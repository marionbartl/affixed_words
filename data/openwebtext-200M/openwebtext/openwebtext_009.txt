Arakawa 's margin of victory was substantial ; there is no uncertainty :
Congratulations to the gold medal winner !
Bullet Points :
The medals are correct .
But under the rules , a computer would have awarded the silver to Slutskaya in just over 1/3 of all possible combinations of panels .
According to 12 judges , Cohen deserved the silver and was fortunate in the selection of panels ; Slutskaya was unlucky .
Short Program : About 58 % of the possible 220 panels would have placed Slutskaya over Cohen , and the consensus of all 12 judges would have placed Slutskaya ahead by 0.28 after the short program ( the panel chosen by the computer had Cohen in front by 0.03 ) .
Judges 4 , 5 , and 9 were excluded by the computer .
Free Skate : About 27 % of the possible 220 panels would have placed Slutskaya ahead of Cohen , but the consensus of all 12 judges would have had Cohen ahead of Slutskaya by 0.91 ( instead of the actual margin of 1.89 ) .
Judges 3 , 9 , and 12 were excluded by the computer .
Final Standings :
The 12 judges had Cohen in front of Slutskaya , by a margin of 0.63 points , so the medal standings are secure .
A rough normal approximation indicates that about 30 % of the panels of judges would have awarded Slutskaya the silver medal over Cohen .
The exact figure : 16,295 of 48,400 combinations of panels would have awarded the silver to Slutskaya , just over 33 % ( and 132 possible panels would have created a tie between Slutskaya and Cohen ) .
If you are wondering why this number is not the same as 0.58 times 0.27 ( see the figures above ) , you have discovered a great question for a classroom of introductory statistics students .
I 'll use it myself .
This is why I do what I do .
Good news indeed .
I ’m really impressed with IE7 – it will make a huge difference when it is released .
Standards compliance , a great rendering engine and better Javascript are really exciting .
[...]
IE7 JavaScript Improvements is interesting to mention . [...]
There is still a lot to be done though .
e.g. prototypes on Object extensions on HtmlElement
While certainely true that this is very good news , do not forget that we already have browsers with all these features .
So , it ’s still a game of catch - up for IE .
Ie7 is a huge improvement , I wonder though if it will actually make programmers work easyer in th NEAR future .
Since they still will have maintain backwards compatibility .
If you rate IE7 compared to Firefox / Opera , then yes it ’s nothing special .
If you rate IE7 compared to IE6 it ’s a huge leap forward .
Really happy with the improvements they ’ve made and hope there ’s more to come .
Recently been designing a new CV site there ’s been very little in the way of specific IE7 fixes .
Still have to have an additional css for IE6 and below , but at least that will eventually become a thing of the past .
Although we should all be happy because ( a lot of us ) are web designers and developers , maybe we should n’t be happy because Microsoft is just putting bugs right that should have never existed in the first place !
While it is nice that IE 7 has performance and standards improvements in the JScript engine , it ’s catch - up arrival is late in the game .
JScript ( JavaScript ) itself is still a client - side “ convenience ” script .
Your good designers are using less and less JavaScript in favor of server - side scripting in every new design .
The future trend , mostly based on a culminating increase in data reliance and security , is to use none , or as little JavaScript as possible .
If JavaScript is turned off , your web site and your forms better still work without it .
really good support for Jscript .
but it doesnt get easy on developers they will still need to keep up with prior versions since market wont switch to IE7 quickly .
When reading some replies I am very doubtful if these are real improvements .
See for example this reply :
http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/28/728654.aspx#735949
javascript in IE7 RC1 still does not work well for me .
Actualy , some javascript that can be executed with the IE7 beta 2 does not work in IE7 RC1 .
One of my major problems with the IE& is that I still cannot use properly an old MSDN Library for Visual Studio 6.0 since many links in it execute some javascript which ca n’t be run with IE7 .
‘ Your good designers are using less and less JavaScript in favor of server - side scripting in every new design . ’
On the contary , javascript has had a fresh lease of life , enabling a whole range of web apps that owe there snappy performance and rich featureset to ajax style scripting .
After all lower server hits can only be a good thing , unless you ’re in the ad sales game !
Lets hope that IE7 js really does banish the sluggish performance and soul destroying memory leaks that developers have had to fight with IE6 .
I have been looking at IE7 and in many ways it seems better , but I have a major problem with the way it is implementing JavaScript arrrays .
I have an old application that holds data in a large Javascript array .
This has always worked fine .
However , in IE7 it falls over .
It seems like it is just falling over when an array gets too big .
Has anyone else come across this problem or any related problem with IE7 .
I have been hunting around and cannot find any reference to an upper limit to array sizes in JavaScript .
Pity if you will the poor burghers of the Northumberland village of Felton - living as they are under a palpable pall of fear provoked by the attentions of a monstrous , allotment - menacing devil rabbit .
That 's according to the Times , which reports that the " Beast of Felton " - a deer - sized , black and brown creature with " diabolically shaped ears " - has already decimated " a market stall 's worth of Japanese onions , parsnips and spring carrots " .
The first sighting of the Mephistophelean herbivore came back in February .
Allotment holder Jeff Smith , 63 , recounted : " This is no ordinary rabbit .
We are dealing with a monster .
It 's absolutely massive .
" The first time I saw it , I was n't sure what it was .
Its prints are huge , about the size of a deer .
It 's a brute of a thing .
We have two lads here with guns who are trying to shoot it , but it 's too clever .
They never see it . "
The two lads in question are hired guns tasked with killing the vegetarian vandal .
One of the Magnificent Two , underkeeper Brian Cadman , said : " Only a few people have seen it so far but I 've seen the evidence and I think it 's going to be a big 'un .
" I 've been out here at night with another underkeeper .
We have not had much luck yet , but you can see what it 's been eating .
It 's been taking huge bites out of cabbages , carrots and turnips . "
With the beast still at large , the mood in Felton has turned from fear to vengeful anger .
Smith told a meeting of the local parish council on Monday : " When we get it killed - when we shoot it - we are going to hang it up on a tree so folk can see it . "
Whether the locals then rushed to the village green with wooden agricultural implements and burning torches before storming into the night in search of the unholy creature 's creator is not noted .
Nick Park was unavailable for comment this morning . ®

Thanks to all those readers who 've written to suggest that what the people of Felton really need is the Holy hand grenade of Antioch .
Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk is known for her hardline stance
D66 , the coalition 's smallest member , withdrew its support in a row over Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk .
Ms Verdonk had threatened to strip former politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali of her Dutch passport because of false information she gave in 1992 .
Mr Balkenende said he would tender the government 's resignation on Friday .
" Following this , the remaining ministers and junior ministers decided to tender their positions to the head of state , the Queen .
This also counts for me , the prime minister , " Mr Balkenende said on television .
U-turn
Mr Balkenende 's announcement came after two days of debate in the parliament , where Ms Verdonk had done a U - turn on her stance on Ms Hirsi Ali , claiming she had found a legal loophole that would allow the Somali - born woman to stay .
The D66 party pulled three ministers from the government because Ms Verdonk , known as " Iron Rita " for her tough stance on immigration issues , refused to resign over her treatment of Ms Hirsi Ali .
" A rift was created with my party and I feel there is no other way but to withdraw support for this government , " D66 party leader Lousewies van der Laan told parliament today .
Ms Hirsi Ali , 36 , became an international figure after writing a controversial film about the treatment of women in Islam , which was directed by Theo Van Gogh , later led to his murder by a Muslim extremist in 2004 .
Since admitting to lying in her asylum application , Ms Hirsi Ali has stepped down as a member of parliament and planned a move to the US to work for a think tank .
The resignation of the government could lead to new elections in October .
Attention : Newcomers to Mollio ...
Mollio launched in early 2006 , which is a long time in internet time .
Since then Microsoft has launched IE7 , which exposed a few rendering problems that the Mollio dropdown navigation had .
We think Mollio is still a useful , basic , starting point for website layout , but we 'd suggest you check out some of the many other CSS template and framework initiatives that have popped up since Mollio was created , and continue to be updated , like : Twitter 's Bootstrap Framework
Blueprint CSS Framework
Yahoo YUI CSS Grids
What is Mollio ?
Mollio is a simple set of html / css templates .
The aim was to create a set of page templates that use css for layout as well as some sample basic content which has also had some css applied .
More sample content and layouts are planned to be added .
Get involved , suggest & contribute ideas via the Mollio Google Group .
So enough of the chit chat , what are you talking about ?
Can I get all those files as a zipped archive ?
Sure can :
What about the photoshop source files ?
We 've used Photoshop CS2 to create these - so you may or may not need that version to open these ...
Can I use it on my own project ?
Our hope is to make Mollio templates and their derivatives as universal as possible .
In order to help those creating derivative works of Mollio we 've agreed to release the templates under three different licenses ; Creative Commons , GPL and CPL .
As a creator of a derivative work you simply need to choose the license that suits your project .
If you have no idea about licensing or want to know nothing about licensing then you are after the Creative Commons license .
Essentially you can do what you like as long as you keep the attribution in the HTML - basically a link to Mollio saying where it all began .
Who made it ?
Pete Ottery , while working at a web development company in Sydney called Daemon .
Why ?
Daemon built an open source CMS called FarCry and then created this skin to use as a default install skin when creating a site .
We figured the html /css would be helpful to use in its own right , so even if you are not using FarCry you might find it useful .
Is there any support or help provided ?
Theres a very basic styleguide linked above which details how the page templates are structured .
Beyond that , join the Mollio Google Group & ask questions .
The History of updates
Version 1.1 added another layout , a " type F " .
basically the same as Type C but the left and right columns swapped added partial support for Mac IE5 .
the css now has a set ( fixed ) width you can define ( set at 10em in Mollio ) for those top horizontal nav items .
other browsers get a width : auto the licenses its released under have been updated .
now CC , GPL & CPL .
All the detail you could ever want to know is linked above .

Five American soldiers have been charged in a horrendous rape and murder case in Iraq ( and a sixth for not reporting it ) .
In the United States , rape is now a public crime .
Cases are regularly discussed and followed in the media ; victims are far less often blamed ; if you turn on a TV program like Law & Order : SVU , rape cases are national drama and even entertainment .
In Iraq , rape remains a crime largely kept out of the sight of a society that finds it almost too heinous to imagine ( which does n't necessarily make it uncommon ) .
Consider , for instance , the comments of an Iraqi journalist , Raheem Salman , who works for the Los Angeles Times and who interviewed the first relative to enter the house of the 14 year old victim after she had been raped and murdered , and her body partially burned by American soldiers :
Or consider the young Sunni blogger , Riverbend , who writes Baghdad Burning and now seems to live as a semi- shut - in in an Iraqi capital caught in a heightening state of civil war .
( " It 's like Baghdad is no longer one city , it 's a dozen different smaller cities each infected with its own form of violence . " )
In a post in which she discusses the death of a friend -- a twenty - six year - old civil engineer caught in sectarian violence in his neighborhood -- she also turns to the rape case in this fashion :
Finally , consider the fine reporter Nir Rosen , who has spent much of the last three years as an independent journalist in Iraq -- and who looks Iraqi enough ( his father was Iranian ) to have been able to experience both sides of the occupation .
He has been embedded with U.S. troops , but also embedded with ordinary Iraqis .
( " My skin color and language skills allowed me to relate to the American occupier in a different way , for he looked at me as if I were just another haji , the " gook " of the war in Iraq . " )
At the Truthdig website , he writes a summary account of the American occupation ( " creating enemies instead of eliminating them " ) as he encountered it that has to be read to be believed .
He concludes :

At the Truthdig website , he writes a summary account of the American occupation ( " creating enemies instead of eliminating them " ) as he encountered it that has to be read to be believed .
He concludes :
In a similar way , the now highly publicized rape and murder of an Iraqi girl by American soldiers focuses attention on one horrifying case of sexual terrorism , but not on the larger issue of what has actually happened to the majority of Iraqi women in the wake of the American invasion and occupation of their country .
Ruth Rosen , a former columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times , as well as the author of a superb history of the modern women 's movement , The World Split Open , explores this distinctly under - reported but crucial topic :
What , in fact , has the Bush administration 's " liberation " of Iraqi women meant since 2003 ?
Tom
Abu Ghraib .
Haditha .
Guantanamo .
These are words that shame our country .
Now , add to them Mahmudiya , a town 20 miles south of Baghdad .
There , this March , a group of five American soldiers allegedly were involved in the rape and murder of Abeer Qassim Hamza , a young Iraqi girl .
Her body was then set on fire to cover up their crimes , her father , mother , and sister murdered .
The rape of this one girl , if proven true , is probably not simply an isolated incident .
But how would we know ?
In Iraq , rape is a taboo subject .
Shamed by the rape , relatives of this girl would n't even hold a public funeral and were reluctant to reveal where she is buried .
Like women everywhere , Iraqi women have always been vulnerable to rape .
But since the American invasion of their country , the reported incidence of sexual terrorism has accelerated markedly .
-- and this despite the fact that few Iraqi women are willing to report rapes either to Iraqi officials or to occupation forces , fearing to bring dishonor upon their families .
In rural areas , female rape victims may also be vulnerable to " honor killings " in which male relatives murder them in order to restore the family 's honor .
" For women in Iraq , " Amnesty International concluded in a 2005 report , " the stigma frequently attached to the victims instead of the perpetrators of sexual crimes makes reporting such abuses especially daunting . "
This specific rape of one Iraqi girl , however , is now becoming symbolic of the way the Bush administration has violated Iraq 's honor ; Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has already launched an inquest into the crime .
In an administration that normally does n't know the meaning of an apology , the American ambassador , Zalmay Khalilzad , and the top American commander in Iraq , Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , both publicly apologized .
In a fierce condemnation , the Muslim Scholars Association in Iraq denounced the crime : " This act , committed by the occupying soldiers , from raping the girl to mutilating her body and killing her family , should make all humanity feel ashamed . "
Shame , yes , but that is hardly sufficient .
After all , rape is now considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court .
It was n't always that way .
Soldiers have long viewed women as the spoils of war , even when civilian or military leaders condemned such behavior , but in the early 1990s , a new international consensus began to emerge on the act of rape .
Prodded by an energized global women 's movement , the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in 1993 .
Subsequent statutes in the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda , as well as the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court in July 2002 , all defined rape as a crime against humanity or a war crime .
No one accuses American soldiers of running through the streets of Iraq , raping women as an instrument of war against the insurgents ( though such acts are what caused three Bosnian soldiers , for the first time in history , to be indicted in 2001 for the war crime of rape ) .
Still , the invasion and occupation of Iraq has had the effect of humiliating , endangering , and repressing Iraqi women in ways that have not been widely publicized in the mainstream media :
As detainees in prisons run by Americans , they have been sexually abused and raped ; as civilians , they have been kidnapped , raped , and then sometimes sold for prostitution ; and as women -- and , in particular , as among the more liberated women in the Arab world -- they have increasingly disappeared from public life , many becoming shut -ins in their own homes .
Rape and sexual humiliation in prisons
The scandal of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib focused on the torture , sexual abuse , and humiliation of Iraqi men .
A variety of sources suggest that female prisoners suffered similar treatment , including rape .
Few Americans probably realize that the American - run prison at Abu Ghraib also held female detainees .
Some of them were arrested by Americans for political reasons -- because they were relatives of Baathist leaders or because the occupying forces thought they could use them as bargaining chips to force male relatives to inform on insurgents or give themselves up .
According to a Human Rights
Watch report , the secrecy surrounding female detentions " resulted from a collusion of the families and the occupying forces . "
Families feared social stigma ; the occupying forces feared condemnation by human rights groups and anger from Iraqis who saw such treatment of women by foreigners as a special act of violation .
On the condition of anonymity and in great fear , some female detainees nevertheless did speak with human rights workers after being released from detention .
They have described beatings , torture , and isolation .
Like their male counterparts , they reserve their greatest bitterness for sexual humiliations suffered in American custody .
Nearly all female detainees reported being threatened with rape .
Some women were interrogated naked and subjected to derision and humiliating remarks by soldiers .
The British Guardian reported that one female prisoner managed to smuggle a note out of Abu Ghraib .
She claimed that American guards were raping the few female detainees held in the prison and that some of them were now pregnant .
In desperation , she urged the Iraqi resistance to bomb the jail in order to spare the women further shame .
Amal Kadham Swadi , one of seven Iraqi female attorneys attempting to represent imprisoned women , told the Guardian that only one woman she met with was willing to speak about rape .
" She was crying .
She told us she had been raped .
Several American soldiers had raped her .
She had tried to fight them off , and they had hurt her arm .
She showed us the stitches .
She told us , ' We have daughters and husbands .
For God 's sake do n't tell anyone about this . ' "
Professor Huda Shaker , a political scientist at Baghdad University , also told the Guardian that women in Abu Ghraib have been sexually abused and raped .
She identified one woman , in particular , who was raped by an American military policeman , became pregnant , and later disappeared .
Professor Shaker added , " A female colleague of mine was arrested and taken there .
When I asked her after she was released what happened at Abu Ghraib , she started crying .
Ladies here are afraid and shy of talking about such subjects .
They say everything is OK .
Even in a very advanced society in the west it is very difficult to talk about rape . "
Shaker , herself , encountered a milder form of sexual abuse at the hands of one American soldier .
At a checkpoint , she said , an American soldier " pointed the laser sight [ of his gun ] directly in the middle of my chest
Then he pointed to his penis .
He told me , ' Come here , bitch , I 'm going to fuck you . ' "
Writing from Baghdad , Luke Hardin of the Guardian reported that at Abu Ghraib journalists have been forbidden from talking to female detainees , who are cloistered in tiny windowless cells .
Senior US military officers who have escorted journalists around Abu Ghraib , however , have admitted that rapes of women took place in the cellblock where 19 " high - value " male detainees were also being held .
Asked how such abuse could have happened , Colonel Dave Quantock , now in charge of the prison 's detention facilities , responded , " I do n't know .
It 's all about leadership .
Apparently it was n't there . "
No one should be surprised that women detainees , like male ones , were subjected to sexual abuse at Abu Ghraib .
Think of the photographs we 've already seen from that prison .
If acts of ritual humiliation could be used to " soften up " men , then the rape of female detainees is hardly unimaginable .
But how can we be sure ?
In January , 2004 , Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez , the senior U.S. military official in Iraq , ordered Maj. Gen. Antonio M. Taguba to investigate persistent allegations of human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib .
The Taguba Report confirmed that in at least one instance a U.S. military policeman had raped at least one female prisoner and that guards had videotaped and photographed naked female detainees .
Seymour Hersh also reported in a 2004 issue of the New Yorker magazine that these secret photos and videos , most of which still remain under wraps by the Pentagon , show American soldiers " having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner . "
Additional photos have made their way to the web sites of Afterdowningstreet.org and Salon.com .
In one photograph , a woman is raising her shirt , baring her breasts , presumably as she was ordered to do .
The full range of pictures and videotapes are likely to show a great deal more .
Members of Congress who viewed all the pictures and videotapes from Abu Ghraib seemed genuinely shaken and sickened by what they saw .
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist , R - Tenn called them " appalling ; " then - Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle described them as " horrific . "
Ever since the scandal broke in April 2004 , human rights and civil liberties groups have been engaged in a legal battle with the Department of Defense , demanding that it release the rest of the visual documents .
Only when all those documents are available to the general public will we have a clearer -- and undoubtedly more ghastly -- record of the sexual acts forced upon both female and male detainees .
Sexual Terrorism on the Streets
Meanwhile , the chaos of the war has also led to a rash of kidnappings and rapes of women outside of prison walls .
After interviewing rape and abduction victims , as well as eyewitnesses , Iraqi police and health professionals , and U.S. military police and civil affairs officers , Human Rights Watch released a report in July , 2003 , titled Climate of Fear : Sexual Violence and Abduction of Women and Girls in Baghdad .
Only months after Baghdad fell to U.S. forces , they had already learned of twenty - five credible allegations of the rape and / or abduction of Iraqi women .
Not surprisingly , the report found that " police officers gave low priority to allegations of sexual violence and abduction , that the police were under - resourced , and that victims of sexual violence confronted indifference and sexism from Iraqi law enforcement personnel . "
Since then , as chaos , violence , and bloodletting have descended on Iraq , matters have only gotten worse .
After the American invasion , local gangs began roaming Baghdad , snatching girls and women from the street .
Interviews with human rights investigators have produced some horrifying stories .
Typical was nine - year - old " Saba A. " who was abducted from the stairs of the building where she lives , taken to an abandoned building nearby , and raped .
A family friend who saw Saba A. immediately following the rape told Human Rights Watch :
" She was sitting on the stairs , here , at 4:00 p.m .
It seems to me that probably he hit her on the back of the head with a gun and then took her to [ a neighboring ] building .
She came back fifteen minutes later , bleeding [ from the vaginal area ] .
[ She was still bleeding two days later , so ] we took her to the hospital . "
The medical report by the U.S. military doctor who treated Saba A. " documented bruising in the vaginal area , a posterior vaginal tear , and a broken hymen . "
In 2005 , Amnesty International also interviewed abducted women .
The story of " Asma , " a young engineer , was representative .
She was shopping with her mother , sister , and a male relative when six armed men forced her into a car and drove her to a farmhouse outside the city .
They repeatedly raped her .
A day later , the men drove her to her neighborhood and pushed her out of the car .
As recently as June 2006 , Mayada Zhaair , spokeswoman for the Women 's Rights Association , a local NGO , reported , " We 've observed an increase in the number of women being sexually abused and raped in the past four months , especially in the capital . "
No one knows how many abducted women have never returned .
As one Iraqi police inspector testified , " Some gangs specialize in kidnapping girls , they sell them to Gulf countries .
This happened before the war too , but now it is worse , they can get in and out without passports . "
Others interviewed by Human Rights Watch argued that such trafficking in women had not occurred before the invasion .
The U.S. State Department 's June 2005 report on the trafficking of women suggested that the extent of the problem in Iraq is " difficult to appropriately gauge " under current chaotic circumstances , but cited an unknown number of Iraqi women and girls being sent to Yemen , Syria , Jordan , and Persian Gulf countries for sexual exploitation .
In May 2006 , Brian Bennett wrote in Time Magazine that a visit to " the Khadamiyah Women 's Prison in the northern part of Baghdad immediately produces several tales of abduction and abandonment .
A stunning 18 - year - old nicknamed Amna , her black hair pulled back in a ponytail , says she was taken from an orphanage by an armed gang just after the US invasion and sent to brothels in Samarra , al - Qaim on the border with Syria , and Mosul in the north before she was taken back to Baghdad , drugged with pills , dressed in a suicide belt and sent to bomb a cleric 's office in Khadamiyah , where she turned herself in to the police .
A judge gave her a seven - year jail sentence ' for her sake ' to protect her from the gang , according to the prison director . "
" Families and courts , " Bennett reported , " are usually so shamed by the disappearance [ and presumed rape ] of a daughter that they do not report these kidnappings .
And the resulting stigma of compromised chastity is such that even if the girl should resurface , she may never be taken back by her relations . "
Disappearing women
To avoid such dangers , countless Iraqi women have become shut -ins in their own homes .
Historian Marjorie Lasky has described this situation in " Iraqi Women Under Siege , " a 2006 report for Codepink , an anti-war women 's organization .
Before the war , she points out , many educated Iraqi women participated fully in the work force and in public life .
Now , many of them rarely go out .
They fear kidnap and rape ; they are terrified of getting caught in the cross - fire between Americans and insurgents ; they are frightened by sectarian reprisals ; and they are scared of Islamic militants who intimidate or beat them if they are not " properly covered . "
" In the British - occupied south , " Terri Judd reported in the British Independent , " where Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mehdi's Army retains a stranglehold , women insist the situation is at its worst .
Here they are forced to live behind closed doors only to emerge , concealed behind scarves , hidden behind husbands and fathers .
Even wearing a pair of trousers is considered an act of defiance , punishable by death . "
Invisible women -- for some Iraqi fundamentalist Islamic leaders , this is a dream come true .
The Ministry of the Interior , for example , recently issued notices warning women not to go out on their own .
" This is a Muslim country and any attack on a woman 's modesty is also an attack on our religious beliefs , " said Salah Ali , a senior ministry official .
Religious leaders in both Sunni and Shiite mosques have used their sermons to persuade their largely male congregations to keep working women at home .
" These incidents of abuse just prove what we have been saying for so long , " said Sheikh Salah Muzidin , an imam at a mosque in Baghdad .
" That it is the Islamic duty of women to stay in their homes , looking after their children and husbands rather than searching for work --- especially with the current lack of security in the country . "
In the early 1970s , American feminists redefined rape and argued that it was an act driven not by sexual lust , but by a desire to exercise power over another person .
Rape , they argued , was an act of terrorism that kept all women from claiming their right to public space .
That is precisely what has happened to Iraqi women since the American invasion of Iraq .
Sexual terrorism coupled with religious zealotry has stolen their right to claim their place in public life .
This , then , is a hidden part of the unnecessary suffering loosed by the reckless invasion of Iraq .
Amid the daily explosions and gunfire that make the papers is a wave of sexual terrorism , whose exact dimensions we have no way of knowing , and that no one here notices , unleashed by the Bush administration in the name of exporting " democracy " and fighting " the war on terror . "

How To Not Throw Up
Images :
The top image is a traditional helicoid .
The bottom one has a hole in it that would become a handle if the shape were completely untwisted into a flat surface .
( Courtesy of Indiana University )
A twisted soap bubble with a handle ?
If you find that hard to visualize , it 's understandable .
Experts had thought for more than 200 years that such a structure was not even mathematically possible .
But no longer .
In a paper published in the Nov. 15 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , mathematicians Matthias Weber of Indiana University , David Hoffman of Stanford University , and Michael Wolf of Rice University presented a proof of the existence of a new minimal surface they call a genus one helicoid .
" This proof tells us that our intuition was not quite right about what is possible and what is not possible , " Weber said .
" Probably one reason it was not discovered sooner is that no one imagined that something like this could exist . "
A helicoid is what results when one of the simplest shapes -- a flat plane -- is twisted an infinite number of times .
If the helicoid is vertical , its shape resembles a spiral parking ramp .
The new surface looks much like this traditional helicoid with an extra feature : a handle such as one finds on a coffee mug .
It turns out that on one " floor " of the parking ramp there is an additional column -- the handle .
All minimal surfaces have something important in common : a minimal surface area .
" A minimal surface is formed when the pressure on both sides of a surface is the same , " Weber explained .
" ' For example , when you dip a bent coat hanger into soapy water , the soap bubble that forms on the hanger is a minimal surface . "
These soap bubbles can have various shapes , depending on the shape of the coat hanger , but in every case the bubble is trying to minimize surface tension , he said .
This happens when the bubble has the smallest possible surface area .
At every point , a minimal surface is either flat or shaped like a saddle or a potato chip .
Minimal surfaces are proving to be important at the molecular level .
" Minimal surfaces actually occur in nature at the nanoscale as interfaces between certain substances , " Weber said .
An example is some copolymers that are plastics used to make new kinds of fabrics .
When these copolymers are mixed , there are interfaces between them that are minimal surfaces .
Knowing what these interfaces look like can help in determining what the chemical properties of the mixture will be .
Minimal surfaces are extremely stable as physical objects , Weber pointed out , and this can be an advantage in many kinds of structures .
He has heard from architects who have seen computerized illustrations of some of his minimal surfaces and are intrigued by the possibility of adapting them to structures , both interior and exterior .
He has exchanged information about minimal surfaces with some architects and is exploring ways to collaborate with them .
Calendars are another use for this work , highlighting the aesthetic qualities of minimal surfaces .
These aesthetic qualities are on vivid display in Weber 's computer gallery of minimal surfaces at www.indiana.edu/~minimal/gallery/index/index.html , which shows minimal - surface objects set in imaginary landscapes .
" The images in the gallery are not intended as illustrations of mathematical facts , " Weber said .
" They more than fulfill their purpose if people see them and can feel some of the intriguing enchantment that a mathematician feels when exploring the mathematical objects . "
In a second gallery at www.indiana.edu/~minimal/archive/index.html the pictures do illustrate mathematical facts .
" This is the most comprehensive collection of minimal surfaces available , " Weber said .
" Users can download programs that recreate the surfaces , allowing them to conduct numerical and visual experiments . "
The mathematicians ' complete proof is more than 100 pages long .

BAGHDAD , Iraq , Dec. 11 - With just four days to go until parliamentary elections , the Iraqi electoral commission said today that it had found irregularities in voter registration in the volatile northern oil city of Kirkuk .
The discovery was the first instance of an election irregularity announced by the commission as the country prepared for the vote on Thursday .
The commission said experts conducting an audit of voter lists found that there had been an unexpected surge in voter registration in the area .
When the experts scrutinized the voter registration forms , the commission said in a written statement , they found that many had been filled out incorrectly .
Some had missing signatures and others had more than one signature .
In some cases , the same name appeared on several forms .
Adel al - Lami , the director general of the Iraqi electoral commission , said in an interview that in his view the voter registration irregularities were technical errors and not politically motivated .
" Please stay away from political conspiracies , " he said .
" There 's no political reason for this . "
Introducing WSGI : Python 's Secret Web Weapon
September 27 , 2006
James Gardner
Web Server Gateway Interface Part I : Getting Started
The recent Python 2.5 release features the addition of the Web Server Gateway Interface Utilities and Reference Implementation package ( wsgiref ) to Python 's standard library .
In this two - part article , we will look at what the Web Server Gateway Interface is , how to use it to write web applications , and how to use middleware components to quickly add powerful functionality .
Before diving into these topics , we will also take a brief look at why the specification was created in the first place .
The Many Frameworks Problem
Python is a great language for web development .
It is straightforward to learn , has a broad and powerful standard library , and benefits from an active community of developers who maintain a range of XML and database tools , templating languages , servers , and application frameworks .
In 2003 , when the Web Server Gateway Interface specification was drawn up , the Python community also had one major problem .
It was often easier for developers to write their own solutions to web - development problems from scratch rather than reusing and improving existing projects .
This resulted in a proliferation of largely incompatible web frameworks .
If developers wanted a full and powerful solution , they could use Zope , but many of them coming into the community in search of a lightweight framework found it hard to know where to start .
Developers within the Python community quickly recognized that it would be preferable to have fewer and better - supported frameworks , but since each framework had its strengths and weaknesses at the time , none stood out as a clear candidate for adoption .
In the Java world , the servlet architecture meant that applications written with one framework could run on any server supporting the servlet API .
The Web Server Gateway Interface ( often written WSGI , pronounced " whiskey " ) was designed to bring the same interoperability that the Java world enjoyed to Python , and to go some way toward unifying the Python web - framework world without stifling the diversity .
The full specification is defined in PEP 333 .
( PEP is an acronym for Python Enhancement Proposal . )
The abstract of the PEP sums up the specification 's goals very clearly , stating :
" This document specifies a proposed standard interface between web servers and Python web applications or frameworks , to promote web application portability across a variety of web servers . "
Most Python web frameworks today have a WSGI adapter , and most server technologies ( Apache , mod_python , FastCGI , CGI , etc. ) can be used to run WSGI applications , so the vision of web - application portability is fast becoming a reality .
The separation of server from application has the clear benefit that application developers supporting the API do not have to worry about how their applications are served , and server developers need only create one interface to support the majority of Python web applications .
Simply supporting the WSGI is enough for server and application developers to guarantee a large degree of interoperability .
In the next sections , we will look at how to develop and deploy WSGI applications ; in Part II of this article , we will look at how to use middleware components to provide facilities such as session handling , interactive debugging , and much more .
The HTTP Protocol
The Web is largely built on the HTTP protocol , so to understand the WSGI , it is essential to understand how the Web works at the HTTP protocol level .
It is very useful to be able to see the HTTP information being sent back and forth between a web browser and a server .
One good tool for doing this is the LiveHTTPHeaders extension for the Firefox web browser which , when loaded , is visible in the sidebar and displays the HTTP information sent and received on each request .
Once it 's installed , you can select View - > Sidebar ->LiveHTTPHeaders from the menu to load the extension in the sidebar .
When you request a page , the browser sends an HTTP request to the server .
When the server receives that request , it will perform some action ( typically running an application or serving a file ) and return an HTTP response .
Below is the HTTP information sent when visiting the PEP 333 page :
Figure 1 . HTTP Request
and here is the response returned :
Figure 2 . HTTP Response
As you can see , the browser sends quite a lot of information to the server .
The server makes this and other information available to the application .
The application then returns a status code ( in this case , 200 OK ) along with any HTTP headers it wishes to send back .
Of particular note is the Content - type header , which tells the browser what sort of content is going to be sent ( in this case , text / html ) .
Finally , the application returns the content that will be displayed by the browser ( in this case , the HTML that makes up the page ) .
The server may add extra HTTP headers or perform other modifications before the response is returned .
Hello World !
Here is a simple CGI application that would produce a Hello World !
message in the browser :
print " Content - Type : text / html
" print " < html >< body > Hello World !</body ></html > "
and here is the same application as a WSGI application :
def application ( environ , start_response ) : start_response( '200 OK ' , [ ( ' Content - type ' , ' text / html ' ) ] ) return [ '< html > < body >
Hello World !</body ></html >']
At first glance , this looks a little complicated , so let 's think about what information a server needs from an application and vice versa .
First of all , an application needs to know about the environment in which it is running .
In a CGI application , you can obtain this information with this code :
import os environ = os.environ
In a WSGI application , this information is supplied directly by the WSGI server as the first parameter to the application callable ; in our example above , this parameter is named environ .
The server also needs to know the status and headers to set before any content is returned to the browser , so it supplies a second argument to the application -- a callback function taking the status and a list of tuple pairs of headers as arguments .
In our example , it is named start_response .
Our application calls start_response ( ) to set a status of 200 OK , which means everything went fine , and to set the Content - type header to text / html .
Finally , the server needs to know the content to return to the browser .
Rather than requiring an application to return all the content in one go , the server iterates over the application , returning data to the browser as the application returns it .
In our example , this result is achieved by returning a simple list of strings containing the HTML to display the Hello World ! message .
In summary then , a WSGI application is any callable ( in our case , a simple function ) taking an environment dictionary and start_response callable as positional parameters .
The application should call start_response ( ) with a status code and a list of tuple pairs of headers before it returns an iterable response ( in our case , a list with just one string ) .
In normal circumstances , applications can only call start_response ( ) once ; after all , it would n't make a lot of sense to start the response twice .
These requirements for applications can also be met by generators , classes that override the __call__ ( ) method or the __iter__ ( ) method .
It is possible to use these as WSGI applications instead of following the example above and using a simple function .
The WSGI specification also discusses a third parameter to start_response ( ) named exc_info , used in error handling , and a writable object returned by start_response ( ) , used for backward compatibility -- not for use in new applications or frameworks .
( We do not need to worry about these details , but they are mentioned for completeness ) .
Testing the Application
We will start by running our test application as a CGI script .
Create a new file named test.py and add the following to it :
def application ( environ , start_response ) : start_response( '200 OK ' , [ ( ' Content - type ' , ' text / html ' ) ] ) return [ '< html > < body >
Hello World !</body ></html >' ] from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler CGIHandler ( ) .run( application )
If you are running a version of Python prior to 2.5 , you will need to download and install the wsgiref package .
You can do this by extracting the wsgiref - 0.1.2.zip file ( or most recent update ) and executing the command :
> python setup.py install
You can then run the test application from the command line to see what information it outputs :
> python test.py
You will see the following :
Figure 3 .
Test output ( Click for full - size image ) .
Notice that the CGIHandler has acted the way any other CGI server would , and added the Status and Content - Length to the output .
Of course , one of the original motivations for the WSGI was to run the same application on multiple WSGI servers without modification .
As an example , this is how you would serve the same application using FastCGI instead of CGI , using the flup package :
from flup.server.fcgi import WSGIServer WSGIServer ( application ) .run ( )
You can also run this same , unmodified application on all other WSGI - compliant servers .
The environ Dictionary
We 've seen how to write a simple WSGI application and deploy it as a CGI script or use it with FastCGI , but to write any real application , we 'll need access to the environment .
This is provided by the first parameter passed to the application by the server , the environ dictionary .
The environ dictionary contains all the information about the environment and the request that the application needs .
Below is an application named show_environ that displays a list of all the keys in the environ dictionary :
def show_environ ( environ , start_response ) : start_response( ' 200 OK ' , [ ( ' Content - type ' , ' text / html ' ) ] ) sorted_keys = environ.keys ( ) sorted_keys.sort ( ) return [ ' < html >< body > < h1 > Keys in < tt>environ </tt></h1><p >' , '< br />'.join( sorted_keys ) , '</p></body></html>' , ] from wsgiref import simple_server httpd = simple_server .
WSGIServer ( ( ' ' ,8000 ) , simple_server .
WSGIRequestHandler , ) httpd.set_app(show_environ ) httpd.serve_forever ( )
This example serves the application using a standalone server .
If you run this example , you will be able to see the output from the application by visiting http://localhost:8000 .
You will notice that environ contains all the usual keys you would expect to see in a CGI environment , such as PATH_INFO , REMOTE_ADDR , etc .
It also contains the Web Server Gateway Interface keys wsgi.errors , wsgi.file_wrapper , wsgi.input , wsgi.multiprocess , wsgi.multithread , wsgi.run_once , wsgi.url_scheme , and wsgi.version , which provide information about the WSGI environment .
The use of these variables is described in the environ variables section of the specification .
The wsgi.errors key contains an output stream ( filelike object ) .
Any information written to the output stream is sent by the server to its error log .
This can be useful for debugging purposes , as well as issuing errors or warnings , and it can be used like this :
environ ['wsgi.errors ']. write ( ' This will be sent to the error log ' )
Adding this line to the example above , restarting the server , and refreshing the page outputs the message to the console as expected :
Figure 4 . Console ( Click for full - size image ) .
From the information in environ , you can build any web application , and tools already exist to simplify common tasks , such as extracting the variables submitted in a form from the QUERY_STRING or rebuilding the original URL .

The ramps generate up to 50 kW of power
Dorset inventor Peter Hughes ' Electro - Kinetic Road Ramp generates around 10 kW of power each time a car drives over its metal plates .
More than 200 local authorities had expressed an interest in ordering the £ 25,000 ramps to power their traffic lights and road signs , Mr Hughes said .
Around 300 jobs are due to be created in Somerset for a production run of 2,000 ramps next year .
Plates in the ramp move up and down as vehicles pass over them , driving a generator .
" The ramp is silent , comfortable and safe for vehicles , " Mr Hughes said .
Inventor Peter Hughes spent £ 1 m developing the ramps
Depending on the weight of the vehicle passing overhead , between five and 50 kW can be generated .
The prototype was created and tested at Hughes Research unit at the Westland Helicopter base in Somerset , at a cost of £ 1m .
The concept has been developed by Dorset - based Mr Hughes over the past 12 years .
He recently approached councils across the country with the final patented project .
Here ’s the deal .
Your stepdad , stepmom , guardian , caregiver or actual biological parent screwed up .
Oh , they meant well , but they got it wrong .
Not on purpose .
But because they did n’t understand .
They filled your head with what ended up being lies and now you are walking around somewhat confused .
Your instincts are saying one thing but the voices your parents put in your head are saying something else .
Let me clear it up for you .
The only thing your parents got right was multiculturalism .
Everything else is questionable .
Here ’s the skinny , ( stop looking at me funny , it ’s an old phrase ) ,
The Tests Do n’t Matter
In school they bombarded you with a bunch of tests .
Made sure you did well on them .
Complete .
Waste.Of.Time .
Tests do n’t mean shit .
There is nobody keeping score in the real world , except you .
The only ability you need after middle school is the ability to learn .
Quickly .
Things are changing too fast for you to remember them .
We have computers and Google for that .
Corporations Do n’t Matter
I ’m sure your caregiver wants or wanted you to get a good job at a big corporation with tons of benefits .
Wrong move .
The bigger the company the faster they fail and the harder it is to stop their failure .
You want to go small where you can be important faster and have a say when things need to change .
Fast .
Benefits ?
If a company is giving great benefits they probably wo n’t be around too long .
I know you ’ve been coddled all your life but you gotta take care of yourself .
Do n’t take a job for it ’s medical plan .
Take a job because of your future plan .
You are not your fucking khakis .
Your mom made money so she could move you to a better neighborhood and buy a SUV .
But take a look around .
Status symbols are bullshit .
You are not your zipcode .
You are not the car your stepdad drives .
Everybody can afford everything anyway .
Poor kids in the projects are sporting Lexus ’ and Vendi .
If your judging yourself by the stuff you got you are sure to get fucked .
Country does n’t matter .
I know we ’re at war but the world is flat .
A Jew hating redneck who lives next door is just that , a Jew hating redneck who lives next door .
You probably have more in common with a skateboard riding , hip hop listening , kid who lives in India .
It ’s the values that are important , not the land .
Things really are different .
Like the folks who got all freaked as we moved from an agricultural to an industrial economy some parents are freaked and are still teaching kids the importance of tractors .
Be polite , nod respectfully , but pack your bags and move into the city as fast as you can .
And feel free to view this on your cellphone .

For years and years we 've been talking about the idea that the trick to " owning " the internet is to become the platform of the internet .
It seemed like Google was moving in this direction when word of Google Base first leaked out , but the actual offering turned out to be a whole lot less .
It was trying to be a product , not a platform .
Yahoo has been slowly , slowly , slowly opening up APIs , but seems so worried to take the real plunge that it 's almost too little to mention .
It got to the point that we thought some of the more innovative stuff in terms of really being open was coming out of a tiny startup we had present at our Techdirt Greenhouse event over the weekend -- even knowing that such a small company faced a huge challenge trying to stand up against Google and Yahoo .
In fact , Openomy 's discussion question this weekend was focused around how could they compete against those two .
Perhaps those guys from Chicago were looking in the wrong direction .
Word is leaking out tonight that it 's Amazon that 's leading the way with the open platform .
Thisabout storage , even though that 's what most people will talk about .
This is about being the file system and database on which web apps are built .
That 's much more powerful than just storage .
Forget the head fake of Amazon getting into contextual advertising .
Combine this announcement with the announcement a few months ago from Amazon subsidiary Alexa opening up their search platform , and start to imagine what developers could do if they can simply plug into an open online file system / database and an open search engine -- and then just build an app on top of that .
It 's like Amazon just provided much of the database and middleware someone might need to develop a web - based app .
Of course , there 's a lot of marketing that needs to be done between here and there , and convincing everyone to jump on that platform may not be easy ( and who knows , the terms of service may be problematic ) .
That 's , in part , because people just do n't think of Amazon in this way .
However , if Amazon really can convince people that it 's providing the basics they need to build the next generation of web apps , Amazon just became a much more interesting company -- not by copying Google and Yahoo , but by going beyond them and doing what both companies have yet to do . : Ian Sefferman from Openomy points out what Amazon got wrong , with the big one being that data is applications specific rather than user specific -- making it much more difficult to share the same data in multiple applications .
Villagers living near Mount Mayon in the Philippines have been preparing to leave after the volcano emitted huge clouds of ash and smoke .
The 2,462 m ( 8,000 ft ) peak is the country 's most active volcano .
It began emitting lava , ash and boulders last week .
Scientists say a major eruption could come within weeks .
The government has told 4,000 people who reside in a 6 km ( four - mile ) danger zone surrounding the volcano to leave , but many have decided to remain .
But ash clouds early on Thursday created panic among residents , some of whom rushed to collect family members .
Despite the danger , visitors have come to the region to see the rumbling volcano .
It has erupted around 50 times in the last 400 years .
More than 1,200 people died when it erupted in 1814 .

SECRET LAWS …. John Gilmore is suing the government because he does n’t think he should be required to show ID before boarding a commercial flight .
I think this is stupid and he deserves to be thrown out of court .
At least , that ’s what I ’d think if it were n’t for this :
The Bush administration …claims that the ID requirement is necessary for security but has refused to identify any actual regulation requiring it .
A three - judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals seemed skeptical of the Bush administration ’s defense of secret laws and regulations but stopped short of suggesting that such a rule would be necessarily unconstitutional .
“ How do we know there ’s an order ? ” Judge Thomas Nelson asked .
“ Because you said there was ? ” …. The Justice Department has said it could identify the secret law under seal , which would be available to the 9th Circuit but not necessarily Gilmore ’s lawyers .
But any public description would not be permitted , the department said .
WTF ?
Call me naive , but I ’ve never heard of a secret law .
I ’ve heard of secret courts and secret evidence ?
which are bad enough already ?
but not secret laws .
When did this happen ?
And another thing .
How could it possibly harm national security to identify the text of the law that requires passengers to show ID before boarding a plane ?
Maybe someone with a more vivid imagination than me can come up with something , but I can’t .
POSTSCRIPT : Seriously , is this true ?
I ’m just gobsmacked .
Congress is passing laws that the American public is n’t allowed to know about ?
Any of us might be prosecuted under one of these laws that we do n’t know exists ?
Courts are being asked to interpret laws they ’ve never seen ?
This gives Kafakesque a very chilling and newly concrete meaning .
1. The Emperor You are the ruler of a medieval empire and you are about to have a celebration tomorrow .
The celebration is the most important party you have ever hosted .
You 've got 1000 bottles of wine you were planning to open for the celebration , but you find out that one of them is poisoned .
The poison exhibits no symptoms until death .
Death occurs within ten to twenty hours after consuming even the minutest amount of poison .
You have over a thousand slaves at your disposal and just under 24 hours to determine which single bottle is poisoned .
You have a handful of prisoners about to be executed , and it would mar your celebration to have anyone else killed .
What is the smallest number of prisoners you must have to drink from the bottles to be absolutely sure to find the poisoned bottle within 24 hours ?
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint :
It is much smaller than you first might think .
Try to solve the problem first with one poisoned bottle out of eight total bottles of wine .
Solution : 10 prisoners must sample the wine .
Bonus points if you worked out a way to ensure than no more than 8 prisoners die .
Number all bottles using binary digits .
Assign each prisoner to one of the binary flags .
Prisoners must take a sip from each bottle where their binary flag is set .
Here is how you would find one poisoned bottle out of eight total bottles of wine .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Prisoner A X X X X Prisoner B X X X X Prisoner C X X X X
In the above example , if all prisoners die , bottle 8 is bad .
If none die , bottle 1 is bad .
If A & B dies , bottle 4 is bad .
With ten people there are 1024 unique combinations so you could test up to 1024 bottles of wine .
Each of the ten prisoners will take a small sip from about 500 bottles .
Each sip should take no longer than 15 seconds and should be a very small amount .
Small sips not only leave more wine for guests .
Small sips also avoid death by alcohol poisoning .
As long as each prisoner is administered about a millilitre from each bottle , they will only consume the equivalent of about one bottle of wine each .
Each prisoner will have at least a fifty percent chance of living .
There is only one binary combination where all prisoners must sip from the wine .
If there are ten prisoners then there are ten more combinations where all but one prisoner must sip from the wine .
By avoiding these two types of combinations you can ensure no more than 8 prisoners die .
One viewer felt that this solution was in flagrant contempt of restaurant etiquette .
The emperor paid for this wine , so there should be no need to prove to the guests that wine is the same as the label .
I am not even sure if ancient wine even came with labels affixed .
However , it is true that after leaving the wine open for a day , that this medieval wine will taste more like vinegar than it ever did .
C'est la vie .
2. The Stark Raving Mad King
A stark raving mad king tells his 100 wisest men he is about to line them up and that he will place either a red or blue hat on each of their heads .
Once lined up , they must not communicate amongst themselves .
Nor may they attempt to look behind them or remove their own hat .
The king tells the wise men that they will be able to see all the hats in front of them .
They will not be able to see the color of their own hat or the hats behind them , although they will be able to hear the answers from all those behind them .
The king will then start with the wise man in the back and ask " what color is your hat ? "
The wise man will only be allowed to answer " red " or " blue , " nothing more .
If the answer is incorrect then the wise man will be silently killed .
If the answer is correct then the wise man may live but must remain absolutely silent .
The king will then move on to the next wise man and repeat the question .
The king makes it clear that if anyone breaks the rules then all the wise men will die , then allows the wise men to consult before lining them up .
The king listens in while the wise men consult each other to make sure they do n't devise a plan to cheat .
To communicate anything more than their guess of red or blue by coughing or shuffling would be breaking the rules .
What is the maximum number of men they can be guaranteed to save ?
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint :
To solve this problem , you need to presume that each wise man can count the total number of red hats in front of them without error , that all the wise men have great attention to detail and that all the wise men care about the greater good .
Solution : 99 .
You can save about 50 % by having everyone guess randomly .
You can save 50 % or more if every even person agrees to call out the color of the hat in front of them .
That way the person in front knows what color their hat is , and if the person behind also has the same colored hat then both will survive .
So how can 99 people be saved ?
The first wise man counts all the red hats he can see ( Q ) and then answers " blue " if the number is odd or " red " if the number is even .
Each subsequent wise man keeps track of the number of red hats known to have been saved from behind ( X ) , and counts the number of red hats in front ( Y ) .
If Q was even , and if X&Y are either both even or are both odd , then the wise man would answer blue .
Otherwise the wise man would answer red .
If Q was odd , and if X&Y are either both even or are both odd , then the wise man would answer red .

3. The Fake Coin
You have twelve coins .
You know that one is fake .
The only thing that distinguishes the fake coin from the real coins is that its weight is imperceptibly different .
You have a perfectly balanced scale .
The scale only tells you which side weighs more than the other side .
What is the smallest number of times you must use the scale in order to always find the fake coin ?
Use only the twelve coins themselves and no others , no other weights , no cutting coins , no pencil marks on the scale .
etc .
These are modern coins , so the fake coin is not necessarily lighter .
Presume the worst case scenario , and do n't hope that you will pick the right coin on the first attempt .
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint :
The balance tells you which side is heavier and which side is lighter .
You can move coins around and get more information this way .
Solution : 3 . If you knew the fake coin was lighter , then the solution would have an easy explanation .
But you do not .
So .... Number the coins 1 through 12 .
1 . Weigh coins 1,2,3,4 against coins 5,6,7,8 .
1.1 .
If they balance , then weigh coins 9 and 10 against coins 11 and 8 ( we know from the first weighing that 8 is a good coin ) .
1.1.1 . If the second weighing also balances , we know coin 12 ( the only one not yet weighed ) is the counterfeit .
The third weighing indicates whether it is heavy or light .
1.1.2 . If ( at the second weighing ) coins 11 and 8 are heavier than coins 9 and 10 , either 11 is heavy or 9 is light or 10 is light .
Weigh 9 against 10 .
If they balance , 11 is heavy .
If they do n't balance , you know that either 9 or 10 is light , so the top coin is the fake .
1.1.3 If ( at the second weighing ) coins 11 and 8 are lighter than coins 9 and 10 , either 11 is light or 9 is heavy or 10 is heavy .
Weigh 9 against 10 .
If they balance , 11 is light .
If they do n't balance , you know that either 9 or 10 is heavy , so the bottom coin is the fake .
1.2 . Now if ( at first weighing ) the side with coins 5,6,7,8 are heavier than the side with coins 1,2,3,4 .
This means that either 1,2,3,4 is light or 5,6,7,8 is heavy .
Weigh 1,2 , and 5 against 3,6 , and 9 . 1.2.1 . If ( when we weigh 1,2 , and 5 against 3,6 and 9 ) they balance , it means that either 7 or 8 is heavy or 4 is light .
By weighing 7 and 8 we obtain the answer , because if they balance , then 4 has to be light .
If 7 and 8 do not balance , then the heavier coin is the counterfeit .
1.2.2 . If ( when we weigh 1,2 , and 5 against 3,6 and 9 ) the right side is heavier , then either 6 is heavy or 1 is light or 2 is light .
By weighing 1 against 2 the solution is obtained .
1.2.3 . If ( when we weigh 1,2 , and 5 against 3 , 6 and 9 ) the right side is lighter , then either 3 is light or 5 is heavy .
By weighing 3 against a good coin the solution is easily arrived at .
1.3 If ( at the first weighing ) coins 1,2,3,4 are heavier than coins 5,6,7,8 then repeat the previous steps 1.2 through 1.2.3 but switch the numbers of coins 1,2,3,4 with 5,6,7,8 .
4 . The Trainee Technician A 120 wire cable has been laid firmly underground between two telephone exchanges located 10 km apart .
Unfortunately after the cable was laid it was discovered to be the wrong type , the problem is the individual wires are not labeled .
There is no visual way of knowing which wire is which and thus connections at either end is not immediately possible .
You are a trainee technician and your boss has asked you to identify and label the wires at both ends without ripping it all up .
You have no transport and only a battery and light bulb to test continuity .
You do have tape and pen for labeling the wires .
What is the shortest distance in kilometers you will need to walk to correctly identify and label each wire ?
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint : Creating a single loop will only help you identify all the wires by walking 40 km .
You need to group them in a rather odd matrix .
Solution : 20 .
At one end label a wire " A " .
Then join two wire and label them both " B ' , then tie three ( not already joined ) wires together and call them each " C " .... continue until all the wires are joined together in groups of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , etc .... for a 120 strand cable .
NOTES that the largest group will have 15 wires .
Now walk to the other end .
Using a ( battery and light bulb ) it is now possible , for example , to find the wire that was n't joined to any of the others .
It is similarly possible to find which wires are in a pair , which is joined in a group of 3 , etc .
Each time a group is found the technician should label it with the letter for the group , so the single wire is labeled ' a ' , the pair are each labeled " A " , etc . ... this now matches the other end ..... the letters will go up to " O " .
Now take " A " , " B " , up to " O " and join them together in a group and label each one with " 15 " , so we have cable " A15 " , " B15 ' , " C15 " , up to " O15 " .
Take the second and last " B '" wire and
join it with a remaining " C " , " D " , up to " O " and label these each " 14 ' so we have " B14 " , " C14 " , up to " O14 " .
Repeat this until at the end there will be a single " O " cabled labeled " O1 " .
Now walk to the other end .
Now untie all the old connections and identify the group labeled " 1 " , " 2 " , " 3 " ... " 15 " at which point each wire at each end has a unique classification .
Alternative solution from citrog : First , tie the 120 wires together randomly in 60 pairs .
Next , go to the far end , randomly label any wire 1 , and connect the battery to it .
Test which other wire is tied to it at the starting end , and label that wire 2 .
Then pick another wire other than 1 or 2 , label it 3 , and tie it to 2 , so now the battery is connected to 1 , which is tied to 2 at the other end , which is tied to 3 at the end you 're at .
Now test which wire is tied to 3 at the other end , and label that 4 , etc .
What you will wind up with is all 120 wires tied to each other in a continuous sequence .
Then go back to the end you started at , leaving the battery behind , connected to wire 1 .
Before you untie all the wires at the starting point , label each wire so that you know which wire was paired with which .
Now with all the wires untied at the starting point , test which wire is connected to the battery , and label that 1 .
Whichever wire was in the same pair as 1 , label that 2 , and then tie 1 and 2 back together .
Now you can find 3 , because it 's tied to 2 on the far end .
Once you find 3 , label the wire it was tied to 4 , etc .
This assumes that the resistance of the wire is small enough that the battery will still light the bulb across 12,000 km of wire .
5 . The Card Trick I ask Alex to pick any 5 cards out of a deck with no Jokers .
He can inspect then shuffle the deck before picking any five cards .
He picks out 5 cards then hands them to me ( Peter ca n't see any of this ) .
I look at the cards and I pick 1 card out and give it back to Alex .
I then arrange the other four cards in a special way , and give those 4 cards all face down , and in a neat pile , to Peter .
Peter looks at the 4 cards i gave him , and says out loud which card Alex is holding ( suit and number ) .
How ?
The solution uses pure logic , not sleight of hand .
All Peter needs to know is the order of the cards and what is on their face , nothing more .
Show Hint Show Solution Hint :
There are only 4 suits , so there will be at least two cards of one suit , one higher and another lower .
By careful selection and placement the cards can be used to encode the exact number and suit of the selected card .
Solution : Pick out two cards of the same suit .
Select a card for Alex where adding a number no greater than six will result in the number of the other card of the same suit .
Adding one to the Ace would cycle to the beginning again and result in a Two .
E.g. if you have a King and a Six of Diamonds , hand the King to Alex .
The other three cards will be used to encode a number from 1 through 6 .
Devise a system with Peter to rank all cards uniquely from 1 to 52 ( e.g. the two of hearts is 1 , the two of diamonds is fourteen etc ... ) .
That will allow you to choose from six combinations , depending on where you put the lowest and highest cards .
6 . The Warden
The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive .
He tells them , " You may meet today and plan a strategy .
But after today , you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another .
" In the prison is a switch room , which contains two light switches labeled 1 and 2 , each of which can be in either up or the down position .
I am not telling you their present positions .
The switches are not connected to anything .
" After today , from time to time whenever I feel so inclined , I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room .
This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position .
He must flip one switch when he visits the switch room , and may only flip one of the switches .
Then he 'll be led back to his cell .
" No one else will be allowed to alter the switches until I lead the next prisoner into the switch room .
I 'm going to choose prisoners at random .
I may choose the same guy three times in a row , or I may jump around and come back .
I will not touch the switches , if I wanted you dead you would already be dead .
" Given enough time , everyone will eventually visit the switch room the same number of times as everyone else .
At any time , anyone may declare to me , ' We have all visited the switch room . '
" If it is true , then you will all be set free .
If it is false , and somebody has not yet visited the switch room , you will all die horribly .
You will be carefully monitored , and any attempt to break any of these rules will result in instant death to all of you "
What is the strategy they come up with so that they can be free ?
Show Hint Show Solution Hint :
Take a long - term perspective .
Solve the puzzler for three prisoners .
Solution :
The team nominates a leader .
The group agrees upon the following rules :
The leader is the only person who will announce that everyone has visited the switch room .
All the prisoners ( except for the leader ) will flip the first switch up at their very first opportunity , and again on the second opportunity .
If the first switch is already up , or they have already flipped the first switch up two times , they will then flip the second switch .
Only the leader may flip the first switch down , if the first switch is already down , then the leader will flip the second switch .
The leader remembers how many times he has flipped the first switch down .
Once the leader has flipped the first switch down 44 times , he announces that all have visited the room .
It does not matter how many times a prisoner has visited the room , in which order the prisoners were sent or even if the first switch was initially up .
Once the leader has flipped the switch down 44 times then the leader knows everyone has visited the room .
If the switch was initially down , then all 22 prisoners will flip the switch up twice .
If the switch was initially up , then there will be one prisoner who only flips the switch up once and the rest will flip it up twice .
The prisoners can not be certain that all have visited the room after the leader flips the switch down 23 times , as the first 12 prisoners plus the leader might be taken to the room 24 times before anyone else is allowed into the room .
Because the initial state of the switch might be up , the prisoners must flip the first switch up twice .
If they decide to flip it up only once , the leader will not know if he should count to 22 or 23 .
In the example of three prisoners , the leader must flip the first switch down three times to be sure all prisoners have visited the room , twice for the two other prisoners and once more in case the switch was initially up .
7.a. Solomon Grundy
You randomly ask people if they have two children .
After a few people say no , you find Fred Grundy who says yes .
You ask Fred to pick one child randomly , and tell you their gender and the day they were born on .
Fred says his first child is a boy named Solomon Grundy who was born on a Monday .
What is the chance the other child is also a boy ?
Guess the probability as a number out of 108 e.g. 1/3rd is 36 out of 108 .
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint :
This one is easy , it is what you think .
Solution :
The answer is 54 out of 108 , or one out of two or a 50 % probability .
Because you did n't know the gender or the day of either child before selecting your participant , the facts discovered after selecting your participant are irrelevant to the probabilities .

While chatting on IRC last night I entered conversation about strdup ( ) , a C function I had never used or encountered .
I was then challenged to write my own .
Checking the man page had me thinking about a for loop to iterate the data from one place to another , however , the genious Maxlor then pointed me to memcpy ( ) ( another function I had never used . )
Two minutes later I had my own version of strdup .
char * mystrdup ( const char * string ) { char * p ; if ( ( p = malloc ( strlen ( string ) ) ) == NULL ) return NULL ; return memcpy ( p , string , strlen ( string ) ) ; }
Quite interesting to think through how some functions you use ( or do n’t use ) are implemented .
Our insatiable appetite for the big picture is threatening the planet .
A scientist has warned that if half of British homes buy a plasma - screen TV , two nuclear power stations would have to be built to meet the extra energy demand .
Britons were buying flat - screen TVs every 15 seconds from Currys and its online sister company Dixons during the build - up to the World Cup , and subsequent price reductions have ensured they remain hugely popular .
But plasma sets can use up to four times as much electricity as the old - style cathode - ray tube models .
Combined with set - top boxes , digital video recorders , DVD players and home PCs , the digital home is seen by environmental campaigners as a growing contributor to the energy crisis .
Dr Joseph Reger , chief technology officer at Fujitsu Siemens Computers in Munich , Germany , said : ' If all the [ plasma ]
TVs were on at the same time , you would need something that produces 2.5 gigawatts .
That can be done today with around two nuclear power stations . '
But Reger added : ' It is safe to assume that there will be extras because people rarely just buy a TV .
They desire a better picture and all of a sudden you have the urge for the latest and greatest DVD player .
Then you need more file space on your personal video recorder .
You want to download movies and it all adds up . '
Once all the elements of the ' digital home ' are factored in , Reger calculates , the additional power requirement at peak hours may be six gigawatts .
In the meantime , growing electricity demands are placing a strain on conventional power stations .
One quarter of all carbon emissions in Britain come from energy used in the home , about the same as transport .
Simply leaving devices such as TVs and DVD players on standby at home puts up to 1 m tonnes of carbon a year into the atmosphere and costs each household around £ 25 .
The government recently called 11 electronics retailers - including Argos , Amazon , Asda , Comet , the Dixons Group , John Lewis , Sainsbury 's and Tesco - to a summit at 11 Downing Street to discuss cutting greenhouse gas emissions from their products .
Gordon Brown 's last Budget contained an initiative for retailers to sell energy - efficient goods by 2010 .
Last year consumer electronics used the equivalent of 18 terawatt hours - equivalent to the annual output from five standard power stations , and amounting to 30 per cent of the country 's total domestic electricity consumption .
The Department for the Environment estimates this could rise to 31 terawatt hours by 2010 , mainly due to the rise in the number of TVs , demand for bigger screens and set - top boxes .
Projections show that more than 50 million digital set - top boxes will be in UK homes by 2012 .
Philip Sellwood , chief executive of the Energy Saving Trust , said : ' As the consumer electronics market continues to grow , further development of energy - efficient products will be vital to help in the fight against climate change .
TVs are here to stay , but people can change how they use them , for example , turning them off standby when not in use . '
Reger remains optimistic , believing that plasma screens will be overtaken by more energy - efficient technologies .
' I think it will be a general requirement because people increasingly have an environmental conscience , ' he said .
' Equipment with a sticker that says , " Extreme low standby " will be a selling point .
' It 's a short - term problem , but to say it will automatically right itself is also wrong .
Inefficient TVs can be around in homes for five or 10 years . '
Das kommende " Imperium des neuen Wissens "
Ob sich da manche stiff upperlip ein wenig bange gekräuselt hat oder war man doch eher " amused " und rieb sich die gepflegten Hände in vorfreudiger Erwartung des goldenen - profitablen - Zeitalters der Information , dem " Imperium des neuen Wissens " , das der Medien - Großmogul heraufdämmern sieht ?
Von den Reaktionen der Zuhörerschaft , die gestern Abend den jüngsten revolutionären Visionen von Rupert Murdoch ( vgl. Schon wieder eine Revolution verschlafen ? ) lauschten , verrät der Bericht des Guardian leider nichts .
Nur dass die erlesenen Gäste der 603 Jahre alten Gilde mit dem Dickenschen Namen " The Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers " einen seltenen Gast hatten , der das Medienestablishment mit einer Gorbatschowschen Alternative konfrontierte : " Change or die ! "
Ganze Länder gefährdet
Die Macht würde sich weg bewegen von den alten Eliten der Medienindustrie , von den Herausgebern , den Bossen , den Eigentümern , die Ära der " Medienbarone " sei zu Ende , so Murdoch , der Tycoon einer multinationalen Mediengruppe .
Er prophezeit gewaltige Auswirkungen der Informationsrevolution : Nicht nur Firmen , ganze Länder würden von der neuen Technologie entweder aufgebaut oder zerstört .
Man dürfe die großartigen Veränderungen , die längst im Gange sind , nicht unterschätzen , so seine Warnung .
Gesellschaften und Firmen , die sich hinter einer glorreichen Vergangenheit verschanzen würden , sei das Scheitern sicher .
Man müsse sich neu orientieren :
A new generation of media consumers has risen demanding content delivered when they want it , how they want it , and very much as they want it .
Großer Journalismus würde immer Leser anziehen und traditionellen Zeitungen noch einige gute Jahre ins Haus stehen .
Aber Gedrucktes würde künftig nur mehr einer von mehreren Kanälen zum Leser sein .
Medien würden wie " Fast - Food " werden , Nachrichten über Handys und Handhelds schnell zugänglich und überall abrufbar .
Er selbst habe die Macht des Internet lange Jahre unterschätzt .
Jetzt wisse er , dass das Netz eine " kreative , destruktive Technologie " ist , die alles in ihrem Weg neu ordnet .
Wie es heißt , hat Murdochs Unternehmen jetzt 400 Millionen Dollar in MySpace.com investiert .
Möglich , dass die Dinergäste von solchen visionären Häppchen beeindruckt waren , interessant ist der Ausflug zum Abendessen im Londoner Grade 1 - Gebäude " Stationers ' Hall " vor allem , weil er ein kurzes Schlaglicht darauf wirft , wie die gegenwärtigen Transformationen im Nachrichten - , Medien - und Zeitungsgeschäft in der obersten Etage wahrgenommen werden .
Seismische Transformation
Gar nicht abgehoben , aber dafür ungleich erkenntnisreicher ist in diesem Zusammenhang der aktuelle Bericht des Project for Excellence in Journalism , einem Institut , das mit der Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism verbunden ist .
Vom Ende des herkömmlichen Journalismus wollen die Verfasser des Berichtes nicht sprechen , aber auch sie beobachten eine " seismische Transformation dessen , was und wie man heutzutage von der Welt ( an ) Wissen erfährt . "
Auch sie beobachten , dass sich die Medienmacht von den Journalisten als den klassischen Gate - Keepern zum Publikum hin bewegt .
Auch ihnen ist aufgefallen , dass sich das Publikum mehr von den alten zu den neuen Medien bewegt und eine aktivere Rolle einnimmt ( Stichwort Blogs , Citizen media ) .
Die Journalisten müssten entsprechend ihre Rolle neu definieren und sich Gedanken darüber machen , welche essentiellen Werte sie gewahrt haben wollen .
Ein Prozess , der nach Meinung der Verfasser erst sehr langsam beginnt .
Der Citizen - Media - und Blogger - Boom hat nach ihrer Ansicht eine Schattenseite , die bislang in dieser Deutlichkeit noch von niemandem herausgestellt wurde : Die offenen Kanäle geben auch Vertretern von " speziellen Interessen " die Möglichkeit , anonym oder unter einer anderen Identität Einfluss auszuüben .
Die Sorge , welche die Verfasser beschäftigt , ist nicht das " wundersame Hinzukommen der Citizen Media " zum klassischen Medienpool , sondern der Verfall der Beobachtung und Kontrolle von mächtigen Institutionen durch professionelle Vollzeit - Journalisten .
Immer mehr Publikationen veröffentlichen die gleichen Stories
Das neue Paradox des Journalismus sei nämlich , dass immer mehr Publikationen immer weniger Geschichten abdeckten .
Das hat zum einen damit zu tun , dass die Zeitungsbranche in den USA arg kränkelt und auch große Zeitungen und Magazine ( New York Times , Washington Post , Newsweek ) ihr Newsroom - und Reporter - Personal drastisch kürzen , und zum anderen mit dem Zeitdruck , dem Journalisten unterliegen , die sich eine Spezialisierung nicht mehr leisten können und dadurch auch nur über beschränkte Kontakte verfügen .
Die Konzentration ihrer journalistischen Mitarbeiter auf wenige populäre Themen würde den Nachrichtenmachern eine Kontrolle über das geben , was das Publikum weiß .
Den Regierungsinstitutionen wäre es so ein Leichtes , die " Schar von Reportern , Korrespondenten , Crews und Paparazzi " in die für die Presse freigegebenen Räume zu locken - weg von den News .
Eine Ausnahme bildete die Berichterstattung über den Hurrikan Katrina im vergangenen Jahr , eben weil die Behörden nicht schnell genug schalteten .
Die Art von Zeitung , die nach der Studie am meisten gefährdet ist , ist das Big - City - Metro - Paper , im letzten Jahrhundert dominant auf dem Nachrichtenmarkt .
Auch dieser
Trend fügt sich für die Autoren in ein eher sorgenvolles Bild , da es gerade diese Zeitungen sind , welche über die Ressourcen , Mittel und den Ehrgeiz verfügten , als " watchdogs " über städtische , regionale und staatliche Institutionen zu wachen .
Es sei fraglich , ob diese Aufgabe von Vorstadt - Tageszeitungen oder Wochenzeitungen übernommen werden könnte .
Und für die Bloggerszene gelte - trotz all ihrer Qualitäten und Bereicherungen , die sie beisteuert - noch immer , dass sie vorwiegend von der Berichterstattung größerer Publikationen lebe .
Der Anteil von Reportern in der Blogosphäre sei derzeit leider noch sehr gering .
Idealisten haben verloren , die Buchhalter gewonnen
Den Kampf zwischen journalistischen Idealisten und der eher wirtschaftlich denkenden Führung in den herkömmlichen Medienunternehmen der USA sei vorbei , so ein anderes Fazit der Studie .
Gewonnen haben die an der Wirtschaftlichkeit orientierten Kräfte .
Inzwischen sei es gar nicht mehr sicher , ob in vielen News - Media - Unternehmen überhaupt noch Stimmen präsent seien , die sich für das " öffentliche Interesse " einsetzten .
Dafür habe es einen bemerkenswerten Wandel in den traditionellen Medien gegeben .
Während man früher das Internet nur als Plattform für recyceltes Printmaterial begriffen habe , habe sich hier im letzten Jahr ein Wandel gezeigt .
Endlich begreife man das Internet als eigenständiges Medium , das eine eigene Form brauche und andere Leseransprüche bedienen müsse .
Ob das jüngere Publikum damit zu gewinnen ist , bleibt allerdings unklar , ebenso steht die Antwort auf die Frage noch aus , ob die traditionellen Medien mit ihrem Internetauftritt tatsächlich ihre " Kultur " verändern können oder ob sie damit nicht einfach ihrer Neigung folgen , die Leserschaft ihrer traditionellen Publikationen halten zu wollen .
Muss Google künftig für News bezahlen ?
Die interessanteren Fragen , die auf die Nachrichtenindustrie zukommen , werfen aber die sogenannten News - Aggregators auf .
Durch Google und Yahoo sei das Nachrichtengeschäft noch schneller geworden , die Verfallszeit der Nachrichtenprodukte noch kürzer - außer bei den Bloggern , dort halten sich die Stories mit wertvollem I nhalt länger .
Dies geschehe auf Kosten derjenigen , von denen die Nachrichten stammen .
Entweder , so folgern die Verfasser der Studie , müssen Google und Yahoo über kurz oder lang selbst Nachrichten produzieren , die ersten " Baby - Schritte " würden da auch schon gemacht , oder die Old - School - Nachrichten - Produzenten müssten künftig Geld von den News - Portalen verlangen .
Die Frage wäre , ob Google oder Yahoo mehr als Technologie - Unternehmen werden können und wenn , inwieweit sie den Werten eines Journalismus , der sich am öffentlichen Interesse orientiert , folgen würden ?
( Thomas Pany )
The sharing of Iraq 's oil revenues is still under discussion
But minutes ahead of the deadline for an agreement , Sunni politicians said there was no consensus .
The original deadline last week was shifted to midnight on Monday ( 2000 GMT ) when no agreement was reached .
MPs have gathered in the chamber to receive the text but it is not clear what decision they will make .
Shia and Kurdish political groups have enough of a majority in parliament to push through a draft constitution without the support of Sunni members of parliament .
Correspondents say this would be a politically damaging move , possibly further alienating Sunni Iraqis from the political process .
US officials say a delay risks playing into the hands of the insurgents , who killed 10 people in Baghdad on Monday .
Eight policemen were among those killed as their mini-van was riddled with bullets north of the capital .
Stumbling blocks
Shia , Sunni and Kurdish teams have had difficulties agreeing on key issues including federalism , oil and the role of Islam .
" Thank God we have finished all the details related to the agreement , " Shia negotiator Jawad Maliki told reporters .
He acknowledged differences with Sunni Arabs over the key issue federalism - which they oppose for all but Iraq 's northern Kurdish area .
There are still major points of disagreement
Saleh Mutlaq
Sunni committee member
Constitutional issues
The Sunnis oppose greater autonomy for the Kurdish north and Shia south , fearing its share of revenues from those oil - rich regions could eventually be compromised .
And Sunni negotiator Saleh Mutlaq said " major points of disagreement " remained and the plan to submit the text to parliament was unlawful .
" There is still no agreement and if they want to hand the draft today they will be violating the law , " Mr Mutlaq told the Associated Press news agency .
One prominent Kurdish negotiator , Mahmoud Othman , said earlier the Shia insistence on submitting the draft had created a lot of bad feeling .
He said it was important to have the Sunnis on board .
The prime minister 's spokesman has said the government may ask for another one - week extension or " the national assembly would be dissolved " paving the way for fresh elections .
Correspondents say there appears to be little appetite for new elections , so an extension appears the more likely outcome if the deadline is not met for the second time .
The United States has led the way in urging the completion of the constitution , seeing it as a step towards stabilising Iraq .
' Sidelined '
The BBC's Mike Wooldridge in Baghdad says Sunni politicians complain of being sidelined and have urged the international community to prevent the pushing through of a constitution lacking consensus .
He says the most optimistic participants believe a final text at this stage would still leave some details unresolved .
Officials say the communities have edged closer on some issues , but not close enough to come up with a draft form of words for the constitution .
A draft constitution agreed by the committee would be put to a referendum due in October .
If it was approved , fresh elections would follow to elect a fully - mandated parliament under its terms , probably in December .
Fußball in der Krise Goals statt Gelder !
Es steht nicht gut um des Deutschen liebstes Kind : Kurz vor der WM macht der Fußball Negativschlagzeilen am laufenden Band .
Dabei kommt die Krise nicht von ungefähr .
SPIEGEL - ONLINE - Autor Hubert Kleinert plädiert für weniger Millionen , weniger Tricks und weniger Marketing zugunsten spannenderer Spiele .
“ In matters nuclear one thing is certain : there is no protection in an iron curtain . ” A letter in The Times May 3rd , 1986 .
On the 26th of April 1986 shortly after midnight , to be precise , at 1:23 GMT , there occurred near the Ukrainian town of Chornobyl a tremendous explosion at a huge nuclear power plant , followed by a gradual meltdown of the reactor No. 4 .
Chornobyl is situated 80 miles north - west of Kiev , the ancient capital of Ukraine and the Soviet Union ’s third largest city .
It was by far the worst nuclear reactor accident ever , which immediately sent a radioactive cloud across neighbouring Byelorussia , Poland and the Baltic Republics towards Scandinavia .
Within days , borne by shifting winds , radioactive mists wafted beyond Soviet borders and spread across most of Europe causing anxiety , apprehension and fear .
The most badly affected were the Republics of Ukraine and Byelorussia .
They suffered large scale involuntary irradiation , due to extensive secrecy , and great economic damage .
Furthermore the contaminated air mass passed over large areas of Poland and also over parts of Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania and Yugoslavia and a number of West European countries .
Till now the land is abandoned , thousands of houses , thousands acres of the land , everything is now stays almost the same as it was 20 years ago .
Nowadays there guided tours are being conducted to this area .
These photos are made by Alexandr Vikulov , pikul2001@mail.ru while participating in such a trip .
This Soviet Era sign indicates the entrance to Chernobyl county .
Many of the things there stand unchanged since Soviet union times .
This is also a sign from Soviet times on one of the buildings in Chernobyl .
There is life now in Chernobyl , some people decided to return despite the radiation hazard .
The members of this trip have noticed even one building was being renovated .
Still people are very rare on the streets of Chernobyl .
All the pipes now are on top of the ground , because the soild is nuclear polluted .
This is the main square in downtown of Chernobyl .
It is the monument to the people who tried to shut down the nuclear station right after the accident happened .
Many of the died – some same year ( 1986 ) others a little bit later .
This is also that monument .
On the road to the monument there are a lot of signs warning about nuclear pollution , but trees and bushes grew all over them so it ’s possible not to notice such signs .
Nature is not afraid of radiation .
This is kindergatten kindergarten on the way to Chernobyl in one of the abandoned villages .
This is a bedroom in it .
Toys are lying all over the place .
Music notes .
How is it correct to cross a road ?
One more bedroom .
This is a Chernobyl Nuclear Station itself .
Even now people there work , they build a special cover on top of the blown up reactor , so that radiation could not spread further .
They are allowed to work inside not more than 2 minutes a day in special protective uniform , and they get $ 1000 monthly salary for this 2 minute job a day , which is 5 times bigger than an average salary in this region .
Many people try to tune their the dosage indicators so that they show less numbers than they got in reality so that they could work more and earn more .
This was a cultural center for Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers .
Coming inside …
Such huge pictures across the walls were very classy in Soviet 80s .
This is a gym , Soviet symbolics is left untouched .
Probably no other places in former USSR where it can be found so .
Through the floor there is already a tree grew .
Probably a result of some mutation ?
Here is written “ Brave ones ”
Sport equipment .
And that ’s a view to a side - show .
Leaving a gym ..
More Soviet symbolics and portraits of some Soviet leaders .
“ Love ” is written here .
A lonely doll was lost on the asfalt .
Here were the tickets sold to the side - shows .
This was a star turn , the big dipper .
And this is the entrance to it .
Some more toys are left ..
And some more Soviet era signs .
A disposed fire extinguisher .
It has been said that some mad French artist visited an abandoned city and made series of crazy paintings on the walls all across the city .
This was the hotel .
Some more of French paintings .
Some tables are left on the middle of the square .
Look at this Nuclear Hazard sign , it was previously used to be a peaceful sign , now it shows the real state of the things here .
This is a Soviet style mailbox .
Piece of the Soviet architecture …
Inside of School building .
Look how many gas - masks !
Somebody left his shoe in a rush .
That ’s a chemistry classroom .
And this is a teachers room .
This is a class log .
The building of the school suffers demolition …
Guess what it is .
This is inside a hospital .
Inside of a cubicle .
Chess and a medical thing .
Mattresses .
This is an elevator .
It is stuck halfway .
This medical drug is left untouched for 20 years !
And some more drugs untouched .
Beds at the hostpital ’s yard .
Walking across the city .
All these trees were n’t here before the accident , 20 years ago .
They are a new generation .
A dock .
This is another sample of Soviet architecture , 16 stored building with a Soviet state emblem .
Just another view of it .
Another street art on the walls of the abandoned city Chernobyl , all of them appeared after the accident , when first tourists appeared .
And some more on the roof of this 16 stored building from previous photos .
This is the view on the Chernobyl Power Plant .
As it can be seen it stands right in the middle of the city .
This is that emblem .
Some giant letters are scattered across the roof .
What for ?
Who knows ..
A view of totally abandoned city .
Forest came into the city .
Another piece of art …
Opinion
Why the U.S. should never deploy its latest weapon
The U.S. military - industrial complex has just developed a dangerous weapon that should never , under any circumstances , be deployed .
No , I 'm not talking about the " bunker - buster " nukes that were , thankfully , denied funding once again in next year 's federal budget .
The new weapon -- first reported in the press in 2004 -- is known in military circles as the Active Denial System .
It has been nicknamed the " pain ray " -- and with good reason .
According to DefenseTech.org , an online military information service , the new weapon " fires out millimeter waves -- a sort of cousin of microwaves , in the 95 GHz range .
The invisible beams penetrate just 1/64th of an inch beneath the skin .
But that 's deep enough to heat up the water inside a person .
Which is enough to cause excruciating pain .
Seconds later , people have to run away .
And that causes mobs to break up in a hurry . "
Charles Heal , a widely recognized authority on nonlethal weapons who has dubbed the ray the " Holy Grail of crowd control , " likened it to having a hot iron pressed against the skin .
Raytheon has reportedly developed such a device that can be mounted on a Humvee for the Pentagon .
According to a recent report on Military.com , the head of the Army unit charged with rapidly securing new gear for use by troops , Col. Robert Lovett , " has requested that [ the device ] be rushed to the field to support military operations in Iraq . "
Lovett 's memorandum cites a request by Col. James Brown , commander of the 18th Military Police Brigade , for the immediate deployment of the Active Denial System to help " suppress " insurgent attacks and quell prison uprisings .
As a national security expert and a former professor for the U.S. Naval War College , I understand the urgency felt by commanders on the front lines to provide U.S. troops with the best weaponry available .
But because of that built - in bias , we are fortunate to have a civilian - led military in order to keep our long - term interests in the proper perspective .
Not only do I strongly disagree with the two colonels ; I feel compelled to publicly oppose their request .
Today 's innovation is tomorrow 's copy .
For example , the baseball team lucky enough to include on its roster the pitcher who first developed the curveball had a temporary advantage , to be sure -- at least until all the other pitchers learned the same technique .
Likewise , military innovation , once deployed , enjoys only a temporary advantage until adversaries and allies alike are able to catch up .
That 's why developing a pain ray and deploying one are inherently different actions .
Studying the capability of millimeter waves to cause pain might help us develop defenses against that technology ; however , deploying the weapon merely invites other nations to follow suit .
The stigma of deploying such weapons , once the line is crossed , is difficult to " uncross " -- much like trying to put the " nuclear genie " back in the bottle .
Rather than deploying a pain ray , President Bush should instead begin developing a plan -- drawing inspiration from the post - World War I leaders who banned the use of chemical weapons -- to forever ban the use of millimeter waves ( or similar technologies ) in combat or any other form of " crowd control . "
Otherwise , it will only be a matter of time before such weapons are used against American troops or by repressive regimes against their own citizens -- or perhaps even by the U.S. government against dissidents or unruly crowds in our own country .
Harlan Ellison observed in August 1975 , on the 30th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima : " For the first time we have a weapon that nobody has used for 30 years .
This gives me great hope for the human race . "
Let 's hope that 30 years from now , the same can be said about the pain ray .
A new breed of weapon
Directed - energy weapons could play a role in fighting conflicts in coming years and bring numerous advantages to U.S. troops who have to deal with a hostile but unarmed crowd .
Active Denial System
Sends a nonlethal beam of energy to repel people without injury
Beam traveling at the speed of light , penetrates the skin to 1/64 of an inch , causing a burning sensation
Antenna focuses the invisible beam
Transmitter produces energy at a frequency of 95 GHz
Range
Beam : 700 yards
Small - arms fire : about 1,100
A 2 - second burst can heat the skin to 130° F
Normal : 98.6° F

The following is a list of the Internet ’s eight biggest Google AdSense publishers .
The information was compiled from interviews and articles found on the Internet .
Whenever possible , I list the source of the information .
I apologize in advance if I missed anyone on the list .
If you make more than the people listed , please send me proof of your Google AdSense earnings and I will add you on the next time the list is updated .
This is a list of individual site owners – people just like you and me .
Big corporate AdSense publishers like AOL are excluded .
1 : Markus Frind : PlentyOfFish.com – $ 300,000 per month
Markus Frind is a local Vancouverite who is turning the online dating world upside down .
His site , Plentyoffish.com is the biggest free dating site on the Internet .
Plentyoffish.com receives up to 500 million page views per month and make over $ 10,000 per day for Markus , who runs the site from home .
You think a site this big would be staffed by a hundred people but the only employee that Markus has is his girlfriend , who helps to answer the emails .
Markus coded Plenty of Fish all by himself .
The site is lean and mean and requires only four servers to handle all that traffic .
Doubts about Makus ’s Google earnings were silenced when he posted this $ 900,000 check from Google .
According to Markus ’s blog entry , the check represented two months of AdSense earnings .
2 : Kevin Rose : Digg.com – $ 250,000 per month
Kevin Rose started Digg in December of 2004 with just $ 1000 .
Today Digg is one of the biggest news sites on the Net , with over 400,000 members and over 200 million page views per month .
According to this article from Business week , Digg will make $ 3 million this year from a combination of Google AdSense and Federated Media ads .
Unfortunately , only Mr. Rose and his accountants knows how much came from Google and how much came from Federated Media .
I can try to take a guess based on the number of times I have seen a Federated Media ad vs. a Google ad on Digg but , being in Canada , it ’s almost 100 % Google ads .
Whatever Google ’s share of Digg ’s $ 250,000 per month in ad revenues may be , one thing is for sure , it is not small .
3 : Jeremy Schoemaker – $ 140,000 per month
If ever anyone can be considered an Internet marketing superstar , ShoeMoney would be near the top of the list .
Jeremy Schoemaker is a search engine marketer who knows how to take advantage of both Google AdSense and AdWords .
In the above photo , you see him with the biggest Google AdSense check he has ever received from Google .
The income was earned back in the month of August 2005 .
Since then Mr. Schoemaker has moved to wire transfers .
No doubt , he got tired to dealing with the bank tellers when trying to deposit $ 100 K plus checks every month .
Unlike the other Google whores on this list , ShoeMoney , as he likes to be call , does not own just one site .
He makes his enormous Google checks using hundreds of sites and thousands of domains .
4 : Jason Calacanis : Weblogs , Inc. – $ 120,000 per month
Before Jason Calacanis sold Weblogs , Inc to AOL for $ 25 million , he got the network of blogs making over $ 4,000 a day from Google AdSense .
So impressive was his AdSense performance that Google used Weblogs for a case study .
Now that AOL controls Weblogs , you can bet it is making a lot more than a measly $ 120,000 a month .
5 : David Miles Jr. & Kato Leonard – $ 100,000 per month
According to this Washington Post article , David Miles Jr. and Kato Leonard , claims they make $ 100,000 a month from their site , Freeweblayouts.net , which gives away designs that people can use on MySpace .
The only problem with the revenue figure is it is not 100 % AdSense .
Free Web Layouts use other advertising networks in addition to Google .
However , with a claimed $ 100,000 per month in revenues , I am fairly confident that the AdSense portion is higher than our next Google whore .
6 : Tim Carter : AskTheBuilder.com – $ 30,000 per month
Tim Carter is a licensed master plumber and carpenter with his own radio show .
He also makes frequent television appearances .
He founded AsktheBuilder.com in 1995 , The primary focus has been catering to an avid following of fellow builders on the site .
According to the Google case study , Mr. Carter did such a good job tweaking the Google ads on his site that it now makes $ 30,000 a month .
Tim ’s AdSense revenues now average $ 1400 a day and growing .
Overall , Carter is enthusiastic about AdSense : it allows him to focus on content development , and gives him built - in tools to measure ad performance and make changes to maximize revenues .
“ People come to me for help , ” says Carter .
“ They get what they need from my columns and advice – and also from ads delivered by AdSense . ”
7 : Joel Comm – $ 24,000 per month
Joel Comm is get rich quick guru .
He wrote the best selling e-book , What Google Never Told You About Making Money with AdSense .
The e-book , along with the website that promotes it has a screen shot of Mr. Comm AdSense earning from November 19 , 2005 to December 15 , 2005 .
Whether or not Mr. Comm still makes this much from Google is anybody ’s guess .
8 : Shawn Hogan â€ “ DigitalPoint.com $ 10,000 per month
Back in January of 2005 the New York Times had an article about AdSense , featuring Shawn Hogan , founder of DigitalPoint .
The article states that Mr. Hogan makes $ 10,000 per month from Google AdSense using a very unique revenue sharing model .
Google pays Digital Point about $ 10,000 a month , depending on how many people view or click on those ads , said Shawn D. Hogan , the owner and chief technology officer of Digital Point .
Mr. Hogan said he started the revenue - sharing approach in 2004 “ as kind of a marketing gimmick . ”
“ But everyone seemed to think it was a cool idea , ” he said .
“ I saw a lot of other sites doing the same thing maybe six months later . ”
DigitalPoint have grown a lot since that article and while Mr. Hogun would not say anything , the DigitalPoint forum members speculate that he is making at least twice that amount now .
The United States will become a second - rate economic power unless it can match the educational performance of its rivals abroad and get more of its students to achieve at the highest levels in math , science and literacy .
Virtually every politician , business leader and educator understands this , yet the country has no national plan for reaching the goal .
To make matters worse , Americans have remained openly hostile to the idea of importing strategies from the countries that are beating the pants off us in the educational arena .
The No Child Left Behind
Act , passed four years ago , was supposed to put this problem on the national agenda .
Instead , the country has gotten bogged down in a squabble about a part of the law that requires annual testing in the early grades to ensure that the states are closing the achievement gap .
The testing debate heated up last month when national math and reading scores showed dismal performance across the board .
Lurking behind these test scores , however , are two profoundly important and closely intertwined topics that the United States has yet to even approach : how teachers are trained and how they teach what they teach .
These issues get a great deal of attention in high - performing systems abroad -- especially in Japan , which stands light years ahead of us in international comparisons .
Americans tend to roll their eyes when researchers raise the Japanese comparison .
The most common response is that Japanese culture is " nothing like ours . "
Nevertheless , the Japanese system has features that could be fruitfully imitated here , as the education reformers James Stigler and James Hiebert pointed out in their book " The Teaching Gap , " published in 1999 .
The October 3 , 2005 issue of Fortune magazine carries a “ wall street : special report ” called “ The Money Game ” by Marcia Vickers .
This details the investment strategies of David F. Swensen and Jack R. Meyer , who managed the endowments of Yale and Harvard , respectively .
While most mutual funds that pick stocks underperform indices , both schools have consistently earned a much better return than the stock indices .
How did they do it ?
Below are their allocations .
Note that Harvard ’s total is 105 percent because of leverage , i.e. , situations in which they ’ve borrowed money to purchase investments .
Conspicuously absent from these portfolios are heavy investments in American companies run by Harvard and Yale graduates .
“ Domestic Equity ” are publicly traded stocks such as GE and Microsoft .
Harvard and Yale have faith that their graduates will make a lot of money for themselves , but no faith that they will make money for their shareholders .

Celebrities , activists rally against Darfur genocide WASHINGTON 
A crowd of thousands joined human rights activists , movie stars , athletes and politicians in front of the U.S. Capitol Sunday to press for political support to end genocide in Sudan 's southern Darfur region .
" Paralysis in the face of genocide is wrong , " Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , told the crowd .
He urged demonstrators to call on political leaders to put pressure on all sides to end the killing in Darfur .
The rally drew actor George Clooney , Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel , Olympic speedskating champion Joey Cheek and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California .
Clooney told the crowd it was critical to keep up public pressure " until this travesty ( against refugees ) is ended . "
" If we turn our heads and look away and hope they will disappear , then they will , " he said .
Rebels in Darfur , made up largely of Muslims from several non-Arab tribes , resisted what they saw as neglect by the Arab - dominated central government .
Militias , drawn from Arab tribes , tried to crush the rebellion .
The conflict has killed at least 180,000 people and left about 2 million homeless .
The Sudanese government might accept a United Nations force in Darfur to aid African Union troops if a peace treaty is signed .
PEACE TALKS : Rebels reject draft deal Amid ongoing peace talks , the plight of refugees in Darfur has worsened .
The U.N. World Food Program , citing a lack of funds , is cutting rations in half .
President Bush met with Darfur advocates at the White House on Friday and lent his support to the weekend rallies .
" For those of you who are going out to march for justice , you represent the best of our country , " Bush said .
The crowd , holding signs that read " Not on our Watch " and " Never Again , " ranged from Sudanese refugees to Jewish students .
Saul Finkelstein , accompanied his two elementary - school - age sons , Ethan and Aaron , from New York City aboard one of five buses from the Abraham Joshua Heschel School .
" It 's the biggest event of the year , " Finkelstein said .
" The school really rallied around it . "
Emily Raebeck , 21 , a student at James Madison University in Harrisonburg , Va. , said she learned about the rally on The Oprah Winfrey Show .
She said she wondered , " How have I not heard about this ? "
There were no official estimates of the crowd , but people were packed into a two - block area across from the Capitol .
Refugee Satima Haround , 40 , of Philadelphia said conditions in Darfur are " horrific " for the victims .
" It 's torture , humiliation , rape , shooting and slaughter right in front of their eyes , " she said .
Hassan Cober of Portland , Maine , said he was forced to leave his family and flee Sudan four years ago after many people were killed and raped in his village .
He urged the United States and United Nations to act quickly , saying he had no idea where his relatives were or whether they were OK .
" We need deeds , not words , " he said .

Ormai il “ tempo delle chiacchiere ” sta venendo meno : i dati che emergono sul gioco - peraltro rilasciati dalla Guardia di Finanza - rappresentano quello che il gioco legale è arrivato ad essere nell ’ultimo biennio .
Non vi è dubbio che il gioco è divenuto un settore importante ed è arrivato il momento di affrontarlo - una volta per tutte - in modo assolutamente serio e razionale .
E non vi è neppure il dubbio che una buona parte delle situazioni che si sono create sui territorio derivino da una poco attenta valutazione ed attenzione sulle conseguenze che il divulgarsi dell ’ offerta di gioco avrebbe potuto causare .
In pratica il “ gioco è sfuggito di mano ” come non si è potuto mai concretizzare , in pratica , un coordinamento nazionale ed un dettagliato confronto messo sempre a disposizione degli operatori della filiera del gioco .
Il “ tempo delle chiacchiere ” è proprio finito poiché è sempre più significativo che la carenza di gioco in alcune regioni non significa che i cittadini di quei territori non giochino , ma che invece si rivolgono all ’illegalità che continua ad approfittare delle carenze del nostro Stato per insinuarsi pericolosamente sul territorio prendendo sempre più piede e rendendo sempre meno sicuro e tutelato il gioco dei consumatori .
La presa di coscienza di questa “ ingombrante ” presenza va assolutamente indirizzata verso una regolarizzazione , razionalizzazione ed ordinamento del settore con urgenza , sperando che la Delega Fiscale venga approvata a breve poiché sarebbe senz ’ altro un notevole passo avanti che convoglierebbe ad un tavolo di coordinamento tra Stato e Regioni assolutamente urgente e necessario .
Correct !
Lol , no .
Real !
During an extended winter cold snap a hardened crust of ice can accumulate over parts of the falls — American Falls in particular — creating an amazing , naturally - formed ice sculpture that has been known to reach a thickness of 50 feet .
Historically , when this blanket of ice has spanned the entire Niagara River , the phenomenon has been known as the " ice bridge . "
Just as you see in the photos , people used to stroll and frolic on and around the frozen falls and even walk across the ice bridge , though no one has been allowed to do the latter since 1912 , when the bridge unexpectedly broke apart and three tourists died .
Poll : Bush would lose an election if held this year President Bush would not get re-elected if an election were held this year , according to a CNN poll .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Iraq GOP George W. Bush or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
A majority would vote for a Democrat over President Bush if an election were held this year , according to a CNN / USA Today / Gallup Poll released Tuesday .
In the latest poll , 55 percent of the respondents said that they would vote for the Democratic candidate if Bush were again running for the presidency this year .
Thirty - nine percent of those interviewed said they would vote for Bush in the hypothetical election .
The latest poll results , released Tuesday , were based on interviews with 1,008 adults conducted by telephone October 21 - 23 .
In the poll , 42 percent of those interviewed approved of the way the president is handling his job and 55 percent disapproved .
In the previous poll , released October 17 , 39 percent approved of Bush 's job performance -- the lowest number of his presidency -- and 58 percent disapproved .
However , all the numbers are within the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points , so it 's possible that the public 's opinion has not changed at all .
More than half , 57 percent , said they do n't agree with the president 's views on issues that are important to them , while 41 percent said their views are in alignment with those of Bush on important issues .
Democrats preferred on issues
On separate issues , a majority of those questioned felt the Democrats could do a better job than Republicans at handling health care ( 59 percent to 30 percent ) , Social Security ( 56 percent to 33 percent ) , gasoline prices ( 51 percent to 31 percent ) and the economy ( 50 percent to 38 percent ) .
Forty - six percent also believed Democrats could do better at handling Iraq , while 40 percent said the GOP would do better .
In 2003 , 53 percent said Republicans would better handle Iraq and only 29 percent believed the Democrats would do better .
The only issue on which Republicans came out on top was in fighting terrorism : 49 percent said the GOP is better at it , while 38 percent said the Democrats are .
And there was a dramatic shift downward in the latest poll , compared with September , in the percentage of people who said that it was a mistake to send U.S. troops to Iraq .
This time , 49 percent said it was a mistake , versus 59 percent who felt that way last month .

Body Bags 2006 - 03-05
Almost as good as the confusion among English speakers over the term Fanny Pack , is the humor raised by the German equivalent for knapsack .
Companies often use or " borrow " words from other languages to give their product names a certain cachet .
Sometimes their choices are a bit odd .
German makers of knapsacks refer to them as " Body Bags " .

CBS 60 Minutes New !
2006-02-25
I use an interpreter from time to time , so I know how difficult the job is .
The following Translator Mistake is reported on October 6 , 2000 on the CBS News Web Site among other places .
Look for the side bar on " Lost In Translation " .
( Which has not got to be one of the most overused , unclever , cliche headings in the past few years .
Strike it from the language along with " without further ado " . )
60 Minutes ' Mike Wallace , known for his tough interviewing style , drew a sharp rebute from Boris Yeltsin - thanks to a translator 's error .
The confusion arose when Wallace asked Yeltsin if he had a " thin skin " when it came to public criticism , but the translation had Wallace describing Yeltsin as a " thick - skinned hippopotamus . "
Yeltsin was not amused .
" An experienced journalist like yourself , " Yeltsin said , " should express himself in a more civilized fashion .
But this may be the translator 's fault , and if so , he is the hippopotamus ! "

Orange New !
2006-02-16
During its 1994 launch campaign , the telecom company Orange had to change its ads in Northern Ireland . "
The future 's bright … the future 's Orange . " That campaign is an advertising legend .
However , in the North the term Orange suggests the Orange Order .
The implied message that the future is bright , the future is Protestant , loyalist ... did n't sit well with the Catholic Irish population .

In 1988 , the General Electric Company ( GEC ) and Plessey combined to create a new telecommunications giant .
A brand name was desired that evoked technology and innovation .
The winning proposal was GPT for GEC - Plessey Telecommunications .
A not very innovative name and not suggestive of technology and a total disaster for European branding .
GPT is pronounced in French as “ J’ai pété ” or “ I 've farted ” .

Life Fitness New !
2006-01 - 24
Life
Fitness is a maker of exercise equipment , bikes , ski machines etc .
Their logo made me laugh .
I was walking around the exercise room to stretch my legs after some strenuous biking when I first noticed it .
At first I thought it said “ 4 F ” .
Now , for those of you that do n't know , the American military , when there was a draft , had a rating for recruits .
If you were “ 1A ” , you were healthy and fit for duty .
“ 4 F ” is the code for those that are physically unfit and unacceptable to the army .
So “ 4 F ” was a rather inappropriate logo for a health fitness machine .
It took me about a minute to realize it was n't “ 4 F ” , but “ LF ” the initials for LifeFitness .
Waterpik 2004 - 12 - 24 Waterpik uses another name in Denmark .
" Pik " is the common Danish word for male genitals .
Most Danes can easily translate " water " to the danish word " vand " .
And " vandpik " is a term for the morning erection .
" And you put that thing in your mouth ?!?! "
Thanks to Jørgen Lykkebo !
PepsiCo India 2004 -10-06
I was visiting Bangalore , India when the local news ( for example , rediff india ) was widely reporting the legal consequences of a marketing mistake by Pepsi .
Pepsi is being sued in a Hyderabad , India city court in a public interest litigation for glorifying child labor in a television ad .
In the ad , the Indian cricket team is in a celebratory huddle when a young boy serves them Pepsi .
Binney & Smith Crayola 2004 - 11-06
Crayola has changed color names over time due to the civil rights movement and other social pressures .
In 1962 , Binney & Smith replaced flesh with peach , in recognition of the wide variety of skin tones .
More recently , in 1999 , they changed indian red to chestnut .
The color was not named after Native Americans , it was actually named for a special pigment that came from India .
But school children often assumed the incorrect origin of the name .
There are many sites listing the history of Crayola colors , including Crayola 's own history page .
Panasonic 2004 -05 - 13
According to the EE Times , October 8 , 1996 ( and numerous web sites ) , Matsushita Electric was promoting a Japanese PC for internet users .
It came with a Japanese Web browser courtesy of Panasonic .
Panasonic had licensed the cartoon character " Woody Woodpecker " as the " Internet guide . "
The day before a huge marketing campaign was to begin , Panasonic stopped the product launch .
The reason : the ads featured the slogan " Touch Woody - The Internet Pecker . "
An American at the internal product launch explained to the stunned and embarrassed Japanese what " touch woody " and " pecker " meant in American slang .
Thanks to A . Vine for pointing me at this !
Port Wallhamn 2004 - 05-08 Port Wallhamn is a Swedish port .
The companies that surround it used to give their employees ties with the logo " W " and an anchor .
The combination forms a very nice rebus for Wanker , much to the chagrin of the British workers who had to wear it .
Thanks to Hendrik Demol !
If someone has a tie and could send me a photo of it , that would be much appreciated !
Gerber 2004 - 05-08
Gerber , the name of the famous baby food maker , is also the French word for vomiting .
It becomes a bit limiting when you go global ...
Gerber is therefore not in France , and although Gerber has a French Canadian web page , it says " Les aliments pour bébés Gerber ne sont disponibles pour l'instant qu'aux États - Unis " ( French for :
The baby food ain't here , try the U.S. )
Thanks to Hendrik Demol !
Latte Anyone ?
2004-03-16
Latte means milk in Italy .
In English , Latte is a coffee - drink .
Many folks like to head to Starbucks or other coffee shops to take early morning latte breaks ...
In Germany , Latte is a well known word for an erection .
So , " morning latte " is when you wake up in the morning with an erection !
The word " break " means " destroy " , so taking that " morning latte break " is destroying that erection .
I 'll leave the details to your imagination , as well as all the puns on how you take your steaming hot drink .
This item is thanks to Jochen Gumpert , a standup guy !
Apparently , Germans are amused at American morning television shows called " Morning Latte " and book 's like the popular Amanda Hesser 's book " Cooking for Mr. Latte " !
Yellow Transportation 2004 - 3- 8
Some will think it a mistake .
I think it 's brilliant .
The logo for Yellow Transportation says the name " Yellow " in bold black letters on hey , wait - a- second ... that 's not yellow !
Right it is orange .
And orange is all over their trucks , collateral , etc .
It 's good marketing that stops and makes you take a second look or makes you wonder .
Apparently they named the company Yellow , and later sought out the safest color for their trucks .
Collaborating with Dupont they came up with " Swamp Holly Orange " .
OK , it does n't take an Einstein to figure out you do n't want to rename the company Swamp anything .
Nevertheless , I like their commitment to safety while maintaining their identity and having a cool marketing strategy , which goes back to the 1930's .
Oh , you wanted mistakes .
See the next item .
IKEA FARTFULL 2004 - 3-8 IKEA sells this workbench as the FARTFULL .
Although IKEA 's web page says FARTFULL is not for sale on the web , I still enjoy recommending it as the perfect gift suggestion for various people .
Swedish is a Germanic language , and " Fährt " is German for travel , so I am sure " fartfull " is being used here to suggest mobility , given the desk 's wheels and design .
Swedish has several words for fart , but one of them is " Fjärt " , which strikes me as close enough that their marketing department knew what it was doing .
If even bad press is good public relations , then this is a case of allowing an ill wind to blow some good .
Ford Pinto , Ford Corcel Updated !
2004 -1-12
Everyone , get out your web erasers !
This popular story is debunked .
Marcelo de Castro Bastos informs us ( and confirmed elsewhere ) :
Ford Pinto ( under any name ) was n't ever sold in Brazil , except maybe as a low - volume import .
The Ford Corcel was a totally unrelated product , the result of a joint project by the Brazilian subsidiary of Willys Overland and French automaker Renault ( Willys used to make Renault cars , like the Dauphine and Gordini , under license in Brazil . )
When Ford acquired Willys 's Brazilian operation , they inherited the almost - finished project and decided to launch it under their own brand .
They MAY have considered to use the " Pinto " brand on it , but saner heads prevailed and decided on the " Corcel " name in order to keep to the " horse " theme Ford seemed to like at the time .
The " Pinto " name was never used in Brazil .
" Corcel " was a huge success , and remained in production for more than a decade , spawning a station wagon version called " Belina " , a second - generation " Corcel II " , a luxury version called " Del Rey " and a light pick - up version called " Pampa " .
In the early eighties , almost the entire production of Ford Brazil 's automobile division was comprised of Corcel - related vehicles .
DEBUNKED !
Ford 's Pinto did n't do well in Brazil .
Pinto is Brazilian slang for " male genitals " .
Ford renamed the car the Corcel , which means horse or steed .
Note 1 : If it were my translation marketing department I would have renamed the car " Dear God , I hope my gas tank does n't explode ! "
Note 2 : " Pinto " is reported all over the web , along with this story , as meaning " tiny male genitals " or a " man with small genitals " .
According to Luiz Pryzant , it just refers to " male genitals " .
SEPR Ersol 2004 - 1- 11 Bill
Leahy sends this gem : Saint - Gobain is a large French glass and ceramics company .
Their subsidiary , SEPR , invented a material used in the bottom of furnaces that melt glass .
The product was named " Ersol " which comes from " Electro Refractaire Sol " .
Sol is the French word for bottom ( of the furnace ) .
Electro Refractaire refers to it being refractory ( resists softening at high temperature ) and so is made by electrically melting it .
A sensible name , until they introduced the product into the United Kingdom .
Ersol sounds too close to arsehole !
However , when alerted to the language problem the company decided not to change it .
Combine the name with the product 's bottom position , and you can see why some product descriptions might read inappropriate to the British :
" contraction which occur during the solidification process must be carefully controlled , as it affects the homogeneity of the piece , the volume and location of the shrinkage cavity , and the residual stress . "
That said , I noted several companies named Ersol on the web .
Aussie Nads 2004 - 1-10 Boxes labeled Aussie Nads caught my attention in the local Walgreens .
In my limited vocabulary " Aussie " means Australian and " Nads " is colloquial for gonads , in particular testicles .
So my first thought was that the box contained the international version of " Rocky Mountain Oysters " or " Prairie Oysters " .
( Here are some testicle recipes . )
But I was n't in the food aisle .
My second thought was that these were replacement parts ...
After all , I get an e-mail every 15 minutes offering me either viagara or organ extensions , so it 's not such an unreasonable conclusion .
But the idea that some very macho Australians , no doubt from the Outback , decided they were man enough to sell one of their parts and still have enough left over to make out ok ( pun intended ) was implausible .
Closer inspection of the box reveals that Aussie Nads is a hair removal product .
Another well - named product is " Nad 's for Men " and do n't forget to order " Nad 's Wand " the " facial applicator wand " .
Seems like they are penetrating many new markets and so very soon they will be in a store barely a stone 's throw away from you .
Glen Thomas points out that there is a well - known greyhound named " nads " in Australia , frequently spurred on by the crowd yelling " Go Nads " .
Intimidate Dating Service 2004 - 1- 10 Israeli radio and press ran ads for the Intimidate Dating Service .
Now you might think that Intimidate tries to match up sadists with masochists .
However , Hagit Rozanes informs us that " Intimi " is the Hebrew word for intimate .
( Hmmm .
Better hope your date speaks Hebrew or you are in for a rough night ... )
Liebfraumilch Wine 2004 - 1-10
Several people wrote me about Germany 's most exported wine : Liebfraumilch .
" Lieb " means " dear " or " beloved " sometimes a reference to " God " or " holy " .
" Frau " is " woman " , and " Milch " is " milk " .
Hence " beloved woman 's milk " , also translated as " Milk of the Virgin " or " Milk of Our Lady " .
E-mails also offered translations of " women love milk " , and " loves woman milk " .
The name comes from its origins in about the 16th century in the vineyards of the Liebfrauenkirche ( " Church of Our Lady " ) in Worms , Germany .
( Worms Wine would also have been a Marketing Mistake ! )
( Read more in the Food Dictionary . )
It would probably be a Marketing Mistake for Liebfraumilch to produce a variation of the Got Milk ?
ads with paintings of a woman 's breast and the milk mustache on it , next to their wine bottle .
( Maybe pencil in a mustache in this El Greco ... )
Götzen 2004 - 1- 10
The european hardware store chain " Götzen " opened a mall in Istanbul .
" Göt " means " ass " in Turkish .
They changed the name to " Tekzen " .

Wang Cares 2004 -1-10
In the late ' 70s , the American computer company Wang was puzzled why its British branch refused to use its latest motto " Wang Cares " .
However , to British ears the motto sounds too close to " wankers " .
( masturbaters )
Thanks to Malcolm Howlett !
Opel Ascona 2004 - 1-10
General motors made a car named " Opel Ascona " .
This model sold poorly in Galicia , the northwestern region of Spain .
In the galician and also portuguese languages , the term is similar to the term for female genitalia .
Thanks to Anjo .
Inferno Undertaker 2004 - 1- 4
The 1990's saw the emergence of private - owned companies and the re-introduction of cremation in Estonia .
Kai Redone reports that during that period an undertaker in Tallinn , Estonia named itself Inferno , causing several raised eyebrows .
I did n't see the problem right away .
I thought inferno's meaning is " a very intense and uncontrolled fire " or conflagration .
However , although that is one sense for the word , inferno's major usage is " hell " , " purgatory " or " perdition " .
I can imagine the advertisement for Inferno :
" I am sorry about the loss of your loved one .
Where is the funeral , so I can say goodbye to him ? "
" He 's going to burn in the Inferno ! "
Mitsubishi Starion 2003 - 12-30 Andrew Harris of Australia writes : " Mitsubishi had a very successful small car called the Colt .
They brought out a slightly larger model , but right up to the last minute , could n't decide on a name for it .
The people here were in a last minute conference call to the Japanese execs trying to make a decision when the final word came through that ' Stallion ' would be a suitable ' horsey ' name to follow Colt .
Trouble was , the name was n't written , but spoken with a thick Japanese accent and the Aussie end were mystified , but duly wrote down ' Starion ' .
By the time the mistake was realised the badging and ads had been started and it was too late to stop it . "
It 's a great story and Snopes categorizes it as a definite maybe .
With so many car names on this page , you have to wonder if these marketing mistakes are n't intentional , owing to the theory that even bad press is allegedly good marketing ...
I like that Andrew 's version attributes the choice of the name to Mitsubishi's " Aussie " management .
Many of the reports I receive have a local or localized coloring .
The car is of course sold internationally and othe reports ( such as in Snopes ) attribute the problem due to American ( mis - ) management .
There is probably a U.K. version as well ...
Nintendo Donkey Kong 2003 - 12-30 Snopes ( and Nintendo ) refutes the notion that Nintendo Donkey Kong was originally to be known as Monkey Kong , or that either a smudged fax or a typographic error resulted in the product 's actual name .
Yamaha Electric Grand Keyboard 2003 - 12 -27 Yamaha had a mistranslation in their assembly instructions for their Electric Grand Keyboard , circa 1993 .
They should have written " screw " and ended up instead with instructions for the over - 21 crowd .
( And for consistency , it should have been called a Grand Organ ... )
Irish Mist Liqueur 2003 - 12 - 27
Bad translations using the word " Mist " in Germany keep coming my way .
( See Mist Stick and Silver Mist . )
D. Fleming reported that Irish Mist did n't do well in Germany either .
Other sources claimed it was marketed with the semi-Germanized Irischer Mist , which would translate back to English as Irish dung .
( Babelfish translated it kindly as " Irish muck " . )
( German Customs should just turn " Mist " products back at the border ! )
Toaplan Zero Wing
" All your base are belong to us " 2003 - 12 - 24 Toaplan was a video game maker that had a terrible , Japanese - to - English translation of the intro to their Zero Wing game , with great lines like : " Somebody set up us the bomb . "
Although the company went out of business , the translation and in particular the line " All your base are belong to us " became a phenomenon crossing from the net into popular culture .
Hey , if you are gonna blow it , blow it big !
A web search will find plenty of hilarious web pages featuring the line .
Here is a history page and an informative news item .
Traficante Mineral Water 2003 - 12 - 23 Traficante is an Italian brand of mineral water .
In Spanish , it means drug dealer .
Volkswagen Jetta 2003 - 12-20 Volkswagen named the sedan version of Golf the Jetta .
However , the letter " J " does n't exist in the Italian alphabet , so Jetta is pronounced " Ietta " , which means Misfortune ...
Thanks to Alberto Malin .
Omanko writes :
It 's true ... the letter J do n't exist in the Italian alphabet but it is in use a long time .
( e.g .
There is also an old city called Jesi and Italian names like Jacopo ... ) .
The word ietta do n't exist in Italian but Jella exists ( yes , you write it with the letter J ! ) and there are two or three words derived from this one , e.g. jettatore / iettatore ( evil - eyed man ) or jettatura / iettatura ( bad luck ) .
In neapolitan dialect Jetta means throw , throw away !!!
Jetta has good sales in Italy .
2003 -12-23 OK , I received a few confusing if not conflicting mails on this , so I spoke with New England 's Italian language translation expert , Laura Bergamini : ' The answer from Omanko is correct .
Jetta by itself does not mean anything , nor is it associated with " bad luck " as " jella " is .
It is part of words like " jettatore " .
' Additionally , ever since it was introduced , the car was marketed with the English pronunciation of " J " so it IS called " jay - tta " by the Italian audience . '
OK
The word Jetta is meaningless in Italian , and sales are good .
Score one for VW Marketing .
I would like to say case closed , but in fairness to Alberto and the others that wrote me that " Jettas were bad luck " , translationally speaking , there can be regional or dialectical differences , and so it may be more true in some Italian - speaking areas .
Also , as with all the entries here , I check for other sources before posting , and did find some other mentions of it .
So perhaps it is an urban legend or a case of " You say Jetta , I say Ietta " .
OK , More mail from Italy .
Francesco V. of Calabria writes that Jetta does mean " throw away " , not only in Neapolitan dialect , but in southern Italy .
Grazie Molto !
Hoover Zyklon , Umbro Zyklon , Siemens Zyklon 2003 - 12-20
Hoover , maker of vacuum cleaners , sells a model on the European market , including Germany , called the Zyklon .
Zyklon is the German word for Cyclone , so it is a seemingly sensible choice for a powerful vacuum .
However , Zyklon B is the lethal gas used by Nazis in concentration camps .
I would think that the name would draw protests , but I see German web sites currently selling the vacuums for less than 200 euro .
Perhaps , if readers are aware of either protests or reasons that it is not considered offensive , they will e-mail me .
Meanwhile , CNN.com reported on August 28 , 2002 , that British shoe maker Umbro received many protests for its running shoe the Zyklon .
Umbro apologized and renamed it .
Apparently , the shoe had been named the Zyklon since 1999 , but they had not written the name on the shoe until recently .
A week later , BBC News reported that Bosch Siemens Hausgeraete ( BSH ) was withdrawing its trademark application for the name Zyklon .
BSH had filed two applications with the US Patent & Trademark Office for " Zyklon " across a range of home products , including gas ovens .

Hong Kong Tourist Board 2003 - 12 - 20 According to TravelBiz.com.au in April , 2003 the Hong Kong Tourist Board tried to either pull their ads or have their slogan changed .
But it was too late to change the campaign that was on billboards throughout Hong Kong and in British versions of Cosmopolitan and Conde Nast Traveller .
The slogan that was running " Hong Kong :
It will take your breath away . " unfortunately coincided with the SARS epidemic that resulted in numerous deaths .
Shortness of breath is one of the main symptoms of SARS .
( OK , I know it is not a translation mistake , just bad timing , but it caught my attention anyway . )
Sharwoods 2003 -11-18 MediaGuardian.co.uk reports : Sharwoods £ 6 m campaign to launch its new Bundh sauces received calls immediately from numerous Punjabi speakers .
" bundh " sounds like the Punjai word for " arse " .
Sharwoods has no intention of changing it .
" We hope that once they understand the derivation of the Bundh sauce range and taste the delicious meals they can produce , they will agree that it is miles apart from the Punjabi word that is similar but spelled and pronounced differently ( with a long " u " ) . "
Thanks to Paul Kerins for this .
Peanut Chocolate Bars
Anyone know the name of the peanut - packed chocolate bar that lost out in the Japanese market because many Asians believe peanuts and chocolate cause nosebleeds ?
Both peanuts and chocolate ( actually caffeine ) cause allergic reactions .
I did n't find reports on the web of their causing nosebleeds specifically , but I did find pages where individuals are avoiding them to prevent nosebleeds .
Also , asian diets are very different from western diets and so tolerances differ .
General Motors Buick LaCrosse 2003 - 10 - 22 Reuters reports : General Motors Corp. will rename its Buick LaCrosse in Canada because the name for the car is slang for masturbation in Quebec , embarrassed officials with the U.S. automaker said on Thursday .
GM officials , who declined to be named , said it had been unaware that LaCrosse was a term for self - gratification among teenagers in French - speaking Quebec .
GM officials in Canada are working on a new name for the car ...
Pizza Hut P'Zone 2003 - 06 - 23 Pizza
Hut is advertising their new dish , a calzone they named the P'Zone .
It is pronounced like " pezón " , the Spanish word for " nipple " .
Susana says the Pizza Hut PR dept . in Texas told her they knew about this before launching the campaign .
Maybe we should n't file this under mistakes then , and instead put it under interesting marketing strategies !
Muchas gracias to Susana C. Schultz of Strictly Spanish for this report !
Honda Fitta / Jazz / Fit 2003-04-06
Car maker Honda introduced their new car " Fitta " in the Nordic countries during 2001 , only to find out that " fitta " is an old word , currently used in vulgar language to refer to a woman 's genitals in Swedish , Norwegian and Danish .
It was renamed to " Honda Jazz " for the Nordic market .
According to newspaper articles , Japanese ads said that " [ Fitta ] is small on the outside , but large on the inside " .
It 's now called the Honda Fit in Japanese markets .
My thanks to Peter Karlsson for this report !
SEGA 2003 -04-05
In Italy " sega " is the unofficial but most popular name for the act of male masturbation .
So , the popular videogame makers SEGA Enterprises , attempting to disassociate SEGA from sega , changed the pronunciation to " see - ga " in their ads , as if to educate Italians about proper English ( or Japanese ? ) pronunciation .
Many Italians are surprised to learn that SEGA is not pronounced see - ga , but say - ga , outside of Italy .
Also alleged , is that when the SEGA - sponsored Arsenal Gunners soccer team was to play the Italian Fiorentina team for the Championship ( circa 1999 ) , the Arsenals argued to play the game in the U.K .
Apparently , their away flag displays the sponsor prominently and it might inspire , er I mean offend the Italian TV audience .
American or Braniff Airlines
When American Airlines wanted to advertise its new leather first class seats in the Mexican market , it translated its " Fly In Leather " campaign literally , which meant " Fly Naked " ( " vuela en cuero " ) in Spanish !
Some reports say it was Braniff not American .
About Spanish Language ( part 2 ) says ' The idiom for " buck naked " is " en cueros " , not " en cuero " .
Even a beginning translator would realize that a word play such as " in leather " might not work in a literal translation . '
Interestingly , Castaways Travel of Spring , Texas thought flying naked was a good idea .

American Motors Matador
The Matador did not do well in Puerto Rico where " matador " has the connotation of " killer " .
( Bull - fighting was abolished on the island more than 100 years ago , when the U.S. took control of Puerto Rico . )
Bacardi Pavane / Pavian Popular story these days is that Bacardi marketed a drink called either Pavane , which sounds like Pavian , or it marketed a drink called Pavian .
The latter sounds plausible , if they wanted to go after the healthy , aristocratic , pure water drinkers , as it sounds like the brand " Evian " .
Either name would have given the fruity drink a French mystique .
The claim is the Bacardi drink does n't do well in Germany where " Der Pavian " means " the Baboon " auf Deutsch ...
Chevy Nova , Vauxhall Nova , Opel Corsa Updated 2004 -01 - 19
When General Motors introduced the Chevrolet ( aka Chevy ) Nova in South America , it was apparently unaware that " no va " means " it wo n't go " .
After the company figured out why it was n't selling any cars , it renamed the car in its Spanish markets to the Caribe .
This one is untrue .
For more background on this , see :
About Spanish Language ( part 1 ) ,

http://www.tafkac.org/products/chevy_nova_mexico.html, and
http://www.snopes.com/business/misxlate/nova.htm.
Steven Marzuola wrote me : " I grew up in Venezuela , and there were Novas all over the place .
I have also learned that it did rather well in Mexico .
It was not offered in many other countries , for a variety of reasons , but none of them having to do with the name . "
Steve Checkley informs me that in mainland Europe , the GM car known as the Vauxhall Nova in the United Kingdom , is known as the Opel Corsa .
This is true as I have confirmed it elsewhere .
The European Novas were launched in 1983 .
However , the American version ran from 1961 ( starting with the 1962 model ) through to 1979 .
The pictures that I have seen of the European Novas do n't look like the American Novas .
There may have been some similarities under the covers of course .
But I think the cars were different generations and probably only related by name .
Here is a history of the American Nova and a history of the Vauxhall Nova 1983 - 1993

Clairol Mist Stick Clairol introduced the " Mist Stick " , a curling iron , into German only to find out that " mist " is slang for manure .
Not too many people had use for the " manure stick " .
Actually , this is not quite right and confuses the curling iron story with the Rolls Royce Siver Mist example .
The German word “ Miststück ” ( pronounced similarly to Mist Stick ) is how you might call a woman a bitch or slut .
( And now you know what to get your ex-wife for Christmas ! )
Thanks to Peter Hofer for correcting this .
Coca -Cola Fresca
In Mexico , Fresca is a term for Lesbian .
Jokes abound , but sales were n't hurt .
( Despite what you read elsewhere on the web . )
There are many fruit drinks named Agua Fresca ( fresh water ) .
Coca - Cola , Ke- ke - ken - la , Ko-kou - ko-le
The name Coca - Cola in China was first rendered as Ke - ke - ken -la .
Unfortunately , the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been printed that the phrase means " bite the wax tadpole " or " female horse stuffed with wax " depending on the dialect .
Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic equivalent , " ko - kou - ko-le , " which can be loosely translated as " happiness in the mouth . "
For more background on Coke in China , see : Snopes.com or www.kekoukele.org/kekoukele.htm.
Colgate Cue Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue , the name of a notorious porno mag .
I have received several mails saying that they do n't know of a French magazine named Cue .
This story goes back to the early '90s so Cue might have existed and gone out of business since then .
Others have written that they do know of a magazine named Cul , which is pronounced like cue ( e.g. " kyu " ) .
Personally , I do n't give this story much credence .
However , from the mails I get , a lot of people are out searching for this magazine .
If anyone wants to join me in publishing a French porn magazine named Cue , there is a ready market for it !
Coors Coors put its slogan , " Turn it loose " into Spanish , where it was read as " Suffer from diarrhea " .
Electrolux Vacuum
The Scandinavian vacuum manufacturer Electrolux tried to sell its goods in America but did n't help itself with this slogan , " Nothing sucks like an Electrolux . "
Ford Comet , Ford Caliente Ford 's Comet , was called " Caliente " in Mexico .
" Caliente " literally means " hot " ( as in temperature ) , but colloquially it is also used for either " horny " or " prostitute " .
Ford Cortina Ford 's Cortina is translated as " jalopy " .
Ford Fiera Ford 's Fiera does n't do well with Spanish - speaking Latin- Americans , since " fiera " means " ugly old woman " .
Gerber Baby Food
When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa , they used the same packaging as in the US , with the beautiful Caucasian baby on the label .
Later they learned that in Africa , companies routinely put pictures on the label of what 's inside , since most people can't read .
Snopes dismisses the African baby food story as an example of " cultural prejudice " .
I am a big fan of Snopes , but in this case I am a little disappointed .
I do n't mind if the story is totally false and completely fabricated , but it would be nice if Snopes offered some evidence such as interviews with someone (s ) from Africa , or perhaps a statement from Gerber or other companies selling baby food in Africa , that they continue to market the product with baby pictures on the label .
Hmm .
OK I 'll write to Gerber and see if I can get a statement from them and post the result back here .
Hyundai Pony Richard Seamon reports : Hyundai had problems with the Hyundai Pony .
In Cockney rhyming slang , " Pony " is short for " pony and trap " , meaning crap .

Locum Locum is a Swedish company .
In 1991 , they sent Christmas cards to all of their customers .
They thought they would give their logo a little holiday spirit , by substituting a little heart for the letter " o " .
For some reason , they also used all lowercase letters .
The lowercase " L " can therefore be easily misunderstood to be an " i " , and the locum logo looked like one of those " I love ... " bumper stickers , with an unfortunate pornographic sentiment to it .
Thanks to Johan Inganni ( Sweden ) for this entry .
John Severinson writes on 2003 - 11 - 16 :
" Actually , it was a paper ad in the largest papers .
The image you 've got there is a scan from DN ( www.dn.se), one of them .
And , it was in 2001 .
Locum shortly afterwards claimed ' they had no idea the ad would send such a message but appreciates that the brand Locum is associated with love and caring ' . "
Mazda Laputa , Laputa : Castle in the Sky , Laputa ( 1819 ) Mazda 's Laputa seems like an odd name for a minivan .
The Mazda Laputa was introduced in Japan in 1991 .
Spanish speakers immediately think of " puta " , the word for prostitute .
With that in mind the ads claiming that " Laputa is designed to deliver maximum utility in a minimum space while providing a smooth , comfortable ride " and " a lightweight , impact - absorbing body " are humorous .
Distributors in Santiago , Chile asked Mazda to rename the vehicle .
Japanese speakers are likely unaware of this meaning and more likely associate " Laputa " with a popular 1986 animated film : " Laputa : Castle in the Sky " .
However , the film could not be marketed in either Spain or Italy because the word " Laputa " appears onscreen and would offend .
These are not the first uses of the word .
" Laputa " is referenced in Gulliver 's Travels , where author Jonathan Swift wrote that the astronomers of the island Laputa knew about the moons of Mars and European astronomers did not .
Meanwhile modern astronomers have named a real asteroid ( 1819 ) Laputa .
Of course , that leaves the question of who named the asteroid ...
Was it a fan of Swift 's fiction , one of the many that adores Hayao Miyazaki 's animated film , a minivan enthusiast , or someone that just had an interesting evening out ?
Inquiring minds want to know !

Mitsubishi Pajero , Montero Mitsubishi had to rename its Pajero automobile because the word is a vulgar term for a masturbating man .
This story is true , although there was no blunder involved because the car was marketed under a different name from the beginning .
In Spanish - speaking countries , this model has been sold as the Montero .
Nike Nike has a television commercial for hiking shoes that was shot in Kenya using Samburu tribesmen .
The camera closes in on the one tribesman who speaks , in native Maa .
As he speaks , the Nike slogan " Just do it " appears on the screen .
Lee Cronk , an anthropologist at the University of Cincinnati , says the Kenyan is really saying , " I do n't want these .
Give me big shoes . "
Says Nike 's Elizabeth Dolan , " We thought nobody in America would know what he said . "

Nike Air Nike offended Muslims in June , 1997 when the " flaming air " logo for its Nike Air sneakers looked too similar to the Arabic form of God 's name , " Allah " .
Nike pulled more than 38,000 pairs of sneakers from the market .
Nissan / Mitsubishi Pachero
For their series of landcruisers , Nissan Company invented an apparently meaningless word borrowed from the Spanish " pajaro " ( bird ) .
They named it " Pachero " .
This means wanker in South America .
Thanks to Arne Schäpers for this submission .
According to other sources , e.g. About Spanish Language ( part 2 ) it was Mitsubishi , and the company renamed the car to Montero before marketing it in Spanish - speaking countries in Latin America .
Nissan Moco Nissan 's minivan Moco does n't do so well in Spanish - speaking markets .
Especially green ones .
Distributors in Santiago , Chile asked that the vehicle be renamed since Moco is the Spanish word for mucous .

Orange Juice
To boost orange juice sales in predominantly continental breakfast eating England , a campaign extolled the drink 's eye - opening , pick - me - up qualities with the slogan , " Orange juice .
It gets your pecker up . "
Nicholas Shearer counters " ... it 's a perfectly good slogan and statement .
' keep your pecker up ' is a traditional positive get - up - and - go statement in Britain .
Unlike the U.S. ' pecker ' , it has no other connotations ( other than maybe a birds beak ) .
So the statement is perfect for the English market ... "
I concede , since I do n't want to start comparing peckers .
Call me chicken but I do n't want to have a cock fight over it .
Parker Pen , Parker Quink Ink When Parker Pen marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico , its ads were supposed to say " It wo n't leak in your pocket and embarrass you . "
However , the Spanish word " embarazar " was used by mistake to mean embarrass .
The ads actually said : " It wo n't leak in your pocket and make you pregnant . "
Recent versions of this story claim it was an ad for Parker 's Quink Ink .
Pepsi In Taiwan , the translation of the Pepsi slogan " Come alive with the Pepsi Generation " came out as " Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead . "
Pepsodent Teeth - Whitening Toothpaste vs. Betel Nut Chewers and Teeth - Blackening Pepsodent 's teeth - whitening toothpaste did n't fare well in Southeast Asia where many cultures value chewing Betel Nuts which darkens the teeth .
Chewing Betel Nuts is alleged to strengthen teeth ( it may have anti-bacterial qualities ) and is associated with various rituals and ceremonies ( depending on the particular culture and changing over time ) including the coming of age of women .
Many cultures historically blacken teeth since only savage beasts and evil demons show their white fangs .
( Why am I thinking of some marketing folks right now ... )
In Japan , in the 12th century , blackening was associated with coming of age .
Later in the 18th it was associated with nobility and Samurai .
In the 19th century , it was used by married woman .
( " I ca n't tonite honey , I have to blacken my teeth . " )

No , Powergenitalia is not the company responsible for all that spam offering to help you with organ extensions or to invigorate you with Viagara - powered vitality .
It is also not the Italian division of energy giant Powergen .
When numerous English - speakers on the web took note of the web site www.powergenitalia.com, Powergen felt obligated to announce that they had no connection with the site and in fact had no Italian offices , so that people would not think that it was their Translation Marketing Mistake .
No , they left that distinctive honor to the marketing folks at Powergen Italia , an Italian maker of battery chargers .
Perhaps they were shocked to learn its a World Wide Web .
The website now switches you over to the more aptly named for English - speakers , http://www.batterychargerpowergen.it.

Gore is n't quite as green as he's led the world to believe Correction :
In this column that appeared Aug. 10 on the Forum Page , writer Peter Schweizer inaccurately stated that former vice president Al Gore receives royalties from a zinc mine on his property in Tennessee despite his environmental advocacy .
He no longer does , as the mine was closed in 2003 .
Al Gore has spoken :
The world must embrace a " carbon - neutral lifestyle . "
To do otherwise , he says , will result in a cataclysmic catastrophe .
" Humanity is sitting on a ticking time bomb , " warns the website for his film , An Inconvenient Truth .
" We have just 10 years to avert a major catastrophe that could send our entire planet into a tailspin . "
ON DEADLINE : Your thoughts ?
Graciously , Gore tells consumers how to change their lives to curb their carbon - gobbling ways :
Switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs , use a clothesline , drive a hybrid , use renewable energy , dramatically cut back on consumption .
Better still , responsible global citizens can follow Gore 's example , because , as he readily points out in his speeches , he lives a " carbon - neutral lifestyle . "
But if Al Gore is the world 's role model for ecology , the planet is doomed .
For someone who says the sky is falling , he does very little .
He says he recycles and drives a hybrid .
And he claims he uses renewable energy credits to offset the pollution he produces when using a private jet to promote his film .
( In reality , Paramount Classics , the film 's distributor , pays this . )
Public records reveal that as Gore lectures Americans on excessive consumption , he and his wife Tipper live in two properties : a 10,000 - square - foot , 20 - room , eight - bathroom home in Nashville , and a 4,000 - square - foot home in Arlington , Va .
( He also has a third home in Carthage , Tenn . )
For someone rallying the planet to pursue a path of extreme personal sacrifice , Gore requires little from himself .
Then there is the troubling matter of his energy use .
In the Washington , D.C. , area , utility companies offer wind energy as an alternative to traditional energy .
In Nashville , similar programs exist .
Utility customers must simply pay a few extra pennies per kilowatt hour , and they can continue living their carbon - neutral lifestyles knowing that they are supporting wind energy .
Plenty of businesses and institutions have signed up .
Even the Bush administration is using green energy for some federal office buildings , as are thousands of area residents .
But according to public records , there is no evidence that Gore has signed up to use green energy in either of his large residences .
When contacted Wednesday , Gore 's office confirmed as much but said the Gores were looking into making the switch at both homes .
Talk about inconvenient truths .
Gore is not alone .
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean has said , " Global warming is happening , and it threatens our very existence . "
The DNC website applauds the fact that Gore has " tried to move people to act . "
Yet , astoundingly , Gore 's persuasive powers have failed to convince his own party :
The DNC has not signed up to pay an additional two pennies a kilowatt hour to go green .
For that matter , neither has the Republican National Committee .
Maybe our very existence is n't threatened .
Gore has held these apocalyptic views about the environment for some time .
So why , then , did n't Gore dump his family 's large stock holdings in Occidental ( Oxy ) Petroleum ?
As executor of his family 's trust , over the years Gore has controlled hundreds of thousands of dollars in Oxy stock .
Oxy has been mired in controversy over oil drilling in ecologically sensitive areas .
Living carbon - neutral apparently does n't mean living oil - stock free .
Nor does it necessarily mean giving up a mining royalty either .
Humanity might be " sitting on a ticking time bomb , " but Gore 's home in Carthage is sitting on a zinc mine .
Gore receives $ 20,000 a year in royalties from Pasminco Zinc , which operates a zinc concession on his property .
Tennessee has cited the company for adding large quantities of barium , iron and zinc to the nearby Caney Fork River .
The issue here is not simply Gore 's hypocrisy ; it 's a question of credibility .
If he genuinely believes the apocalyptic vision he has put forth and calls for radical changes in the way other people live , why has n't he made any radical change in his life ?
Giving up the zinc mine or one of his homes is not asking much , given that he wants the rest of us to radically change our lives .

Tal Afar
From the Department of Defense : Commander Describes Routing Foreign Fighters From Tal Afar .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 16 , 2005 --
The commander of coalition troops in Iraq today described " an extremely successful tactical operation " in which U.S. and Iraqi troops all but cleared Tal Afar , Iraq , of foreign fighters .
Tal Afar is one of two major transit zones for foreign fighters coming into Iraq , Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , commander of Multinational Force Iraq , said from Baghdad today .
The other route is through the Euphrates River Valley , farther south .
U.S. troops from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and Iraqi forces from the 3rd Iraqi Army Division have been working for two months to plan and prepare for an operation to " restore Iraqi control to Tal Afar , " Casey said .
Since Sept. 10 , this combined force has been engaged in an operation to clear a roughly 600 - by - 800 - meter section in the center of Tal Afar that foreign fighters had set up as a sanctuary .
The combined force killed about 150 insurgents and captured roughly 350 more .
Casey said officials estimate this accounted for about 75 percent to 80 percent of the foreign fighters and other insurgents they believed were in the city .
" It looked like a pretty tough fight , " he said .
Strong support from the Iraqi government made the soldiers ' mission significantly easier , Casey said .
In the days leading up to the military assault , Iraqi government representatives spent time in Tal Afar and brokered an agreement with local leaders from all local ethnic groups : Shiia , Sunni and Turkoman .
" The other piece of this that sometimes gets lost is the Iraqi government was very much involved in setting the conditions for success , " he said .
Casey explained that local sheiks signed statements saying basically : " We 've had enough .
We ask for the military to come in and clean the terrorists and foreign fighters out of Tal Afar . "
This led to support for the mission from the city 's civilian population .
" That had a huge impact on what we had to deal with with respect to the population of that city , " Casey said .
About 20,000 civilians left Tal Afar before the fighting began .
The Iraqi and coalition force was prepared with humanitarian assistance , but many of those who fled went to stay with friends or relatives elsewhere , Casey said .
The Iraqi government also provided $ 50 million to compensate civilians whose property was damaged and to fund rebuilding damaged areas .
The mission was intended to allow Iraqi civilians to participate in the upcoming constitutional referendum Oct. 15 .
Military photos from the operations in Tal Afar here , here , here , here , and here .
From Strategy Page : Why It 's Getting Harder to be a Bad Guy .
The U.S. / Iraqi offensive in Tal Afar has been more effective than anticipated , and terrorists are abandoning the area .
It is unclear as to whether the dispersal of terrorist forces , who seem mostly to be local Sunni Arab tribal fighters and al Qaeda " Foreigners " , is a planned response in the event of defeat or a spontaneous development .
Whichever the case , the insurgents have abandoned large stocks of arms as well as some important infrastructure , including bomb factories and underground installations .
The damage to al Qaeda was serious enough to elicit a public announcement from the terrorist organization , where it announced a new wave of suicide bombings , as revenge for the success of the Tal Afar , and related , operations .
Apparently it was a case of " use it or lose it , " with al Qaeda fearing that the continuing operations along the Syrian border and in western Iraq , would lead to more bomb workshops , and completed car bombs , being captured .
UPDATE I -- Sept. 21 : In today 's Wall Street Journal , Iraqi President Jalal Talabani addresses the foreign fighter issue among others : We Need American Troops .
American forces are in Iraq at the invitation of the democratically elected government of Iraq , and with the backing of a United Nations Security Council resolution .
Your soldiers are in my country because of your commitment to democracy .
Moreover , during my visit to Washington , Mr. Bush reaffirmed the United States ' complete support for the Iraqi political process toward sustainable democracy , and for the fight to defeat fascist and jihadist terrorism in Iraq .
...
Above all , American forces provide Iraq with a much - needed deterrence capability .
In the past , Iraq sought an illusory security through the follies of aggression , terrorism and weapons of mass destruction .
Today , our external security comes from our alliance with the United States .
Our neighbors can thereby be assured that we will settle all of our differences with them peacefully .
Sadly , some of our neighbors have chosen not to understand this .
They seem either unwilling or unable to shut off the pipeline of terrorists crossing into Iraq .
And in addition to what is at least passive support for the terrorists , some of them are providing financial and material support to them , too .
They must desist from this behavior now .
While the problem of some of our neighbors supporting terrorism is bad enough , we can only imagine what our neighbors might have done if American troops had not been present .
Most likely , Iraq would have been transformed into a regional battlefield with disastrous consequences for Middle Eastern and global security .
Despite the fact that Bush has , unfortunately , often defined the Iraq war in altruistic terms , it should not be Iraq 's need that fundamentally determines whether or not our troops are there .
After all , many countries " need " our troops for various reasons , but that does n't mean we should send them .
Our troops should be used only to protect America 's national security interests , and the only basic reason for staying in Iraq should be to fight America 's enemies , in this case , Islamic and Baathist terrorists and their state sponsors , two of which border Iraq .
It remains to be seen how we will deal with Iran and Syria .
But considering that both countries are fighting a proxy war with the U.S. in Iraq , I do n't see how settling " our differences with them peacefully , " as Talabani assures them , can even be an option .
Whether Iraq itself becomes a " sustainable democracy " or a theocracy is another problem altogether .

Swords were handed in and destroyed during a knife amnesty
Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson announced laws to ban swords unless sold for legitimate reasons .
Shops selling swords will need a licence , as will businesses dealing with non-domestic knives and other bladed weapons such as machetes .
The measures are the latest steps from the Scottish Executive to curb the problem of knife crime .
They come weeks after a nationwide knife amnesty .
A total of 12,645 blades - including lock knives , machetes , swords , meat cleavers , bayonets and axes - were handed in during the five - week amnesty .
People must realise that swords cause horrific injuries when they get into the wrong hands
Det Chief Supt John Carnochan
Violence Reduction Unit
Exemptions to the ban on sword sales include swords that are to be used for Highland dancing , museum displays , historical re-enactments , fencing and martial arts .
Ms Jamieson said : " Knife - carrying is all too prevalent in some communities , particularly in the west of Scotland , and has cut short and scarred too many young lives .
" In these areas police , doctors and law - abiding citizens have seen the damaging effects of swords , including samurai swords , being wielded on the streets .
" It is simply far too easy at present for these weapons to be bought and sold . "
Anyone selling swords under the exemptions would have to take " reasonable steps " to establish that the intended use was a legitimate one .
Commercial sellers will have to comply with strict new licensing conditions , including keeping records of all sales .
' Deep - rooted culture '
Ms Jamieson added : " The licensing regime for sales of all non-domestic knives should help weed out unscrupulous traders and help legitimate traders take steps to avoid these dangerous weapons falling into the wrong hands . "
Shops selling swords under exemption would need a licence
The measures will be included in a new Sentencing Bill , which will go before the Scottish Parliament later in the year .
It comes after First Minister Jack McConnell announced a five - point plan to tackle knife crime in November 2004 .
Other parts of the plan brought in under the Police , Public Order and Criminal Justice ( Scotland )
Act doubled the maximum penalty for carrying a knife to four years , gave police the unconditional power to search someone they suspect of carrying a weapon and increased the minimum age for buying a knife from 16 to 18 .
Det Ch Supt John Carnochan , head of the police 's violence reduction unit , hailed the measures as " another major step forward in the fight against knife crime and violence " .
More than half the murders in Scotland each year are carried out with knives or other sharp weapons .
Det Ch Supt Carnochan said a licensing scheme alone would not solve " the deep - rooted culture of violence which is prevalent in parts of Scotland " but added that combined with the other measures it would have a positive impact .
Cultural problem
He added : " People must realise that swords cause horrific injuries when they get into the wrong hands .
We routinely see incidents involving swords , which result in appalling injuries . "
Kenny MacAskill MSP , justice spokesman for the SNP , said : " We must continue to recognise that knives are as much of a cultural problem in our communities as they are a criminal one .
" We must ensure we tackle the causes as well as the symptoms of this scar on our communities . "
Margaret Mitchell , justice spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservatives , said : " I broadly welcome these moves but legislation alone is never going to be enough .
" We have to make sure that anyone who would use any kind of knife or weapon feels the full force of the law and the strongest possible custodial sentence . "

Everyone is born with an empty wallet and no skill .
Yet some go on to acquire means and expertise .
How likely is that ?
Your prospects for a quick financial windfall are not good .
Accounting fraudonce a popular approach to fast cash has fallen on hard times as escalating legal costs and prison sentences erode its benefits .
Inheritance has never been reliable :
There are far fewer wealthy relatives than willing heirs , and the ones that exist have a selfish fixation on their own longevity .
Powerball is a sucker 's game .
Imagine a string stretched from Owatonna , MN to Orlando , FL .
A one - inch segment represents your odds of hitting the jackpot ; the remainder , your odds of continuing your present lifestyle .
If your chance of instant riches is minuscule , your chance of instant expertise is zero : Nobody acquires skill in a day .
Still , for those who persist , the long - term prospects are good .
Both money and knowledge can compound over time .
To understand the compounding of money , consider a " five - dollar " experiment .
Each week put five bucks in a cookie jar .
Once a year , pull out $ 260 and invest it at 8.5 % ( a reasonable market return over the long haul ) .
Do this year after year .
You 'll need a dozen years to build up your first $ 5000  that 's quite a while but you 'll need only six additional years to accumulate your next $ 5000 .
You 'll have your third $ 5000 in another four years , and your fourth $ 5000 in just three more .
In the early stages of compounding , gains are meager .
Significant gains do n't occur until later .
But once they appear , they start to snowball .
How about becoming an expert ?
Within their areas of competence , experts have many more categories of awareness than novices .
The perception of subtleties is what Michael Jordan , Warren Buffett , and Yo - Yo Ma have in common .
Not only have experts gathered many " elemental " facts about their field ; they have linked them to one another to produce a vast array of " relational " facts .
In simplest terms , a relational fact is the knowledge gained when you combine two elemental facts .
To picture this , draw two dots and connect them with a line .
The dots represent elemental facts ; the line , a relational fact .
Add new dots , connecting each to all the others .
With three dots , you 'll have three connecting lines .
With four dots , six lines .
With five dots , ten ; etc .
Every new dot compounds the number of connecting lines .
Likewise , every new piece of information compounds the pool of available relationships .
With a knowledge base of one hundred elemental facts , you have at your disposal about 5000 potential connections .
Double your knowledge base and you will increase the potential connections to nearly 20,000 .
Learn a thousand things and the potential connections approach half a million .
It is these latent relationships that the mind processes in its search for insight .
The processing is autonomous and subliminal , but you can encourage it .
Each day use your powers of observation and reasoning to learn some new thing about your field .
Reflect on its connection to what you already know .
Reflection compounds knowledge .
With a sufficient knowledge base , you can start to build a portfolio of noteworthy work problems solved , know - how acquired and applied .
To the extent that your growing portfolio is valued by others , your income is likely to increase .
This , in turn , can accelerate the growth of your financial base .
The power of dollars and of facts is collective , not individual .
Before either can generate really large returns they must reach a critical mass .
Mass grows as the accumulating returns on your past efforts are enhanced by the on - going contributions of your new efforts in short , as you persist .
There is no persistence without discipline .
But self - coercion is fools ' discipline .
A devitalizing force at heart , it will eventually burn you out .
Far better are the attractive forces of love , desire , and fascination .
These are rejuvenating ; their objects , energizing .
The wise recognize this and harness them to travel to the City of Good Luck .

Feature : Special Report Why Did the World Trade Center Collapse ?
Science , Engineering , and Speculation
Editor ’s Note : For a more complete .
updated analysis of the World Trade Center towers collapse , read “ The Role of Metallurgy in the NIST Investigation of the World Trade Center Towers Collapse ” in the December 2007 issue .
INTRODUCTION
The collapse of the World Trade Center ( WTC ) towers on September 11 , 2001 , was as sudden as it was dramatic ; the complete destruction of such massive buildings shocked nearly everyone .
Immediately afterward and even today , there is widespread speculation that the buildings were structurally deficient , that the steel columns melted , or that the fire suppression equipment failed to operate .
In order to separate the fact from the fiction , we have attempted to quantify various details of the collapse .
The major events include the following :
The airplane impact with damage to the columns .
The ensuing fire with loss of steel strength and distortion ( Figure 1 ) .
The collapse , which generally occurred inward without significant tipping ( Figure 2 ) .
Each will be discussed separately , but initially it is useful to review the overall design of the towers .
THE DESIGN
The towers were designed and built in the mid-1960s through the early 1970s .
They represented a new approach to skyscrapers in that they were to be very lightweight and involved modular construction methods in order to accelerate the schedule and to reduce the costs .
To a structural engineer , a skyscraper is modeled as a large cantilever vertical column .
Each tower was 64 m square , standing 411 m above street level and 21 m below grade .
This produces a height - to - width ratio of 6.8 .
The total weight of the structure was roughly 500,000 t , but wind load , rather than the gravity load , dominated the design .
The building is a huge sail that must resist a 225 km/h hurricane .
It was designed to resist a wind load of 2 kPaa total of lateral load of 5,000 t.
In order to make each tower capable of withstanding this wind load , the architects selected a lightweight perimeter tube design consisting of 244 exterior columns of 36 cm square steel box section on 100 cm centers ( see Figure 3 ) .
This permitted windows more than one - half meter wide .
Inside this outer tube there was a 27 m × 40 m core , which was designed to support the weight of the tower .
It also housed the elevators , the stairwells , and the mechanical risers and utilities .
Web joists 80 cm tall connected the core to the perimeter at each story .
Concrete slabs were poured over these joists to form the floors .
In essence , the building is an egg - crate construction that is about 95 percent air , explaining why the rubble after the collapse was only a few stories high .
Figure 1 . Flames and debris exploded from the World Trade Center south tower immediately after the airplanes impact .
The black smoke indicates a fuel - rich fire ( Getty Images ) .
Figure 2 .
As the heat of the fire intensified , the joints on the most severely burned floors gave way , causing the perimeter wall columns to bow outward and the floors above them to fall .
The buildings collapsed within ten seconds , hitting bottom with an estimated speed of 200 km/h ( Getty Images ) .
The egg - crate construction made a redundant structure ( i.e. , if one or two columns were lost , the loads would shift into adjacent columns and the building would remain standing ) .
Prior to the World Trade Center with its lightweight perimeter tube design , most tall buildings contained huge columns on 5 m centers and contained massive amounts of masonry carrying some of the structural load .
The WTC was primarily a lightweight steel structure ; however , its 244 perimeter columns made it one of the most redundant and one of the most resilient skyscrapers .
1
THE AIRLINE IMPACT
The early news reports noted how well the towers withstood the initial impact of the aircraft ; however , when one recognizes that the buildings had more than 1,000 times the mass of the aircraft and had been designed to resist steady wind loads of 30 times the weight of the aircraft , this ability to withstand the initial impact is hardly surprising .
Furthermore , since there was no significant wind on September 11 , the outer perimeter columns were only stressed before the impact to around 1/3 of their 200 MPa design allowable .
The only individual metal component of the aircraft that is comparable in strength to the box perimeter columns of the WTC is the keel beam at the bottom of the aircraft fuselage .
While the aircraft impact undoubtedly destroyed several columns in the WTC perimeter wall , the number of columns lost on the initial impact was not large and the loads were shifted to remaining columns in this highly redundant structure .
Of equal or even greater significance during this initial impact was the explosion when 90,000 L gallons of jet fuel , comprising nearly 1/3 of the aircrafts weight , ignited .
The ensuing fire was clearly the principal cause of the collapse ( Figure 4 ) .
THE FIRE
The fire is the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse .
Even today , the media report ( and many scientists believe ) that the steel melted .
It is argued that the jet fuel burns very hot , especially with so much fuel present .
This is not true .
Part of the problem is that people ( including engineers ) often confuse temperature and heat .
While they are related , they are not the same .
Thermodynamically , the heat contained in a material is related to the temperature through the heat capacity and the density ( or mass ) .
Temperature is defined as an intensive property , meaning that it does not vary with the quantity of material , while the heat is an extensive property , which does vary with the amount of material .
One way to distinguish the two is to note that if a second log is added to the fireplace , the temperature does not double ; it stays roughly the same , but the size of the fire or the length of time the fire burns , or a combination of the two , doubles .
Thus , the fact that there were 90,000 L of jet fuel on a few floors of the WTC does not mean that this was an unusually hot fire .
The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual , and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel .
In combustion science , there are three basic types of flames , namely , a jet burner , a pre-mixed flame , and a diffuse flame .
A jet burner generally involves mixing the fuel and the oxidant in nearly stoichiometric proportions and igniting the mixture in a constant - volume chamber .
Since the combustion products cannot expand in the constant - volume chamber , they exit the chamber as a very high velocity , fully combusted , jet .
This is what occurs in a jet engine , and this is the flame type that generates the most intense heat .
In a pre-mixed flame , the same nearly stoichiometric mixture is ignited as it exits a nozzle , under constant pressure conditions .
It does not attain the flame velocities of a jet burner .
An oxyacetylene torch or a Bunsen burner is a pre-mixed flame .
In a diffuse flame , the fuel and the oxidant are not mixed before ignition , but flow together in an uncontrolled manner and combust when the fuel / oxidant ratios reach values within the flammable range .
A fireplace flame is a diffuse flame burning in air , as was the WTC fire .
Diffuse flames generate the lowest heat intensities of the three flame types .
If the fuel and the oxidant start at ambient temperature , a maximum flame temperature can be defined .
For carbon burning in pure oxygen , the maximum is 3,200 °C ; for hydrogen it is 2,750°C .
Thus , for virtually any hydrocarbons , the maximum flame temperature , starting at ambient temperature and using pure oxygen , is approximately 3,000°C .
This maximum flame temperature is reduced by two - thirds if air is used rather than pure oxygen .
The reason is that every molecule of oxygen releases the heat of formation of a molecule of carbon monoxide and a molecule of water .
If pure oxygen is used , this heat only needs to heat two molecules ( carbon monoxide and water ) , while with air , these two molecules must be heated plus four molecules of nitrogen .
Thus , burning hydrocarbons in air produces only one - third the temperature increase as burning in pure oxygen because three times as many molecules must be heated when air is used .
The maximum flame temperature increase for burning hydrocarbons ( jet fuel ) in air is , thus , about 1,000 °Chardly sufficient to melt steel at 1,500°C .

Figure 4 . A graphic illustration , from the USA Today newspaper web site , of the World Trade Center points of impact .
Click on the image above to access the actual USA Today feature .
But it is very difficult to reach this maximum temperature with a diffuse flame .
There is nothing to ensure that the fuel and air in a diffuse flame are mixed in the best ratio .
Typically , diffuse flames are fuel rich , meaning that the excess fuel molecules , which are unburned , must also be heated .
It is known that most diffuse fires are fuel rich because blowing on a campfire or using a blacksmiths bellows increases the rate of combustion by adding more oxygen .
This fuel - rich diffuse flame can drop the temperature by up to a factor of two again .
This is why the temperatures in a residential fire are usually in the 500 °C to 650 °C range .
2,3
It is known that the WTC fire was a fuel - rich , diffuse flame as evidenced by the copious black smoke .
Soot is generated by incompletely burned fuel ; hence , the WTC fire was fuel richhardly surprising with 90,000 L of jet fuel available .
Factors such as flame volume and quantity of soot decrease the radiative heat loss in the fire , moving the temperature closer to the maximum of 1,000°C .
However , it is highly unlikely that the steel at the WTC experienced temperatures above the 750 800 °C range .
All reports that the steel melted at 1,500 °C are using imprecise terminology at best .
Some reports suggest that the aluminum from the aircraft ignited , creating very high temperatures .
While it is possible to ignite aluminum under special conditions , such conditions are not commonly attained in a hydrocarbon - based diffuse flame .
In addition , the flame would be white hot , like a giant sparkler .
There was no evidence of such aluminum ignition , which would have been visible even through the dense soot .
It is known that structural steel begins to soften around 425 °C and loses about half of its strength at 650°C .
4
This is why steel is stress relieved in this temperature range .
But even a 50 % loss of strength is still insufficient , by itself , to explain the WTC collapse .
It was noted above that the wind load controlled the design allowables .
The WTC , on this low - wind day , was likely not stressed more than a third of the design allowable , which is roughly one - fifth of the yield strength of the steel .
Even with its strength halved , the steel could still support two to three times the stresses imposed by a 650 °C fire .
The additional problem was distortion of the steel in the fire .
The temperature of the fire was not uniform everywhere , and the temperature on the outside of the box columns was clearly lower than on the side facing the fire .
The temperature along the 18 m long joists was certainly not uniform .
Given the thermal expansion of steel , a 150 °C temperature difference from one location to another will produce yield - level residual stresses .
This produced distortions in the slender structural steel , which resulted in buckling failures .
Thus , the failure of the steel was due to two factors : loss of strength due to the temperature of the fire , and loss of structural integrity due to distortion of the steel from the non-uniform temperatures in the fire .
THE COLLAPSE
Nearly every large building has a redundant design that allows for loss of one primary structural member , such as a column .
However , when multiple members fail , the shifting loads eventually overstress the adjacent members and the collapse occurs like a row of dominoes falling down .
The perimeter tube design of the WTC was highly redundant .
It survived the loss of several exterior columns due to aircraft impact , but the ensuing fire led to other steel failures .
Many structural engineers believe that the weak points the limiting factors on design allowables were the angle clips that held the floor joists between the columns on the perimeter wall and the core structure ( see Figure 5 ) .
With a 700 Pa floor design allowable , each floor should have been able to support approximately 1,300 t beyond its own weight .
The total weight of each tower was about 500,000 t.
As the joists on one or two of the most heavily burned floors gave way and the outer box columns began to bow outward , the floors above them also fell .
The floor below ( with its 1,300 t design capacity ) could not support the roughly 45,000 t of ten floors ( or more ) above crashing down on these angle clips .
This started the domino effect that caused the buildings to collapse within ten seconds , hitting bottom with an estimated speed of 200 km per hour .
If it had been free fall , with no restraint , the collapse would have only taken eight seconds and would have impacted at 300 km /h .
1
It has been suggested that it was fortunate that the WTC did not tip over onto other buildings surrounding the area .
There are several points that should be made .
First , the building is not solid ; it is 95 percent air and , hence , can implode onto itself .
Second , there is no lateral load , even the impact of a speeding aircraft , which is sufficient to move the center of gravity one hundred feet to the side such that it is not within the base footprint of the structure .
Third , given the near free - fall collapse , there was insufficient time for portions to attain significant lateral velocity .
To summarize all of these points , a 500,000 t structure has too much inertia to fall in any direction other than nearly straight down .

WAS THE WTC DEFECTIVELY DESIGNED ?
The World Trade Center was not defectively designed .
No designer of the WTC anticipated , nor should have anticipated , a 90,000 L Molotov cocktail on one of the building floors .
Skyscrapers are designed to support themselves for three hours in a fire even if the sprinkler system fails to operate .
This time should be long enough to evacuate the occupants .
The WTC towers lasted for one to two hoursless than the design life , but only because the fire fuel load was so large .
No normal office fires would fill 4,000 square meters of floor space in the seconds in which the WTC fire developed .
Usually , the fire would take up to an hour to spread so uniformly across the width and breadth of the building .
This was a very large and rapidly progressing fire ( very high heat but not unusually high temperature ) .
Further information about the design of the WTC can be found on the World Wide Web . 58
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE
The clean - up of the World Trade Center will take many months .
After all , 1,000,000 t of rubble will require 20,000 to 30,000 truckloads to haul away the material .
The asbestos fire insulation makes the task hazardous for those working nearby .
Interestingly , the approximately 300,000 t of steel is fully recyclable and represents only one days production of the U.S. steel industry .
Separation of the stone and concrete is a common matter for modern steel shredders .
The land - filling of 700,000 t of concrete and stone rubble is more problematic .
However , the volume is equivalent to six football fields , 69 m deep , so it is manageable .
There will undoubtedly be a number of changes in the building codes as a result of the WTC catastrophe .
For example , emergency communication systems need to be upgraded to speed up the notice for evacuation and the safest paths of egress .
Emergency illumination systems , separate from the normal building lighting , are already on the drawing boards as a result of lessons learned from the WTC bombing in 1993 .
There will certainly be better fire protection of structural members .
Protection from smoke inhalation , energy - absorbing materials , and redundant means of egress will all be considered .
A basic engineering assessment of the design of the World Trade Center dispels many of the myths about its collapse .
First , the perimeter tube design of the towers protected them from failing upon impact .
The outer columns were engineered to stiffen the towers in heavy wind , and they protected the inner core , which held the gravity load .
Removal of some of the outer columns alone could not bring the building down .
Furthermore , because of the stiffness of the perimeter design , it was impossible for the aircraft impact to topple the building .
However , the building was not able to withstand the intense heat of the jet fuel fire .
While it was impossible for the fuel - rich , diffuse - flame fire to burn at a temperature high enough to melt the steel , its quick ignition and intense heat caused the steel to lose at least half its strength and to deform , causing buckling or crippling .
This weakening and deformation caused a few floors to fall , while the weight of the stories above them crushed the floors below , initiating a domino collapse .
It would be impractical to design buildings to withstand the fuel load induced by a burning commercial airliner .
Instead of saving the building , engineers and officials should focus on saving the lives of those inside by designing better safety and evacuation systems .
As scientists and engineers , we must not succumb to speculative thinking when a tragedy such as this occurs .
Quantitative reasoning can help sort fact from fiction , and can help us learn from this unfortunate disaster .
As Lord Kelvin said ,
 I often say . . . that when you can measure what you are speaking about , and express it in numbers , you know something about it ; but when you cannot measure it , when you cannot express it in numbers , your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind ; it may be the beginning of knowledge , but you have scarcely , in your thoughts , advanced to the stage of science , whatever the matter may be . 
We will move forward from the WTC tragedy and we will engineer better and safer buildings in the future based , in part , on the lessons learned at the WTC .
The reason the WTC collapse stirs our emotions so deeply is because it was an intentional attack on innocent people .
It is easier to accept natural or unintentional tragedies ; it is the intentional loss of life that makes us fear that some people have lost their humanity .

Last weekend ( Friday and Saturday ) , I attended RubyNation 2008 , the first regional Ruby conference in my area .
The speakers were excellent and it was great to meet up with folks from the Ruby community who I have n’t seen in awhile .
As always , I left feeling energized and excited about my Ruby projects .
There were two main themes of the conference : the ‘ official ’ one was Ceremony vs. Essence , while the ‘ unofficial ’ one was Test all the fucking time .
The first theme was the subject of the opening and closing keynotes .
The second came from Bryan Liles lighting talk on the first day and kept coming up afterwards ( audience ‘ hecklers ’ would ask presenters how often they should test ) .
Agenda
Welcome to RubyNation Gray Herter Opening Keynote : Ceremony vs. Essence Neal Ford DSLs and Ruby : Blurring the Lines Between Programs And Data Russ Olsen The Culture of Innovation in Ruby Glenn Vanderburg Living on the Edge Yehuda Katz Lightning Talks Chris Bucherre , Bryan Liles Archaeopteryx : A Ruby MIDI Generator Giles Bowkett Welcome , Day 2 David Keener Keynote : Ruby , A Retrospective Rich Kilmer Ruby Puzzlers Mike Furr Pratical JRuby David Keener Tools for Your Ruby Toolbox Dave Bock Lightning Talks Soren Burkhart , Glenn West , Jesse Shock , Yehuda Katz , Bryan Liles Closing Keynote : Bad Ruby Stuart Halloway
Neal Ford ’s talk on Ceremony vs Essence was one of the best talks of the conference and a great way to kick it off .
He criticized our industry for failing to look backwards and leveraging the lore of the past .
Then he proceeded to look even further back discussing Plato ’s doctrine of ideas , Aristotle ’s essential properties vs accidental properties , Galileo ’s use of experimentation to verify ideas , and William Occam ’s principle that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible ( KISS ) .
Do n’t confuse essential complexity ( we have a hard problem to solve ) vs accidental complexity ( we ’ve made the problem hard to solve ) .
Some of the new patterns he presented were :
Chicken Cognition : no memory , ca n’t learn from your mistakes
Frozen Caveman : burned by something and was flash frozen at that point in time , everything revolves around that issue
Rubik ’s Cubicle : love to solve puzzles , not real issues
During his keynote , Neal suggested learning from the lore of our past by reading classics like The Mythical Man-Month : Essays on Software Engineering , Anniversary Edition ( 2nd Edition ) , Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns , The Pragmatic Programmer : From Journeyman to Master .
Next up was Russ Olsen who gave a talk about DSLs , both external and internal .
Domain specific languages continue to be a hot topic in Ruby and the developer community in general .
Ruby is very well suited to both external DSLs ( involving a parser ) and internal DSLs ( use the Ruby parser and build language infrastructure ) .
Ruby is great for DSLs because it does n’t require parenthesis or semi-colons , it supports procs , the reflection capabilities ( method_missing , instance_eval , etc ) , etc. Rich Kilmer called DSL building , syntax driven development .
Glenn Vanderburg presented on the culture of innovation within the Ruby community .
The Ruby community is seeing so much innovation because Rubyists are novelty junkies , the languages opens possibilities that deserve to be explored , the requirement to integrate with IDEs is hampering innovation in Java ( Java developers wo n’t use it until it ’s integrated within their IDE ) , and things are just easier to accomplish in Ruby ( low ceremony ) .
He said that sometimes its good to start over as being forced to reinvent can be an opportunity .
To close out his talk he did have a warning :
When learning new things costs are easier to spot than benefits , but when inventing new things benefits are easier to spot than costs .
Yehuda Katz from Engine Yard spoke about living on the edge .
As an aside , it appears that Engine Yard is trying to be a mini-Google in that they appear to have hired many of the top Rubyists as well as some very savvy operations folks .
Yehuda said that we should expect Merb 1.0 by the end of summer , introduced the DataMapper ORM , YARD ( a replacement for rdoc ) , and Johnson ( a JavaScript / Ruby bridge ) .
He urged those present to take the time to think things through and not rush an API ( or software ) out .
During the Lightning Talks we heard from Chris Bucchere about BDG ’s social network for conferences ; David James of Community Goals about state machines , Simon Kaczar of Prognosoft about libncurses - ruby , and Bryan Liles about testing ( where the meme test all the fucking time appeared ) .
Bryan ’s was one of the best talks of the conference , I highly recommend seeing him present .
The first day closed with Giles Bowkett ’s presentation on Archaeopteryx ( a Ruby MIDI generator ) .
The music it generated ( through Reason ) was pretty good .
The software makes heavy use of lambda functions and so Giles has aliased lambda to L to reduce typing .
His talk covered a wide range of topics and there ’s no way I can do it justice .
Hopefully he ’ll have it recorded ( since he ’s given the presentation a few times now ) and post it on the ‘ net .
The second day opened with Rich Kilmer of InfoEther who provided a look back at the early days of Ruby ( from his involvement in 2001 ) , the conferences , and all of the various projects he ’s worked on with Ruby .
Rich always has fun stories to tell and I enjoyed his talk immensely .
I wo n’t go through the entire chronology , but he ended by stating that the community needs to develop tools to deal with the dynamic nature of Ruby in order for wider adoption of the language , though he did note that Ruby is becoming mainstream .
He also announced HotCocoa , a DSL for Cocoa application development .
Mike Furr spoke about issues he encountered when writing a Ruby parser for his DRuby project .
These were somewhat interesting traps , pitfals , and corner cases for where the language is ambiguous .
His slides are available here so you can see specific code examples .
David Keener walked through installing , configuring and running JRuby .
Unfortunately , I have no interest in JRuby .
I started working with it at my previous job to add Ruby scripting to a Java application , but since I no longer program in Java nor have an operational environment that is setup to deploy Java , I just do n’t care .
Tools for your Ruby toolbox by David Bock was an interesting tour of three Ruby projects : StaticMatic , Sinatra , and GServer .
StaticMatic looked interested for static website development , but then Mike Clark wrote about Webby and it looks even better .
Sinatra appears to be a very light weight alternative to Rails and in combination with a static web site tool like StaticMatic or Webby could be extremely useful .
GServer is a generic server which takes some of the pain out of setting them up .
Dave ’s an engaging speaker and I always enjoy his presentations as well as speaking with him in the hallways at conferences .
The second day of Lightning Talks was even better than the first .
Soren Burkhard from Hawaii Business Consulting had a great overview of starting your own business .
Glenn
West spoke about several Rails plugins that he uses on a regular basis : ActiveScaffold , Role Requirement , ActiveAuthentication , File_column , PDFtoRuby , DotR , and Tabnav .
Jesse Shock from Engine Yard spoke about high availability planning : multiple sites , geographic diversity , data partitioning , sharding , etc .
He said you need to establish costs up front so the customer knows which availability techniques they can afford .
Yehuda Katz , also from Engine Yard , spoke about testing ( in the context of Merb ) and how you should use BDD for internal as well as external interfaces .
The last of the lightning talks was by Bryan Liles on how to be a manager , his slides are available here .
Finally , Stu closed out the conference with a talk on bad Ruby .
Overall , Ruby is good but that there are some bad practices / decisions that could come back to bite us later as Ruby adoption grows .
Some of the examples he provided were : constants ( you ca n’t change them so testing becomes difficult ) , class attributes ( prefer instance attributes on the eigenclass ) , direct access of instance variables , and proc workarounds ( e.g. passing more than one block to a method ) .
The code examples from his talk are available here .
Luis de la Rosa was kind enough keep track of all of the URLs that folks were throwing around and has posted them here : – delicious : http://delicious.com/tag/rubynation – magnolia : http://ma.gnolia.com/tags/rubynation
Overall , it was a great conference and I look forward to next year ’s RubyNation in June 2009 .
We have been warned .
Prepare for a broader war in the Middle East , as plans are being laid for the next U.S. - led regime change  in Syria .
A UN report on the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri elicited this comment from a senior U.S. policymaker : “ Out of tragedy comes an extraordinary strategic opportunity . ”
This statement reflects the continued neoconservative , Machiavellian influence on our foreign policy .
The “ opportunity ” refers to the long - held neoconservative plan for regime change in Syria , similar to what was carried out in Iraq .
This plan for remaking the Middle East has been around for a long time .
Just as 9/11 served the interests of those who longed for changes in Iraq , the sensationalism surrounding Hariri ’s death is being used to advance plans to remove Assad .
Congress already has assisted these plans by authorizing the sanctions placed on Syria last year .
Harmful sanctions , as applied to Iraq in the 1990s , inevitably represent a major step toward war since they bring havoc to so many innocent people .
Syria already has been charged with developing weapons of mass destruction based on no more evidence than was available when Iraq was similarly charged .
Syria has been condemned for not securing its borders , by the same U.S. leaders who cannot secure our own borders .
Syria was castigated for placing its troops in Lebanon , a neighboring country , although such action was invited by an elected government and encouraged by the United States .
The Syrian occupation of Lebanon elicited no suicide terrorist attacks , as was suffered by Western occupiers .
Condemning Syria for having troops in Lebanon seems strange , considering most of the world sees our 150,000 troops in Iraq as an unwarranted foreign occupation .
Syrian troops were far more welcome in Lebanon .
Secretary Rice likewise sees the problems in Syria  that we helped to create  as an opportunity to advance our Middle Eastern agenda .
In recent testimony , she stated that it was always the administration ’s intent to redesign the greater Middle East , and Iraq was only one part of that plan .
And once again we have been told that all options are still on the table for dealing with Syria  including war .
The statement that should scare all Americans ( and the world ) is the assurance by Secretary Rice that the president needs no additional authority from Congress to attack Syria .
She argues that authority already has been granted by the resolutions on 9/11 and Iraq .
This is not true , but if Congress remains passive to the powers assumed by the executive branch it wo n’t matter .
As the war spreads , the only role for Congress will be to provide funding lest they be criticized for not supporting the troops .
In the meantime , the Constitution and our liberties here at home will be further eroded as more Americans die .
This escalation of conflict with Syria comes as a result of the UN report concerning the Hariri death .
When we need an excuse for our actions , it ’s always nice to rely on the organization that our administration routinely condemns , one that brought us the multi-billion dollar oil - for - food scandal and sexual crimes by UN representatives .
It ’s easy to ignore the fact that the report did not implicate Assad , who is targeted for the next regime change .
The UN once limited itself to disputes between nations ; yet now it ’s assumed the UN , like the United States , has a legal and moral right to inject itself into the internal policies of sovereign nations .
Yet what is the source of this presumed wisdom ?
Where is the moral imperative that allows us to become the judge and jury of a domestic murder in a country 6,000 miles from our shores ?
Moral , constitutional , and legal arguments for a less aggressive foreign policy receive little attention in Washington .
But the law of unintended consequences serves as a thorough teacher for the slow learners and the morally impaired .
Is Iraq not yet enough of a headache for the braggarts of the shock and awe policy ?
Are 2,000 lives lost not enough to get their attention ?
How many hundreds of billions of dollars must be drained from our economy before it ’s noticed ?
Is it still plausible that deficits do n’t matter ?
Is the apparent victory for Iran in the Shi’ite theocracy we ’ve created in Iraq not yet seen as a disturbing consequence of the ill - fated Iraq regime - change effort ?
When we have our way with the next election in Lebanon and Hezbollah wins , what do we do ?
If our effort to destabilize Syria is no more successful than our efforts in Iraq , then what ?
If destabilizing Syria leads to the same in Iran , what are our options ?
If we ca n’t leave now , we ’ll surely not leave then  we ’ll be told we must stay to honor the fallen to prove the cause was just .
We should remember Ronald Reagan ’s admonition regarding this area of the world .
Ronald Reagan reflected on Lebanon in his memoirs , describing the Middle East as a jungle and Middle East politics as irrational .
It forced him to rethink his policy in the region .
It ’s time we do some rethinking as well .
Thanks to the valuable career advice in the following letter , which appeared in my mail box , unsigned , I forsee a vast improvement in my rotten citation track record :

Shifting the Terms of Debate : How Big Business Covered Up Global Warming
[ Here ’s the first part of an article I wrote last year about how right - wing think tanks shift the debate . ]
In 2004 , Michelle Malkin , a conservative editorialist , published the book In Defense of Internment .
It argued that declassified security intercepts showed that Japanese internment during World War II — the government policy that relocated thousands of Japanese to concentration camps — was actually justified in the name of national security .
We needed to learn the truth , Malkin insisted , so that we could see how racial profiling was similarly justified to fight the “ war on terror . ”
Bainbridge Island was the center of the evacuations ; to this day , residents still feel ashamed and teach students a special unit about the incident , entitled “ Leaving Our Island ” .
But one parent in the district , Mary Dombrowski , was persuaded by Malkin ’s book that the evacuation was actually justified and insisted the school was teaching a one - sided version of the internment story , “ propaganda ” that forced impressionable children into thinking that the concentration camps were a mistake .
The school ’s principal defended the practice .
As the Seattle Times reported :
“ We do teach it as a mistake , ” she said , noting that the U.S. government has admitted it was wrong .
“ As an educator , there are some things that we can say are n’t debatable anymore . ”
Slavery , for example .
Or the internment — as opposed to a subject such as global warming , she said . †
True , Japanese internment is n’t a controversial issue like global warming , but ten years ago , global warming was n’t a controversial issue either .
In 1995 , the UN ’s panel on international climate change released its consensus report , finding that global warming was a real and serious issue that had to be quickly confronted .
The media covered the scientists ’ research and the population agreed , leading President Clinton to say he would sign an international treaty to stop global warming .
Then came the backlash .
The Global Climate Coalition ( funded by over 40 major corporate groups like Amoco , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , and General Motors ) began spending millions of dollars each year to derail the Kyoto Protocol , the international treaty to help reduce global warming .
They held conferences entitled “ The Costs of Kyoto , ” issued press releases and faxes dismissing the scientific evidence for global warming , and spent more than $ 3 million on newspaper and television ads claiming Kyoto would mean a “ 50 - cent - per - gallon gasoline tax . ” †
The media , in response to flurries of “ blast faxes ” ( a technique in which a press release is simultaneously faxed to thousands of journalists ) and accusations of left - wing bias , began backing off from the scientific evidence .†
A recent study found only 35 % of newspaper stories on global warming accurately described the scientific consensus , with the majority implying that scientists who believed in global warming were just as common as global warming deniers ( of which there were only a tiny handful , almost all of whom had received funding from energy companies or associated groups ) . †
It all had an incredible effect on the public .
In 1993 , 88 % of Americans thought global warming was a serious problem .
By 1997 , that number had fallen to 42 % , with only 28 % saying immediate action was necessary .
1
And so Clinton changed course and insisted that cutting emissions should be put off for 20 years .
US businesses seriously weakened the Kyoto Protocol , leading it to require only a 7 % reduction in emissions ( compared to the 20 % requested by European nations ) and then President Bush refused to sign on to even that .†
In four short years , big business had managed to turn nearly half the country around and halt the efforts to protect the planet .
And now , the principal on Bainbridge Island , like most people , thinks global warming is a hotly contested issue — the paradigmatic example of a hotly contested issue — even when the science is clear .
( “ There ’s no better scientific consensus on this on any issue I know , ” said the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , “ except maybe Newton ’s second law of dynamics . ” )
2
But all this debate about problems has kept us away from talk about solutions .
As journalist Ross Gelbspan puts it , “ By keeping the discussion focused on whether there is a problem in the first place , they have effectively silenced the debate over what to do about it . ” †
So is it any wonder that conservatives want to do the same thing again ?
And again ?
And again ?

June 6 , 2006
Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine , an abortion rights Republican who has sponsored legislation that would require insurance companies to cover contraception , has seen a major change .
" Two decades or more ago , I do n't think there was much of a divide on contraception and family planning , " she says .
" It was one area both sides could agree on as a way to reduce unwanted pregnancies .
Now it becomes embroiled in philosophical disputes . "
The Guttmacher Institute , which like Siecus has been an advocate for birth control and sex education for decades , has also felt the shift .
" Ten years ago the fight was all about abortion , " says Cynthia Dailard , a senior public - policy associate at Guttmacher .
" Increasingly , they have moved to attack and denigrate contraception .
For those of us who work in the public health field , and respect longstanding public health principles — that condoms reduce S.T.D.'s , that contraception is the most effective way to help people avoid unintended pregnancy — it 's extremely disheartening to think we may be set back decades . "
It was a Friday afternoon at the end of August last year , with most of official Washington on vacation , when a press conference was called at F.D.A. headquarters in Rockville , Md . The occasion was a major drug announcement , but no one from the agency 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research was in the room to hear Commissioner Lester M. Crawford declare that " the agency is unable at this time to reach a decision on the approvability of the application . "
It was for Plan B .
Plan B , the brand name for the most common form of emergency contraception , has been on the market since 1999 ( another form , Preven , came on the market in 1998 ) .
The pill , which contains concentrated amounts of progestin , a hormone found in ordinary birth control pills , can prevent a pregnancy most effectively if taken within 72 hours of having sex .
( The abortion pill , by contrast , can be taken up to 49 days after the beginning of the last menstrual period and causes the chemical abortion of a fetus . )
Plan B's manufacturer applied in April 2003 for permission to sell Plan B over the counter .
Reproductive and women 's health professionals expected clear sailing for the drug ( morning - after contraception has been available in some European countries for more than 20 years ) .
Experts overwhelmingly considered it safe : in December 2003 the F.D.A.'s own joint advisory panel voted 28 - 0 that it was " safe for use in the nonprescription setting " and then voted 23 to 4 in favor of granting Plan B over - the - counter status .
The hope many people had for the drug was tied to an ugly number : 21 .
That is the number of abortions in the U.S. per year per 1,000 women of reproductive age , which puts the country at or near the top among developed nations .
Put another way , according to a study released this past week by the Guttmacher Institute , there are 6.4 million pregnancies a year in the U.S. , 3.1 million of which are unintended and 1.3 million of which end in abortion .
In the seven years since the last such study , the overall unintended - pregnancy rate has remained unchanged ; for women below the poverty level it increased 29 percent .
If women had quick , easy access to a backup contraceptive , the thinking of Plan B proponents went , those rates — and thus the abortion rate — would drop .
" I saw it as a win - win situation , something that everyone on both sides of the abortion issue could support , " says Dr. Susan F. Wood , who was at the time director of the Office of Women 's Health at the F.D.A .
" I still do n't get what happened . "
One thing that happened , which Dr. Wood and many others may have failed to notice , was the change in conservative circles on the subject of contraception .
At a White House press briefing in May of last year , three months before the F.D.A.'s nonruling on Plan B , Press Secretary Scott McClellan was asked four times by a WorldNetDaily correspondent , Les Kinsolving , if the president supported contraception .
" I think the president 's views are very clear when it comes to building a culture of life , " McClellan replied .
Kinsolving said , " If they were clear , I would n't have asked . "
McClellan replied : " And if you want to ask those questions , that 's fine .
I 'm just not going to dignify them with a response . "
This exchange caught the attention of bloggers and others .
In July , a group of Democrats in Congress , led by Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York , sent the first of four letters to the president asking outright : " Mr. President , do you support the right to use contraception ? "
According to Representative Maloney 's office , the White House has still not responded .

For those who were listening , that silence may have given an indication of what had been going on inside the F.D.A .
After the agency 's advisory committees voted in favor of over - the - counter status for Plan B at the end of 2003 , and after it was further approved at every level of the agency 's professional staff , standard procedure would have been for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research arm of the F.D.A. to approve the application .
But one member of the F.D.A. 's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee had reservations : Dr. W. David Hager , a Christian conservative whom President Bush appointed to lead the panel in 2002 .
( After an outcry from women 's groups , who were upset at Dr. Hager 's writing that he used Jesus as a model for how he treated women in his gynecology practice , he was shifted from chairman of the panel to ordinary member . )
Dr. Hager said he feared that if Plan B were freely available , it would increase sexual promiscuity among teenagers .
F.D.A. staff members presented research showing that these fears were ungrounded : large - scale studies showed no increase in sexual activity when Plan B was available to them , and both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Adolescent Medicine endorsed the switch to over - the - counter status .
Others argued that the concern was outside the agency 's purview : that the F.D.A.'s mandate was specifically limited to safety and did not extend to matters like whether a product might lead to people having more sex .
Meanwhile a government report later found that Dr. Janet Woodcock , deputy commissioner for operations at the F.D.A. , had also expressed a fear that making the drug available over the counter could lead to " extreme promiscuous behaviors such as the medication taking on an ' urban legend ' status that would lead adolescents to form sex - based cults centered around the use of Plan B . "
In May 2004 , the F.D.A. rejected the finding of its scientific committees and denied the application , citing some of the reasons that Dr. Hager had expressed .

Mike Burrows explains the principle behind his bike
Mike Burrows Mike Burrows , the Norfolk man behind the superbike that helped Chris Boardman win Olympic gold in 1992 , shares his thoughts about Designers , Engineers and Inventors with Norfolk Online .
When asked about my " inventing " the Lotus bike , I usually start by explaining that I do n't see myself as an inventor , but like to think that I am an " engineer " .
The difference ?
I think that whereas engineers mostly try to solve their own problems , inventors usually try to solve other people's .
The other badge I could easily pin on would , of course , be " designer " , except that it has been horribly devalued by the media 's constant use of the word ; i.e. a designer can do wallpaper or the wings of an Airbus .
Even Leonardo Da Vinci was not that multi-talented .
Chris Boardman and the superbike
So if you are thinking of becoming a designer , you will need to decide :
a ) what you like doing ;
b ) is this likely to provide a worthwhile job ?
( Snowboard designing must be a crowded area by now ) ;
c ) most importantly - do your talents suit the task ?
A full - time job
To be a successful designer you will be doing your job a lot - whenever you are not sleeping !
Designing is full - time , as you can never stop thinking about the problems , and if you have no talent for it you will soon lose interest .
So for those of you who are are artistic loners it is the wallpaper or similar aesthetically - focused areas ; but it is difficult if you are too artistic - the desire to live in Arles and cut off your ear will get to you sooner or later .
It helps to understand how important your job is - the world might like the odd sunflower but it needs good wallpaper .
At the other end of the design spectrum , but no more or less important , is aircraft design - no room for loners .
The trick here is to make the very small bit you are working on without making it impossible for everyone else 's bit to work .
From style to function I n between , and where most " industrial designers " end up , is in companies where you work with a small team and tackle most of the product design from style to function .
The trick then is not to be under pressure - easy to say of course , but the client will usually want it yesterday , which is where the designing full - time comes in .
You have to constantly solve problems before you are given them - not an easy trick and only likely to bear fruit very occasionally , but very satisfyingly , when it does .
The other option is to do what I do and have a little workshop in Norfolk , design what you want to design and at your own pace - just do n't expect to earn too much money !

The post - Katrina debate taking place everywhere from Congress to the family dinner table - about what went wrong and who is to blame , has included again and again one word : racism .
The definition , though , has been very race - specific : black versus white .
It 's a valid debate .
Unless , of course , your skin is brown .
That blacks were " looting " while whites were " finding " has been well circulated on the Internet in a fierce cyber image - war .
What the mainstream media has neglected to mention - at least in its initial discussions of the role that race played in preparation for , and clean - up after Katrina - is that the Latinos are " hiding , " many in churches where they feel protected , or in Mexican and Honduran restaurants .
Many Latinos will keep a low profile during the clean - up
Over 100 Latin American immigrants now call La Iglesia Lugar de Sanidad ( Healing Place Church ) in Gonzales , Louisiana home .
They use their reverence to ask God for help since they are unsure who to trust outside the church walls .
Latinos - especially Hondurans - are no strangers to natural disaster .
After fleeing Honduras in the wake of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - which killed thousands , left thousands missing , and affected millions from Guatemala to Costa Rica - many Hondurans ended up in the port city of New Orleans in search of that " better life " that El Norte seemed to offer .
Invisible citizens
Approximately 150,000 Hondurans live in Louisiana , most in New Orleans .
Estimates of Mexicans living in or around New Orleans range from 40,000 to 100,000 .
And other groups , including Salvadorans and Brazilians , also number in the tens of thousands .
The Pew Hispanic Center estimates ( conservatively ) that 20,000 to 35,000 of these Latinos are illegal immigrants or undocumented workers .
Even the governments of Mexico and Honduras are stumped as to where their citizens are hiding .
In the face of our worst natural and national disaster ever , we find ourselves face - to - face with a basic discussion in American society : Just what is an American ?
Fearing deportation , Latinos - many of whom are illegal immigrants - prefer instead to seek shelter and support in Latino - owned businesses that they learn about through word of mouth .
They sneak out at night to look for food and water since many cannot understand the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's ( Fema's ) English - language public service announcements about where to go for services .
Increasing tensions
The American discussion of who is worthy of " saving " in the face of disaster - one that we thought we had at least tabled after 11 September , is back in full force .
Fema spokeswoman Joanna Gonzalez , answering pleas from Presidents Fox of Mexico and Maduro of Honduras not to prosecute illegal immigrants , offered one answer : " We want to provide food , water , shelter and medical supplies to everyone .
No one should be afraid to accept our offers to provide safety . "
Ms Gonzalez originally ignored follow - up enquiries as to whether or not this meant that illegal immigrants would not be reported or prosecuted , simply repeating her form - letter statement .
Is Fema 's message reaching everyone ?
They cite the fact that many legal residents may have lost their papers in the hurricane , and should not be penalised for it .
At the same time , DHS amended their original statement - while they would save a drowning illegal immigrant , they would not " turn a blind eye to the law " if they later found out his immigration status .
These policies have created tension in the Gulf Coast and throughout the nation .
Some Latino civil rights workers argue that this is a clear indication that the US Government is creating policy aimed to serve a select group and to ignore or prosecute others .
Dispensable labour
While the " deserving poor " in shelters are eligible to approach Fema , social security and Red Cross representatives to receive food , water , debit cards and food stamps , Latinos stand behind and watch .
They are trained to avoid authority at all costs .
Even in the face of a disaster like Katrina .
Opponents of illegal immigration view the policies as a direct affront to the thousands of displaced American citizens and legal residents who are searching for a job , any job .
If the law lets an employer hire an illegal Latino , then one less job is available for a true American , they argue .
In the United States , in the face of our worst natural and national disaster ever , we find ourselves face - to - face with a basic discussion in American society : Just what is an American ?
Defining the protection - worthy and the dispensable has become another job in the relief efforts .
Blacks are complaining that they are seen as inferior to whites ; Latinos are too scared to complain at all , or do n't speak the right language to do so .
Meanwhile , we are sending them back in to clean up our cities , clad in dust masks and rags and with the promise of a 15 - dollar - an - hour job , until we decide to report them and send them back to their own countries .
God bless America , indeed .
Que Dios nos bendiga .

The clock is ticking for light bulbs
The organic light - emitting diode ( OLED ) emits a brilliant white light when attached to an electricity supply .
The material , described in the journal Nature , can be printed in wafer thin sheets that could transform walls , ceilings or even furniture into lights .
The OLEDs do not heat up like today 's light bulbs and so are far more energy efficient and should last longer .
They also produce a light that is more akin to natural daylight than traditional bulbs .
" We 're hoping that this will lead to significantly longer device lifetimes in addition to higher efficiency , " said Professor Mark Thompson of the University of Southern California , one of the authors of the paper .
Old fashioned
Traditional light bulbs were invented more than 130 years ago .
Since then the basic principle of creating light remains the same , although the design has been tweaked .
An electric current passing through a tungsten wire causes it to heat up and glow white hot .
Today , more than 20 % of electricity used in US buildings is eaten up by lights and nearly half that amount is used by traditional , incandescent light bulbs .
It has been a long - term goal of scientists to come up with something that would reduce this mammoth energy demand .
The new work exploits the properties of carbon - based polymers to produce the white light .
These are already found in some mobile phone displays and MP3 players .
To create the new material , the scientists build up ultra - thin layers of plastics coated with green , red and blue dyes .
When an electric current passes through them , they combine to produce white light .
Previous attempts to make OLEDs like this have largely failed to make an impact because traditional phosphorescent blue dyes are very short lived .
The new polymer uses a fluorescent blue material instead which lasts much longer and uses less energy .
The researchers believe that eventually this material could be 100 % efficient , meaning it could be capable of converting all of the electricity to light , without the heat loss associated with traditional bulbs .
The new material can also be printed onto glass or plastic and so in theory could create large areas of lighting , relatively cheaply .
Before this becomes a reality , the scientists need to work out a way to seal the OLEDs from moisture which can contaminate the sensitive material , causing it to no longer work .
If that barrier can be overcome , the new polymer could eventually become the material of choice for stylish , environmentally friendly lighting .
The research team incorporated members from Princeton University , the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan .

Batwoman 's new look has been designed by artist Alex Ross
Batwoman - real name Kathy Kane - will appear in 52 , a year - long DC Comics publication that began this month .
In her latest incarnation , she is a rich socialite who has a romantic history with another 52 character , ex-police detective Renee Montoya .
52 will be published in the UK as a graphic novel by Titan Books in 2007 .
The series is set in a world in which established superheroes Batman , Superman and Wonder Woman do not play a part .
Reinvention
The new - look Batwoman is just one of a wave of ethnically and sexually diverse characters entering the DC Comics universe .
Others include Mexican teenager Blue Beetle - who replaces the character 's previous white incarnation - and the Great Ten , a government - sponsored team of Chinese superheroes .
Regular characters Firestorm and The Atom , meanwhile , have been reinvented as black and Asian heroes respectively .
The characters are part of a wider effort to broaden the make - up of comic - book creations in line with society as a whole .
Batwoman , who first appeared in July 1956 , has not been seen since September 1979 when she was killed by the League of Assassins and the Bronze Tiger .

How to make an artificial shark uterus
So , apparently some Australian scientists are attempting to create artificial shark uteruses — so that they can prevent fetal sharks from eating each other in the womb .
Yes , you read that correctly .
Here ’s the deal :
The average female grey nurse shark begins her pregnancy with about 40 embryos in her two uteruses .
But it takes a year for the baby sharks to gestate , and by the time they ’re ready to be born , there are only two left — one in each uterus .
Why ?
Because by four months they ’ve developed a full set of teeth , and the strongest begin cannibalizing the weaker ones .
Ay yi yi .
I ’d heard of wild dingos getting into deathmatches right after being born , but this takes the whole red - in - tooth - and - claw stuff up to the next level .
Anyway , the grey nurse shark population is apparently critically endangered , and since they ’re the top predators in the oceanic food chain , the ecosystem could be unpredictably unbalanced if they all vanish .
So the scientists are trying to develop an artificial shark uterus so they can capture a pregnant female , flush out the embryos , and raise them independently so they can all be born .
Of course , as Slate wondered , maybe this attempt to tinker with Mother Nature is doomed to failure .
Maybe the embryo sharks need to feed on one another to survive long enough to be born ; and maybe the pre-birth contest serves to winnow out sharks that would n’t prosper in the wild anyway .
Scientists are n’t sure , as an AFP story notes :
No accepted explanation has been established for why the grey nurse sharks take sibling rivalry to such extreme lengths .
“ It would seem logical that the intra-uterine cannibalism does confer some sort of evolutionary advantage , somewhat similar to the survival of the fittest , but it may be the luck of the draw because even the biggest could be attacked , ” Otway said .
Well , that ’s gotta be a conversation - stopper at cocktail parties .
“ So , what do you do for a living ? ” “ Oh , I design artificial shark uteruses to prevent inter-uterine embryo cannibalism . ”

An international team of scientists thinks it has solved the ultimate mystery of the Neanderthals : where and when they made their last stand before extinction .
It was at Gibraltar 28,000 years ago , some 2,000 years more recently than previously thought .
The archaeologists and paleontologists reported yesterday finding several hundred stone tools in Gorham ’s Cave , on the rugged Mediterranean coast near the Rock of Gibraltar .
They are artifacts of the Mousterian technology , usually associated with Neanderthals .
So far , no fossil bones of the cave occupants have been uncovered .
The researchers said , however , that the tools established the survival of a population of Neanderthals , a people closely related to human ancestors , in the southernmost point of Western Europe long after they disappeared elsewhere .
These were , they concluded , the last Neanderthals “ currently recorded anywhere . ”
The scientists , led by Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum , announced the discovery at a news conference at the museum .
Their report was simultaneously published on the Web site of the journal Nature , www.nature.com.
It will appear in the journal at a later date .
This post will provide a graphical update on what has been a roller coaster ride in the natural gas market over the past 12 months , and a steep plummet of late .
Natural gas prices have dropped by 50 % in the last month , and over 70 % from their highs earlier in the year .
The warmest winter on record and not a single rig- damaging hurricane have combined to create record gas in storage , thereby reducing price demand for the marginal unit .
Yet , production is flat with last year despite significant more drilling and rigs allocated to the commodity .
The current situation is thus one of short term plenty and long term supply concern .
If longer term predictions of reduced supply and accelerated well depletion are correct , we should be seeing some of the major producers reduce rig counts at these levels , or shut - in their production with intent to sell it higher in the future .
This post examines the supply / demand equation for natural gas in the US , the NG futures strip , and the implications going forward of higher price volatility in this important commodity .
( For those unfamiliar with how the energy futures markets work , here is some background info . )
Natural gas .
It does everything from heat our homes to fertilize and cook our food .
And unless you 've lived in a climate that does n't require air conditioning or heat , you 've probably heard of the wild swings in the gas market in the past year .
The price drop has caused fits , threats and lost bets .
Each day the natural gas market goes up or down .
This year , its pretty much gone down .
Click to enlarge .
The two markets I refer to in the title are supply and demand .
But I could just as easily be referring to the dichotomy between near term prices and long term .
The above chart ( and most news services ( CNBC , etc ) quote what the ' front ' or near month for oil and gas futures is doing .
However , these commodities can be traded for expiration each of the next 60 months .
A ' futures strip ' is comprised of the entire forward market for a commodity .
The complexity of the short and long term supply / demand situation can be better understood by looking at the entire curve .
Below is a graphic of the futures strip from NYMEX.com of last fridays close for natural gas .
( it was down again on Monday ) .
As can be seen , prices are very low for October and November 2006 then form a sine wave pattern for the next 60 months , with peak prices expected in winter months , when heating demand is high .
( Note , the above chart shows historical prices over 10 years , the below chart are todays prices for delivery the next 5 years in the future )

We will return to the futures strip at the end of this post but first give a review of the current dynamics of the natural gas market .
NATURAL GAS SUPPLY
The Peak Oil ( and Natural Gas ) crowd typically focus their worries on the supply side of the market equation .
The supply story for natural gas , at least domestically , does not look promising .
The United States has roughly 400,000 natural gas wells operating currently , near an all time high .
First of all , lets look at total production in the United States .
( The difference in the two lines is the top one includes ' wet gas ' or non -gas liquids which are added into the petroleum supplies . )
( Source EIA )
Click to enlarge .
The following is a graphic showing how quickly the average new gas well is depleted .
( this is for wet wells but dry wells appear to be depleting slightly faster )
As can be seen , a decade ago , it took 10 - 15 years for a new well to deplete .
Now they are going dry in less than 18 months .
Click to enlarge .
In addition to quicker depletion , wells are smaller and hence less productive : ( Source EIA )
Click to enlarge .
We are drilling more wells and smaller wells .
Equity research house Johnson Rice recently put out a report showing that from Q2 2005 to Q2 2006 , the top 20 NG production firms were down 2.4 % in production yet had increased rig count by 22 % .
( this doesnt include shut - in production ) .
HELP FROM THE NORTH ?
Canada produces about 6.2 TCF per year and exports 3.6 TCF to the United States .
However , they too are declining in production with a large increase in wells - a similar pattern to the US .
The graph below shows Canada producing about the same amount of NG as in 1998 , but needing to drill more than twice the wells annually to do this .
( Do n't get me started on net energy )
Click to enlarge .
This is a broad sketch of the supply picture - of course there are coal bed methane and liquefied natural gas , but the impact of both is uncertain , and with natural gas currently with a $ 4 handle , those sources may be uneconomical or not come to market in a timely fashion .
To me , the North American natural gas supply situation can best be likened to the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland , who kept running very fast just to stay in place - if she slowed down , she might go backwards rapidly .
NOT SO FAST MY FRIEND !
Natural gas demand is the other half of the story .
The US ( in 2005 ) used just under 22 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
Believe it or not , this is less than we used 10 years ago ( compared to a 13 % increase in crude oil ) .
The 22 TCF roughly breaks down as follows : 24 % for residential heating , 14 % for commercial use , 35 % for industrial use , and 27 % for electric and combined cycle power .
Click to enlarge .
Though many say that closure of industrial and chemical plants domestically due to high NG prices is responsible for the drop in industrial demand , as can be seen from the chart , this trend has been in place since the late 1990s , when gas was still cheap .
If I was a manufacturer in Toledo paying $ 17/ hr why wouldnt I move my plant to Mexico and pay $ 4/ hr for wages ?
It is unclear how much more demand destruction can come from the manufacturing sector .
However , electricity demand and its use of natural gas has surely been growing .
THE NEW GODZILLA MOVIE - " GLOBAL WARMING VS GAS DEPLETION "
The past winter was the warmest on record .
But just how warm is not commonly known .
The dark red patches in North America in the below graph are 4 - 13 Degrees C above the historical average - needless to say , less people needed natural gas for heat ( except in Russia - where they had the opposite trend in January )
Click to enlarge .
( Source - James Hansen NASA 2006 )
The warm temperatures contributed to much less demand for heating not only in the dead of winter , but in the spring as well .
April , May and Jun 2006 each saw less natural gas usage than any equivalent month for the last 33 years .
So far through 2 quarters in 2006 , residential customers have used 12 % less natural gas than 2005 .
BACK TO THE FUTURE (S ) - WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES
Click to enlarge .
The pink line represents what the futures strip looked like in September 2005 .
The blue line represents the futures strip on Friday .
( Notice , we are missing 12 months of pink line at the end because last year 60 months only brought us to 2010 and we are missing 12 months of blue line at the front because fridays futures are only looking forward , not backward )
What we see here is that the front month , which at one time was over $ 15 is now at around $ 4.50 , an historic drop .
However , a year or so out there has been a much smaller drop and at the end of the futures strip ( 2011 ) prices are actually slightly higher than they were a year ago .
We also can see that winter months command higher prices , due to higher chances of shortages when natural gas usage is highest .
Also , the shape of the winter ' hump ' , though at lower levels , is similar to a year ago .
We also notice that currently all winters in the future are roughly priced the same , whereas a year ago , the nearer the winter , the higher the price .
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A MONTH MAKES
Click to enlarge .
What does this graph tell us ?
First of all , near month futures have dropped like a stone since August - from near $ 8 to $ 4.50ish .
Also , the winter - summer premium has declined , not only in this coming winter ( where supposedly Amaranth had their calendar spreads ) , but in all subsequent winters .
Either there was some major hedge fund activity , or some energy traders talked to Al Gore .
Curiously , in the face of this steep decline , back dated futures actually went up ( the blue is higher than the brown in 2011 )
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A WEEK MAKES
Click to enlarge .
Here we can see that in all years except for 2006 , the majority of the winter - summer premium collapse of the last month came in the last week .
( compare the brown - blue vs red - blue in the two graphs ) .
However , this winters price differential had already collapsed , presumably earlier in the month , from about a $ 2.50 premium over spring to about $ 1 .
If we believe the media reports of Amaranth losing $ 6 billion , how could they do that in natural gas calendar spreads ?
First of all , each natural gas futures contract is 10,000 million BTUs or 10 million cubic feet of gas - this means for each 1 point movement in price , the contract value changes by $ 10,000 .
So to lose $ 6B , one would have to have on 400,000 contracts if there was a $ 1.50 loss .
However , the entire open interest of all the 2006 - 7 winter months is about 260,000 contracts and the entire open interest of every contract thru 2011 is 960,000 contracts .
So either Amaranth had off balance sheet exposure ( derivatives ) , they had things other than calendar spreads on ( the actual front month contract declined almost $ 4 ) , or something else was afoot .
Incidentally , if they did have 400,000 contracts , that would represent 4 trillion cubic feet , or about 20 % of US annual natural gas consumption .
Boy do energy and dollars make strange bedfellows ...
AND FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE
Keep in mind that despite the dramatic fall in natural gas prices in the past year , when we compare the current futures strip to what it looked like 5 years ago , we see a ) current prices are still much higher that they used to be and b ) the winter ' humps ' , though still existent 5 years ago , were much smaller .

CONCLUSIONS
We currently have a glut of natural gas .
As scary as the future supply situation is , the fact is that even with a cold winter supplies will be adequate .
Could another warm winter ( it is an el Nino year ) combined with no increase in storage capacity result in actual flaring of gas ?
Producers would n't allow this to happen of course , as at SOME price they will shut - in production and stop drilling new wells .
In fact , today Baker Hughes announced their new weekly rig count , and the Canadians , always quick to reduce drilling on commodity price drops , had a 22 % drop in rigs from last week .
High prices gave us demand destruction .
Low prices give us supply destruction .
Low prices , while currently pleasant , send the wrong long term signal to the alternative energy markets ( like wind , tidal , solar , etc ) .
Energy price volatility ( in both directions ) interrupts progress being made replacing fossil fuels with renewables .
Low natural gas prices remove the motivation of utility providers to invest in alternatives .
Low prices also prevent wind and solar entrepreneurs from being cost competitive , until the signal is too late .
Furthermore , continued volatility will hamstring policymakers .
A warm winter and everything is fine and a cold winter and people freeze in Michigan .
As James Schlesinger , our nations first energy secretary said about energy " We have only two modes -- complacency and panic . "
I can think of a third mode - schizophrenia due to alternating years of complacency and panic .
Towards this end , and this applies to crude oil as well , the ease with which the wall street crowd can impact the price of a commodity that is so ubiquitous in making our system work , combined with growing knowledge that fossil fuels are a one time subsidy given to humanity and are depleting rapidly , should alert policymakers to the importance of making immediate changes to current energy policy .
In addition to position limits for non-users or hedgers of energy , we should create a floor price for oil and gas , so that financial market - led volatility or intermittent gluts of product do not derail the development of alternative forms of electricity and liquid fuels .
The achilles heel of the big two fossil fuels in their use in our world , is the time it takes to replace them .
The natural gas market , in its current price dichotomy , is a prime example of the high standard deviation potential in our current system .
Heads everything is rosy .
Tails there are power outages .
I have no idea whether it will be cold this winter .

BARTOW , Florida ( Court TV ) --
Warned by the judge that tears could trigger a mistrial , a mother was stoic in front of a Florida jury Tuesday as she relived the day she discovered the bloodied bodies of her children .
Nicoletta Dosso was the first person to come upon the bloody crime scene where her children , Frank Dosso , 35 , and Diane Patisso , 28 , were shot to death .
In the same office where her son lay dead in a pool of blood from gunshot wounds to the head , Nicoletta Dosso also discovered her daughter 's husband , George Patisso , 26 , slumped against the body of 68 - year - old George Gonsalves , her husband 's business partner .
Dressed from head to toe in black , the grieving mother had barely taken her seat in the witness box Tuesday before she began stifling sobs while family members and friends sat red-eyed in the gallery holding tissue boxes .
The emotional display prompted a swift response from lawyers representing the defendant , Nelson Serrano , who faces the death penalty if convicted of four counts of first - degree murder .
" Mrs. Dosso 's role in this case is more emotional than any witness identification situation I can imagine , " defense lawyer Robert Norgard told the court after the jury was quickly rushed out of the room .
" If she breaks down in front of the jury , we will ask for a mistrial . "
Fears of juror bias
Circuit Judge Susan Roberts agreed that an emotional display would unfairly bias the jurors against the defendant , and issued a stern warning to the prosecutor and , indirectly , to the witness and her family .
" If she gets emotional , I will grant a motion for a mistrial , " Roberts said , eliciting emphatic headshakes from Dosso 's friends and family .
" If [ the prosecutor ] wants to put her on the stand with that in mind , he may do so . "
In a compromise , both sides agreed to let the witness give her testimony outside the presence of the jury and then play a video of the testimony for the jury if it was deemed " unemotional " enough .
As a result , the Sicilian - born mother of three offered a sanitized version of the events that took place on December 3 , 1997 .
Nicoletta Dosso said she and her husband were supposed to go to their son's home that evening for coffee and cake to celebrate his twin daughters ' 10th birthday .
At about 6 p.m. , Frank Dosso's wife called to say he had not returned home .
They went to look for him at the Bartow office of Erie Manufacturing and Garment Conveyor Systems , where Frank Dosso worked for his father 's business .
Nicoletta was the first to come upon her daughter 's body , lying in a pool of blood .
' My God , what did they do ? '
" I went down and I said , ' My God what they do ?
I do n't know who did this to you , Diane , ' " the witness said in an Italian accent .
As she continued through the offices , she saw George Gonsalves ' foot sticking out of her son's office , and discovered the bodies of the three other men inside .
" I wanted to hug [ Frank ] , but I could not .
I did not want to touch the dead , " she said , her voice restrained .
" I do n't want to spoil .
I knew that was even worse for me to do . "
The widow of Frank Dosso received the same cautionary instructions about her composure before she did her own run through outside the presence of the jury .
Maria Dosso Jacoby testified that she and her three daughters waited for Frank Dosso to return home that night with Chinese take - out .
Anxious for an answer , she left her three daughters at home with a friend and drove to Erie 's offices with George Gonsalves ' wife , Inocencia .
" There was already crime - scene tape , there was an ambulance , " testified Maria Dosso Jacoby , who has remarried since her husband 's death .
" Did your husbands have any enemies or people that might want to injure him ? " assistant state attorney John Aguero asked Jacoby .
" No , " Jacoby said , without betraying any emotion .
Atlanta alibi
Polk County prosecutors contend that Serrano , 67 , went to Erie Manufacturing to kill Gonsalves , who had removed Serrano from his position as president of Garment Conveyor Systems and cut his salary .
He killed the others , they say , so there would be no witnesses .
( Full coverage )
Serrano 's lawyers claim evidence places their client in Atlanta the day of the shootings .
They also point to a lack of forensic evidence linking the Ecuadorian native to the crime scene .
Earlier Tuesday , several Erie employees testified about the acrimonious relationship between Serrano and his partners , Gonsalves and Phil Dosso , the husband of Nicoletta Dosso and the father of Frank and Diane .
Before Serrano left the company in July 1997 , former employee Todd White testified Tuesday that Serrano asked him to leave Erie and join him in a new company he was starting .
" I told him I was n't comfortable leaving , and at that point he proceeded to become very disgruntled and very upset , " testified White , who left Erie in 1999 .
" He kept saying things like , ' If you choose not to , I think you 'll be sorry , because I plan to see this company fail .
I guarantee you this company will fail . ' "
Phil Dosso is expected to testify Wednesday and provide further details of the turmoil between the partners that preceded Serrano 's departure six months before the shootings .
The Hajj is the Pilgrimage to Mecca in Islam .
It is the fifth of the Five Pillars in Sunni Islam and one of the ten Branches of Religion in Shi'a Islam .
Every able - bodied Muslim who can afford to do so is obliged to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime .
The government of Saudi Arabia issues special visas to foreigners for the purpose of the pilgrimage , which takes place during the Islamic month of Dhu al - Hijjah .
Entrance to the city itself is forbidden to non-Muslims , and the entire city is considered a holy site to Islam .
Now ... let 's see a lot of people at Mecca .
一昨日は駅前の喫茶店にて文字コードについてのインタビューをうけました。なんでも文字コードについて面白い読み物にしたいとのこと。X だと か02いくつだとか、訳の分からない数字やアルファベットが続くのに強い違和感を抱いている様子。うーん、いいなあ、ぼくも昔はそういうこと考えていたんだよなあ、正確さよりも面白さが大事だって。どこで間違っちゃったんだろうなあ。
で、乞われるまま にASCII からISO R 646、ISO 2022 か らISO /IEC 10646への流れ、そしてその中で日本が果たした役割、あるいはJIS
X 0208 がISO 2022に基づいた構造であること。もともとISO
2022は事前の二者間の合意を前提とした情報交換のために作られた符号化方法であり、合意のない情報交換や、コンピュータ内部の情報処理用としては向いてなかったこと、そしてこれがUCS≒Unicodeの登場を促すことになる――。
こういう流れを押さえると見えてくるんですが、文字コード規格というものは、符号化対象の文字の数とか種類を、より増やす形で進化してきた。そしてこれが大事なんですが、これをたった一言で表すと「国際化」という言葉に集約できる。つまり文字コード規格にとって「国際化」とは、本能のようなものだと言えるのではないか。そしてシフトJISは、この国際化ができない仕組みだったからこそ未来がなかった――。
……てなことを、数時間にわたってご説明申し上げたんですが、どうもライター氏の顔色はさえない。というより、話をすればするほど彼の顔はどんどん暗くなっていく。取材の最後、彼が聞いて曰く。
「 それで 、Unicodeになって、何か良いことってあるんですか？」
そりゃありますよ、シフトJISのように海外のウェブが化け化けになることもないし、JIS外字を意識しながら書かなくてすむし、良いことだらけじゃないですか。
「……いや あ、それは分かりますけど…… それだけですか？ 」
いや、まあ、それだけって言われればそれだけですけど。
「 じゃあ 、JIS X 0213で文字が増えて便利になったんですか？」
旧人名用漢字許容字体表の漢字が使えるようになりましたね。常用漢字の旧字体です。それからJIS
X 0208で漏れた、姓で使う漢字が入った。 SMAPファンは喜んでいると思いますよ。あとは鴎とか冒涜の「涜」など83改正で変えられた伝統的な字体が使えるようになった。
でも一番便利になったのは丸付き数字やハートマークでしょう。これが化けずに書けるようになった。
「 丸付き数 字 …… それだけですか？ 」
ま、それだけですけど。ええとですね、“誰もが満足する図書館を作るには、何冊蔵書すればいいか ” という問題をご存知ですか？ 具体的な数字は忘れちゃったんですけど、千冊かそこらあれば、９割以上の人は満足させられるんですよ。でも、あとの１割以下に満足してもらうには、じつに何十万冊も必要になるんです。漢字もこれと同じなんですよね（英単語などもそうですけど）。JIS
X 0213がやったのは、こうした「落ち穂拾い」なんです。どうしたって万人向けの漢字ばかりにはならないでしょう。
万人向けという意味では、常用漢字表は1,945文字を定義してます。でもこの1,945字ですら、ぼくはきっと全部は書けないと思います。ましてやJIS
X 0208は約7,000字もある。1990年代末に「文字が足りない」ってあちこちで言われてました。ぼく自身も編集者としてそう思ってた。それで出来たのがJIS
X 0213です。でも、約7,000字あった上の「足りない」ですからね、そうそう目に見えて多い訳がないんですよ。
それでも、こういうことは言えると思います。たしかに 草ナギ 川〈山竒〉君が存在する確率は、１学年に１人、いや学校に１人とかかもしれない。でもJISさえあれば在校生の名前を全部書けるというのは、大事なことなんだと――。
――てなことをご説明したのですが、ライター氏の顔色は曇ったまま帰途につかれたのでありました。ははは、さて、どんな原稿になるんだろうなあ。
しかしまあ、取材を受ける立場になって分かったことがあります。使いたい文字が使えるようになったり、文字が化けないことって、当たり前のことなんですよ。こういう当たり前のことに、普通人々は価値を見出しません。なんで文字コードについての原稿が売れないのか、大変よく分かったように思います。
※追記（2006.5.11 ）
文中、中線で消した部分は筆者の誤認でした。
草ナギ、冒涜の 「涜 」 や「鴎」の伝統字体はJIS X 0213以前にJIS X 0212に含まれます。
筆者 はWindows XPにおいて、これらの文字は簡単に入力できないと思っていましたが、事実はMS-IMEによる比較的簡単な操作で入力することができます。
ご指摘くださったttkさん、とおりすがりさんに感謝いたします。
目次
このページでは、 結城が仕事をする上で心がけていること、 心がけようとしていることをご紹介しています。
仕事について書くのに、 「 休息」から書きはじめるのは変でしょうか。
けれども私はそうは思いません。 私は、よい休息がとれているときにはじめて
充実した知的生活を営むことができるからです。
逆に、休息がきちんととれていないと、 大きな仕事をこなしても、どこかに不満が残ってしまうように思います。
休むのも仕事のうち 。
聖書にも安息日が出てくる。
家内が自分のバロメータになっている。
プログラミングはまるで家内制手工業。
いつもどうしたら（本当に）楽ができるのか考えよう
( Perlの作者であ るLarry Wallもそう言っている ) 。
細切れに眠るのではなく、きちんと「眠る時間」をとって眠ろう。
規則正しく、眠る準備を整えてから眠ろう。
準備を整えてあげると身体が喜ぶ。
「 さあ、いまから眠るんだよ。安心して眠っていいからね」と自分にメッセージを送るようにして眠ろう。
「 この世のすべてを捨てる」かのような心持ちで眠ろう。あれはどうだっけ、この件はどうしよう、などと考えつつ眠らないように。
徹夜はいけない。フラフラになるから。
徹夜は非常手段である。次の日一日を捨ててもよい、というような状況でないと徹夜をしてはいけない。
普段から自分の睡眠の取り方、睡眠時間のパターンについて関心をもつようにしよう。
朝型に変えてから、仕事がはかどるようになった。
夜3時間かかるバグも朝なら3分で取れる。
夜中まで頭をブンブン回すと、眠れなくなる。
夜遅くなると「ハイ」になり、働いているような気分になる。けれどもそれは気分だけ。
ただし、夜 の 「自分の前に無限の時間が続いているような幻想の中でリラックスして仕事をする」という感覚は大事かもしれない。でも練習しだいでは、限られた時間内であってもリラックスして仕事をできるものかもしれない。
食事はきちんととること。
規則正しくとること。食休みをとること。
よく味わうこと 。
ふだん分析的な、論理的な仕事が多いので、「味わっている」という感覚を大事に。味わい、浸り切るという感覚を大事に。
休息をきちんととること。
よいアイディアは休息後に生まれる。
食事を味わう、音楽に浸る。
食後にお腹をなでてあげる 「 よしよし」と。
できれば、仲のよい人と一緒に食事するとよい。

プログラマの心の健 康
考えが行き詰まりそうなときには人と話す。人がいないときには思っていることをテキストエディタに向かって吐き出す。文章を使ったカタルシス。
「 無駄のない人生」をこころがける（無駄を無駄にしないくふう）。
それと同時に 「無駄があってもかまわない人生」も心がける。
批判はあとで、まず受け入れてから。
聖書を読む 。
失敗したと感じたときには 「そういうこともある」と受け入れてしまう。
できる限り誠実に。人をワナにかけないように。わざと情報を少なくしてミスを誘うことをしないように。
よい言葉を言う。悪い言葉を言わない。自分の言葉を一番初めに聞くのは自分である。
直接相手にものをわたすところをイメージする。
自分がものをつくるところをイメージする。
今、深さ優先か広さ優先か。
人を怒らない。怒りはものを生み出さない。
声を荒げない。小さな声で語っても正しいことは正しいこと。
けれども、ときには role play として怒ることが必要な場合もある 。
全体をイメージする。要となるもの（技術、人、文章）は何かを考える。
一番大事なことは何か、を考える。まずそれを真っ先に考える。助走はほどほどに。
正しい見積りは普段から訓練してないとできない。
とにかく見積もってみる。
仕事の後で、見積りが正確だったかを評価する。
数量化できるものはおおよそでよいから数量化しておく。
例えば、関数の数、ファイルの数、ページ数、日数。日数の見積りは、土日を抜いて行なうこと。
たくさんある、というとき、 10 か 100 か 1000 かと、オーダー程度は把握しておく。
一個するのに一分で、全体では何時間かかるかと、見積もっておく。
仕事が一つ終わったら、それに何時間・何日・何ヶ月かかったか、ざっと把握しておく。
それを一人ごとで 「 これだけするのにこれだけかかるんだ」と口で言っておく。
たまに時給計算をしてみるのもよい。があまりそれに縛られないように。
数量化できないものまで無理にしない。
いいわけや粉飾はあとまわし。まずは（少なくとも自分の中では）正直な見積もりを行う。
タネとなる習慣を見つけ出し、それを拡張する。
まず、毎日必ずしていることを自分で見つけ出す。「新たにする」のではないのがミソ。それに付随させて習慣を拡張していく。
例えば、通勤電車がガタンと動き出した瞬間に聖書を読みはじめるという習慣。
例えば、階段を昇るときに主の祈りを唱えるという習慣。
自分の力を信用しない工夫が大事。
例えば、何の根拠もタネとなる習慣もないのに、「よし、明日から毎日×××をしよう」と決心しても、たいてい長く続きはしない。
飽きてきたときには、もう少し続けてみる。ちょっと目先を変えてみる。

結城さんお久しぶりです。 結城さんお久しぶりです。 （といっても私は毎日このホームページを見ていますが…） 今日はじめてこのページをみました。 疲れたら結城さんのページにきます。 そして、何かを発見してから帰っていきます。 私はこれから試験期間です。 ほどほどに頑張っていこうと思います。 （私は頑張りすぎる性質なので） それでは、またメールしますね。 （大学生 ）
身に積まされることばかり 読んでいて身に積まされることばかりでした。 人に頼まれてプログラムを書いていると、突然「 やっぱ変えて」とくる。 チャント聞かないでやると、あとで「聞いてないよー」という結果になる。
別に自分の評判はひどくてもいいけど、仕事がまるまる無駄になるのは勘弁願いたい。
でも、基本的なことばかりでしたね。結局人の言うことを良く聞く、ですか。
「 おもしろそうなのを先にやる」はだめなんですよね。
おっしゃる通りですが、少し、プログラマはつまらないかもと思ってしまいました。 （会社員）
休息は大事ですね。 休息は大事ですね。 プログラマの心の健康をみてからここまできましたが。。。 休息が取れない時期は何事もうまくいきません。 余裕のある生活が良い仕事を生み出すと思います。 しかしながら 現実はそうもいきません。 急な出張。急な障害対応。急であるにもかかわらず どうでもいい（と思われる）仕事。などなど。 急いでる自分はやはり変ですね。 少しおちつきました。 ちょっとブルーになってるときに ここに来れてよかったなと思います。 また辛くなったら来てみようと思います。 ありがとうございました 。

The IEA warns that energy consumption must be reduced
The prediction comes from the latest annual World Energy Outlook report from the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) .
It says that under current consumption trends , energy demand will also rise by more than 50 % over the next 25 years .
The IEA adds that oil prices will " substantially " rise unless there is extra investment in oil facilities .
It says the world has seen " years of under - investment " in both oil production and the refinery sector .
The organisation estimates that the global oil industry now needs to invest $ 20.3 trillion ( £ 12 trillion ) in fresh facilities by 2030 , or else the wider global economy could suffer .
' Unsustainable '
" These projected trends have important implications and lead to a future that is not sustainable , " said IEA chief Claude Mandil .
If investments [ in oil fields ] do not come in a timely and sufficient manner , there will be higher oil prices , and global economic growth will suffer
IEA chief economist Fatih Birol
" We must change these outcomes and get the planet onto a sustainable energy path . "
The IEA 's warning comes at a time when the Kyoto climate change agreement calls on developed nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions to 5 % below 1990 levels by 2008 - 12 .
It also cautions that oil producers need to double annual investments in their oil fields or else see another £ 13 a barrel on the projected price of oil over the next 25 years .
Economic impact
The IEA says this extra investment is vital to avoid the supply bottlenecks that saw oil prices rise above $ 70 a barrel in late August .
" If investments do not come in a timely and sufficient manner , there will be higher oil prices , and global economic growth will suffer , " said IEA chief economist Fatih Birol .
The IEA says the world has enough oil supplies to last until 2030 , and that the core issue is instead the need to improve the supply chain .
Greenpeace said the latest figures from the IEA showed just how important it was for countries to meet their Kyoto targets .
" The Kyoto protocol does n't amount to much in terms of emissions reductions but at least it breaks the curve [ of rising emissions ] among countries that have accepted its targets , " said Steve Sawyer , climate policy expert at the environmental pressure group .
" We have to work out the trick of how to get the US and the rapidly industrialising developing countries to break the curve as well . "
The IEA is made up of the 26 main industrialised nations who are the major oil consumers .
Intelligence officials doubt Iran uranium claims , say Cheney receiving suspect briefings Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Friday August 18 , 2006 Print This Email

The Bush administration continues to bypass standard intelligence channels and use what some believe to be propaganda tactics to create a compelling case for war with Iran , US foreign policy experts and former US intelligence officials tell RAW STORY .
One former senior intelligence official is particularly concerned by private briefings that Vice President Dick Cheney is getting from former Office of Special Plans ( OSP ) Director , Abram Shulsky .
" Vice President Cheney is relying on personal briefings from Shulsky for current intelligence on Iran , " said this intelligence official .
Shulsky , a leading Neoconservative and member of the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) , headed the shadowy and secretive Department of Defense 's OSP in the lead - up to the Iraq war -- helping to locate intelligence that would support the Bush administration 's case for war with Iraq .
In an earlier report by Raw Story on an OSP spin - off dubbed the Iranian Directorate ( ID ) , Lt. Col. Barry E. Venable -- a spokesman for the Pentagon -- confirmed that Shulsky was consulting for this new initiative as well .
" Mr. Shulsky continues in his position as Senior Advisor to the USD , focusing on Mid-East regional issues and the [ global war on terror ] , " stated Venable .
Several foreign policy experts , who wish to remain anonymous , have expressed serious concern that much like the OSP , the ID is manipulating , cherry picking , and perhaps even -- as some suspect -- cooking intelligence to lead the U.S. into another conflict , this time with Iran .
" Cheney distrusts the information being disseminated by CIA on Iran , " said one former senior intelligence official .
" The reports assembled by the Iranian Directorate at the Pentagon differ significantly from the analysis produced by the Intelligence Community .
The Pentagon Iranian Directorate relies on thin and unsupported reporting from foreign sources . "
In the build - up to the Iraq war , Cheney relied on intelligence almost exclusively from the OSP , which leveled allegations that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
This was later debunked , but no OSP or DOD officials were held accountable for what many believe was a " deliberate effort " to mislead the nation into war .
New Uranium Allegations : Adding to the similarities between the pre-war build up to Iraq , new allegations of Uranium transactions began aggressively circulating earlier this month .
For example , in an August 6th Sunday Times of London article entitled " Iran 's plot to mine uranium in Africa , " Iran is alleged to have purchased Uranium from the Democratic Republic of Congo .
" A United Nations report , dated July 18 , said there was ' no doubt ' that a huge shipment of smuggled uranium 238 , uncovered by customs officials in Tanzania , was transported from the Lubumbashi mines in the Congo .
" Tanzanian customs officials told The Sunday Times it was destined for the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas , and was stopped on October 22 last year during a routine check . "
The UN report , however , does not mention Iran .
It is only the Tanzanian official who does .
The article also quotes the Tanzanian official on his description of the uranium amounts found in each container and how it was located .
" This one was very radioactive .
When we opened the container it was full of drums of coltan .
Each drum contains about 50kg of ore .
When the first and second rows were removed , the ones after that were found to be drums of uranium . "
Experts familiar with both African mining and atomic energy have expressed serious concern about these allegations , which have been circulating for some time .
According to a source close to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the story is " highly unlikely " and " not well researched . "
This source , who wished to remain anonymous given the nature of the subject , explained that the main concern in the Congolese mines is environmental waste and how it affects workers and villages near the areas where the mining is done .
A former senior US official with experience in the region also finds the story improbable , in this case regarding the Tanzanian interception of a Congo - to - Iran based shipment and the amount transferred .
" My understanding is that the Congolese mines were closed years ago and that any mining now is purely artisanal , " said this official .
" [ It ] would take a lot of labor to produce the volume of uranium they are talking about .
The reduction ratio of rock to ore is roughly one hundred to one in the Niger mines .
I can't imagine the vein is any richer in the Congo . "
Still other experts took issue with the description of the uranium and its suggested purpose , including the sentiment that u-238 is " highly radioactive . "
Steven Aftergood , senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists ( FAS ) , an organization that was formed in 1945 by atomic scientists from the Manhattan Project , is doubtful .
" U - 238 is one of the isotopic forms of uranium .
Another isotopic form , [ for example ] , U - 235 , is used in fission bombs , " explained Aftergood .
" U - 238 is not highly radioactive .
On the contrary , it decays very slowly .
It has a half - life of 4.5 billion years .
That means that a given quantity of u-238 would radioactively decay by 50 % in 4.5 billion years .
So you could hold it in your hand without any adverse effect .
On the other hand , it is a toxic metal , and you would n't want to inhale or ingest uranium dust if you could avoid it . "
But the stories of Iran attempting to purchase uranium from abroad leave many experts highly concerned .
One official close to the United Nations Security Council explained that Iran has its own mines , making any allegations of imported uranium from abroad highly questionable .
" Why would Iran import U - 238 when it mines it itself ? "
The official asked Raw .
" This makes no sense whatsoever . "
Several sources suggested that the Iranian Directorate , as did its predecessor -- the OSP , may be cherry picking , manipulating , and even planting intelligence abroad that would support a case against Iran in the minds of the public .
Expressing great frustration , one former high ranking intelligence officer said " it is all the Neocons . "
Asked about the allegations of the uranium transaction from Congo - to - Iran , this source remarked : " Total bullshit . "
Wendy Morigi , spokeswoman for U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Vice - Chairman Jay Rockefeller , would not confirm or deny that the committee had received any information regarding the Iran uranium purchase .
" We can't comment on what briefings the committee has received , " Morigi stated in an email response .
Morigi did , however , explain that as with any sensitive information , " Generally speaking , it 's safe to assume that the committee closely follows everything related to Iran 's nuclear program . "

How to create a Ruby extension in C in under 5 minutes
By Peter Cooper
Many coders will reach a situation where developing a C extension makes sense , whether for doing ' heavy lifting ' , diving into assembly language , interfacing with other C code , etc .
Luckily , developing a basic Ruby extension in C is easy .
Note :
This article assumes you are using a UNIX of some sort ( this was all tested on OS X ) and that you have Ruby installed properly ( from source , ideally , so you have ruby.h available ) .
If not , you may be stuck .
First , create a directory called MyTest ( or whatever you want your extension to be called ) and in there create two files , extconf.rb and MyTest .c ( if you want to download pre-written sources , they 're in this tar file ) .
In extconf.rb , put the following :
require ' mkmf ' extension_name = ' mytest ' dir_config ( extension_name ) create_makefile ( extension_name )
This code is pretty self descriptive .
It loads up Ruby 's makefile library , sets up the environment , and creates a Makefile .
Next , create the actual extension in MyTest.c .
Here 's some demonstration code to create a basic module with a single method called ' test1 ' which returns ' 10 ' when called :
// Include the Ruby headers and goodies #include " ruby.h " //
Defining a space for information and references about the module to be stored internally VALUE MyTest = Qnil ; // Prototype for the initialization method - Ruby calls this , not you void Init_mytest ( ) ; //
Prototype for our method ' test1 ' - methods are prefixed by ' method_ ' here VALUE method_test1 ( VALUE self ) ; //
The initialization method for this module void Init_mytest ( ) { MyTest = rb_define_module ( " MyTest " ) ; rb_define_method ( MyTest , " test1 " , method_test1 , 0 ) ; } // Our ' test1 ' method .. it simply returns a value of ' 10 ' for now .
VALUE method_test1 ( VALUE self ) { int x = 10 ; return INT2NUM ( x ) ; }
For C , it 's reasonably simple code .
We include the Ruby headers via ruby.h , set up a variable to store the module in , and create two functions , one which is called by Ruby when it initiates the module , and the other is our test1 method ( Note that in the code above we define MyTest as a module , but you could just as easily use rb_define_class to create a class , if that 's what you wanted to do . )
Next we need to compile our hard work .
Make sure you 're in the MyTest directory and run ruby extconf.rb , and it should say that the Makefile has been created .
If so , you can then run make to compile and build the extension .
As long as no errors occur , run up irb ( or create a new Ruby program ) and test out your newly build extension like so :
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > require ' mytest ' => true irb( main ) : 002:0 > include MyTest =>
Object irb( main ) : 003:0 > puts test1 10
Et voila !
The world 's simplest Ruby extension written in C in under 5 minutes .
It does n't do much , it 's overly basic , but this is the springboard to greater things :)
Why Desktop Computers Are n't Going Anywhere
Latency is Bad
Lack of a Consistant UI and API for Dynamic Web Applications
The Status Quo is Comfortable
Powerful Computers are Cheap
Conclusion
Over the past few years , the web interface for creating applications has come a long way .
With AJAX and similar technologies , we now have the ability to have the browser interact directly with the server without page reloads in a more or less standard way , a critical step in perceived performance for end users .
Applications such as Google Maps and Spreadsheets , Writely , AjaxWrite , and Meebo , among others , prove that the web applications can perform at a level comparable to disk - based counterparts .
It would seem like the late 90's vision of the Network Computer is finally upon us .
And yet it is n't .
This infuriates many people in the software development world .
We deal in a world of absolutes , where there is one right answer and it is inevitable , at least to people who trouble themselves to think of such things .
Procedural languages give way to object - oriented ones .
Proprietary formats give way to open standards .
And desktop applications move to the web .
There is just something that feels right about this , like a ship emerging from a fog .
When it is in the fog it does its best to muddle its way through , but when it sees an opening filled with sunlight it suddenly knows the right way to go .
There are several things which prevent this from happening on a wide scale , however , some of which are either miscalculated or underestimated by people on the front lines developing the software .
Below are some of the hurdles web applications have to overcome to graduate to the next level of mainstream acceptance .
This one we all know .
The problem with all applications delivered over a network is that the network itself is unpredictable .
While it is neat to play with Google Spreadsheets to see what the guys in Mountain View are up to , trying to do real work in it is another thing entirely .
If you lose your connection to the net because your ISP trips over your wire at the central office , you lose what you are working on .
More likely , you will deal with nagging little performance issues as your AJAX calls are n't returned in real - time , or the Flash game on another tab in your browser sucks up all your CPU cycles and makes your page slow to refresh , or any number of other things that impact your browser and make your AJAX experience less than optimal .
The web applications just do n't have the same feel as desktop applications , much like Java Swing interfaces do n't feel like native ones .
It 's a fact of life right now .
This is more subtle and requires a little more explanation .
First , there is a difference between a library and an API .
A library obscures some functionality to let someone program at a higher level of abstraction .
An API defines a platform .
There are of course similarities between the two , but the bottom line is that there is not a consistant dynamic web platform that is accepted as a standard by normal users .
What we are left with instead are 299 different AJAX libraries with largely overlapping functionality and slightly different assumptions and design goals .
Building your application around one of these may help you from dealing with obnoxious things like browser detection and XMLHttpRequest object instantiation and may even give you some cool fading effects to play with , but it will most likely not make your application look like other web applications to end users or give you higher - level building blocks with which to build your applications and interfaces .
A quick rant : Developers ( particularly open - source developers ) believe that diversity in libraries and interfaces is a strength rather than a weakness .
I agree only in so far as the diversity eventually pushes standards into place as the stronger ideas are adopted and the weaker ones dropped .
To typical end -users ( the type you need to make any type of revolution mainstream ) having 10 ways to do the same thing is confusing .
Look at the window managers available for Linux as an example .
Should mainsteam users even know what a window manager is ?
Are the subtle differences between Gnome and KDE worth the fact that every newby book for Linux needs to dedicate a chapter to describing X Windows and how it decouples the presentation of windows from the lower level parts , and how you can choose between a million different interfaces despite the fact that you want the one that looks like Microsoft Windows ?
This stuff is confusing to people who do it for a living , nevermind people just looking to surf the web in peace .
This same problem plagues web development , where the large number of developers and the Not - Invented - Here syndrome that they usually have leads to everyone wanting to make their own libraries rather than adopt someone elses ' .
Our inability to establish de facto standards on our own is what lets certain monolithic corporations do it for us .
End rant .
I believe that the YouOS project is one of the first ( or at least most popular at this moment ) to attempt to tackle this problem head on , and I wish them luck .
I have n't seen their code to know how it works , but their site looks impressive .
It remains to be seen whether or not higher - level development will take place on this platform beyond the widgets I have seen so far .
If they get OpenOffice running , I am there .
:)
We are in a mature industry , and people often forget that the " Next Big Thing " does n't occur nearly as quickly as the " Last Big Thing " in such an environment .
At this point the players are pretty well established in the computer industry , and the costs associated with the current structure are both well - known and accounted for .
While web applications are being pursued for most in - house development nowadays ( replacing buggy VB applications with buggy ASP. net replacements ) there is no push to also replace standbys like Word and Outlook with web - based alternatives .
The current versions work and we already paid for them .
Plus we have a help desk that knows them .
Plus we paid for training in them .
Plus we have Active Directory and group policy already set for them .
Plus the CIO wants more money in his budget to spend , not less .
And so on .
While this is n't necessarily something that will hold back web application development , it certainly removes some of the exigency for going in that direction .
Web application supporters often say that less sophisticated users " like my grandmother " only use a PC for limited tasks , such as email or balancing a checkbook .
Naturally , these users would flock to a cheap thin - clientesque computer running web - based applications since they are cheaper and would allow them to do everything they need .
This argument is problematic because of a simple misunderstanding about human nature : People never want to feel that they are getting ripped off .
There is a reason Starbucks charges $ 3.25 for a 16 oz drink and only $ 4.25 for the 32oz .
People will pay a little bit more just to make sure that they get better value for the money .
This is exactly the situation the thin - client finds itself in .
If they are even available , the cost is only a shade below that of a full - fledged PC that comes without any of the limitations .
And this is a big if .
Most thin - client computers are only sold to corporate customers that have the ability to centralize a huge number of functionally identical machines , and even this is relatively rare .
For the most part , people will keep buying the best PC they can afford when upgrade time comes around , and that will be more than capable of running mainstream desktop applications .
Web applications have come a long way and are often genuine works of art .
A lot of ingenuity was required in taking a platform meant to merely view static documents online and turning it into a mostly fully - functioning operating system .
That being said , we as developers must be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves in extrapolating this growth curve .
If we want this work to result in a real desktop replacement platform , we will need the discipline to overcome the issues listed above .
Til next time .
In honor of my new glasses , here 's a photoshopped pic that makes my head hurt .
France quarrels with America not because the pair are so different but because they are so alike
NESTLING in a valley near Aix - en - Provence , Plan de Campagne is a familiar French landscape .
A strip of garish hoardings on stalks reaches into the distance .
Le Plan Bowling , a 30 - alley indoor centre , squats near the El Rancho Tex - Mex grill , a clay - coloured mock hacienda , complete with cactuses and sombreros .
Two McDonald 's fast - food joints rival Buffalo Grill , where poulet Kentucky and assiette Texane are served under a red roof topped with giant white buffalo horns .
All this is ringed by vast parking lots , crammed with gas - guzzling 4X4s .
Welcome to France , cradle of anti-Americanism .
Beyond the Romanesque churches and lavender fields of the tourist trail , France is changing .
Slowly , its way of life is beginning to resemble that of the country it loves to hate .
Over four - fifths of the French now live in towns or suburbs — more than in America .
Less than 4 % of the French workforce is in farming .
French intellectuals and editorialists may still philosophise in smoke - filled cafés , but their countrymen flock to Hollywood films and devour American brands .
American culinary sins — fast food , TV - dinners — are on the rise in the land of gastronomy , and with them child obesity .
Yet the more that ordinary French people embrace such American ways , the more the elite seems fixated with an anti-Americanism that runs far deeper than just differences over Iraq .
What is it about the French and America ?
France has no monopoly on anti-Americanism .
But no other country gets such scorn from Americans for harbouring the sentiment .
France 's defiance over Iraq explains much of this today .
But that disagreement swelled into an exchange of insults because it drew from a deeper well of American assumptions about the French — their unreliability , ingratitude , superciliousness — that are in turn inspired by the force of French anti-Americanism .
French anti-Americanism is unlike other European varieties , because it prevails not only on the political left but on the right too .
Anti-Americanism in Spain used to be a largely right - wing phenomenon , and the tradition is venerable among right - wing writers in Britain .
But only in France has it inspired the most potent strain of right - of - centre politics for nearly half a century .
President Jacques Chirac derives most of his support from this tradition , whose champion is still Charles de Gaulle , the president who converted France 's dollar reserves into gold and , in 1966 , defiantly pulled France out of NATO 's military command .
Some , such as Philippe Roger , the author of “ L'Ennemi Américain ” , detect an undercurrent of anti-Americanism going back to the denigration of pre-revolutionary America by French thinkers in the 18th century .
It reappeared , often as cultural snobbery , in the 19th century , and hardened into contempt in the 20th , most virulently among communists , as American industrial might grew .
A rash of publications during the 1920s and 1930s — “ L'Abomination Américaine ” ( 1930 ) , “ Le Cancer Américain ” ( 1931 ) — railed against the inhumanity of American life .
“ Out with the Yankees ! ” wrote one pamphleteer .
“ Out with the people and their products , their methods and their lessons , their dances and their jazz !
Let them take back their Fords and their chewing gum . ”
The sentiment has found an echo , especially in the columns of France 's national newspapers , ever since .
The durability of anti-Americanism prompted Jack Straw , Britain 's foreign minister , to call it an ancient French “ neurosis ” .
Scratch the surface of the denunciations from on high , however , and French anti-Americanism is not quite what it seems .
First , because it is an elite doctrine that is often not shared by ordinary people .
Second , because it is used by the political class more as a scapegoat for its own troubles than as a reasoned response to real threats .
And , third , because it implies that the French clash with America out of antipathy .
The real reason is rivalry , tinged with jealousy .
“ It is an article of faith among American intellectuals ” , wrote Thomas Frank , the author of “ What 's the matter with Kansas ? ” , “ that countries such as France resist Hollywood films because they are snobs , dedicated to bringing ‘ culture ' — in the form of arty , disjointed films — to the masses . ”
Certainly , French intellectuals cherish low - plot , high - art films , and the French Ministry of Culture leads a guerrilla war to defend such works from a vulgar American invasion .
But what do French people actually watch ?

From France with love
In the first 11 months of 2005 , the top film was “ Star Wars : Episode 3 ” .
The all - time top box - office film in France is another American blockbuster , “ Titanic ” .
On the small screen , French versions of American reality television and confessional talk - shows clog up the schedules , spawning the term la télé poubelle .
French teenagers download American rap to their iPods .
In 2004 , the person most searched for on Google France was Britney Spears .
The more American brands flaunt their origins , the better they seem to do .
In Carrefour at Montesson , a giant out - of - town hypermarket west of Paris , the bakery shelves are stacked with “ Harry 's American Sandwich ” bread , a sliced product that has taken the land of the baguette by storm .
In the nearby McDonald 's , Le road to America menu tempted customers not so long ago with Le New York burger and Le Texas .
Such is the success in France of McDonald 's , a chain that is struggling elsewhere , that its boss was promoted to reinvigorate the brand across Europe .
Existentialism on the rocks
The French seduction by Americana is not new .
The French fell for American jazz in the 1920s and 1930s , welcoming black American musicians who saw France as a haven from the racism at home .
Josephine Baker became a music - hall star in Paris .
Sidney Bechet lived his last years there .
Duke Ellington , Charlie Parker and Louis Armstrong were mobbed when they toured France .
American writers , too , from Richard Wright to Henry Miller , made a home in Paris , finding a reception and stimulation that eluded them at home .
Sartre and de Beauvoir adored America 's jazz , its novels , its films and its whisky .
Of course , a taste for American brands or popular culture does not necessarily mean a taste for America , its citizens or leaders .
Consumption patterns are no guide to affinity , argues Mr Roger : American brands are popular in the Arab world , after all .
Yet even the evidence for popular anti-Americanism is ambivalent .
For sure , 85 % of the French disapprove of George Bush 's international policies , according to the latest German Marshall Fund transatlantic survey , compared with 72 % of all Europeans and 62 % of the British .
Mr Bush 's French supporters are a silent minority : just 11 % would have voted for him , said one poll before the 2004 presidential election .
And today 's America — God- fearing , fixated by terrorism , militaristic — is not the Europhile America of old that a nostalgic France often yearns for .
Yet the French do not seem to generalise this dislike .
In one 2004 poll , 72 % of the French had a favourable view of Americans , more even than in Britain ( 62 % ) or Spain ( 47 % ) .
Some 68 % of those questioned in another poll the same year said that what unites France and America was more important than what separates them .
During the 60th anniversary of the Normandy landings in 2004 , politicians were frosty , but the people at large showed an outpouring of gratitude to American veterans .
Even in the 1950s , as anti-Americanism raged on the left , ordinary French people did not express hostility to America .
Between 1952 and 1957 , according to Michel Winock , a French historian , polls found the French on average unequivocally favourable to America .
Today America still draws the French .
Young French bankers , cooks and students head for New York or California .
Even French politicians cannot resist the allure .
On the left , Laurent Fabius snapped up a short summer job lecturing at the University of Chicago in 2003 and again in 2004 .
On the right , Nicolas Sarkozy , who found an hour to entertain Tom Cruise at his ministry in Paris , told a New York audience that “ The dream of French families is that their children go to American universities . ”
Even Mr Chirac has fond memories of a summer at Harvard .
He may rail about American cultural imperialism , but could not resist inviting Steven Spielberg to the Elysée Palace to award him the légion d'honneur .
So much for French disdain for the new world .
In truth , the allergy to America was always a rather intermittent complaint .
When we recall the fervent anti-Americanism of the left in the 1950s and of the right in the 1960s , we can't help but be struck by the transformation of attitudes and sensibilities that have opened the door to American mass and high culture .
The transformation of attitudes has even resulted in general support for American foreign policies .
Survey data show that while France manifested the strongest hostility towards the United States in the post - war period , it is now probably the least hostile of the European countries .
This was Ezra Suleiman , a political scientist at Princeton and astute observer of France , writing some 20 years ago .
It is easy to forget that Ronald Reagan 's America was widely admired by François Mitterrand 's France .
Even the French elite does not always feel compelled to stir up anti-Americanism .
Consider the revolutionary period , which Patrice Higonnet , a Harvard historian , calls the “ mythological age ” of mutual admiration .
French and Americans , intoxicated by modern ideas about liberty , swapped theory , gunpowder and manpower .
The Marquis de Lafayette , who was made an American officer and helped to defeat the British at the battle of Yorktown in 1781 , was a shared hero .
Tom Paine , an American by adoption , was granted French citizenship for his contribution to revolutionary thinking .
Benjamin Franklin was adored in the salons of Paris , and Thomas Jefferson was invited to sit in the National Assembly during the writing of the French constitution .
For sure , anti-American feelings later stirred in France .
French radicals were disappointed at the timidity of America 's revolution .
Yet French fascination with the young republic survived .
Disenchantment was followed by renewed admiration .
Lafayette spent nearly 13 months in the United States as a guest of various Americans in 1824 - 25 , before being sent home in a government frigate with a gift of $ 200,000 and the ownership of a small town .
In 1886 , President Grover Cleveland unveiled a gift from the French : a statue dedicated to “ Liberty Enlightening the World ” .
It 's a diversion
What prompted all this to change into 20th - and 21st - century anti-Americanism ?
Explanations include a clash of commercial interests , as American economic might grew and French clout declined ; changing views of common foreign threats ; and the two countries ' relative balance of power .
To these might be added a French sense of insecurity .
Anti-Americanism intensifies at times of French uncertainty .
It has often flared after French military humiliation — 1917 , 1940 , 1962 — or instability at home .
Striking positions of independence from America is a way for France to project power when it feels emasculated , something de Gaulle well understood after the American liberation of France .
Today 's concern about decline is another such moment .
Sure enough , a favourite posture among the French political class is proclaiming the need to build up Europe to counterbalance the United States .
Despite a recent thaw in Franco - American relations , President Chirac , in the best Gaullist tradition , continues to call for a “ multi- polar world ” .
On the left , the Socialist Party campaigned for the European constitution with the slogan “ Strong in the face of the United States ” .
Or consider the use of the term “ l' Américain ” by French politicians to discredit rivals .
Michel Rocard , a Socialist prime minister in the 1980s , was undermined by the label .
Today , Mr Sarkozy 's rivals on the right pin it on him .
The epithet is potent because many current French phobias — capitalism , globalisation , liberalism — are associated with America .
Indeed , Jean - François Revel , author of “ L'Obsession anti-Américaine ” , argues that French anti-Americanism , particularly in the media , often flourishes at the expense of self - examination .
The French delight in exposing American poverty , racism and ghetto life , he pointed out well before the country 's recent riots proved his point , when at home a tenth of the workforce is out of work and young French Muslims are isolated in suburban tower blocks .
America , he argues , “ serves to console us about our own failures by sustaining the myth that things are even worse there — and that what is going wrong for us comes from them . ”
Thomas Friedman , a columnist for the New York Times , kicked up a stir among the French during the stand - off over Iraq when he declared that “ France is becoming our enemy . ”
But is it really hostile to America ?
America is , after all , one of the few western countries with which France has never been to war .
Even de Gaulle supported America during the Cuban missile crisis , and reminded a joint session of Congress of the two countries ' history of shared values .
The country that supposedly scorns American capitalism has spawned global companies that feed the American army ( Sodexho ) , fit tyres on American cars ( Michelin ) and put the gloss on American lips ( L'Oréal ) .
In many ways , France and America clash so often not because they are so irreconcilably different , but because they are so alike .
The modern French and American polities may have evolved quite differently , notably where the role of the state is concerned , but both emerged as highly codified , anti-clerical , secular republics .
Both — unlike the dissembling English — can articulate unapologetically what their country stands for .
Born of revolutions , America and France each established republics inspired by Enlightenment thinking , and based on freedom and individual rights .
Within the same year , 1789 , both the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the American Bill of Rights were drafted .
Above all , each nation believed in the universalism of its model — the Americans stressing liberty , the French civilisation — and shared an ambition to spread it abroad .
The conviction among the French elite that France represents an alternative to the American way runs deep .
It forms part of the national mythology that has helped to shore up French pride .
And it explains why the French so readily pick on America at times of self - doubt .
Just listen to Dominique de Villepin , the prime minister , who came to embody anti-American defiance .
“ What an honour to be French , ” he wrote in a recent book , “ loyal to a ... responsibility to bestow a conscience , a soul upon our Earth .
Our democracy was built upon the affirmation of universal values , ” he adds , and France 's destiny is to enact “ our universal and humanist dream ” .
Such florid romanticism may provoke derision on the other side of the Atlantic , never mind how closely it parallels Mr Bush 's belief in his duty to spread freedom .
But the basic point is keenly felt among the French governing class .
It echoes de Gaulle 's “ certain idea ” of France , “ dedicated to an exalted and exceptional destiny ” , 50 years ago .
This competitive instinct explains why anti-Americanism was the natural flipside to de Gaulle 's effort in the 1960s to turn Europe into a French - led superpower .
As with de Gaulle , so with his inheritors .
Romantic rivalry inspires Mr Chirac 's determination to create a “ multi- polar ” world , and his resistance to Mr Bush 's doctrine of unilateral pre-emption .
It explains France 's desire to keep its own spheres of influence , whether in Africa or the Arab world .
And , incidentally , it explains France 's eagerness to see off others whom it considers to be encroaching on its domain , notably the British , whose first attempts to join the European common market were vetoed by de Gaulle .
Moreover , defying the might of America is a form of muscular self - affirmation , to be contrasted with the unmanly British tendency to jump when American fingers click .
To be pro-American for long would emasculate .
After all , what is France for if not to represent an elegant , pleasurable alternative to the American way , even if it does so as most of the country munches its burgers and goggles at its trashy television ?

The highest sounds are the hardest to hear .
Going forward is a way to retreat .
Greater talent shows itself late in life .
Even a perfect program still has bugs .
If it were not for laughter , there would be no Tao .
How could it be otherwise ?
Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of time and space for their programs .
Programmers that comprehend the Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals .
But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it .
Each language has its purpose , however humble .
Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software .
Each language has its place within the Tao .
The assembler gave birth to the compiler .
Now there are ten thousand languages .
The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning .
If the Tao is great , then the operating system is great .
If the operating system is great , then the compiler is great .
If the compiler is greater , then the applications are great .
The user is pleased and there is harmony in the world .
The Master replies : " That programmer has mastered the Tao .
He has gone beyond the need for design ; he does not become angry when the system crashes , but accepts the universe without concern .
He has gone beyond the need for documentation ; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code .
He has gone beyond the need for testing ; each of his programs are perfect within themselves , serene and elegant , their purpose self - evident .
Truly , he has entered the mystery of the Tao . "
" They are alive within the Tao . "
The manager said : " I should have never sent you to the conference .
Those programmers live beyond the physical world .
They consider life absurd , an accidental coincidence .
They come and go without knowing limitations .
Without a care , they live only for their programs .
Why should they bother with social conventions ? "
The answer exists only in the Tao .
Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds ?
Aware , like a fox crossing the water .
Alert , like a general on the battlefield .
Kind , like a hostess greeting her guests .
Simple , like uncarved blocks of wood .
Opaque , like black pools in darkened caves .
The master programmer shrugged .
" Then the design will never be completed , " he said .
" And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it ? "
The master programmer frowned .
" In that case , it will take two years . "
" But we need this system immediately or even sooner !
How long will it take if I assign ten programmers to it ? "
" It will take one year , " said the master promptly .
The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled .
" That is all good and well , but which is easier to debug ? "
" Not so , " said the programmer , " when designing an accounting package , the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas : how it must operate , how its reports must appear , and how it must conform to the tax laws .
By contrast , an operating system is not limited by outside appearances .
When designing an operating system , the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas .
This is why an operating system is easier to design . "
The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief .
" Surely an accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system , " he said .
The man smiled .
" I am stealing ideas , " he said .
On the final day of the trade show , the guard could restrain his curiosity no longer .
" Sir Thief , " he said , " I am so perplexed , I can not live in peace .
Please enlighten me .
What is it that you are stealing ? "
On the next day of the trade show , the man returned and chided the guard saying : " I escaped with a vast booty yesterday , but today will be even better . "
So the guard watched him ever more closely , but to no avail .
When the man left , the guard took him aside and searched his clothes , but nothing was to be found .

A program should be light and agile , its subroutines connected like a strings of pearls .
The spirit and intent of the program should be retained throughout .
There should be neither too little nor too much , neither needless loops nor useless variables , neither lack of structure nor overwhelming rigidity .
A program should follow the ' Law of Least Astonishment ' .
What is this law ?
It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the way that astonishes him least .
A program , no matter how complex , should act as a single unit .
The program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward appearances .
If the program fails in these requirements , it will be in a state of disorder and confusion .
The only way to correct this is to rewrite the program .
4.2
A novice asked the master : " I have a program that sometimes runs and sometimes aborts .
I have followed the rules of programming , yet I am totally baffled .
What is the reason for this ? "
The master replied : " You are confused because you do not understand the Tao .
Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans .
Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed ?
Computers simulate determinism ; only the Tao is perfect .
The rules of programming are transitory ; only the Tao is eternal .
Therefore you must contemplate the Tao before you receive enlightenment . "
" But how will I know when I have received enlightenment ? " asked the novice .
" Your program will then run correctly , " replied the master .
4.3
A master was explaining the nature of the Tao to one of his novices , " The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how insignificant , " said the master .
" Is the Tao in a hand - held calculator ? " asked the novice .
" It is , " came the reply .
" Is the Tao in a video game ? " continued the novice .
" It is even in a video game , " said the master .
" And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer ? "
The master coughed and shifted his position slightly .
" The lesson is over for today , " he said .
4.4
I find it tragic that the vast majority of people leave this earth too soon and spend too many of their years in pain and suffering .
When it comes to our health , we do n't pay enough attention until it is too late .
" I dream of a world free from pain and suffering .
I dream of a world free from disease .
Love life and live it to its fullest in happiness and health . "

Jean - Christophe Lafaille was the most gifted mountaineer of his generation .
Small , strong and fearless , he ascended the world 's highest peaks without oxygen or back - up ; climbing alone because no one else could match his supernatural speed .
Then , three months ago , with the 8,000 m pinnacle of Makalu in his sights , he vanished .
Jason Burke his final steps
On his last morning alive , Jean - Christophe Lafaille woke up perhaps the most profoundly alone man on the planet .
His tiny tent , specially designed for ultra-high altitude , was perched on a small ridge at around 25,000 ft on an icy shoulder of Makalu , the world 's fifth largest mountain .
Either side of the tent , huge rock and snow cliffs and avalanching slopes swept down to the distant valleys of the high Nepalese Himalayas .
There was nothing above him except Makalu 's summit , some 3,000 ft higher .
Lafaille had slept through his alarm and woken around 5 am , when he called his wife Katia to tell her he was now up and moving .
Ahead of him was a day that few normal human beings could have survived for more than a few minutes .
Even by the standards of this most gifted and hardened mountaineer , the task Lafaille had set himself was almost unprecedented in modern mountaineering .
Outside it was around - 30C , still dark , with a light wind .
The summit of Makalu would take 10 hours of hard and dangerous climbing to reach ; up steep ice slopes , through crevasse - strewn glaciers and rocky cliffs , gasping in the thin air at an altitude at which passenger jets cruise .
No one had ever climbed the mountain in winter before - let alone without oxygen , or back - up .
Lafaille made himself a hot drink , ate a little , stuffed food and water in his rucksack , pulled on his boots and picked up his ice axes .
Before leaving his tent , he rang his wife again .
And then the finest climber in France , arguably in the world , disappeared .
It was late January this year and Lafaille , 40 , was climbing in the hardest way possible .
He had no rope mates , no porters , no rescue team .
At his base camp , 7,000 ft below , there were three local Nepali sherpas with a radio .
There were no other expeditions anywhere near him , and no one else on the mountain .
Lafaille , as he always preferred , had the huge expanse of rock and snow and ice , and the cold and the wind and the great arcing vault of the Himalayan sky all to himself .
His only link to the rest of mankind was a portable satellite telephone - which he had been using to call Katia and his four - year - old son several times a day .
This is a story of love and death , of the complex and often difficult relationship that a prodigiously gifted , driven man such as Lafaille can have with a sport - a sport which for him was a profession , a vocation and a passion .
It is a tale of his extraordinary relationship , framed by the world 's highest and most dangerous peaks , with his wife , lover , closest friend , professional partner and the mother of his child .
This is the story of the short , happy life of Jean - Christophe Lafaille .
Lafaille was born in Gap , in the foothills of the French Alps , in 1965 .
He started climbing at a young age , inspired by the books collected by his father , a keen amateur mountaineer .
He quickly proved to be an extraordinary talent , forcing new and spectacular routes on the rock cliffs near his home .
Such exploits were not particularly dangerous - climbers protected themselves with a system of metal bolts set into the rock - but they were extremely demanding .
Lafaille 's compact 5ft 3in , 8st 6lb frame did not hold him back .
He was not very interested in drinking and going to nightclubs as a teenager , he said later , almost apologetically .
Soon , he graduated to the high mountains of the Alps , where he quickly proved himself .
The fiercely competitive French mountaineering milieu began to take notice when the young upstart climber began ' repeating ' some of the hardest routes in the Mont Blanc massif .
Such routes sometimes took days , though Lafaille cracked them with an extraordinary speed and technical proficiency that was to become his trademark .
Lafaille first climbed the hardest existing routes and then spearheaded a new wave .
The climbs took him into a vertical universe where , under constant threat of rockfall or avalanche , he climbed overhanging ice with axes and crampons , and scaled walls of rock using metal pegs only slightly thicker than a coin , hammered into minuscule cracks as holds .
Many climbs he did alone , setting up complicated rope arrangements to protect himself or merely relying on his own ability to avoid a fall of several thousand feet .
In 1992 , one of France 's top mountaineers , Pierre Beghin , asked Lafaille if he would like to go to the Himalayas to attempt a complicated and extremely challenging new route on Annapurna , one of the 14 peaks in the world that are more than 8,000 metres ( 26,000 ft ) high .
He was 27 years old and could only accept .
The trip went horribly wrong .
After several days of climbing , high on a huge , exposed face of Annapurna , a mountain almost double the height of Mont Blanc , a storm erupted and the two men decided to descend .
To climb down a vertical wall of complex terrain the size of Annapurna is as dangerous as climbing up , if not worse .
The two men began to abseil , fixing their 150 ft - long rope to spikes of rock or lumps of ice , then sliding down it , before pulling the rope down and using it again to descend a little further .
Occasionally , when nothing else was available , they used metal pegs or a piece of equipment known as a ' friend ' , which expands and takes a hold in cracks when weighted , to fix the rope to the mountain face .
But such devices are not foolproof .
Beghin fixed a ' friend ' and had just began to abseil when the artificial anchor popped out .
Lafaille was watching his far more experienced rope mate from above , and looking straight into his face , when the rope slipped and Beghin fell backwards into space .
Any fall at that altitude is usually fatal .
Beghin , carrying the bulk of the two men's equipment , dropped the entire length of the face .
Lafaille was left alone , with no food , no water and almost no equipment , and with an arm broken by rock fall .
It took him five days to climb down the vertical mile or more of rock and ice to base camp .
Lafaille later described looking out from the wall as he descended and seeing the lights of the trekking lodges in the valley below , a world of security and comfort and human warmth that seemed impossibly distant .
Pictures taken of the young mountaineer after the ordeal show him almost destroyed , a terrible hunted look in his hollowed eyes .
Yet he did not give up climbing .
I know Chamonix well , but I still stop the car when I round the bend in the steep road and the vast white wall of Mont Blanc swings into sight at the end of the valley .
It is , as ever , a breathtaking sight .
I can see the ridge at 14,000 ft where I once bivouacked , 15 years ago , ill - clad in borrowed clothes .
To the young Lafaille , Mont Blanc was a testing ground and a playground .
He would have seen the possibilities of purer and purer routes , each taking the most natural , the hardest , the most direct line to a summit .
He would also have read - as commuters read newspapers or traffic reports and farmers read fields - snow conditions , rockfall danger and the weather .
I have come to Chamonix to interview people who knew Lafaille .
Everybody knew him in a way : as France 's best - known climber his face adorned the covers of dozens of magazines .
Climbers in France are major celebrities , household names , almost pin-ups ; their exploits are major news stories .
France even has a minister for mountaineering .
The reasons for this interest are manifold : the Alps , the Pyrenees and the sun-drenched crags of the south of the country are all an integral part of the image the French have of their own country , as important as cheese or wine .
The men and women who perform such extraordinary feats among these mountains represent something in the national spirit .
It is no surprise to see Lafaille 's sharp , elfin features on posters in half the outdoor gear shops in the country .
A number of journalists - many of them climbers - have told me how , after the Annapurna tragedy , Lafaille went on through the mid-Nineties to push back the barriers of modern mountaineering further and further .
Not content with simply climbing the great north faces of the Alps individually , he did nine of them , including the famous Eiger , one after another without pause in 15 days , skiing from one to the next .
When his work as a guide and instructor in Chamonix allowed , he returned to the Himalayas to complete a series of difficult new routes .
Instead of climbing with huge expeditions , with ropes fixed to allow easy ascent and escape , and porters carrying tonnes of equipment , Lafaille often climbed alone , almost always without any support , and certainly without any oxygen .
All the journalists who had interviewed Lafaille described him as eerily quiet , modest , unassuming , friendly and gentle .
' Very different , ' said one , ' from your average screwed up , egomaniac , hyper - sensitive top - flight French climber , or any ultra - high level athlete for that matter . '
But though many reporters praised Lafaille , they did not all rush to praise his wife , Katia .
I had expected Lafaille to be the classic driven climber who leaves his wife and family to single - mindedly pursue a selfish and irresponsible dream .
But the critics told another story : Katia cut him off from his friends and turned him into a media star .
One went further .
On Makalu , the final climb , it was the media pressure that eventually pushed him too far , he said .
His wife was in charge of the media ... draw your own conclusions , he implied .
Harsh words indeed about a widow , I thought , but wrote them down nonetheless .
Yann Geizendanner is Chamonix's Mr Weather .
He has worked at the local meteorological office for 30 years and is consulted by many of France 's top climbers .
He began working with Lafaille eight years ago , not for money , but for the sheer joy of helping an extraordinary climber enter the history books .
We meet in his flat on the slopes above the town .
Through the kitchen window I watch the thick clouds coiling around the Bossons glacier , a mile - wide jumble of vast ice - blocks - seracs - and crevasses ; gaping splits in the ice that could swallow a house .
The clouds descend as the light goes out of the sky and night falls .
' Who was Lafaille ? '
I ask Geizendanner .
' There was Lafaille , ' he says , ' but there was also the Lafaille couple .
If Katia had not existed Jean - Christophe could never have been able to do what he did .
It was a combination unique in the mountaineering world .
It was thanks to the money she was able to bring in that he could climb like he did .
We were a team , ' he explains .
' Katia handled the media , the commercial side and the logistics , I did the weather and Jean - Christophe trained and climbed . '
This is not , I think , the image the critics have sketched .
Nor is it the norm in the slightly bizarre world of professional climbing .
It is not often you find a top - flight mountaineer with anything that resembles a settled and happy private life .
The travel , the drive , the ambition , the danger , the fact that even the most successful climbers do not make a great deal of money , all conspire to make profound relationships in the world of climbing rare .
And there are even fewer mountaineers who , like Lafaille , have children and , for good or bad , a partner who is an integral part of their career .
Geizendanner was as close to Lafaille as anybody , other than Katia .
After all , Lafaille 's life depended on his judgment several times .
The most astonishing example of Geizendanner 's worth came on the most important mountain of all for Lafaille .
In 2002 , he and a team of four climbers , all of them among the best in the world , attempted an astonishingly audacious new route on Annapurna .
Two turned back , but Lafaille and a partner , trusting a forecast from Geizendanner , pressed on .
For five days they climbed along a knife - edge ridge from which the slightest wind or mistake would send them plummeting to their deaths .
There was no way they could have been rescued .
But Geizendanner 's forecast was correct , their strength held out and Lafaille reached the summit of Annapurna .
He sat with his legs dangling over the face he had down - climbed alone 10 years earlier , after Beghin 's fall , and wept for the man who had died there .
It was one of the most incredible climbs of modern mountaineering .
Why did Lafaille climb ?
I ask Geizendanner .
' He told me that at altitude he would feel independent , autonomous .
He would feel his survival instincts alive .
He used to say that it was a pleasure for him to be up there .
But more and more he liked to be in Vallorcines with Katia and the kids .
He had nothing left to prove - to himself or anyone else .
Why did he climb alone ?
' Because there was no one as fast or as strong as him , ' says Geizendanner .
' Anyone else would have held him back - and in the mountains moving fast is safest . '
What about the supposed media pressure ?
Geizendanner shakes his head .
' There was no media pressure .
Katia knew exactly what she was doing .
She was careful to protect him .
In fact , she might have gone too far the other way .
The problem was that JC became a bit isolated from his old friends and colleagues .
Katia wanted him to focus on training , to not be distracted or worried by the groupies , the criticism , the jealousy .
She was the only one to whom he would really listen .
Alone , Katia would have done nothing ; alone , JC would have been a good alpinist .
But together they became a legend . '
How many of the climbers you know are dead ?
I ask .
' Quite a lot , ' Geizendanner replies .
' But they were not madmen or crazies .
They did n't have death wishes .
It was the need to be up high , and to prove something .
And , of course , they did it to earn a living .
If Lafaille had been the first Frenchman to climb all 14 of the world 's 8,000 m peaks he and his family could have lived off it for the rest of his life . '
Seven years ago , in the last serious climbing I did , I climbed to over 7,000 m on a mountain in the Himalayas .
At that altitude , every step was an enormous effort , and was followed by great rasping breaths .
My brain , starved of oxygen , took ages to cope with the easiest tasks .
It took me 20 minutes to put on my double - layered ice boots , dully wondering what the L and the R I had marked on them meant .
I had no appetite ( eating just granola bars or dried fruit , despite the intense physical effort ) but a desperate thirst - the need to irrigate my lungs and to offset my altitude - thickened blood .
Melting snow for lukewarm soup or tea took hours .
I slept in five or 10 - minute apnoea - ridden snatches , awakening each time panting like a dog dying in the dark .
And then there was the cold .
Lafaille plunged his hands and feet into buckets of ice cubes to prepare them for freezing temperatures before his climb .
I did n't .
I woke with ice on my eyelids .
The cold was intense enough to become a nauseating physical pain , the kind you feel when you bark your shins against a low table .
When three climbers on another expedition died after making an elementary error of navigation in a fog a few hundred metres from our top camp , I decided to turn back .
I have barely climbed since .
I was at around 7,000 metres for a day or so on an easy mountain .
Lafaille spent weeks of his life at altitudes much higher , often climbing extraordinarily difficult terrain that most experienced mountaineers would not be capable of even at oxygen - rich lower altitudes .
It is difficult to give an impression of quite how fit and mentally strong someone like Lafaille has to be .
Ed Viesturs , the first American climber to scale all the world 's 8,000 m peaks , was one of the few mountaineers with whom Lafaille was prepared to share a rope .
Viesturs , a lean and laconic 44 - year - old , was one of those who turned back on Annapurna in 2002 when the French climber went on to complete his extraordinary high - altitude high - wire act on his ascent of the mountain .
' I thought it too risky to continue , but JC went on and succeeded , ' he says .
' It 's a very personal thing .
There 's no right and no wrong .
He was a little guy but phenomenally strong , very , very fast and absolutely gifted .
He was technically the most talented all - round climber in the world .
He could climb anything .'
After the expedition , Viesturs and Lafaille became close friends , climbing together the following year on two other major 8,000 m peaks in Pakistan , Broad Peak and Nanga Parbat .
Even though the two men barely shared a common language , Viesturs said they ' could always communicate .
He had similar values .
He loved his family as well as climbing .
I like being with my wife , my three kids , my home here in Seattle . '
I ask Viesturs , who has been on more than 30 expeditions , how he reconciles a family life and his career .
' I have always been a professional climber , ' he says .
' My wife knew what she was getting into and I have always told her that I would be as safe and as conservative as I can be .
You can manage a risk .
A lot of people cause their own problems .
They disregard the conditions and go for the top .
The art of mountaineering is walking away .
Crevasses do n't care if you are famous . '
Viesturs rarely climbs alone , but did so on Everest ( which he has climbed six times ) in 1993 .
' It was a psychological journey , ' he tells me .
' It 's tough , you have nobody to talk to , but uplifting , too .
There are not many places on this planet where you can be so alone . '
We talk a little more - about the bitchiness of the Chamonix climbing scene , about how Lafaille was something of an outsider there and about those who accuse mountaineers , especially those with wives and children , of being selfish , egotistic , irresponsible .
' People who criticise are ignorant or stupid .
They should go out and climb fourteen 8,000 m peaks and then we 'll talk . '
Lafaille lived in Vallorcines , a small village set high above Chamonix .
To reach it , I drive out of the town , along the base of a valley flanked by huge mountains .
It is a dozen degrees below zero .
The clouds have cleared and the sky is a crystalline clear blue .
A thin plume of cloud is being driven off the summit of Mont Blanc .
Katia Lafaille is 36 , small , slim , lightly tanned and strikingly pretty .
We shake hands and I say , ' How are you ? ' and , as people do after a bereavement , she says , ' Fine , thanks ' automatically .
And then adds , ' Well ... not really fine at all ' and leads me into the old school house that she and her husband were in the process of converting into a family home when he set off for Makalu three months before .
We walk through a storeroom packed with the blue plastic drums used by climbers to transport equipment .
There is a set of skis next to the door .
Katia and Lafaille knew each other for several years before they got together ; she was a climber , too , her boyfriends were climbers .
' We were just friends , ' she says , ' but there was always a good feeling .
We finally got together on New Year 's Day 1998 .
It was a very powerful , very profound love . '
She recalls how , ' His eyes sparkled when he spoke about the hills .
Other climbers I knew just tried to prove things , to deal with their own issues through climbing ; but he just loved their beauty , their purity , being among them , he loved the people who lived among them . '
I ask why Lafaille climbed alone .
Katia 's answer is different from those of Geizendanner and Viesturs .
' Because he did not want to see another climbing partner get killed like on Annapurna , ' she said .
' He preferred to be completely autonomous . '
But like Geizendanner , Katia stresses , too , that such autonomy also meant safety .
There was no one else , less talented , weaker , to endanger him .
Quite early on in their relationship , Katia , who had worked in PR , took over the commercial side of things .
' Before , Jean - Christophe was just interested in earning a bit of cash to keep climbing .
He negotiated his sponsorship contracts with a quick conversation over a coffee .
He was an artist , not interested in material things . '
One of the criticisms levelled at Katia was that she had encouraged Lafaille to try and ' tick off ' the world 's 8,000 m peaks .
Mountaineering purists often sneer at the ' commercial gimmickry ' of the list .
Such criticism conceals two very harsh charges levelled against Katia .
The first is that Lafaille was ' ticking the list ' for sordid financial reasons .
The second is that if he had not been ticking the list - he had done 11 of the 14 ' 8,000 - ers ' - he might not have been on Makalu , and therefore might still be alive .
' Yes , ' Katia says , ' I suggested doing the 8,000 m peaks .
He said he did not want to get involved in a list , but I pointed out that each year he kept setting off to do another 8,000 m peak so he was up on these mountains anyway .
I tried convincing him to climb smaller peaks , but he said there was something special on the bigger ones .
He loved being up there alone , with the beauty and the emptiness and just him , his strength and skill .
So I thought , " OK , if you are going to do it anyway , we might as well do it properly , " get everything organised and get enough sponsorship so that he could climb with everything he needed . '
The point is quite simple and silences all the criticism .
Yes , Katia made sure Lafaille did what brought in the cash .
But she did it so her husband would be safer .
I tell Katia that I had heard that her husband was getting tired of the big mountains .
' To an extent , ' she says .
' When Ed [ Viesturs ] finished his 8,000 - ers , Jean - Christophe said that he wished he had finished his .
I said : " Fine .
Stop then .
Stop if you want to . "
But then he said that he was just interested in Makalu as a project .
He said he wanted to do it anyway .
It was , in all simplicity , just what he loved to do . '
And in her view , even the attempt on Makalu was very much feasible .
' He originally wanted to do a new route .
I said , " A new route ?
In winter ?
Alone ?
No way . "
And he agreed and switched to a route that has been climbed many times before . '
I think of something Geizendanner had said , about it being ' the couple Lafaille ' who climbed .
When he was high on the mountain , Lafaille used a small Thuraya satellite phone - it meant that he and Katia talked incessantly .
' Katia was in his head as he climbed , ' Geizendanner had said .
' They almost climbed together .
She could tell exactly how he was feeling from his voice , how strong he was . '
During the climbs , Katia counselled and coached him .
She motivated him when he was exhausted and , on several occasions , she got him to retreat when he wanted to go on .
On others , such as on the famous ridge at Annapurna , she was at the base camp of the mountain , and she kept him going .
' We were living a love that was extremely strong , ' Katia says .
' And he told me : " I have a dream life , I have a wonderful wife , a wonderful son , and I do what I love to do . "
We complemented each other perfectly .
He spent two months a year away on expeditions , but other than that he was at home or with us .
We grew an enormous amount together .
We had so many adventures to live , but we lived something that , if you are lucky , you know once in your life ... and at least now I have known it .'
We are sitting at the kitchen table .
There are children 's drawings on the fridge .
Lafaille and his four - year - old son Tom , were , Katia tells me - for the first time having trouble talking - extremely close .
I am suddenly aware of how raw all this must be .
Lafaille died only six weeks earlier .
' It 's hard for the little one , ' she is saying .
' He says , " Where 's Dad got to ? " '
When there 's bad weather he thinks it 's the storm that has stopped his father coming home .
I 've told him that Dad is not coming home . '
She pauses .
' I thought about what it would be like if he was killed many times , of course , but I never imagined the void , the emptiness .
The emptiness is terrible .
We had so much ahead of us . '
It is unlikely that anyone will ever know what happened to Lafaille on Makalu .
Katia recently flew over the mountain in a helicopter to see if there was any trace of her husband , but it is now very doubtful that his body will ever be recovered .
The probability is that he fell into a crevasse shortly after leaving his tent , not long after pulling on his boots , making a final phone call home and stepping out into the cold .
There would , of course , be no hope of rescue .
Just the silence of the high , high mountains an hour before dawn .
March 2 , 2006  --
A Colorado school is in upheaval following the suspension of a teacher who was recorded comparing President Bush 's rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler .
More than 100 students at Overland High School in Aurora , Colo. , walked out of class this morning to protest the decision to put geography teacher Jay Bennish on administrative leave .
The school administration made the move after a student went public with a 20 - minute recording of Bennish 's comments to his class .
In the tape , the teacher is heard saying there were similarities between remarks Bush made in his State of the Union address and " things that Adolf Hitler used to say . "
Superintendent Monte Moses told ABC
News affiliate KMGH -TV that policy calls for both sides of an issue to be presented to students .
He said Bennish 's presentation appeared unbalanced .
Sophomore Takes Recording to Radio Station
The recording was made by 16 - year - old sophomore Sean Allen the day after the president 's speech .
Allen said he had been disturbed by " political rants " he heard in Bennish 's class .
" So these kids are going to have notes on why George Bush is related to Hitler and why the state of Israel was founded on violence and terrorism , " Allen told KHOW Radio Wednesday when he went public with his tape .
" These kids are going to have notes on this and accept that as fact . "
On the tape , Bennish , who has taught in the Colorado district for five years , is heard quoting part of the State of the Union address : " It is our duty as Americans to use the military to go out in the world and make the world like us . "
Bennish continues : " Sounds a lot like what Adolph Hilter used to say . "
" We do want teachers to express their opinions , but to put that in context and to provide opposing points of view , " Moses said .
" All discussion must be fair and balanced . "
" [ The suspension ] is not a disciplinary action .
It is to give us enough time to sit down and gather all the facts , " said Moses .
Tustin Amole , a Cherry Creek School District spokeswoman , told KMGH that an investigation of the incident would take about a week .
Last time I checked the score it was Iran 5 — International Community 0 .
It is with much amusement that I now note the Iranians have managed to bag another goal against the international community .
The achievement here on the part of Iran is not that Iran has responded formally to the stix - and - karats proposed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council + 1 ( the nokhodi is Germany that has allusions of grandeur ) .
The achievement on the part of the Iranian establishment is that it said it was going to respond on August 22 and it stuck to the date of August 22 to give its response .
The Iranian atomic czar , the light - complexioned Mr. Larijani ( let ’s hear it for the shomali everywhere ! ) summoned the ambassadors of the 5+1 ( the pouting US was represented by Switzerland ) to the palace and in a regal gesture sent them back to their offices with a document containing Iran ’s non-responses to the aspects of the proposal .
It is a delicious irony that the Iranians , who are notorious for being late and unpunctual , to demonstrate such sense of time .
That cultural shift itself might be in the long run more important than any accomplishment that atomic enrichment could possibly garner for the Iranian psyche .
Also noteworthy is that the formalities took place in Tehran — not Geneva , or Vienna or New York , the institutional venues of Western hegemony and neo-colonial imperial structures peddled as necessaries of “ peace and security . ”
Iran handed its response on its turf , on its terms and at the time of its own choosing and , no less , in Farsi — and so , Iran 6 — International Community ( still ) 0 .
After many weeks of saying to the world that the US will not accept anything short of suspension of enrichment activities prior to start of negotiations , John “ the shaggy dog ” Bolton stated on August 22 that the US will study carefully the Iranian response !
Excuse me , am I missing something here — what is there to study , bozo ?
On August 21 the Supreme Leader of the Resolute Nation in Tehran declared that Iran will not give up enrichment and fuel - cycle technology and will continue this stuff with vigor .
What is there to study ?
The US has Iran ’s answer — which is a big fat bilakh (! ) c moslam ( buttered ) as the Russian version goes .
The condition of no pre-condition , brilliant !
Iran ’s non-response — all of its 23 pages — was delivered in Farsi .
You ’ve got to love it —
If biding for time is what Iran needs in order to master this cascade stuff and other technical matters , this submission in Farsi was genial .
I can only imagine the long debates that will now ensue because of the lousy translations that the various translators in US / UK , France , Russia , China and Germany will furnish — making Tehran object to the errors and misunderstandings and other such time - consuming and indeterminate linguistic pursuits .
Take , for example , the Iranian Supreme Leader ’s statement the other day about Iran pursuing its nuclear program with vigor .
The jackass in Tehran or somewhere else who translated this statement made it sound like Iran will be pursuing its program “ forcefully . ”
These are not isotopic difference .
There is a ton of elemental difference between the two words — the word “ forceful ” sounds militaristic , unnatural and obnoxious .
Anyway —
The time from now until August 31 will be an eternity for the Bush - league architects of America ’s kaka - diplomacy .
As President Bush stated with masterful yet mumbling oratory at his press conference the other day , on the 31st the US will get together with others in the Security Council to deal with the issue !
Great , more sitting down , getting up , lying sideways , spooning Chirac , massaging Angela , yo - yoing with Tony “ the Pretty Boy ” Blair and dickering with the Orientals — Russians and Chinese !
All that sitting around may or may not produce a sanctions resolution to isolate Iran diplomatically and pressure it economically !
Wait a minute — are these not the very conditions that have been imposed on Iran for the last 25 years or so ?!
You mean to tell me that there were things that the US did not prohibit ?
I am shocked , shocked , I tell you !
If the Iranians survive the additional sanctions and isolation ( which they will , out of sheer spite if not nerve ) , the Iranians will emerge from all this with a shitload of other self - reliant achievements that will baffle the West even more !
Maybe they will tunnel under the forever Persian Gulf and walk off with the Black Stone of Kaba .
The progression of Iran ’s geostrategic emergence today will lead to its becoming the central power in the next ideological “ ism ” as yet to be named .
What the West does not get is that the Iranian appeal cannot be analyzed or dismissed in terms of the tired old cliché of sectarian differences as to Shiite versus Sunni , or the national / cultural differences as to Arab versus non-Arab , or Islam versus Judeo - Christianity , or even international rivalries like US versus Iran , Iran versus Saudi Arabia , etc .
Iran ’s appeal today is the universal theme of friendship , lending a hand , standing up against the bully and for the oppressed .
Was n’t that a long time ago America ’s own appeal .
It is a shame all that has happened to all of that American moral authority .
Folks this contest will not end in a miraculous comeback by the international community , tying the score or going ahead , or going into overtime and ten winning by penalty kicks .
The sides are playing two different sports — the Iranians are playing volleyball and the West is playing dodgeball .
The contest has an asymmetrical moral imperative —
Iran is playing for honor and self - determination and the West is playing for unmitigated imposition of its self - righteous will .
I will not be surprised at all if in the final analysis the Iran Nuclear Enrichment Case ends up before the International Court of Justice — maybe even on Iran ’s own motion .
After all , is it not the job of the Court to decide if any international laws are being broken by Iran over this issue ?
Of course not !
Silly me —
It is the job of the President of the United States to be the judge , jury and executioner in the international system and it is the job of the Poodle - Four +
Tofailis to go headlong into another disaster of untold consequences .

After maybe 13 years of messing around with Lisp , on and off , I 'm finally starting to like it .
Oh , sure , I 've been lightly acquainted with Lisp 's technical merits ( at least some of them ) for maybe a year now .
I 've been playing around with various Lisps and Schemes , and reading some books on them .
And I 've always done a moderate amount of Emacs - Lisp hacking .
But until recently I never really liked Lisp .
Even when I did my little Emacs typing - test application back in July , I only thought Lisp was so - so .
There were a few things I liked about it , sure .
Most languages have a few areas where they really shine .
Well , some do , anyway .
But I 've always felt like I was fighting with Lisp and Scheme , and when I really need to get something done , except in Emacs where you have no choice , I 've always found it easier and more natural to work in Java or Perl or whatever .
I 'm starting to like Lisp , though , and I 'm finding I particularly like Scheme .
It 's quite different from elisp and Common Lisp .
But I still think of them all as " Lisp " , and I think that in spite of all the squabbling between Lispers and Schemers , they really are still Lisp .
In fact , fighting over them is like arguing the relative merits of , say , skiing vs. snowboarding .
They 're both a lot of fun .
Skiers and boarders target each other for jokes , complaints , etc .
That 's natural , since they 're the only ones on the slopes .
They 've got an entirely different set of problems than the kids on the inner tubes down by the parking lot .
The Functional Skiing Community
Actually , skiers and boarders are n't entirely alone on the slopes , just as Lispers and Schemers are n't entirely alone in their problem space .
There 's the occasional Haskell - lover on snowblades , or an OCaml person on telemark skis .
Lispers and Schemers consider them part of the family — it 's hard not to when they 're there on the same slopes , going off the same jumps with you , looking weird but competent .
But they 're a fairly small minority .
Is it just me , or do those telemark skiers always look like they 're world - class ?
I 'm talking about those long skis where the heels lift way out of the bindings , so they have an entirely different style than Alpine / downhill skiiers .
They always seem to be coming down out of the forest above the runs I 'm on .
Maybe you have to be world - class if you want to master something not many others are doing .
They also look pretty lonely .
Snowboarders clump together with other boarders , skiers with skiers , and so on .
This is partly just ( sub - ) cultural — boarders like the baggy clothes and all that — but also partly because the natural arcs skiers and boarders make coming down the mountain are different , so they have an unfortunate tendency to collide at high speeds .
Telemarkers ' tracks are different from both .
So telemarkers , at least in the ski resorts I 've frequented , seem to be out on their own most of the time .
But they certainly know their stuff .
I remember it took me a few years before I really loved snowboarding .
It did n't happen until I was fairly advanced , and could go down any " sane " slope ( i.e. some double - blacks — no sharp rocks or 20 - foot sheer drops for me , thanks ) without fear .
I thought I loved boarding early on , but each year it kept getting better , as I got better .
I never got past intermediate level as a skier .
I only did it for 2 or 3 seasons , and always used rental skis , so I was n't comfortable on black - diamond slopes .
I 've been boarding for 12 or 13 seasons now , and after taking some advanced lessons , my technique got dramatically better .
You never really notice how much energy you 're wasting by doing things inefficiently , at least until someone actually shows you .
That 's true of boarding , and programming , and probably just about everything else as well .
I 've sometimes wondered how master - level techniques are discovered for totally new skill domains .
Maybe some people are just naturally good at it , and a few are articulate enough to show other people what they 're doing .
Maybe some people have skills that carry over from other domains , so initially the best boarders might have been surfers or skiers or skateboarders .
And maybe some people have just figured out that there are universal concepts like efficiency and economy of motion that apply to mastering just about anything .
Who knows .
Obviously the experts and masters of any skill have a much richer , deeper appreciation for it than a beginner .
I suspect that in general , that deep appreciation allows them to derive more enjoyment from their art / sport / craft than people who are less skilled in it .
I do n't know that for sure , but it's what all the circumstantial evidence seems to say .
Clearly non-masters can have a lot of fun too .
But most things seem to become more enjoyable as you get better at them , and spend less time fighting with insufficient knowledge or bad technique .
You can focus that much more on doing cool stuff .
If your art or sport or whatever is demanding enough , so that even the masters can continue to improve , then it rarely loses its novelty .
You can have fun sliding down a slope on an inner tube , and I suppose some people can enjoy the experience for their whole lives .
But when you learn how to ski ( and it 's a lot of painful work ! ) , new vistas open up that you probably were n't expecting .
To kids on inner tubes , it looks like skiers are just going up and down crowded slopes , so it 's hard to imagine that it 's any more fun than tubing and building snowmen .
Even most skiers and boarders never become skilled enough to experience the breathtaking beauty and solitude of the back - country .
Or the profound satisfaction of controlling your path through moguls , jumps , trees , and high - speed chutes .
But it just keeps getting more fun , and it's clear that the boarders better than me are loving it even more than I am .
Struggling takes a lot of the fun out of things .
Late - Night Scheming
Lisp and Scheme basically snuck up on me .
Until very recently , even though I 've been studying and using them both quite a bit , I still preferred Java and Ruby , and even C++ or Perl , over Lisp for real work .
I just had n't discovered that back - country wilderness yet .
Part of the key to understanding Lisp is realizing that you wo n't ever see its strengths if you just try to write your usual stuff in it .
Down on the beginner slopes , telemark skis and world - class artistry are fairly useless , because all you can really do is slide along at 10 mph .
You do n't need any real sophistication until you try tackling the the mountaintops .
I stayed up late last night doing programming exercises in Scheme .
That 's certainly not what I 'd planned on doing .
But finally , after months of reading ( books , websites , source code ) and experimentation , something " clicked " .
All of the sudden I was obsessed with it .
It was almost like I was discovering programming for the first time .
That did n't happen with , say , Ruby .
It only took a few days to learn a substantial amount of Ruby , and I immediately felt happier about solving the problems I used to solve with Perl .
Same with Java : it was just a better C++ , and Perl had been a better awk / sed / sh , etc .
I got very excited about all of them , and I still am , to some extent — you can't help but love all languages a little , after doing 5 years of nothing but hardcore assembly - language programming .
But learning those languages did n't feel like rediscovering programming .
I 'll confess readily : Lisp me took a long time to learn .
I 've screwed around with Lisp for years without liking it much — at least not enough to want to do any day - to - day programming in it .
And even after embarking on a serious undertaking to become proficient with it , it still took me more than a year of reading and practicing before I finally started to really like it .
And then it happened more or less all at once .
In that sense , it really was like learning my first language .
One big difference may have been my switching to focus more on Scheme , recently , but it 's hard to say .
Maybe it just takes a long time .
Or maybe you do n't actually try as hard to learn things until you really believe , deep down , that it will be valuable .
I do distinctly remember when I decided that I really was going to use Lisp or Scheme for something major , the books got a lot more interesting .
It was a weird , instant transformation from " academically interesting " to " I want to learn this stuff right now . "
Even after I 'd committed to really learning it , Lisp still felt , compared to languages like Java and Ruby , a bit like trying to go from tubing to telemarking .
It was n't intuitive , it did n't make me feel comfortable or happy , and it did n't seem to offer much value over other languages .
Anyway , once I finally got excited about it , which I 'd put right around " yesterday " , I started making my way through the exercises in various textbooks , even doing those 3 - star ones at the chapter ends that nobody ever does .
I also made up my own challenges as I went .
I spent an hour writing three or four versions of quicksort , and I can assure you I 've never before had the urge to implement quicksort for the " fun " of it .
Another exercise from one of the books was to walk a code tree and compute the lexical - address info for all the identifiers , annotate the tree with it , and then reconstruct the variable name from its address later .
Um .
I typically like to write web sites and games and scripts and stuff — not pieces of compiler back - ends .
But last night I wrote countless tree - walkers , mini theorem provers , all kinds of things that I 'd heard of but never implemented , except maybe for specific course projects back in school , after which I promptly and eagerly forgot everything about them .
Last night , in one night , I did stuff that probably would have taken a week or two in Java , a language I 'm vastly more familiar with .
I 'll never know for sure , though , because I 'd never want to implement any of those things in Java .
They just would n't be fun .
I tried doing a few of them in Ruby , and it was n't too bad , but it definitely was n't " fun " .
The same algorithm , right after I 'd done it in Lisp , felt like work in Ruby .
Evidently the problems that Lisp is immediately suited for , right out of the box , are problems that are fairly painful in Java or C++ , and none too fun in Perl , Ruby or Python either .
That 's one realization , but it 's far from the full picture .
What 's also become clear is that Lisp is better at adapting to new problem domains than any other language I 've used .
And I have n't used other functional languages like Haskell and OCaml much , but I suspect Lisp beats them in adaptability as well .
Evolution is King
Perl began as a scripting language , but it quickly adapted itself ( via libraries and language extensions ) to become a good language for Web programming as well .
Perl was really the first flag planted on that new moon , most likely because of its strong text - processing capabilities and Unix integration .
But Perl tends not to be used as much for the Web these days ; it 's nowhere near as popular for building websites as PHP , a Perl - like language made specifically for the web .
They probably would n't have felt the need to create PHP if Perl had been sufficiently adaptable .
As another example , Perl has never made significant inroads into the embedded - language space .
Perl ought to be an excellent language for embedding in other applications ; i.e. an " app scripting " language , which is after all very similar to Perl 's original purpose .
But it turns out to be a lousy embedded language for lots of reasons , most of them boiling down to Perl 's lack of adaptability , which most people do n't notice because it 's got so many shortcuts for Unix scripting and Web programming .
So cleaner languages like Python , Tcl , Lua and even Visual Basic now have the lion 's share of the embedded - language space .
Java has proven itself to be a moderately adaptable language — either that , or it 's just had a lot of people muscling it forward .
It began life intended as a replacement for C++ on embedded devices , detoured as a rich web - client language , and wound up taking a good deal of the enterprise - server space ( and other domains ) .
And it 's well on its way towards achieving its original goal of being the dominant application platform for mobile devices .
Java must be doing something right .
C is even more adaptable than Java .
It 's everywhere , and you can do anything with it , although it really starts to break down at a certain size system — perhaps a million lines at most .
Java scales to much larger code bases , although it unfortunately eats away much of this advantage by being inescapably verbose .
Like my blog !
C++ is much less adaptable than C .
It 's large , nonstandard , ungainly , and nonportable , and it has horrible linking problems , regrettable name - mangling , a template system that 's too complex for what you can do with it , and so on , and on .
These things all hurt its ability to evolve towards suitability for new ( or specialized ) problem domains .
C++ was able to move into the application - programming domain during a temporary historical anomaly , from the mid-80's to mid-90's , during which software demands outpaced Moore 's Law for a while .
The balance is restored , but C++ is still hanging around like a crusty old aunt , because of all the legacy app code out there .
How C++ made it onto the server - side of the web , I 'll never know .
It 's hit the Peter Principle for languages big time : promoted far beyond its capabilities .
Designing for growth
What makes a language adaptable ?
Well , languages are how you say things , so if you need to start expressing new concepts , your language needs to be able to grow to express them .
In particular , you have to be able to express them cleanly , without having to jump through strange hoops , mix in a bunch of historical gunk , and write tons of comments that say : " warning : severe hack ahead " .
So that rules out Perl and C ++.
A language also needs to be well - specified .
If nobody 's exactly sure how the language is supposed to work , then it 's difficult for people to build tools for it , develop implementations on new platforms , and build a community around it .
Having a rigorous language spec was a huge part of Java 's success .
C++'s spec is very large , but is still filled with holes .
Perl 's spec is a printout of Larry 's source code , which looks the same in ascii , ebcdic , and gzipped binary form .
It 's easiest to make a solid language specification if the language is small , orthogonal , and consistent .
Again , this rules out both C++ and Perl .
If the language has highly complex syntax and semantics , then you 've got a lot of writing ahead of you , and your spec may still never be very solid .
Java has only moderately complicated syntax and semantics , and the language specification was created by some of the world 's leading Lisp experts ( Gosling , Joy , Steele , and others ) , so they were able to do a first - rate job .
In addition to relative simplicity ( at least syntactic simplicity ) and a thorough spec , another key element of adaptability is that the language needs to be extensible .
If a particular feature of the language is getting in your way in some new problem domain , then you need to be able to change it , or soon you 'll be looking around for a new language .
C provides a simple but reasonably effective extension mechanism via its preprocessor macros .
These proved very useful for a wide variety of problems not addressed by the language , such as feature - conditional compilation .
In the long term , though , it does n't scale very well , being neither very expressive nor very well - integrated with the language and tools .
But at least C has a macro system .
Java has absolutely nothing in this space — admittedly the C preprocessor was n't something you 'd want to copy , and C++ templates are just about the ugliest thing ever invented by the hand of man , but that does n't mean you should leave the problem entirely unsolved .
Now there are all kinds of Java preprocessors , code generators , huge frameworks like AspectJ , new languages for the JVM and so on , sprouting up everywhere , all designed to give you the ability to make Java flex a little .
The lack of a macro system may well be the thing that finally kills Java , in ten years or however long it 's got left .
Do n't get me wrong : I think Java 's a very strong platform , with lots going for it , and Java introduced ( or at least packaged together ) a lot of novel ideas that people take for granted now .
But a language has to bend or break , and Java 's not doing much bending .
Very little of the innovation in Java these days is with the language , and almost none of it has fundamentally improved its expressive power or its extensibility .
Java 's turning out to be the New Pascal .
Python 's a very adaptable language , and does well in just about all of the categories above except for macros .
It does offer metaprogramming , which lets you solve similar classes of problems , albeit not with any assistance from the compiler .
So it 's found lots of niches and has a pretty good user following .
Good examples of its adaptability include Jython ( a port of Python to the Java VM ) and Stackless Python , which uses continuation - passing for its control flow .
Python 's also frequently used as an embedded scripting language .
All in all , it 's a pretty darn good language .
Google uses it a lot , or so I 've heard .
Unfortunately Python has some flaws that may prove fatal , and which have undoubtedly kept it from being more widely adopted .
One is that the user community consists mostly of frigid , distrustful , arrogant , unfriendly jerks .
Was n't it Thomas Hobbes who first observed that communities and organizations tend to reflect the personalities of their leaders ?
Python has other problems , such as the lack of optional static types , although they 're talking a lot about adding that in .
But most of Python 's technical problems would be easily surmountable if they were n't such a bunch of kneebiters .
I could go on comparing other languages , but you get the idea .
Times change , and new problems arise , but languages generally do n't evolve very quickly : they always have backward - compatibility issues , ones that grow more onerous as time goes by .
The only way to keep up is to provide users with language - extensibility mechanisms .
Of course , defining functions and types is the main way people grow their languages to fit their problem domains .
Those two mechanisms ( functions and an extensible type system ) can carry you a very long way .
The Java community has gotten pretty far with Java 's simple class system , mostly through sheer willpower .
But for Java it 's beginning to break down .
People are using code generators ( EJB , WSDL , IDL , etc. ) , and they 're offloading processing that should logically have been in Java into XML , e.g .
Ant and Jelly , to cite but two examples .
Java has sprouted a powerful 3rd- party metaprogramming system called AspectJ , and it's on the verge of becoming accepted by the majority , which means Sun is losing control of the language .
Many other languages are appearing for the JVM , not to mention templating preprocessors like JSP .
Java interfaces and code bases are becoming so huge that they have turned towards " refactoring tools " as a way to help them move masses of similar - looking code around .
If Java 's so fugging cool , then why does all this stuff exist ?
That 's not a rhetorical question .
I really want to know .
Some people claim that Java is just naturally the best language for solving large - scale business problems , so Java happens to be tackling the biggest problems in the world , and it 's hitting scaling walls long before other languages will see them .
That 's not what I think .
My theory is that Java naturally makes things large and complicated .
So large and complicated , in fact , that it requires unusually sophisticated automation tools just to keep normal - sized projects under control .
Take a look at any large Java framework these days ( they only come in one size ) and you 'll see what see what I mean .
JMX is a good random example , since it just got added to Java 5 .
It 's hundreds of classes , thousands of interface methods , and several large - ish mini-languages passed around in String objects .
For what , you ask ?
Well , it provides a mechanism for you to monitor your app remotely .
Er , sort of .
It actually provides a mechanism for you to build remote monitors .
I 'd have thought that would be a relatively straightforward problem , and more importantly one that 's already been solved in various ways .
But JMX is all - new , and all - huge , and it's not even generic or reusable , at least according to its documentation .
Actually , I 'll get sidetracked if I spend too long on Java frameworks .
I 'll save it for another blog someday , maybe .
Besides , I do n't want to come down too hard on Java , because it has a LOT of things going for it that it does really well .
And , ironically , AspectJ may well turn out to be the thing that keeps Java in the game .
I had no idea just how powerful or mature it was until Gregor came and gave his talk , and even then his talk did n't do it justice .
I just happened to be assigned as his " buddy " from Dev Services , so I grilled him for half an hour before the talk , and again for half an hour afterwards , and listened to other people grilling him as well .
I 'm convinced now , big time , but even so , it 's going to take a lot of slow , careful experimentation before I feel really comfortable about its suitability for production work .
And besides , Java's not the only language that has limitations .
C++ broke down a loooong time ago .
It 's just a body shop now .
The standard quantity of measurement for C++ tasks is the " body " , and the units typically range from dozens to hundreds .
Complexity Boundaries
The reality is that every language has a natural , built - in limit to its ability to help humans manage complexity before it poops out .
Every language has a natural maximum size for systems that can be written in that language .
Up to that maximum size , things go really well , and you spend a lot of time focusing on solving the business problem .
As the system grows beyond the language 's natural complexity boundary , people start to spend more and more time wrestling with problems caused by the language itself .
The code base gets huge , and the perpetual bug count grows linearly ( at least ) with the size of the code .
All kinds of inertia sets in , as people begin to realize that making certain changes will require modifying thousands of files , potentially not in an automated way , because tools can generally help you with syntactic problems , but not so much with semantic or architectural ones .
It starts to become overwhelming , and eventually progress slows to a trickle .
This has happened to me twice now outside of Amazon .
The first time was at Geoworks .
We wrote everything by hand in assembly language : apps , libraries , drivers , kernel — an entire desktop ( and eventually handheld ) operating system and application suite .
The system eventually collapsed under its own weight .
Many Geoworks people still do n't like to admit it , but that 's what happened .
You can laugh it up , saying how foolish we were to write everything in assembly language for performance reasons .
But you 're doing it right now at Amazon .
Same justification , same approach , and already some of the same outcomes .
C++ is assembly language : low - level , non-portable , occupying no useful niche ; squeezed out on the low end by straight C , squeezed on the high end by Java and even higher - level languages that are now shining as Moore 's Law runs ahead .
I know , I know : you and lots of smart people you know disagree .
That 's fine .
You 're welcome to disagree .
I can't blame you : I and everyone else at Geoworks felt the same way about assembly language .
We were doing great things with it .
C was for wimps , and C++ was for Visual Basic pansies .
Performance was King .
We all have a blind spot for performance , you know .
All programmers have it .
It 's in our bones , and we 're very superstitious about it .
So I hear you , and I 'm not going to try to change your mind .
Everyone has to figure it out for themselves .
I did n't figure it out until it had happened to me again , seven years later , after building a very large Java application mostly by myself .
At some indefinable point , the bulk of my effort had shifted from extending the application to maintaining it .
Never satisfied , I did several months of deep analysis on the code , and finally concluded that many / most of the problems were intrinsic to Java , hence unavoidable .
I had been immersed for seven years in blind devotion to Java , seeing as it was actually kinda nice compared to the old assembly - language gig , and my findings were surprising and frustrating .
So I spent another year or so of my free time on a massive quest , searching for a Java replacement .
It was n't as easy as I 'd hoped .
Lots of promise , lots of potential , but precious few high - level languages that actually deliver the vast number of tools and features you need for building production systens .
Given that AOP can help with about half the problems I was having , Java is still a very solid choice .
There 's really only one other contender , one I probably should have been using from the beginning .
But I wo n't bore you with the details .
The point I was trying to make in this section is that all languages have a natural system - size limit , beyond which your innovation starts to slow down dramatically .
It happens regardless of how well you 've engineered your system , and regardless of whether your team is one person or a thousand .
Overall productivity never goes to zero , but that 's moot ; the point is that you started out strong and now you 're weak .
The natural complexity boundary for any given language is also a function of your engineering quality , but that can only reduce the upper bound .
The natural limit I 'm talking about is the one you hit even if your system is engineered almost perfectly .
Adding engineers can help up to a point , but eventually communication , code - sharing , and other people - related issues outweigh the benefits .
You might think your problem domain determines the upper complexity bound more than the programming language you 're using .
I do n't think so , though , because eventually all systems grow to the point where they 're huge , sprawling , distributed / networked , multi-functional platforms .
Back in the 70's and 80's , Unix people joked that all applications eventually grow to the point where they can read mail , and any that do n't are replaced by ones that can .
There was some truth to that .
Today , systems grow to the point where they speak Web Services and other protocols , or they 're replaced by ones that can .
I do n't think your problem domain matters anywhere near as much as the language , because in some sense we 're all converging towards the same kinds of systems .
What language - level features contribute to a language 's scalability ?
What makes one language capable of growing large systems , while a similar system in another language spends all its time languishing in maintenance - mode ?
Type Systems
If my 18 months of intense study have answered any question at all , it 's what data types are exactly , how they work , and why I 'm always struggling with whether I prefer strong or weak typing .
The design of the static type system is an important determinant of language scalability .
Static type annotations improve system safety ( in the quality sense , if not necessarily in the security sense ) .
They also help the compiler produce optimized code .
They can help improve program readability if you do n't overdo them .
And type tags help your editor / IDE and other tools figure out the structure of your code , since type tags are essentially metadata .
So languages without at least the option of declaring ( or at least automatically inferring ) static types tend to have lower complexity ceilings , even in the presense of good tools and extensive unit testing .
You might think C++ and Java are strongly typed .
You 'd be wrong .
Ada and ML are strongly typed .
C++ and Java have some static typing , but they both provide you with lots of ways to bypass the type system .
To be honest , though , I think that 's good thing ; type - checker algorithms are often not very smart , and sometimes you need them to get out of your way .
In the end , if your strongly - typed system becomes too much of a pain , you 'll find ways around it — e.g. passing XML parameters as strings through your IDL interfaces , or whatever .
It might seem odd that type systems yield such great benefits , yet when you make them too strict , nobody can stand them anymore .
The problem is deeper than you might suspect , particularly if you subscribe to the view that Object - Oriented Programming is the be-all , end - all of type systems .
Take another look at that JMX interface .
It 's strongly typed — superficially , at any rate .
But if you dig one or two levels deeper , you 'll see they gave up on the rigorous typing and highly - specialized 32 - letter identifier names .
At the lowest level , it 's all weakly - typed string parameters and oddly generic - sounding classes like " Query " and " Role " .
Almost as if there 's a query language frozen in that mass of OOP interfaces , like Han Solo 's face sticking out of the carbonite .
The whole interface is massively overcomplicated , and it seems to exhibit a sort of struggle between strong and weak static typing , right there in the same framework .
What 's going on ?
Is this really so hard ?
The problem is that types really are just a classification scheme to help us ( and our tools ) understand our semantic intent .
They do n't actually change the semantics ; they just describe or explain the ( intended ) semantics .
You can add type information to anything ; in fact you can tag things until you 're blue in the face .
You can continue adding fine - grained distinctions to your code and data almost indefinitely , specializing on anything you feel like : time of day , what kind of people will be calling your APIs , anything you want .
The hard part is knowing when to stop .
If you 're struggling over whether to call a method getCustomersWithRedHairAndBlueNoses or getCustomersByHairAndNoseType(HairType.RED , NoseColor . BLUE ) , then you 've officially entered barkingUpWrongTreeTerritory .
Over -zealous typing is a dead giveaway that someone junior is doing the design .
At the other exteme , not putting in enough static type information is certain to create problems for you , as you muddle through your nests of untyped lists and hashes , trying to discern the overall structure .
This is the central problem of Object - Oriented design , and of program and system design in general .
And if designing your own types is hard , getting a language 's type system right is much harder , because there really is no " right " — it 's different for different people .
Some people clean their homes until every last speck of dust is gone , and some people are a bit sloppier , but we all manage to get by .
It 's mostly a matter of personal preference .
This is why advocates of " weak " typing do n't see any advantage to Java 's interface declarations and fine - grained primitive types .
They 're going to unit - test it all anyway ; the type system is just redundant bureaucracy to them .
Why do you need ints and longs , for instance ?
A good system should automatically use the smallest representation it needs , and grow it on demand , rather than overflowing and introducing horrible bugs , as Java and C++ both do .
Having fine - grained types for numeric precision just gets people into trouble .
In the real world , numbers have distinct , naturally - occurring types that do n't really map to the primitives you find in popular languages , most of which chose their built - in types based on machine word - sizes .
In nature , we have whole numbers , natural numbers , integers , rational numbers , real numbers , complex numbers , and then an infinite chain of matrices of increasing dimensionality .
That 's just how it works , and you sort of want your programming language to work that way too , if you think about it .
Java 's Type System
Many Java advocates are very excited by the notion of automatically - generated API documentation .
Gosh , I guess I am too .
But because JavaDoc does such a great job , and we rely on it so heavily , many people tend to confuse Java 's type system with the doc-generation system , and they think that you can't have that kind of documentation without being able to declare Java - style interfaces .
It 's simply not true .
Java definitely raised the bar on auto - documentation .
But Javadoc 's output quality is n't better because of the interface signatures ; the quality is almost entirely due to the JavaDoc tags , which you fill in by hand .
The documentation written by humans is far more useful than the dubious declaration that a function takes two ints , or two Strings , or even two Person objects .
You still need to know what it does with them , and whether there are any constraints on the data that are n't expressed by the type signatures — e.g. whether can you pass in the full range of 32 - bit integers to the function .
But many Java enthusiasts have latched onto interfaces , and they appear to think of interfaces as the holy grail of type systems .
They know , deep down , that Java 's type system is non-orthogonal , inflexible , and not very expressive , and they ask questions about how to get around problems with it on a daily basis .
But they 're used to assuming it's how the universe works , so you do n't question it , any more than you question why you have to commute to work when you ought to be able to teleport there instantly .
( The physical universe 's constraint system sucks , too . )
It would take a whole book to explain all the problems with Java 's type system , but I 'll try to throw out a few examples .
One obvious problem is that Java 's type extension mechanism is limited to defining classes and interfaces .
You can't create new primitive types , and there are severe limitations on what you can do with classes and interfaces .
As a random example , you can't subclass a static method — a feature that would occasionally be extremely useful , and which is present in other languages .
And a class can't get its own name at compile - time , e.g. to pass to a static logger .
( Jeez . )
One that really irks me : there 's no such thing as a " static interface " — an interface full of static methods that a Class object promises to implement .
So you have to use reflection to look up factory methods , hardwire class names in your code , and so on .
The whole situation is actually quite awful .
As a result of Java 's whimsical limitations , you often find objects or situations in the real world that are very difficult to express in Java 's type system ( or C++'s , for that matter , on which Java 's is modeled ) .
Many Design Patterns are in fact elaborate mechanisms for working around very serious limitations of the C++ and Java type systems .
An even more subtle point is that every single element of a programming language has a type , even though the language does n't actually recognize them as distinct entities , let alone typed ones .
Here 's an example of what I mean by being able to tag things until you 're blue in the face :
Take a for - loop .
It 's got a type , of course : for - loop is a type of loop .
It can also be viewed as a type of language construct that introduces a new scope .
And it 's a type that can fork program control - flow , and also a type that 's introduced by a keyword and has at least two auxiliary keywords ( break and continue ) .
You could even think of a for - loop as a type that has lots of types , as opposed to a construct like the break statement , which does n't exhibit as much interesting and potentially type - worthy behavior .
A type is just a description of something 's properties and / or behavior , so you can really get carried away with overengineering your type declarations .
In extreme cases , you can wind up with a separate Java interface for nearly every different method on a class .
It 's pretty clear why Python and Ruby are moving towards " duck typing " , where you simply ask an object at runtime whether it responds to a particular message .
If the object says yes , then voila — it 's the right type .
Case closed .
Ironically , even though every single Java language construct has many ( possible ) types , Java itself is oblivious to them .
Even Java 's runtime reflection system is only capable of expressing the types provided by the OO mechanism ( plus some stragglers like the primitive types ) .
Reflection has no visibility inside of methods .
If you want to write Java code that reads or writes Java code , then you have to come up with your own object model first , and potentially wrestle with complex parser generators and so on .
Many languages that do n't offer you much in the way of static type annotations ( e.g. Ruby , Python , Perl ) still have tremendously rich type systems .
They provide you with more flexibility in defining your types , using far less code , and still providing the same level of safety and automatic documentation .
Declaring a bunch of types does n't make your code safe , and not declaring them does n't make it unsafe .
Types are just helpers , and making the right type choices is a fuzzy art , one that boils down to taste .
This is one reason OO design ( and , by extension , service interface design ) is so difficult , and why interview candidates are often so " bad " at it .
I 'll have more to say about types in a future essay , I 'm sure .
I went slightly off - course in this section .
My goal was to illustrate that there 's life beyond Java , that Perl programmers are n't quite as disorganized as most Java folks would like to believe , and of course that a language 's type system is one of the most important contributors to how well the language " scales " .
Language Scalability
I could list other factors that contribute to language scalability : the complexity of the syntax , for instance , is a real barrier to scaling , for many reasons .
You really do n't want a complicated syntax ; it 'll come back to bite you .
Perl , C++ and Java all have artificially complicated syntax : too much for too little semantic benefit .
Java is the least bitten of the three , but it still inherits a lot of cruft from C++ , which was designed by a rank amateur .
( As was Perl . )
The module system is another big one .
Runtime introspection support is another .
In fact , all of the choices made in designing a language , whether explicit or inadvertent , have some impact on how far the language will scale before your system becomes too complex for human beings to keep evolving it .
But all of these contributors pale in comparison to extensibility — i.e. , the extent to which users can customize or change the behavior of the language itself to suit their needs .
And all languages , bar none , pale in comparison to Lisp when it comes to extensibility ( or adaptability , as I was calling this property earlier ) .
It does n't matter how cool or sophisticated or far - reaching you think your favorite language 's extension mechanisms are : compared to Lisp , all other languages are orders of magnitude less capable of evolution .
Lisp is DNA
Alan Kay ( co-inventor of Smalltalk and OOP ) said of Lisp : " it 's not a language , it 's a building material . "
Some authors have called it a " programmable programming language " .
Some people say : " it looks like fingernail clippings in oatmeal . "
People have in fact said all sorts of amusing and interesting things about Lisp .
All of the descriptions fall short of the mark , though .
And mine very likely will , too .
But I 'll try .
Or at least I 'll try to give you the barest outline in the next few paragraphs .
Every programming language runs on a machine .
That machine is NOT the hardware , because all languages can be made to run on different machines — even assembly language , which can be run on emulators .
Programming languages are built atop an abstract machine conceived by the language designer .
This machine that may or may not be very well specified .
For instance , many languages have at least a few constructs whose behavior relies on the implementation of a system - dependent system call .
All languages have at least part of their underlying machine 's functionality implemented in software .
Even C and C++ have software runtime environments , and of course both languages also rely heavily on OS services , which are also implemented in software and supported by the hardware .
In fact , all programs run on a tower of machines .
Even the hardware , which you might think of as pretty " low level " , is actually constructed out of smaller machines , all the way down to the level of quantum mechanics .
OK .
Got it .
Programs in all languages run on virtual machines .
Languages also provide some amount of syntax : a set of input symbols you can use for constructing your program , a set of mostly - formal rules governing how you may arrange those symbols , and a set of mostly - informal descriptions of how your symbol arrangements will be interpreted .
Most languages limit you to the symbols in the ASCII character set , for historical reasons , and they 're gradually migrating toward Unicode .
But a symbol could be anything at all , as long as it can be distinguished from all other symbols used by the language .
It 's just a unique string of bits , usually with a predetermined way of displaying and / or entering it .
The machine interprets your program 's symbols according to the language rules .
Hence , all machines are interpreters .
Some of the interpreting goes on in hardware , and some in software .
The hardware / software boundary is flexible .
For instance , CPUs have started offering floating - point arithmetic in hardware , and video cards now offer polygon rendering and other algorithms that used to be pure software .
With me so far ?
Compilers are just programs that pre-interpret as much of your program as possible .
Technically they 're unnecessary ; you can interpret any language directly from the input symbols .
Compilers are a performance optimization .
They 're quite useful , and we grossly under - utilize them , but talking about performance would take me a bit too far afield today .
I 'll have more to say about performance at some point , I 'm sure .
Hardware is also a performance optimization , if you separate the notions of storage and computation .
Ultimately computations can be performed by people or any other kind of physical process that knows how to interpret your program .
When you hand - simulate your program , you 're the machine .
So " interpreters " are a much more fundamental notion than hardware or compilers .
An interpreter is a tower of machines , some software and some hardware , running at different times , all working together to execute your program .
And your program is just a bunch of instructions , specified by your arrangement of the language 's symbols according to the rules of the language .
Languages and interpreters go hand in hand .
Some programming languages are designed with the goal of being interpreted directly by the hardware , with as little intervention from software as possible .
C is such a language .
This approach has the advantage of being pretty fast on current hardware .
It has all the disadvantages attendant to premature optimization , but I can't get started on performance ; I 've already deleted about ten paragraphs about it .
I 'll leave it for another blog .
Some languages , e.g. C++ and Java , are designed to run on more abstract machines .
C++'s abstract machine is a superset of the C machine , and includes some OOP abstractions .
C++ has very complex syntax , partly due to inexperienced design , and partly because it made many concessions to hardware performance over people performance .
Java runs on a virtual machine , but it was designed to map very closely to existing hardware , so in reality it 's not so far removed from the bare metal as people tend to think .
Perl has its own complex , baroque , ad - hoc machine : the Perl interpreter .
Perl has a very complex syntax , with many shortcuts for common operations .
When you create classes and functions and libraries , you 're not extending the programming language .
You 're extending the machine .
The language stays the same .
If it was hard to say certain things before , then adding libraries of classes and functions does n't really help .
For instance , in Java you must double - escape all the metacharacters in your regular expressions , not to mention create Pattern and Matcher objects , all because you can't make any changes to Java 's syntax .
Unless you want to use the hundreds of non-standard preprocessors that have sprouted up precisely for reasons like this one .
Another example : you can't write logging , tracing , or debugging statements intelligently in Java .
For instance , if you want to write something like this :
debug ( " An error occurred with this object : " + obj ) ;
where " debug " is a function that checks whether a debugging flag is set , and if so , prints the message somewhere .
If you do this , someone will happily point out that in Java , function arguments are evaluated before calling the function , so even if debugging is turned off , you 're doing a bunch of work with that string concatenation : creating a StringBuffer object , copying in the string literal , calling a polymorphic toString ( ) function on obj , creating a new string to hold the object 's description , which possibly involves more StringBuffers and concatenation , then returning the StringBuffer on the stack , where its contents are appended to the first StringBuffer , possibly resulting in a reallocation of the memory to make room , and then you 're passing that argument on the stack to the debug ( ) function , only to find that debugging is off .
Oops .
And that 's the best - case scenario .
In the worst case , you could trigger a thread context switch , or a garbage collection , or an unneeded operating system page - cache fetch , or any number of other things that you really do n't want happening in production because of that debug line , at least when debugging is off .
There 's no way to fix this .
Even a preprocessor could n't do it for you .
The standard hacky workaround is to write something like this instead :
if ( DEBUG ) debug ( " An error occurred with this object : " + obj ) ;
where " DEBUG " is a constant in your code somewhere .
This approach is fraught with problems .
The debug flag may need to be shared across multiple classes , so you need to either declare it in each class , or export it from one of them .
The name of the flag appears right there , inlined with your code , and there 's no way to avoid typing it in hundreds of places ( unless you use AspectJ ) .
And it 's just plain ugly .
My third and final Java example : sometimes you really do need multiple inheritance .
If you make a game , and you have a LightSource interface and a Weapon interface , and behind each interface is a large implementation class , then in Java you 're screwed if you want to make a Glowing Sword .
You have no recourse but to manually instantiate weapon and light - source implementation objects , store them in your instance data , implement both interfaces , manually stub out every single call to delegate to the appropriate instance , and hope the interface does n't change very often .
And even then , you have n't fully solved the problem , because the language inheritance rules may not work properly if someone subclasses your GlowingSword .
The regexp - escaping problem is a lexical problem : an eval - time or compile - time macro system wo n't help you , because the lexical analyzer has already done its dirty work before the parser ever sees the string .
If you wanted to provide a way around this in Java , without using a preprocessor ( which is a hack ) , you 'd need an API that allows you to interact with the lexer .
That 's all .
Just an API , and a way to arrange to invoke it before the rest of your code is lexed .
The debug - flag problem is an evaluation - time problem .
You can fix problems like this either by adding support for lazy evaluation to your language , or by adding a macro system .
They amount to mostly the same thing , except a macro system lets you add some syntactic sugar as well , which is sometimes appropriate .
The multiple - inheritance / delegation problem is a problem with the interpreter semantics not being flexible enough .
It manifests later than eval - time , and it 's conceivable that you could fix it without needing to change the language syntax .
For instance , if Java simply had a methodMissing method in java.lang .
Object , one that was called every time someone tried to invoke a nonexistent method on you , then you could very easily implement your own delegation strategy .
It would be far easier to code , far more resilient to interface changes , and it would even allow you to abstract your delegation policy into another class , so you could share it with other classes .
Because no syntax changes are needed , the third problem illustrates a class of problems that can be solved using metaprogramming , which lets you change the built - in behavior of classes , e.g. by adding methods or properties , overriding built - in methods , and so on .
Three problem classes , three different techniques : Lexer ( or " Reader " ) macros , evaluator macros , and metaprogramming .
C++ lets you do a little of all three of these things with its Template system , and with its operator overloading , which is a limited ( but often useful ) form of metaprogramming .
Not enough with any of them , sadly , and it's too hard to implement what little flexibility it allows you .
But it 's much better than C's preprocessor , and it's a thousand times better than Java 's big fat nothing .
It of course would be infinitely better , being a divide - by - zero error , except that we 'll give Java some credit for at least not copying C++'s broken templates .
Ruby and Python offer fairly flexible metaprogramming models , but no macros or reader - macros .
So they 're both susceptible to the first two kinds of problem I mentioned .
Perl has ... I dunno .
Something .
A whole mess of somethings .
I know they do n't have macros , since they were discussing adding them on the Perl newsgroups a year ago .
Perl has some metaprogramming features , but they 're relatively limited in scope .
And I do n't think it has reader macros , although it may offer some sort of preprocessor .
I hope I 've demonstrated that reader macros , compiler macros and metaprogramming really can make your code a lot smaller , a lot faster , and a lot more robust .
Like any other language feature , you can abuse them horribly .
Unlike other language features , however , you can use macros and metaprogramming to fix broken language features , and in fact make the other features less easily abused .
No language is perfect .
The perfect language does n't exist .
A language perfect for one domain can be awful for another .
A language that 's pretty good today can be awful tomorrow .
Because languages are n't perfect , they need to provide mechanisms to let you evolve them to suit your needs .
A language 's extensibility is one of the most critical keys to its long - term survival .
Again , Java programmers would n't be using XML - based build systems , weird HTML / Java templating systems , code generators and all those zillions of other frameworks and tools out there , if Java had been capable of adapting to meet the needs of those users .
Why do n't most language implementers add macros and metaprogramming ?
They know that ultimately their language will face extinction if the users can't evolve it .
So what are they thinking ?
Sometimes they say that it's to protect the users , or make the language friendlier to beginners .
That 's almost always a baldfaced lie , because they then proceed to pile on horribly confusing features for " experts only " .
In a few rare cases ( Python , Basic and Cobol come to mind ) , they may actually mean it .
Most of the time , though , it 's because they 've made it way too hard to implement .
The language designer tries really hard to guess which features you 'd like , and they create a nice big abstract machine , and a bunch of syntax rules ( and parsers for those rules ) , and semantic rules for interpreting the syntax .
After they 've piled all that stuff on , their interpreter and / or compiler becomes horribly complex , and the language spec is horribly inconsistent , and they spend all of their time trying to think of ways to fix their busted language .
I tell you : they 'd add extensibility if they could .
But extensibility has to be designed in from the ground up , and it makes your system many times harder to build .
As if designing a language is n't hard enough already .
Was n't this blog supposed to be about Lisp ?
Yup .
And now I think I 'm finally in a position to explain why Lisp is the king of evolution among programming languages .
In stark contrast with every other language out there , Lisp only has two syntactic forms , atoms ( i.e. symbols , numbers , strings ) and the s-expression ( which stands for " symbol expression " ) , which looks like this :
( I am an s-expression . )
They can be nested to arbitrary depth :
( I am an s-expression .
( I am a sub-expression .
( We make a tree , actually . )
( Pleased to meet you ! ) ) )
OK , that 's Lisp 's syntax .
Most versions of Lisp add in a small handful of shortcuts , as long as they do n't change the overall tree - structure of the code .
And Lisp 's runtime machine only needs to support a handful of things :
anonymous functions , also called " lambda " expressions named variables nested scopes , one per lambda expression a single control - flow construct called a " continuation " some kind of I /
O
Lisp runtimes provide far more than this , of course , but what I 've described is the core of Lisp , and it 's all you need .
In theory , you do n't even need special support for strings or numbers ; they can be represented by chains of ( and compositions of ) lambda functions .
All operators and control - flow constructs , including conditional logic , loops , exception handling , multithreading , preemptive multitasking , object - oriented programming , everything can be implemented using only the five constructs above , and all using the world 's simplest syntax .
Try describing the " core of Perl " in anything under a thousand pages — and you still wo n't be successful .
The system above gives you more metaprogramming ability than any other language , but just in case that 's not enough power for you , Lisp has macros : both reader macros and compiler macros .
With reader macros , there 's an API to hook into the reader 's token stream and make any changes you like before handing the result back to the reader .
You can implement preprocessors this way — not just * do * preprocessor stuff , but actually implement arbitrary preprocessors for other people to use .
You can change the language syntax however you like : remove all the parens and use whitespace for indentation , for instance , if that 's what 's most appropriate for your problem domain .
With compiler macros , you can pretty much change anything you like about the language .
This scares a lot of people .
They prefer their current , very real pain to some imagined possibility of a different kind of pain .
Weird , but all too common .
Me , I 'll take the flexibility of macros , only hire great people , and make sure we all write good code .
Problem solved .
I 've learned how to use Lisp and Scheme macros , or at least I 'm getting a good feel for them , and they 're a LOT easier ( and more powerful ) than C++ templates .
Scheme macros use pattern - matching and template substitution .
It 's similar to XSLT and is n't much harder to learn than XSLT .
Lisp macros are just pure Lisp , and are very easy to learn , although it can take a long time to fully appreciate them .
The result : Lisp is pure DNA .
You can build anything with it , and you always have the ability to evolve even large existing systems in new directions .
And that 's exactly what you need , because your problem domain is unique .
But I do n't like all those parens !
I know .
I did n't either .
I only started getting used to them maybe a few months ago , and I only started to prefer Lisp to other languages a few days ago .
Do n't blame ya .
But with what you know now , it should be clear that Lisp 's syntax is a technical advantage .
For starters , macros need to parse and generate code , right ?
That 's why C++ templates are so dang complicated .
There are a zillion edge - cases to worry about , and that 's just in the syntax ; there are also lots of ill - specified semantic problems with them .
If you have a complex syntax , then it 's hard for you to implement macros , and it 's hard for people to use them .
Most languages , in trying to give you lots of syntactic options , have actually limited you permanently to using only those options .
And Lisp is tree - structured code ( and data ) .
It 's just lists of lists of lists ... it 's way simpler syntactically than XML , and we all love XML , right ?
Well , most people evidently do .
Even XML , with its allegedly " ultra - simple " syntax , is still kinda complicated , and working with SAX and DOM parsers is n't entirely trivial .
But it beats working with C++/ Java / Perl / Python parsers hands - down .
Trees are just data structures .
We know how to deal with data structures programmatically .
But most languages need to have their syntax converted tortuously into a tree structure in order to operate on it programmatically , and by then it's far less recognizable than the original language .
With half a day of work , you could implement XPath expressions to operate on your Lisp code , and start building your own refactoring and analysis tools , rather than waiting around for months , hoping someone else will build them for your Java IDE .
In fact , traversing Lisp code is simple enough to do almost trivially in any language — but it 's far easier in Lisp .
So writing Lisp macros and evolving the language to suit your needs is so natural that you wind up doing it all the time , almost from the beginning of a project .
The upshot is that your language gradually winds up being tailored precisely to the system you 're building .
That 's why Emacs - Lisp looks so different from Common Lisp .
It 's not so different , really , and it supports many features of Common Lisp , even though they differ in a few core areas ( as elisp is older , and RMS does n't care for CL ) .
But Emacs - Lisp has tons of specialized language features designed specifically for editors .
In fact , although I do n't have firsthand evidence of this yet , I suspect that the size of Lisp systems tends to grow logarithmically with the size of the feature set .
Or maybe an nth - root function .
But definitely less than linearly , because unlike in Java , where refactoring tends to make the code base larger , refactoring Lisp code makes it smaller .
Lisp has far more abstraction power than Java .
I noticed ten years ago that even though Perl seems superficially concise and expressive , the reality is that adding more features to a Perl system makes the code base grow ( roughly ) linearly .
Need a feature , add a function .
Need a system , add a module .
It never seems to get easier as your system grows .
And Java is even worse ; the code grows at a ( slightly ) greater - than - linear rate as a function of the feature set , because unanticipated design changes can't be bridged with programming or macros , and you wind up having to build the bridges using huge frameworks of objects and interfaces .
So Lisp may seem like it's no better than Perl or Java for small programs — possibly worse , depending on the program .
But that 's missing the point :
Lisp only shines when you use it to build a system that would have been huge in another language .
Every sufficiently large problem domain ( from JMX to ordering coffee at Starbucks ) is best expressed using custom mini-languages , and Lisp lets you build them easily and naturally .
OK , fine .
But I do n't want to implement a whole language .
Just because you can implement specialized language extensions in Lisp does n't mean that you need to .
Common Lisp and Scheme implementations have huge libraries of carefully - chosen , powerful features .
Many of these features are unavailable in Java and C++ , and some can be expressed in those languages only indirectly .
Hence , ironically , Java and C++ programmers wind up implementing new languages , very awkwardly , using " design patterns " and other heavy frameworks , layering on classes and interfaces in an attempt to build a machine powerful enough to emulate a subset of Common Lisp .
As a language platform , Common Lisp is on par with C++ or Java .
It 's the only language I 've found , out of the 20 or 30 that I investigated , that I 'd consider to be " production quality " .
Even Erlang , which is very mature , still worries me a bit .
And Common Lisp is Lisp , which means it will gradually change its shape to fit your problem space in the most natural way .
Common Lisp and many Scheme implementations sport powerful compilers , state - of - the - art garbage collectors , rich IDEs , documentation generators , profilers , and all the other stuff you 've come to expect of production - quality languages .
They have powerful type systems with the ability to declare static types as desired , to improve performance or readability .
There are multiple commercial and free / open - source implementations for both languages .
Common Lisp is production - quality and has been for at least as long as C++ ;
Scheme is less ready for prime - time , although it 's gradually getting there .
If I were using Common Lisp , I 'd definitely miss one or two features from Java , and I 'd have to take a few days to implement them .
After all that , I still do n't believe you .
You 're weird .
I know .
Do n't sweat it .
It 's just a blog .
I disagree with the previous caller .
I want to use Common Lisp at Amazon !
In a word : No .
Languages need large communities on site to do well .
And you should n't underestimate the difficulty of learning Lisp .
It generally takes longer to master than even C++ or Perl .
Well , about as long , anyway .
We do have a fair number of experienced Lispers scattered about Amazon — maybe thirty or so , more if you count Emacs - Lisp hackers .
But you 'd really need a bunch of them in your group , not just scattered around , in order to get the right critical mass on your team .
And even then , it would be a highly questionable decision .
People would be watching you constantly , waiting for you to fail , because most people do n't like Lisp and they do n't want it to succeed .
I was one of those people not too long ago .
I was looking for the perfect language , and I never suspected the best candidate would be the one that looks like oatmeal with fingernail clippings .
I know * exactly * how Lisp - dislikers feel , and I do n't really blame them .
And when you failed , e.g. your service had some sort of highly public outage ( as ALL services do , but that would be overlooked ) , Common Lisp would go on trial , and would be ceremoniously burned at the stake , as a warning to any other would - be Lispers out there .
It has happened at many other companies ( Yahoo , NASA and JPL come to mind , but there are many of them ) , and it would happen here .
If you somehow managed to get a team of good Lisp hackers together , and you somehow hid the fact that you 're using it , and you were lucky enough to have C++ neighbors who have all the outages , then you might get away with it .
But if you did n't get away with it , Lispers would hate you for giving it a bad ( well , worse ) name .
Languages are religions , political campaigns , and social communities , all rolled into one .
Never underestimate the ability of one language community to gang up and kill another one .
Java , Perl and C++ only thrived here after well over a hundred people per language more or less simultaneously just started using them , and screw you if you think they 're not doing their job .
Incidentally , none of our core three languages were allowed at Amazon for the first few years .
The only languages allowed were C and Lisp .
Lisp was mostly used for huge , much - loved customer - service application called Mailman .
Mailman was later hastily rewritten as a somewhat less - loved customer - service application : one that did n't have quite as much mail - composition functionality , but at least it was in Java , which solved the embarrassing problem that nobody in CS Apps at the time knew much Lisp .
The point is that C++ , Perl and Java did n't just show up , they barged right through the front door : first Perl , then C++ , then Java , and it took a LONG time before Java folks were viewed as first - class citizens .
It 's taken them even longer to try to integrate with the existing systems , e.g. the build systems , which were written mostly to solve horrible build / link problems with C++ that do n't really exist in Java .
You really do n't want to go there .
One individual recently tried doing a highly visible internal project in Ruby , and it barfed in a highly public way on its first day of operation ; now the Ruby community is mad because it makes Ruby look bad , when Ruby had nothing to do with it .
It was a poor decision on the engineer 's part .
Not because there 's anything wrong with Ruby , but because we do n't have enough experience with it at Amazon to understand its idioms and performance characteristics , and also because very few people have much experience with it here .
Languages need to " bake " for a few years before they become ready for prime - time at Amazon .
They need to be available for personal scripting and productivity tools , and eventually people will start dabbling with getting their feet wet with small systems .
Over time , as the systems prove themselves , larger ones are built , and eventually the painful transition to " trusted , first - class language " completes , typically about five years after its first introduction .
Today , there are only three languages that have been well - tested enough in our environment to be considered stable : C , Java , and Perl .
And I suppose some people use C++ , even though " stable " is n't a very good word for the systems produced with it .
For general - purpose programming , and particularly for services that other teams rely on , those are the only languages * I* would use .
If a hundred people stood up and announced they were going to start using Common Lisp , I 'd probably stand up with them — after asking around to see how well they actually knew it .
But it ai n't gonna happen .
So do n't get too carried away .
This is just a speculative blog .
Lisp is a cool language , or at least it appears to have great potential .
It 's worth a look , and maybe even a second look .
But do n't touch , just look !
That Ruby incident has made all the language enthusiasts a bit paranoid , and we 're going to be a little extra jumpy for a while .

" Compiler macro " actually means something specific in Common Lisp ( see the second paragraph ) :
http://olympus.het.brown.edu/doc/gclinfo-html/gcl_3.html#SEC190
What you refer to as compiler macros are normally called " macros " without special qualifications .
You can probably safely call them " interpreter macros " .
Did n't we actually compile our early C code with a C++ compiler , to get better typechecking ?

Xurf kuzl farq lozy !
You do n't understand ?
Well , I 'm taking advantage of a hypothetical framework for extending English in fundamental ways .
Unbeknownst to you , " kuzl " is part of a new grammatical construct that makes expressing recursive ideas much more natural .
I have heard enough smart people describe the profundity of their experiences with LISP to believe that it's a lot more awesome than I currently realize .
But when the selling point is how radically you can redefine the language , I feel like they miss the value of language consistency , which translates into being able to read foreign code and know what the hell is going on .
In your first Java example , you wrote one line of code , and with that alone you were able to explain exactly what Java does to evaluate that line .
Any experienced Java programmer in the world would be able to tell you the same thing , just by looking at that one line .
Now pretend that you 're up at 2 AM trying to debug some system that you just inherited , the guy who wrote it is no longer with the company , you know he 's a smart guy but sometimes too clever for his own good .
And you have somehow localized the problem to this line :
( make - it - happen ( widget - functor asin ) ( map make - it - happen data ) )
I do n't know enough crazy things you can do with LISP to come up with a plausible example , but you get the idea .
How much other code will you have to read to even discover what * sort * of thing this does ?
I believe there is value in language consistency , namely that it makes it very transparent what your code is actually doing .
Not that you necessarily understand * why * it 's doing what it 's doing , but you at least know * what * it 's doing .
If LISP really gives you the expressive power to implement Perl with LISP macros , then I hardly see how it could be consistent enough to allow a large group of people to share / maintain LISP code .
Unless you restrain yourself from making these deep extensions to the language , but then why waste your time writing clunky things like ( setq x 1 ) when you could just write x = 1 ?

Hey Steve ,
Which Scheme environment have you been using ?
I 've been playing around with a couple of them .
PLTScheme , Scheme48 / scsh and SISC appear to be the more complete ones I 've found so far .
Posted by : Daniel C. at February 8 , 2005 12:03 AM
Josh : I put a comment here that tried to do some more explaining .
Then I re-read my entry , and I see now that I 'd just be repeating myself .
I do n't think it 's possible to be convinced of the benefits of Lisp by reading about it , or by tinkering a little with it .
You just have to do a bunch of it .
Lots .
Tons .
Then eventually it clicks .
That 's why I called this blog " Scheming is Believing . "
So if my explanations were n't compelling , and I seriously doubt they were , then do n't sweat it .
It 's just a blog .

Daniel —
I 've been mostly using Kawa , a Scheme for the JVM that compiles to bytecodes , although I would n't really recommend it .
It 's not a full Scheme implementation yet — e.g. continuations are upward - only , and it has an incomplete set of SRFIs , and lots of bugs in general .
Kawa 's got a lot of long - term potential , but it 's not useful for production - quality work in either Java or Scheme .
I looked at the info pages for MIT Scheme recently , and they 've implemented a LOT of features from other languages — e.g. list comprehensions like Haskell's .
For commercial implementations , Chez Scheme is allegedly the best .
Fast , complete , portable , and actively developed .
All the Schemes implement a different feature set , and the code from one does n't always run immediately on another .
This is a serious problem with Scheme in general , and I believe it currently renders Scheme unsuitable for production work .
But I 'm gradually working on figuring out if any of them is promising enough to try to work with .
Posted by : Steve Yegge at February 8 , 2005 01:18 AM
In response to Josh Haberman 's comment about considering this line of code :
( make - it - happen ( widget - functor asin ) ( map make - it - happen data ) )
What would you do if you were staring at this line of code :
if ( ( * self -> mark_funcs [d ] ) ( self , changed_field_number ) != SUCCESS ) return FAILURE ;
{pointer to actual Amazon function containing this code}
... trying to figure out why the tax was computed incorrectly !
My point is that any language can be obfuscated and it seems to be pretty popular in both perl and C .
Steve -
I completely agree that lisp 's macro system sets it apart and gives the language more power .
Also , I like the fact that scheme is so " light - weight " because it comes with a tiny library .
However , big bulky libraries are also power .
It can become difficult to integrate many different libraries into your application if they have over - lapping problem domains ( with different implementations ) .
So , Common Lisp is very nice in the fact that many common functions are already available to you .
Of course small vs big libraries is a problem with any language .
So , when is the Scheme Codigo implementation going to be ready ?

IEs4 Linux is the simpler way to have Microsoft Internet Explorer running on Linux ( or any OS running Wine ) .
No clicks needed .
No boring setup processes .
No Wine complications .
Just one easy script and you 'll get three IE versions to test your Sites .
And it 's free and open source .
This may be very helpful for software developers and web developers to test their applications .
IEs4Linux Installation in Debian
Before installing Internet Explorer you need to install the following packages
#apt - get install wine cabextract
Now youi need to download IEs4 Linux script from here
$ wget http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/downloads/ies4linux-2.0.3.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf ies4linux - 2.0.3.tar.gz
$cd ies4linux - 2.0.3
Once you are inside ies4linux - 2.0.3 directory you need to run the following script to install internet explorer
$./ies4linux
This will install the internet explore in your machine and after the end of installation it will give you from where you need to run IE6 .
from my machine i am using the following
$ /root/bin/ie6
This will open IE6 and you can see internet explorer in action
[ thumb:471:c:l=p ]
IEs4Linux Installation in Ubuntu
You have to enable universe packages first .
It is also recommended that you use the official winehq ubuntu package :
Open /etc/apt/sources.list file
$ sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
Uncomment following lines in your /etc/apt/sources.list and it may be different if you are in different country instead of UK
deb http://uk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe
deb-src http://uk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe
Add WineHQ APT Repository
or
If you want to add source packages from the repository
Currently , wine only have i386 binary packages available .
If you do not use an i386 architecture , or wish to compile the package in a special or optimized way , you can build the wine package using the source repository instead .
To do this , add a source repository with one of the following :
deb-src http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt dapper main
Close gedit and run an update to take your new Repository
$ sudo apt - get update
Install wine and cabextract
$ sudo apt - get install wine cabextract
Now you need to download IEs4 Linux script from here
$ wget http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/downloads/ies4linux-2.0.3.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf ies4linux - 2.0.3.tar.gz
$cd ies4linux - 2.0.3
Once you are inside ies4linux - 2.0.3 directory you need to run the following script to install internet explorer
$./ies4linux
This will install the internet explore in your machine .
To run IE you need to run the following command and it may be different for others this path at the end of installation it will give from where you want to run
$ /root/bin/ie6
You should see the Internet explorer opening
Internet Explorer Version and Widows Media Player
[ thumb:425:c:l=p ]
If you want to see this in action check the following screen
[ thumb:423:c:l=p ]
If try to run / root / bin / ie6 as root user you will get the following error messages so you need to run as user
#/root /bin/ie6

A sunspot five times the size of Earth could wreak havoc with satellites and radio communication systems , scientists warn , as it moves across the face of the sun and Earth moves directly into its firing line .
Seven huge X - class flares have already erupted from the spot , including one of magnitude X17 last Wednesday that made it into the record books as the fourth largest ever seen .
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) said that the flares have already caused problems with some electric power systems , radio communications and global positioning equipment .
It went on to warn that further flares are likely in the next week , and because the sunspot is moving into line with Earth , the risk of disruptions is even greater as the solar activity will strike the planet head - on .
The daddy of all solar flares was spotted in November 2003 , and ranked X28 on the magnitude scale .
Fortunately , the flare did not directly strike Earth .
Even so , it did disrupt satellites , and caused some problems for the Mars Express spacecraft , which at that time was still en route to Mars .
The radiation from a flare will reach the Earth within minutes , but the charged particles associated with the event take longer to arrive , typically two days .
These particles are responsible for the Auroras Borealis and Australis ; the Northern and Southern lights .
These plasma storms are also responsible for interfering with power grids , TV reception , satellites and so on .
In 1989 a solar flare that hit the Earth directly actually knocked out a whole power grid in Quebec . ®

and press A for driven ball .
When holding Q , press W+DK for lob through ball .
You can use this effectively when your receiver is closely marked by an opponent .
When holding Q , press A+DK for low cross .
You can use this when there are less opponent players inside the box .
When holding Q , press D+DK for lob shot .
This is very useful when you are 1 on 1 with the Goalkeeper , inside the box .
When holding Q , press S+DK then press S again for 1 - 2 pass .
This is most useful when you are trying to lose an opponent .
When running , hold C and then press S+DK for trick pass .
This way you will disguise you intention .
You can use this in the same way for through pass ( W+DK ) , lob pass / cross ( A+DK ) or shot ( D+DK ) .
When you are inside de box , receiving a cross , you can press C+D to simulate an overhead / voley kick .
This can be extremely useful if you have an unmarked player at the far post and you want to let the ball go to him .
Before receiving the ball , hold E and press Shift + DK to immideatly kick the ball forward and run after it .
You can use first - touch control to accelerate the game or get past defenders .
First - touch playing is making the game more faster .
If you can control it do n’t be afraid to use it .
When holding E , press Shift to accelerate .
You can use this when you are in lots of space , with no opponent standing in front of your player .
Press Z / Shift + Forward for bicycle dribbling .
If you are running ( holding on E ) this could only work with Z.Before receiving a ball , you can press Z+S if you want to let the ball go between the legs , to another player .
Tap Z+Side Keys for lateral dribbling when running ( very effective when the opponent stands in front of you ) .
You should try more combinations of DK+Z or Shift to learn more dribblings ( like walking on the ball and so on ) .
Press D ( + DK optional ) , then immideatly press Z for fake shot .
This is very effective if used properly ( you will make the Goalkeeper and eventually some of the defenders go the wrong way ) .
You can also use S then Z for fake pass or A then Z for fake lob pass / cross .
The most simple way to get past an opponent is the DK dribbling .
Do n’t forget , when you try this , that you do n’t have to run all the time .
Try to simulate you are going left ( while running slow ) , then go right and in the same time hold E .
You should practice this in order to get it right .
You must make a lot of midfield pressing to get the ball from the opponents .
When the ball is in the midfield you should n’t slide for the ball .
You just have to hold Q and to try to deposes your opponent with a conservative tackle .
When the opponent lobs the ball forward you can press A or S to try making an interception , or press D to clear the ball .
If you have no other option to stop the opponent attackers then hold W to charge the goalkeaper .
Release the key when you think it ’s time for him to make a save .
You can also hold W to make your goalkeaper catch / clear incoming crosses .
Use Q key when you are defending .
If your marking players ( the other players that you ca n’t control at a moment ) are too far from the opponent players hold Q and they will make pressing .
This hepls you to act more quickly when an opponent receives the ball .
Used careful , this tip could let the opponent attackers stay off - side .
When you gave away a corner , it ’s easy to defend if you know how .
Press S until you control the right player , then you should hold on W ( to charge the goalkeeper ) and press D+DK to clear the ball with a defender .
Use E key to move your marker faster .
Do n’t forget to change the set pieces .
This is very important because some set pieces are more effective ( the goalkeapers wo n’t come out for the ball so often ) .
Use NumPad Keys 2,4,5,6,8 to change your tactics during the game .

Itâ€™s not just Madonna appearing the H&M campaign .
There are 17 other members of her staff in the group shot â€ “ all clad in outfits from the Swedish retailor .
The campaign will debut in magazines in August ( in the Sepetember issues ) and will run until October when H&M will then switch to promoting their collaboration with Viktor & Rolf .
And apparently Madonna has renamed Lindsay Lohan , giving her the name Rose .
Because Lindsay deserves her own name due to her in involvement in Kabbalah name .

Coffee was given to rats in the study
Scientists from Southwestern University found caffeine increased the female libido in experiments on rats .
The Pharmacology , Biochemistry and Behaviour journal study said the effect was caused by it stimulating the part of the brain regulating arousal .
But researchers said a similar effect was only likely to be repeated in humans who do not drink coffee regularly .
Previous research has looked into both the health benefits and consequences of coffee consumption .
Humans would have to drink 10 cups of coffee in one go to get the same effect and that is not the normal consumption level
British Coffee Association spokesman
The hot drink is linked to improving memory and reducing the risk of cancer , but studies have also suggested it increases the risk of heart disease .
In the latest research , scientists gave 108 female rats a moderate dose of caffeine before a mating test to determine if the caffeine had any effect on female behaviour .
They found that administration of caffeine shortened the amount of time it took the females to return to the males after sex for another mating session .
The study said the effects appeared to go beyond a simple boost of energy for socialising , but researchers said the effect may not be repeated in all humans .
Brain
Lead researcher Dr Fay Guarraci said : " These rats had never had caffeine before .
In humans , it might enhance the sexual experience only among people who are not habitual users . "
But she added the study should help improve understanding about the relationship between the brain and behaviour .
" Understanding the circuits that control this behaviour will help us understand how the brain works and what part of the brain mediates motivation because sexual behaviour is a motivative behaviour . "
But a spokesman for the British Coffee Association said : " We are not that convinced by this .
Humans would have to drink 10 cups of coffee in one go to get the same effect and that is not the normal consumption level .
" There are health benefits of coffee , but at this stage I do not think we can include this as one . "
My pitch at the SXSW panel was this .
In creating a start - up , you ’re going to be faced with a thousand seemingly inconsequential decisions .
Tucked amongst those thousands of decisions are five decisions that actually matter .
These decisions will change the face of your company .
What I did n’t say was that I believe it ’s next to impossible to figure out which decisions matter and which ones do not .
How depressing .
Here ’s the deal , you can spend a lot of energy deciding what the big decisions might be , but that ’s much less important than making the decision … educated guess or gut instinct .
There ’s a pile of thoughts on creating decision friendly environments in the Taking Time to Think piece , but that article focuses on the idea of thinking in a team scenario and I want to talk about when you choose to take your thinking solo .
Let ’s start with the most infuriating email you ’ve ever received .
I ’m not talking about that jerk in Tech Support who is simply stupid , I ’m talking about the email from someone you trust … a peer … pissing you off in email .
You ’re going to want to react to this email in the same manner as if I came into your office and punched you in the face .
It ’s your animal brain at work and it served you well when you were living in a cave doing the hunter - gathering thing because reacting slowly meant you were eaten or punched again .
Now .
You have time to soak .
The soak is when you plant the seed of a thought in your brain and let it bump around in a rich stew of ideas , facts , and whatever other random crap that seems to relate .
The soak is a protected activity that will rarely occur during your busy day because you ’re busy reacting to the familiar never - ending flood of things to do .
The goal of the soak is simple : an original thought .
Whatever the problem is your stewing on , you want to find an glimmer of inspiration which transforms your response from a predictable emotional flame - o - gram into a strategic considered thought .
Emotion and Ignorance
At a prior gig , I was finally hitting my stride .
After a two year awkward getting - to - know the company phase , I was in the groove .
I knew who was doing what , who was hungry , and who was coasting .
I ’d turned a small bright idea of a product into a successful money maker , so my boss decided to saddle me with something completely different .
An entirely new product built on technology I ’d never used .
It was a strategic - shift product for the company which meant everyone would be watching .
This visibility would amplify potential fuck - ups .
This was the career defining product for me .
Holy shit .
Having no clue where to start on a new project and want to rip someone apart in email share one important characteristic .
The best move in both cases is to start with a good long soak .
I break soaking activities into two buckets : Active Soaks and Passive Soaks .
The Active Soaks are activities that you can direct and usually involve gathering content where as Passive Soaks are activities when you just point your brain in a random direction and pray .
Passive Soaks are were the real work gets done .
Let ’s start with the first :
Active Soaking
Ask dumb questions .
Your first job when faced with ignorance is information acquisition and , hopefully , there are folks out there who ’ve already done some soaking .
These folks have some facts , ideas , and opinions regarding whatever the problem might be and you need to hear them all .
The first five of these conversations can be awkward for managers because it ’ll be obvious after your first two questions ( “ What is it ? ” , “ How does it work ? ” ) that you have absolutely no clue what ’s going on and a manager ’s job is be clueful .
Suck it up , pal .
Soaking starts out uncomfortable , but with each ignorant question you ask , you ’re adding content to that managerial brain of yours .
Ever sat in a meeting with your VP where they were presenting product strategy ?
Ever sat there , unblinking , shocked and thinking , “ This guy , our leader , has absolutely no clue what doing ” ?
That ’s you in ten years when you ’ve a modicum of success and decided that success is a result of your MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY policy .
Asking dumb questions is the best way to start figuring out what is actually going on .
Furthermore , asking any question of your team is a handy way to indirectly say , “ I care about what we ’re doing enough to ask you what you think . ”
Pitch a stranger .
Once you ’ve asked enough dumb questions , a picture will start to form in your mind about what exactly you ’re doing .
It ’s a not a complete picture , it ’s more a rough sketch coupled with the mild relief that accompanies the sudden absence of ignorance .
Now you ’ve got to test your understanding with a qualified someone who is willing to listen to you ramble .
Pitch this person on your picture and see what happens .
Lots of nodding ?
Great , it ’s coming together .
Blank stare ?
Ooops , time for more dumb questions starting with the person you just pitched .
What I find when I pitch a stranger is that the words coming out of my mouth have very little to do with the picture that ’s in my head .
The act of linearly mapping my thoughts into words and sentences exposes flaws or gaps in my thinking that I never find when the ideas are swirling around my head .
This leads me to our next step .
Write it down , throw it away , write it down again .
Once your stranger is no longer totally confused by your idea , it ’s time to write it down .
This is the same process as pitching the stranger in that you ’re find another medium to capture your idea .
Like the pitch , seeing the words on a piece of paper or flat panel monitor will , once again , expose gaps you ca n’t see in the picture in your mind .
Those gaps prove you ’ve got more dumb questions , so go ask them , write it down again , and then throw it away .
That ’s right , do n’t just close the document window , you need to get rid of everything you just wrote down .
Toss it , empty the trash , and step away from the computer .
I know you ’re attached to some part of that document that you wrote .
Some witty thought that elegantly captured an angle on your problem , but remember what we ’re trying to solve here .
This is n’t whether or not you should get a blueberry - orange muffin on the way to work , this a decision that matters and solving it elegantly means you want to visit and revisit your response as many times as possible .
Consigning your first written draft to the ether might forever lose a piece of wit , but if that wit shows up in the second draft , I guarantee that it belongs there and you ’ll never lose it again .
Passive Soaking
Once you ’ve done all your active content acquisition , once you ’ve pitched some strangers , once you ’ve you ’ve written it down a few times , you need to stop actively working on the problem .
Remove that sticky from your screen , hide those second drafts on your desktop , and just stop working on it .
Yes , you need to make a decision , you need to respond to whatever the problem is , and while I am saying you should remove all the physical artifacts of your active soak , you ’re not going to stop .
You can ’t .
Your brain wo n’t let you .
Back to the original flame mail from your friend .
You ’ve received these before and you know the absolute wrong thing to do is immediately respond .
Of course , your animal brain is dying to do so because IT FEELS SO GOOD TO PUNCH BACK , but it ’s never the right move because your animal brain is defending itself , it ’s not resolving anything other than proving BOY CAN I PUNCH BACK OR WHAT ?
My advice regarding flame - o - grams and hard decisions is the same .
Sleep on it .
A night ’s rest is one best ways to calm and alter your perspective on a problem .
Ever gone to bed at night when the sky is falling and awoken to a blissfully simple way to easily prop the sky up ?
How ’d that happen ?
The answer is , your brain never stops working .
Better yet , it has the unique ability to subconsciously construct elegant solutions to hard problems when you least expect it .
Call it inspiration , call it intuition , but do n’t stare at it too long because it ’s a shy ability .
It does it ’s best work when no one knows it ’s there .
Soaking Takes Time
Do n’t tell anyone I work with , but I earn a majority of my pay during the forty minute drive to work in the morning .
I get in the car with my cup of coffee , hit the road , and let my mind wander to whatever music is playing .
Never do I think , “ Ok , Phil flamed me pretty hard yesterday … how am I going to deal with this ? ”
My mind stumbles , it strikes out in random directions , and I never know where it ’ll end up .
Still , if I ’ve spent time actively soaking on the Phil problem the day before , my wandering often ends up somewhere Phil - like and , sometimes , the mental journey reveals a nugget of inspiration .
As practical advice goes , the soak is pretty thin .
If your boss is waiting for you to weigh in on a critical decision I am not advising you to say , “ I have no clue what to do , I ’m going to go ask dumb questions , pitch a stranger , write it down and then throw it away , and then forget everything I did ” .
What I am saying is that any big decision , any big problem deserves time and consideration .
If you ’ve got years of experience under your belt , you can probably wing it pretty well , but you ’re still going to be faced with situations where the right decision is to not decide , but think .
The soak is , hands down , the favorite part of my job .
What I ’m doing when I ’m soaking on something is an act of creation .
It ’s design work .
It ’s strategy .
It ’s removing the emotion and ignorance from a problem and then constructing an original solution that shows those I work with that I ’m actively caring about what I do .
27/03/2006 Towards a United States of Europe By Jürgen Habermas
Why should we get excited about such a lacklustre topic as the future of Europe ?
My answer is : if we are not able to hold a Europe - wide referendum before the next European elections in 2009 on the shape Europe should take , the future of the Union will be decided in favour of neo-liberal orthodoxy .
Avoiding this touchy issue for the sake of a convenient peace and muddling along the well - trodden path of compromise will give free reign to the dynamic of unbridled market forces .
This would force us to watch as the European Union 's current political power is dismantled in favour of a diffuse European free - trade zone .
For the first time in the process of European unification , we face the danger of regressing to a level of integration below what has already been achieved .
What irks me is the paralytic numbness that has set in after the failure of the constitutional referenda in France and the Netherlands .
Not taking a decision in this context amounts to a decision with major consequences .
Three pressing problems are bundled together in the single issue of Europe 's inability to act :
(1) The international economic situation has changed in the wake of globalisation .
Today 's conditions deprive the national state of the tax resources it needs to satisfy its population 's demands for collective goods and public services , or even to maintain the status quo .
Further challenges , such as demographic developments and increased immigration , only aggravate the situation .
Here the only defence is offence : winning back political clout on a supra-national level .
Without convergent tax rates and medium - term harmonisation of economic and social - policies , we are in effect relinquishing our hold over the European social model .
(2) The return to ruthless hegemonic power politics , the clash of the West and the Islamic world , the decay of state structures in other parts of the world , the long - term social consequences of colonialism and the immediate political consequences of failed de-colonisation – all of this points to a high - risk international situation .
Only a European Union capable of acting on the world stage - and taking its place beside the USA , China , India and Japan - can press for an alternative to the ruling Washington consensus in the world 's economic institutions .
Only such a Europe can advance the long overdue reforms within the UN which are both blocked by and dependent on the USA .
(3) One cause for the rift in the West that has become apparent since the Iraq war is the clash of cultures that now divides America itself into two camps of almost equal size .
This clash has also caused a shift in the hitherto valid normative standards of government policy .
America 's closest allies cannot remain indifferent here .
It is precisely in critical cases of joint action that we must break free of our dependence on our superior partner .
That is one more reason why the European Union needs its own armed forces .
Until now Europeans have been subordinated to the dictates and regulations of the American high command in NATO deployments .
The time has come for us to attain a position where even in a joint military deployment we still remain true to our own conceptions of human rights , the ban on torture and wartime criminal law .
For these reasons , I believe Europe must pluck up the courage to introduce reforms which will give it not only effective decision - making procedures , but also its own foreign minister , a directly - elected president and its own financial basis .
These could be the subject of a referendum held concurrently with the next European parliamentary elections .
The draft would be considered passed if it received the ' double majority ' of votes of the states and the electorate .
At the same time , the referendum would only bind the member states in which a majority had voted in favour .
Europe would then move away from the convoy model where the tempo is set by the slowest member .
Even in a Europe made up of core and periphery , countries preferring to remain on the periphery retain the option of rejoining the core at any time .
These ideas dovetail with those of the Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt , who has recently published a manifesto for the " United States of Europe . "

BERLIN — A Spanish amnesty for illegal immigrants has drawn more of them to Europe and unilateral policies should be abandoned in favour of joint international solutions , Germany ’s Interior Minister said on Sunday .
Europe may be “ overwhelmed ” by migrants if the economic and social gap between it and impoverished Africa continued to widen rapidly , Interior Minister Otto Schily warned , in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung .
“ The pressure on Europe from migrants will increase so dramatically that we will be totally overwhelmed , ” the paper quoted him as saying .
“ Not even three — or five - deep layers of fencing will prevent it . ”
In recent weeks , large groups of African migrants have tried to get into Europe by storming razor wire fences around Spain ’s North African enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta , which are situated on the Mediterranean coast of Morocco .
{snip}
“ In the long term immigration and refugee problems cannot be solved with unilateral action , but only with European and international cooperation , ” he added .
In February , Spain introduced a three - month amnesty for illegal immigrants as part of a drive to lift them out of the shadow economy , give them rights and make them pay taxes .
Around 700,000 people took advantage of the scheme , which the government said helped better regulate immigration in a country that is a main gateway into the European Union from Africa and Latin America .

We bring to the attention of Global Research readers this important commentary by Dr.Joseph Mercola .
The fundamental issue is who owns the intellectual property rights over Tamiflu .
The media reports suggest that the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche will make billions .
While the drug is produced by Roche , it was developed by Gilead Sciences Inc. which owns the intellectual property rights .
Gilead , which has maintained a low profile , has outsourced the production to Roche .
Donald Rumsfeld was appointed Chairman of Gilead Sciences , Inc. in 1997 , a position which he held in the years prior to becoming Secretary of Defense .
in the Bush adminstration .
Rumsfeld had been on the Board of Directors from the establishment of Gilead in 1987 .
As confirmed in a company press statement in 1997 , Donald H. Rumsfeld assumed the position of Chairman , of GILEAD : :
“ Gilead is fortunate to have had Don Rumsfeld as a stalwart board member since the company ’s earliest days , and we are very pleased that he has accepted the Chairmanship , ” Dr. Riordan said .
“ He has played an important role in helping to build and steer the company .
His broad experience in leadership positions in both industry and government will serve us well as Gilead continues to build its commercial presence . ”
According to company statement : Gilead Science Inc “ has been active in the development of inhibitors for the potential treatment and prevention of viral influenza and protease inhibitors for the potential treatment of HIV ”
“ The Company ’s research and development efforts encompass three interrelated programs : small molecule antivirals , cardiovascular therapeutics and genetic code blockers for cancer and other diseases .
Gilead ’s expertise in each of these areas has also resulted in the discovery and development of non-nucleotide product candidates , including neuraminidase inhibitors for the potential treatment and prevention of viral influenza and protease inhibitors for the potential treatment of HIV ”
Also find below an article published in the SF Chronicle , which points to the relationship between GILEAD and Roche in relation to the Rights over Tami Flu .

Who Owns the rights on Tamiflu
by Joseph Mercola
www.mercola.com
Finally , the pieces of the puzzle start to add up .
Not long ago , President Bush sought to instill panic in this country by telling us a minimum of 200,000 people will die from the avian flu pandemic , but it could be as bad as 2 million deaths in this country alone .
This hoax is then used to justify the immediate purchase of 80 million doses of Tamiflu , a worthless drug that in no way shape or form treats the avian flu , but only decreases the amount of days one is sick and can actually contribute to the virus having more lethal mutations .
So the U.S. placed an order for 20 million doses of this worthless drug at a price of $ 100 per dose .
That comes to a staggering $ 2 billion .
We are being told that Roche manufactures Tamiflu and , in a recent New York Times article , they were battling whether or not they would allow generic drug companies to help increase their production .
But if you dig further you will find that a drug was actually developed by a company called Gilead that 10 years ago gave Roche the exclusive rights to market and sell Tamiflu .
Ahh , The Plot Thickens …
If you read the link below from Gilead , you ’ll discover Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was made the chairman of Gilead in 1997 .
Since Rumsfeld holds major portions of stock in Gilead , he will handsomely profit from the scare tactics of the government that is being used to justify the purchase of $ 2 billion of Tamiflu .
TEXT OF 1997 PRESS RELEASE BY GILEAD SCIENCE INC
Donald H. Rumsfeld Named Chairman of Gilead Sciences
Foster City , CA , January 3 , 1997 – Gilead Sciences Inc. ( Nasdaq : GILD ) today announced that board member Donald H. Rumsfeld will assume the position of Chairman , effective immediately .
Mr. Rumsfeld succeeds Michael L. Riordan , M.D. , who founded Gilead in 1987 and has served as Chairman since 1993 .
Dr. Riordan will continue to serve as a director on the board .
“ Gilead is fortunate to have had Don Rumsfeld as a stalwart board member since the company ’s earliest days , and we are very pleased that he has accepted the Chairmanship , ” Dr. Riordan said .
“ He has played an important role in helping to build and steer the company .
His broad experience in leadership positions in both industry and government will serve us well as Gilead continues to build its commercial presence . ”
“ In my years with Gilead , I have witnessed the evolution of one of the industry ’s premier biotechnology companies , ” Mr. Rumsfeld said .
“ Michael Riordan ’s founding vision and enormous accomplishments are evident in the VISTIDE ® product approval , deep pipeline and talented team that will continue to move Gilead to develop novel treatments for viral diseases . ”
Mr. Rumsfeld , who joined Gilead as a director in 1988 , is currently in private business and is distinguished for his accomplishments in both industry and government .
Mr. Rumsfeld served as chief executive officer of G.D. Searle , a worldwide pharmaceutical company , from 1977 to 1985 .
During this time , his stewardship of Searle earned him awards as the Outstanding Chief Executive Officer in the pharmaceutical industry in 1980 and 1981 .
He also served as chairman and chief executive of General Instrument Corporation , a diversified electronics company and world leader in broadband and all digital high definition television technology .
A graduate of Princeton University , Mr. Rumsfeld has served in numerous positions of public service , including four terms in the U.S. Congress , U.S. Ambassador to NATO , White House Chief of Staff and as the 13th Secretary of Defense .
In 1977 , Mr. Rumsfeld was awarded the nation ’s highest civilian award , the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
In addition to Gilead , Mr. Rumsfeld presently serves as an advisor to several companies and as a member of the board of directors of ABB AB ; Gulfstream Aerospace Corp . ; Kellogg ; Metricom , Inc. ; Sears , Roebuck and Co. and Tribune Company .
Mr. Rumsfeld ’s current civic activities include service on the board of trustees of the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship , Freedom House and the RAND Corporation .
Dr. Riordan will continue to assist the company with strategic direction through his involvement on the board of directors .
Since founding the company in 1987 , Riordan has overseen Gilead ’s evolution to a leading biotechnology company with its first approved product and a diversified pipeline of antiviral therapies .
“ Michael Riordan ’s vision and leadership have guided Gilead from a start - up to a commercial company , and we are pleased to rely on his continued counsel as an active board member , ” John C. Martin , Ph.D. , President and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead said .
“ Over the past several years , I have enjoyed working with Don Rumsfeld as an active director and look forward to his new role as Chairman as we continue to build the Gilead business . ”
Gilead Sciences is a leader in the discovery and development of a new class of human therapeutics based on nucleotides , the building blocks of DNA and RNA .
In 1996 , Gilead ’s first product , VISTIDE ( cidofovir injection ) , was cleared by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for the treatment of cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) retinitis in patients with AIDS .
Gilead has other nucleotide product candidates in human testing for the potential treatment of viral diseases caused by CMV , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus , herpes simplex virus and human papillomavirus .
The Company ’s research and development efforts encompass three interrelated programs : small molecule antivirals , cardiovascular therapeutics and genetic code blockers for cancer and other diseases .
Gilead ’s expertise in each of these areas has also resulted in the discovery and development of non-nucleotide product candidates , including neuraminidase inhibitors for the potential treatment and prevention of viral influenza and protease inhibitors for the potential treatment of HIV

Biotech firm wants to regain control of avian flu drug
Gilead says deal with Roche Inc. threatens Tamiflu ’s production
Sabin Russell , Chronicle Medical Writer
Friday , June 24 , 2005
Citing “ ongoing neglect of the product , ” a Bay Area biotech company is attempting to reclaim control of Tamiflu , an antiviral drug it sold to Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Inc. that has since emerged as the world ’s only practical weapon against a potential pandemic of avian flu .
The Foster City - based Gilead Sciences , best known for its AIDS drug Viread , notified Roche on Thursday that it was terminating the 1996 agreement that gave the Swiss company exclusive rights to make and sell Tamiflu .
Gilead executives disclosed that they have been peppering Roche with complaints about its marketing of Tamiflu for five years , and that manufacturing glitches have been responsible for earlier shortages of a drug now deemed vitally important to public health .
Formerly a lackluster seller in the market for drugs to treat influenza , Tamiflu has become a valuable commodity since December 2003 , when scientists became alarmed that a new flu strain that primarily killed chickens in Southeast Asia was starting to kill people who lived in close proximity to the birds .
In April , Roche reported its first quarter sales of Tamiflu quadrupled to $ 330 million .

Lots of news this morning relating to one of my most recent favourite games :
First up if you have n’t had …
I Will Knot !
This is a site about knots : how to tie them , how to appreciate their beauty .
Even the seriously knot - challenged among us can learn to tie many useful and popular knots by following along with the short , step - by - step instructional video clips on this site .
Before you begin , here are a couple quick knot - tying tips to keep in mind :
Get youself some nice , thick rope -- do n't learn with string !
String is extremely hard to control , and your knots will be so small that you wo n't be able to see what is going on .
About 4 feet of 1 /4 to 1/2 - inch thick nylon rope will do nicely for learning purposes .
Any good hardware store will have this , and it is very inexpensive .
Once you 've mastered how to tie a knot from the clips , trying tying it around different sort of objects , at different angles .
You do n't really know a knot until you can tie it upside - down and inside - out !
Okee - dokee , now it 's time to choose a knot to learn from the list below .
So fix yourself a nice hot beverage , grab your rope , and repeat confidently to yourself : I WILL KNOT !!
Andrew Fox StoryIn 1995 , this oft - rejected newcomer to New York City 's club scene found a way to get past the doorman of every hot club he longed to enter -- start a website offering club - goers free club reviews and information .
The now - savvy
Fox recalls his earlier , awkward days : " I showed up at a club wearing green shorts , and everyone was in black .
The bouncer looked at me and said , ' There 's no way .
'" Working on the website in his off hours at first , Fox chucked his investment banking job in 1997 to give Clubplanet.com ( then ClubNYC.com ) his all .
Volunteers provided early club reviews , until Fox hired a full - time editorial staff in 1999 .
Then he came up with a new idea : Start a guest list on his site for access to otherwise hard - to - get - into clubs .
By offering a discounted cover charge to those who both signed up on the site and arrived at the club before midnight , Fox helped enhance the exclusivity of the clubs as well as increase revenue .
Club owners were dubious about Fox 's concept at first , but when hundreds of club - goers who signed up showed up at their doors , the owners gladly forged relationships with the innovator and paid him a " bounty " for every head he brought in .
Fox installed a management team for Clubplanet.com so he could focus on two other businesses he was involved in , but he admits giving up control was a mistake .
Upon learning of Clubplanet.com 's mismanagement and financial woes , Fox engaged in a bitter struggle to regain control .
He ultimately won , but the battle took its toll on the company .
He was forced to lay off employees he had never met .
With only two employees , Fox started back at square one , selling his other companies to refocus on his " baby .
" Clubplanet.com has grown to include thousands of club listings around the United States and the United Kingdom , and now syndicates its content to Citysearch , newspapers , Yahoo ! and other third - party clients .
Fox also recently launched NocheLatino.com , an upscale , urban Latino version of Clubplanet.com , and is working on a version for the gay community .
He 's since expanded his empire to include a New Year 's Eve event ticketing site , NewYears.com ; an exclusive club access site , CoolJunkie.com ; a ticketing company , WantTickets.com ; and an offline event and marketing company , Track Entertainment .
How much money do these sites generate for Andrew Fox ?
Last year it was a cool 22 million US Dollars .

使える GUI デザイン :
フリー／オープンソース・ソフトウェア開発者のための手引き
Benjamin Roe さんの 、Usable GUI Design : A Quick Guide for F/ OSS Developers の M.Shibata による日本語訳です。プロジェクト杉田玄白正式参加テキスト。
Update : この記事についてたくさんのコメントをいただいたので、FAQを作って、そのうちのいくつかについて回答することにしました（訳注 : FAQ も翻訳しました！） 。
イントロダクショ ン
オープンソース・ソフトウェアの世界は優れたソフトウェアでいっぱいです。ワードプロセッサから
Web サービスにいたるまで、コンピュータでしたいと思うようなおおよそすべての作業において、高品質のフリー／オープンソース・ソフトウェアを利用することができます。しかしこうして勢ぞろいしたソフトウェアにも、ひとつ欠点があります。あるべき使い勝手からかけ離れて使いにくいということがたびたびあるのです。UI デザインの専門家は、アプリケーションの開発にあたっていちばんに設計されるべきなのはユーザー・インターフェースであるといいますが、プログラマにはこうした設計をすることができません。それは
UI の専門家でなければできないことで、オープンソース・ソフトウェアのプロジェクトではこうした人々の手を借りることができず、それゆえ本当の使いやすさというものは望むべくもないというのです。
これは、わたしたちが UI デザインをあきらめるべきだということではありません。多くの商用アプリケーションの
UI の品質を見ればわかるように、スタッフにユーザビリティのエキスパートを加えればそれで優れたユーザー・インターフェースが保証されるというわけでもないのです。開発者の努力、知識、洞察力がアプリケーションの使い勝手を大きく向上させることを可能にするのです。わたしたちに見つけられるのは絶対的ではなくて近似的な解にすぎないかもしれませんが、それでもそれは正しい方向への進歩です。
こうした問題に数年にわたって取り組んだ末に、わたしはオープンソース・ソフトウェア開発者がアプリケーションの
GUI をデザインする際に守るべき 5 つの点について書くことにしました。これらは、わたしがオープンソース・ソフトウェアを使用・開発した経験と、こうしたことがらについて扱っているいくつかのたいへん興味深い書籍や
Web サイトから導き出したものです。それらの作品については参考文献に挙げてあります——ユーザビリティの問題に興味がある開発者にとってはどれもすばらしい読みものです。
ほとんどの作品に必ずしも実装を要求されないことがらや、ちょっとした論争になっているようなことがらについては、わたしはあえて軽く触れるにとどめました。より広い「すべてのアプリケーション」についてが本稿の対象だからです。ここに挙げていることは新しいことでもなければ、これといって難しいことでもありませんが、その効果には目を見張るものがあります。それから、わたしがここで取り上げる例についても述べておきます。そのうちのいくつかについては、アプリケーションの設定を変えることで解決できるものもあります。しかし、わたしはデフォルトの設定についてのみ考慮することにしました。デフォルトの状態こそが、そのアプリケーションにおけるもっとも使い勝手のよいデザインについての開発者の考えを表しているように思われるからです。
はじめるに先立って、予想される罵倒にそなえてもう一点述べておくことにしましょう。アプリケーションによっては、以下に述べることがとりわけ手厳しいものに聞こえるかもしれませんが、これに建設的な批評以外の意図はありません。ほとんどのアプリケーションをわたしは毎日使っており、いずれも献身的な開発者たちの何年にもわたる努力の賜物、とびきりの名品ぞろいです。わたしはただ、さらなる改善の余地を提案しているだけで、誰にたいする攻撃の意図もありません。
ポイント
0 ) ユーザーはアプリケーションを使うわけではない
コンピュータの UI デザインにおけるもっとも基本的なポイントは、ユーザーはあなたのアプリケーションを使うために使っているわけではないということです。ユーザーは自分の作業をできるだけ手早く片付けたいと思っていて、アプリケーションはたんにその助けとなる道具であるにすぎません。ユーザーをできるだけ早く解放してあげるアプリケーションほどよいアプリケーションです。あなたのアプリケーションを使うことに費やされた努力というのは、ユーザーのやろうとしている作業を片付けることには貢献していない努力なのです。Alan Cooper の 2 冊目の著作、 「 About Face 2.0」から、このことをうまく要約しているふたつを引用することにします。
「 ユーザーは賢く、そして多忙であると考えよ 」 「どんなにクールなインターフェースでも、それなしで済むに超したことはない」
本稿の残りの 4 点はこの原則の特別なケースであるというのにすぎません。
1 ) Fitt の法 則
Fitt の法則はもっとも基本的で有名な UI デザインの法則です。それによれば、スクリーン上のオブジェクトが大きくてマウスポインタに近いほど、クリックしやすいと述べられています。こんなことはあたりまえなのですが、それでも
UI デザインではすっかり無視されてしまうことが少なくありません。
図 1 : Firefox のツールバ ー
たとえば、デフォルトの Firefox のボタンバー（図 1 ）を考えてみてください 。Web ブラウジングでは、他と比べて圧倒的に押すことの多いボタンは［戻る］ボタンです。したがって［戻る］ボタンは押しやすくなくてはいけません。このようにアプリケーションを使うことに費やす労力を最小限にすることで、ユーザーが
Web ブラウジングに集中できるようになるのです。ところがこのボタンバーでは、5 つのボタンすべてが同じ大きさになっています。［中止］ボタンは本当に［戻る］ボタンと同じくらい重要なのでしょうか？ もちろん違います。よりよいデザインは図 2 のようなものになるでしょう。ここでは［戻る］ボタン は
Fitt の法則にしたがって大きく、そして他のボタンよりも目立つものになっています。
図 2 : 代替デザイン案
コントロールの外見上の大きさは、それをスクリーンの端に配置することで大きくすることができます。マウスカーソルはスクリーンの端にまで達すると、どんなに早くマウスを動かしていたとしても、そこでマウスカーソルの動きは止まります。このことは、マウスの使用者にとってはスクリーンの端にあるものは、スクリーンの外側に無限に広がっていることになるということを意味します。スクリーンの右上にある 1 ピクセルのターゲットにマウスカーソルを合わせるのは簡単なことです。マウスを右上に適当に「投げて」やればいいからです。スクリーンの中ほどにある 1 ピクセルにマウスカーソルを合わせてそれを押すのにはそれよりも時間がかかることでしょう。このことから、押しやすくあってほしいコントロールは、スクリーン端に配置されるべきだということがわかります。
図 3 : Metacity ウィンドウの装飾 。
ボタンの周辺に無効な領域がある。
もっとも簡単な例は、すべてのウィンドウに付いている（［閉じる］［最大化］などの）ウィンドウ操作用のボタンです。ウィンドウを操作しやすくするために、これらは押しやすくなっている必要があります。全アプリケーションの上隅にあるわけですから、これらは角に置く筆頭候補です。しかしながらそれを実践しているウィンドウ・マネージャはごくわずかです。ほとんどの
Metacity テーマがやっていませんし、XFCE4 もやっていません。ボタンを 1 ピクセル右上に移動させるだけで、ユーザーは目をつむってでもウィンドウを閉じることができるようになるというのにです。
図 4 : スクロールバー
1 ピクセルのギャップ。
もうひとつの例はスクロールバーです。わたしのデスクトップにあるほとんどのアプリケーションは、最大化したときにその右端から1 ピクセル離れたところにスクロールバーが付くようになっており、そうなっているばっかりにせっかくのポイントしやすい幅無限大のボックスは
10 ピクセルの小さなボックスへと縮められてしまっていて、わたしはスクロールしたいと思うたびにそこをクリックするのに余計な数秒を費やすことになってしまいます。
このことをまとめると以下のようになります。
よく使われるコントロールは大きく、目立つようにする。
スクリーンの端と四隅に配置されるコントロールは事実上無限に広がっているとみなすことができる。
スクリーンの端や四隅から 1 ピクセル離れてコントロールを置くようなことはしない。
2 ) 不必要なインターフェース
ユーザーが作業をしているときには、かれらの注意は行っている作業のことにあります。ユーザーがアプリケーションへと注意を向けるそのたびごとに、かれらが作業に集中しなおすだけの時間が失われていきます。したがって、アプリケーションがユーザーの気を散らせたり邪魔をしたりするようなことは最小限にとどめなければなりません。アプリケーションにはそれが対象としているアイテムというものが存在しています——テキストエディタならテキスト、Web ブラウザなら
Web ページです。インターフェースはそれが中心になるように作らなければいけません。
このことの例としては、確認や進行状況のダイアログが挙げられます。たとえば、Evolution
はわたしが［送受信］ボタンを押すたびにダイアログをポップアップしてメールをチェックしているその進行状況を教えます。このダイアログはメールを受信したので、ほかのアプリケーションへのアクセスをブロックしようという場合であればまっとうだといえます。しかしこのダイアログの提供しているものはなんでしょう？
これはたんにユーザーの邪魔をするのにしか役に立っていません。このダイアログは廃止して、ステータスバーの進捗メーターに置き換えたほうがずっとよいでしょう。
図 5 : gEdit の検索ダイアロ グ
さらに悪い例は KDE のごみ箱のデフォルトでの振る舞いです。ファイルをごみ箱に送るのは、簡単に復元でき、またユーザーが繰り返し行うこともある操作です。どうして簡単にやり直せる作業でユーザーに［OK］を毎回クリックするのを強制するのでしょうか。ユーザーにファイルがごみ箱に送られたということを警告したいのであれば、アニメーションのようなものを表示させればいいのです。こうした簡単な操作において毎回ユーザーの邪魔をしてはいけません。そんなことはユーザーをうるさがらせて作業を遅滞させ、ダイアログでやみくもに［OK］を押すよくない習慣を付けさせることにしかつながりません。
別の例はテキストエディタの検索機能でおなじみの「見つかりません」ダイアログです。検索ダイアログに入力した文字列が見つからなかったとすれば、おそらくは検索する文字列が間違っていたわけで、それなら検索文字列を修正して検索を続けようとするのが普通です。しかしそこには［OK］ボタンのついたダイアログボックスが立ちはだかっており、なにをするにもまずはそいつをクリックしてのけなければならないのです。ユーザーにはさらなる苛立ちと手間がかさみます。よい例としては
Firefox の検索ダイアログが挙げられます。これは検索語が見つからないときには赤く色が付くのです。
図 6 : あらゆる証拠に反して 、Slashdot には monkey は見あたらない 。
（訳注 : Slashdot の monkey というの は 、２ちゃんねるでいう厨房と同じような意味だそうです。山形浩生さんより教えていただきました。）
このことをまとめると : ユーザーの通り道につまずくような石を置かない。
ポップアップダイアログは役に立つ情報を含んでいる場合にのみ使う。
できるだけ非モーダルなステータス表示をする。
3 ) コンピュータのパワーを使え
コンピュータは昨今、1 秒間に何十億回もの演算をこなし、何百ギガバイトものストレージを使うことのできる、パワフルなものとなりました。かたや人間はといえば、何百年たってもそれほど変わっていません。わたしたちはいまだに疲れやすく、すぐ飽きるし、間違えるし、一度に限られた精神力しか発揮することができません。したがって、できるだけ多くの作業を、みすぼらしく擦り切れた人間などではなく、疲れ知らずでメチャ速の、目の前のコンピュータに任せるようにしたほうが賢明であるように思われるのです。
ユーザー・インターフェースにおいて、このアイデアの示唆するところは明白です。決定しなければならないことや、やらなければならないことがあるたびに、インターフェースがユーザーのためにそれをやってくれるようにできないか考えてみてください。たとえば、わたしのタスクバーには現在ふたつの
xterm が開いています（図 7）。ひとつは
SiEd のソースコードのあるディレクトリを開いており、もうひとつは論文の
LaTeX コードがあるディレクトリを開いています。どっちがどっちだかわかりますか？ わかりませんよね。そこでわたしは自分の作業したいほうを選ぶのに、タスクバーをクリックしたり、そこにマウスカーソルをもっていってツールチップを表示させたりすることになるわけです。しかしコンピュータはどっちがどっちなのか知っているのです。どうしてそれをわたしのためにやってくれないのでしょうか？
図 7 : GNOME のタスクバーは不親切だ 。
解決策は単純です。タスクバーにある同一のアプリケーションについては、タスク名を見て、それらを区別できるような情報を表示するようにすればよいのです。そうすれば、わたしは多くの異なるアプリケーションをほとんど考えることなく切り替えることができます。コンピュータがその作業をやってくれるので、わたしはそれをしなくてすむわけです。
もしコンピュータがそれほどまでに広大なストレージを利用できるというのであれば、終了させるたびにわたしの設定を忘れてしまうアプリケーションが多いのはどうしてなのでしょう？
わたしは Anjuta IDE は必ず最大化させて使うのですが 、Anjuta は起動させるとわたしの使っているスクリーンと同じくらいの大きさでウィンドウを初期化し、ウィンドウの左上をスクリーンから

GNOME の Nautilus ファイルマネージャはこの点申し分ありません。ウィンドウのサイズからスクロールバーの位置に至るまで、すべてがウィンドウごとに記憶されており、一度ディレクトリのウィンドウを好みに設定しておけばもうそのことで頭を悩ませることはありません。
以上をまとめると以下のようになります :
コンピュータはパワフルだ : コンピュータのパワーでユーザーを助けよう。
似ているアイテムを区別しやすくしてあげよう。
アプリケーションの設定は記憶する。
4 ) アイテムは区別しやすく見つけやすく
このポイントはきわめてシンプルです。異なることをするスクリーン上のアイテムは見やすくそしてお互いに異なって見えるべきだということです。操作をしやすくしようと目論んで失敗している端的な例として、Konqueror のデフォルトのタスクバーをご覧ください。
図 8 : Konqueror のデフォルトのツールバ ー
左端のアイテムは上向きの矢印になっていて、Web ブラウザの中ではもっとも使用頻度の少ないコマンドが割り当てられています。左端というのはもっとも見つけやすくクリックしやすい場所ですから、もっともよく使われる操作がここにこなくてはいけません。わたしの知っている他のすべてのブラウザが［戻る］ボタンを左端に置いているのはそれが理由です。
検索ボタンとふたつのズームボタンはとても似通っています。［進む］［戻る］［上へ］［ホーム］そして［更新］ボタンはすべて同じ色をしています。すばやくこれらを見分けるのは至難の業です。さらに重要なことは、それらが 15 個も並んでいるということです！ 人間は 5 つ前後のアイテムを識別するのは得意で、それくらいであれば考え込まずに即座にすることができます。楽譜の譜面が
5 行からなっているのもそれが主な理由です。5 つを超えると、わたしたちは立ち止まって脳を使ってどれがどれであるかを考えなければならなくなります。優れたデザインでは、ツールバーにはもっともよく使われるアイテムのみが配置され、一般的にユーザーがしなければならないことを最小限に絞っています。多くのアプリケーションがこうしたたくさんのアイテムをタスクバーに並べていますが、Web
をブラウズするといった単純なタスクの場合は、15 個というのはやりすぎです。わたしは新規のユーザーが
Konqueror を使おうとして、この配置がいかにかれら自身を混乱させるかを見てきました。経験を積んだコンピュータユーザーであるわたしでさえ混乱するのですから。
アイテムの識別が困難になる別の例は、デフォルトの
GNOME で見られます。図 9 の範囲選択されたテキストを見てください。
図 9 : GNOME Simple theme のテキスト選 択
ユーザーがテキストを範囲選択したとき、彼の注意は選択したテキストにあります。ユーザーはおそらくそれをどうにかするために選択したのですから。それなのにどうしてこのテーマでは選択範囲の背景を暗い色にして、ユーザーが注目しているまさにそのテキストをスクリーン上で読みにくくしてしまうのでしょうか？
その部分を明るくして他の部分から際立たせ、読みやすくしたほうがよいのではないでしょうか？
このことをまとめると以下のようになります:
異なることをするアイテムは区別しやすく ユーザーを選択肢でおぼれさせない
選択していたりフォーカスのあたっているアイテムは目立たせ、読みやすいようにする
結論
以上の 5 つのポイントは些細なことですが 、UI デザインの重要な部分を占めています。これらは UI の問題についての、鉄の掟や特効薬といったものではありません。これらの原則にしたがってインターフェースをデザインすることで、わたしの意見によれば、アプリケーションの使い勝手を大きく向上できるということです。訂正や追加など、どんなコメントでも歓迎します（下記のメールアドレスへどうぞ、nospam の部分を取り除いてください） 。

A provocative essay has been pulled from servers by Newcastle University authorities following complaints from vegetarians .
Nikolas Lloyd , who was granted IT services as a visiting fellow in evolutionary psychology , has had all his pages taken down and his email access rescinded .
Forum members on a vegetarian dating site took exception to the title of the piece “ Why vegetarians should be force fed with lard ” .
It was one of a series of deliberately incendiary treatises , which included “ Why banning hunting is wrong ” , and “ A woman 's place ” .
In his vegetarianism article , Lloyd argues against pro-veggie reasoning in tongue - in - cheek style .
A typical passage reads :
Most vegetarians are women .
In Britain , a person is doubly likely to suffer from vegetarianism if he is female ... when men split up from their veggie girlfriends , they near invariably start enjoying meat again .
This goes to prove amongst other things that men really will do ANYTHING for sex .
The full tirade has been rescued from Google 's cache and is available here .
Not seeing the funny side , tofu fanciers on veggieromance.com fired off complaints to university postmaster Quentin Campbell .
He temporarily suspended Lloyd 's access while the gripes were investigated under the university 's usage policies .
Campbell then replied in an email : “ I am mindful of the obligation of the University , under section 43 of the Education ( No 2 ) Act 1986 , to protect the freedom of speech of its staff . ”
The section of the Act he refers to says :
Take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members , students and employees of the establishment and for visiting speakers .
He concluded : “ You may not agree with the personal opinions that Nikolas Lloyd publishes on our staff website here , but as his views do not appear to break the law of the UK , the university cannot without proper cause prevent him from expressing them . ”
In a later , more detailed official statement , he told the vegetarians the pages would stand , since the Education Act trumps the institution 's own rules regarding material “ intended to annoy ” .
The email dialogue is in the veggieromance .com thread here .
That was back in January , and seemed to put an end to the bean curd - induced humour vacuum .
Last week though , a letter dropped on Lloyd 's doormat from university Registrar John Hogan telling him that all his IT privileges , conferred a decade ago , were to be removed with immediate effect .
According to university authorities , Lloyd 's downfall was that , as a visiting fellow , he was not an official member of staff and so lacked the protection of the legislation .
They contend their own regulations meant the university was obliged to crumble under the weight of complaints from the offended cabbage regarders .
The decision was taken at the very highest level of the university administration .
Lloyd 's access via the Department of Psychology was sponsored by evolutionary psychiatry academic Dr Bruce Charlton , who uses some of Lloyd 's respected work on evolutionary debates in his teaching .
Charlton says the suspension of IT services is a big blow to Lloyd , who pursued his interest in the field on a low income , and a “ malicious , frivolous ” attack should have been resisted by authorities .
He added that it is an “ ominous ” sign that people with “ hurt feelings ” can bring about a crisis meeting in the upper echelons of management .
He also pointed out that the action sets a worrying precedent for the institution ; people can take offence at anything , so the regulations offer no protection to anything on the site .
Some of the meat - shy posters had the mettle to stand up for Lloyd 's rights of free speech , however .
In the spirit of the debate , one joked : “ Personally , I believe that nobody should be allowed to publish or say anything that offends me , and I will always campaign to get it removed so that no one else is allowed to read it ... I plan to go over to Nikolas Lloyd 's house and set fire to it . ” ®
It is the first time since 1913 that a northern bottlenose whale has been seen in the Thames , and hundreds of onlookers rushed to the riverside to watch as it progressed past parliament .
Experts say they are very concerned for the whale - normally found in deep seawater - and there was increasing concern about its chances of making it back to the sea , around 40 miles downstream .
There was speculation that if it became beached and stranded it could have to be put down in a mercy killing to minimise its suffering .
At one stage before 2 pm , the 4.5 metre ( 15 ft ) long mammal came close to becoming beached near Battersea , coming within yards of the riverbank .
A number of members of the public jumped into the river and splashed around to encourage the whale to move back into deeper waters .
It swam as far up river as Chelsea before lifeboats turned it around just short of Albert Bridge .
By 5 pm , the whale - not yet thought to be fully grown - had moved away from the banks near Westminster and was spending more time beneath the surface .
Experts were at the scene , and a four - strong flotilla of boats - including a harbourmaster 's vessel - kept watch on it .
Earlier today Liz Sandeman , a marine mammal medic who went out in a lifeboat to examine the whale , said : " It looks quite healthy and quite relaxed .
It 's breathing normally and its weight seems good . "
However , a statement released by the British Divers Marine Life Rescue ( BDMLR ) later said the whale was showing increasing signs of " poor health " .
Alan Knight , of the BDMLR , said there was currently a flood tide and the whale could become stranded when the tide changed .
Efforts could then be made to refloat it using specialist inflatable pontoon equipment that was being sent to the scene and could help direct it back towards the sea .
" We would only send it on its way if it has a good sense of survival , " Mr Knight said .
" If it does get stranded , it may have to be anaesthetised . "
There is concern that boats in the river could pose a danger to the whale , with the noise of their engines adding to its disorientation .
It appeared to have received a small cut from rocks , and earlier today there were signs of blood in the water - but Mr Knight said this was not a serious concern .
He explained that reports of a whale making its way up the Thames had first been received yesterday .
" We had a report of two whales going up the Thames and we sent divers , but we only found one , " he added .
" At about 6 pm [ last night ] it went back out again past the [ Thames ] barrier and we thought it was gone .
" Then at 8.30 am today we got a phone call from someone on a train who thought they had just hallucinated and seen a whale going up the Thames near Waterloo Bridge . "
Reports said a second whale , believed to be of the same species , had been seen at Southend - on - Sea .
Northern bottlenose whales are normally seen in the north Atlantic off Norway , in the Barents Sea and off northern Britain and Ireland in the summer .
They have bulbous foreheads , look like very large bottle - nosed dolphins and usually feed in deep water .
The mammals can grow to 10 metres in length and are inquisitive , sometimes approaching boats in the north Atlantic .
A source from the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs said : " Because this is a deep water creature coming into shallow waters , it is possible that its sonar has been affected and it could be disorientated . "
Tom Howard - Vyne , the head of communications at the London Eye , said he had seen the whale on the opposite bank of the river to Westminster .
" I saw it blow , it was a spout of water which sparkled in the air .
It was on this side of Westminster Bridge ... it was an amazing sight . "
NEW DELHI , July 9 — India test - fired its longest - range nuclear - capable missile on Sunday for the first time , government officials said .
But although the missile was launched , it was unclear whether the entire test was successful , with at least one report saying that the missile had failed at some point in its flight .
The launching has occurred at a time of rising international tension over North Korea 's recent missile tests , and as the United States Congress is considering a civilian nuclear pact that the Bush administration negotiated with India .
While the pact does not concern missile tests or other military activity , its critics say the Bush administration failed to obtain any commitment from India to stop producing new nuclear weapons fuel , or to restrict its production of new weapons .
The test of the Agni 3 missile ( agni means fire in Hindi ) appeared intended to show that India 's strategic arsenal could reach far beyond Pakistan and cover territory including China .
The missile is reported to have a range of more than 1,800 miles .
The Defense Ministry said it had been launched from Wheeler Island , off the coast of Orissa State in the Bay of Bengal , and had taken off successfully .
' Several of this cursed brood , getting hold of the branches behind , leaped up into the tree , whence they began to discharge their excrements on my head . "
Thus Gulliver describes his first encounter with the Yahoos .
Something similar seems to have happened to democracy .
In April , Shi Tao , a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper , was sentenced to 10 years in prison for " providing state secrets to foreign entities " .
He had passed details of a censorship order to the Asia Democracy Forum and the website Democracy News .
The pressure group Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) was mystified by the ease with which Mr Tao had been caught .
He had sent the message through an anonymous Yahoo ! account .
But the police had gone straight to his offices and picked him up .
How did they know who he was ?
Last week RSF obtained a translation of the verdict , and there they found the answer .
Mr Tao 's account information was " furnished by Yahoo Holdings " .
Yahoo ! , the document says , gave the government his telephone number and the address of his office .
So much for the promise that the internet would liberate the oppressed .
This theory was most clearly formulated in 1999 by the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman .
In his book The Lexus and the Olive Tree , Friedman argues that two great democratising forces - global communications and global finance - will sweep away any regime which is not open , transparent and democratic .
" Thanks to satellite dishes , the internet and television , " he asserts , " we can now see through , hear through and look through almost every conceivable wall .
... no one owns the internet , it is totally decentralised , no one can turn it off ...
China 's going to have a free press ...
Oh , China 's leaders do n't know it yet , but they are being pushed straight in that direction . "
The same thing , he claims , is happening all over the world .
In Iran he saw people ogling Baywatch on illegal satellite dishes .
As a result , he claims , " within a few years , every citizen of the world will be able to comparison shop between his own ... government and the one next door " .
He is partly right .
The internet at least has helped to promote revolutions of varying degrees of authenticity in Serbia , Ukraine , Georgia , Kyrgyzstan , Lebanon , Argentina and Bolivia .
But the flaw in Friedman 's theory is that he forgets the intermediaries .
The technology which runs the internet did not sprout from the ground .
It is provided by people with a commercial interest in its development .
Their interest will favour freedom in some places and control in others .
And they can and do turn it off .
In 2002 Yahoo ! signed the Chinese government 's pledge of " self - regulation " : it promised not to allow " pernicious information that may jeopardise state security " to be posted .
Last year Google published a statement admitting that it would not be showing links to material banned by the authorities on computers stationed in China .
If Chinese users of Microsoft 's internet service MSN try to send a message containing the words " democracy " , " liberty " or " human rights " , they are warned that " This message includes forbidden language .
Please delete the prohibited expression . "
A study earlier this year by a group of scholars called the OpenNet Initiative revealed what no one had thought possible : that the Chinese government is succeeding in censoring the net .
Its most powerful tool is its control of the routers - the devices through which data is moved from one place to another .
With the right filtering systems , these routers can block messages containing forbidden words .
Human - rights groups allege that western corporations - in particular Cisco Systems - have provided the technology and the expertise .
Cisco is repeatedly cited by Thomas Friedman as one of the facilitators of his global revolution .
" We had the dream that the internet would free the world , that all the dictatorships would collapse , " says Julien Pain of Reporters Without Borders .
" We see it was just a dream . "
Friedman was not the first person to promote these dreams .
In 1993 Rupert Murdoch boasted that satellite television was " an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere " .
The Economist had already made the same claim on its cover : " Dictators beware ! "
The Chinese went berserk , and Murdoch , in response , ensured that the threat did not materialise .
In 1994 he dropped BBC world news from his Star satellite feeds after it broadcast an unflattering portrait of Mao Zedong .
In 1997 he ordered his publishing house HarperCollins to drop a book by Chris Patten , the former governor of Hong Kong .
He slagged off the Dalai Lama and his son James attacked the dissident cult Falun Gong .
His grovelling paid off , and in 2002 he was able to start broadcasting into Guangdong .
" We wo n't do programmes that are offensive in China , " Murdoch 's spokesman Wang Yukui admitted .
" If you call this self - censorship then of course we 're doing a kind of self - censorship . "
I think , if they were as honest as Mr Wang , everyone who works for Rupert Murdoch , or for the corporate media anywhere in the world , would recognise these restraints .
To own a national newspaper or a television or radio station you need to be a multimillionaire .
What multimillionaires want is what everybody wants : a better world for people like themselves .
The job of their journalists is to make it happen .
As Piers Morgan , the former editor of the Mirror , confessed , " I 've made it a strict rule in life to ingratiate myself with billionaires . "
They will stay in their jobs for as long as they continue to interpret the interests of the proprietorial class correctly .
What the owners do n't enforce , the advertisers do .
Over the past few months , AdAge.com reveals , both Morgan Stanley and BP have instructed newspapers and magazines that they must remove their adverts from any edition containing " objectionable editorial coverage " .
Car , airline and tobacco companies have been doing the same thing .
Most publications can't afford to lose these accounts ; they lose the offending articles instead .
Why are the papers full of glowing profiles of the advertising boss Martin Sorrell ?
Because they 're terrified of him .
So instead of democracy we get Baywatch .
They are not the same thing .
Aspirational TV might stimulate an appetite for more money or more plastic surgery , and this in turn might encourage people to look , for better or worse , to the political systems that deliver them , but it is just as likely to be counter - democratic .
As a result of pressure from both ratings and advertisers , for example , between 1993 and 2003 environmental programmes were cleared from the schedules on BBC TV , ITV and Channel 4 .
Though three or four documentaries have slipped out since then , the ban has not yet been wholly lifted .
To those of us who have been banging our heads against this wall , it feels like censorship .
Indispensable as the internet has become , political debate is still dominated by the mainstream media : a story on the net changes nothing until it finds its way into the newspapers or on to TV .
What this means is that while the better networking Friedman celebrates can assist a democratic transition , the democracy it leaves us with is filtered and controlled .
Someone else owns the routers .

Talk Introduction
We have witnessed and participated in great advances , in transportation , in computation , in communication , and in biotechnology .
But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast to the even bigger steps in the future .
Sometimes I try to imagine what we , the technologists of the second half of the 20th century , will be remembered for , if anything , hundreds of years from now .
I contend that at this moment in history we are at the beginning of an intellectual revolution based on the assimilation of computational ideas into our culture .
We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years .
The practice of computation arose from military , scientific , business , and accounting applications .
Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments , we have developed a priestly cult of computer scientists .
But , as I have pointed out : Computer Science is not a science , and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers .
The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think .
I will defend this viewpoint with examples and demonstrations .

The 19 - year - old gunman , believed to have deserted in protest against the Gaza pullout this month , opened fire as the bus passed through Shfaram .
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called the incident a reprehensible act by a " bloodthirsty terrorist " .
The gunman was beaten to death by a crowd of people who stormed the bus after his weapon ran out of bullets .
Israel is preparing to pull its settlers and soldiers out of the Gaza Strip and correspondents say there have been fears of attacks by Jewish settlers opposed to the pullout .
' Deserter '
The gunman , Eden Nathan Zaada from the Jewish settlement of Tapuah in the West Bank , wore his army uniform and a skullcap .
According to one eyewitness , the soldier opened fire while talking to the bus driver , who is thought to be one of those killed .
The 19 - year - old is said to have deserted his army unit with his gun
At least 12 people were wounded in the shooting , some seriously .
Mohammed Barakeh , an Israeli Arab member of parliament , said at the scene that the dead were Israeli Arabs and all residents of Shfaram .
Israel media are reporting that the army said Mr Zaada had a " problematic background " .
He was believed to be a member of the outlawed extremist Kach party .
He is said to have deserted his unit a few weeks ago , after refusing to take part in the evacuation of Jewish settlements .
The father of the gunman , Yitzhak Nathan Zaada , said he had asked the army to find his son .
" I was n't afraid he would do something , " he told the Associated Press news agency , adding that his son had told him he would find the time to return his gun .
Protest fear
Israel 's chief of police has dispatched an extra 2,000 officers and urged all Israelis to remain calm .
Moshe Karadi asked people to await an official inquiry into the incident .
Mr Sharon condemned the attack .
" This terror incident is a deliberate attempt to harm the relations between the citizens of Israel , " he said .
" Terror between civilians is the most dangerous thing for the future of Israel and its democratic stability , " he added .
Settler groups have also denounced the violence .
" Murder is murder is murder , and there can be no other response but to denounce it completely and express revulsion , " Bentsi Lieberman , the head of a settlers ' council , told AP .
The bloodiest single attack on Palestinians by a Jewish extremist dates back to 1994 when US - born Jewish Baruch Goldstein shot dead 29 Muslims at a mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron .
And Oranges

Most people , I suspect , can tell the difference between a $ 500 bicycle and a $ 1000 bicycle — most do n’t think the differences are worth the extra money , but they can perceive the differences ( lighter - weight frames , visibly superior components , etc. ) .
I doubt , though , that most non-expert - cyclists are able to distinguish between , say , a $ 1000 bike and a $ 5000 bike .
This holds true for many realms ; it ’s generally pretty easy for most people to perceive the difference between the mediocre and the good , but it often requires expertise or finely - honed sensibility to perceive the difference between the good and the great .
Furthermore , in some cases , most people generally prefer the good to the great .
A high - end racing bicycle is a terrible bike for casual transportation around town — the seats are uncomfortable and the pedals require special footwear .
Cameras are another good example .
Most recreational photographers really do just want to point and shoot ; they do n’t buy point - and - shoot cameras just because they ’re cheaper than SLRs , they buy them because they ’re actually what they want .
“ Better ” is a complicated adjective , because it is subjective .
Whether product A is better than Product B depends entirely upon what criteria matter to you .
A $ 500 bike is better than a $ 5000 bike if you ’re looking for something to ride around your college campus .
A $ 300 Digital Elph is better than an $ 800 Digital Rebel XT if you want a camera that ’s simply easy to use and fits in your pocket .
But just because evaluating “ better - ness ” is subjective does not mean it is arbitrary .
For most products , most people appreciate this .
Even though they can’t perceive the differences between the good and great — or if they do perceive the differences , do n’t care about or do n’t appreciate them — they do n’t dispute that such differences actually exist , or that connoisseurs judge products in their area of expertise by what are sometimes very different criteria .
This is as it should be , and perhaps it all sounds rather obvious .
The point of all this is that in some cases , some people seem unwilling to concede that any criteria other than the ones they themselves deem important actually matter , or even exist .
That ’s dogmatism , 1 and the nature of dogma is such that it pretty much kills any reasonable discussion or debate .

Which brings us to Mark Pilgrim ’s announcement two weeks ago that he ’s switching from Mac OS X to Ubuntu Linux running on a Lenovo ThinkCentre .
It goes without saying that this is a rather curious direction in which to switch — the trend is the other way around , with far more people switching to the Mac than from it .
It is even more curious if you know anything at all about Mark Pilgrim ’s background and personal computer history .
Pilgrim is not some Mac OS X - era carpetbagger .
He ’s a real Mac user , having been using Apple computers for 22 years .
In the early ’90s , he developed a slew of cool games , hacks , and utilities for the Mac — and , notably , released them as open source under the GPL ; there was very little open source software for the Mac in the System 7 era .
Pilgrim is an expert Mac OS X user ; before taking his current job at IBM , he worked as an Apple - certified Mac OS X trainer .
When Mac OS X 10.3 ( a.k.a. Panther ) shipped , he published this wonderfully exhaustive guide to what was new from 10.2 .
His weblog , Dive Into Mark — which prior to his taking an 18 - month hiatus in October 2004 was extraordinarily popular and deservedly so , and was in fact an enormous influence on Daring Fireball — was never a “ Mac weblog ” or “ Apple weblog ” , but did contain a lot of insightful , informative stuff about Mac OS X and Apple .
And even while his weblog was on hiatus , he was still publishing deeply investigative grist for Mac nerds .
All of which is to say that I found it very surprising that , when I linked to his announcement and further explanation , it elicited a wave of email more or less along the lines of “ who gives a crap what computer this Pilgrim guy buys ? ”
Not so unexpected , but disappointing nonetheless , is that nearly all of those contributing to the lengthy comment threads on Pilgrim ’s weblog seem to entirely and utterly miss the point of his argument — which argument is complex and in many ways subtle , which , in turn , is probably why most people chose not to think about it .
Interpolation on the Influence of Yours Truly on the Tone of the Comment Thread for Pilgrim ’s ‘ When the Bough Breaks ’ :
It seems clear to me and deserves to be mentioned here in the open that part of the digressive “ missing the point ” nature of the comments on “ When the Bough Breaks ” are my fault .
When I Link - Listed it , I quoted a paragraph that , I thought , captured a key aspect of Pilgrim ’s argument :
I ’m creating things now that I want to be able to read , hear , watch , search , and filter 50 years from now .
Despite all their emphasis on content creators , Apple has made it clear that they do not share this goal .
Openness is not a cargo cult .
Some get it , some do n’t .
Apple does n’t .
But in what I intended as an aside , I then commented on Pilgrim ’s griping about having lost metadata in both iPhoto and iTunes to database corruption , which he suggested might have been somehow mitigated had those database file formats been publicly documented ( which they are n’t ) .
I wrote :
It ’s obvious he ’s been thinking about this for a long time , but I do n’t agree with all of it .
For example , he ’s been bitten by metadata database corruption in both iPhoto and iTunes ; I think the solution here is a good backup strategy , not open file formats for the binary metadata stores .
Knowing the format of the file wo n’t help if the corruption is severe ; a good back - up will always work .
I agree , though , that closed - format metadata stores are not good long - term archival formats .
I only mentioned backups to refute that one single point ; not to refute Pilgrim ’s entire argument .
2
The problem is that a big chunk of the traffic to his post came from my link , and the comments , especially the early ones , are dominated by people telling him that his problems with Mac OS X could be solved by backing up .
I think that ’s the fault of the misplaced emphasis in what I wrote .
( Pilgrim thinks so , too . )
End interpolation .
So why is Pilgrim switching ?
For the benefit of those of you who have n’t read his piece yet and are too lazy to pause here and read it yourselves — which you really ought to do , if for no other reason than that he ’s a good writer — I ’ll list several of his cited reasons :
He ’s a Firefox and Emacs junkie , and does n’t need a Mac to use them .
( I ’ll add that Firefox , in my opinion , works better , or at least fits in better , on Windows and on Linux than it does on Mac OS X. )
He ’s unhappy about the Apple software he does use — iTunes , iPhoto , and iMovie — because of the aforementioned corruption problems with the first two and because iMovie does n’t let you export edit decision lists .
3
He does n’t like the iTunes Music Store ’s DRM , and because he does n’t like ITMS DRM , he does n’t like the increasing number of ITMS tie-ins in each new revision of iTunes .
He ’s irritated by QuickTime Pro’s $ 30 price tag , which most people pay just so they can watch movies in full - screen mode .
He does n’t like .
Mac .
( He ’s not alone . )
But the crux of his argument is the afore - quoted passage regarding openness and long - term data preservation .
That ’s good , because the points mentioned above really do n’t make for much of a case , on their own .
Arguing over these points , however , which is what most of the commenters on his site have done , is missing the point .
Yes , they ’re all niggles , but Pilgrim is n’t claiming otherwise ; he is simply pointing out the obvious , that a lot of little things about Mac OS X suck .
These niggles do n’t constitute the full case for his switch ; they ’re just factors that made his decision easier .
There ’s an unbecoming tendency for some Mac users to contort their worldview in such a way so as to construe that Mac OS X is better than every other OS in every single way , or that its overall superiority ought to be obvious to everyone .
This actually was true , or very nearly so , in the System 6 era of the late ’ 80s , but it certainly has n’t been true since then ; sticking to this notion just makes you look like a small - minded jackass .
( Not to mention that many of the people I ’m describing were n’t even out of diapers when System 6 was current . )
There are ways that Windows is better than the Mac , and many of them are rather obvious .
E.g. if you need AutoCAD , Windows is better .
If you want to play Half Life 2 , Windows is better .
For most of the past 20 years , PCs offered more raw computing performance than Macs .
These are facts , but that has n’t stopped some Mac users from trying to deny them .
The ways that Mac OS X is better are in many ways more subjective , and for many people , imperceptible .
Or perceptible but they just do n’t care .
Many Mac users just ca n’t get it through their heads that most people do n’t give a rip about the quality of the design of the user interfaces they use ; that for most people “ good enough ” is good enough .
Mac OS
X is better than Windows if you care about user interface design ; if you do n’t , though , it ’s just different , not better .
It is easier , or more comforting , for Windows nerds who do not perceive anything significantly better about the Mac ’s UI to chalk up Mac users ’ strong preference to their being irrational cultists than it is to admit that they ( the Mac users ) perhaps have a more acute sense of UI design aesthetics .
Contrast this to the markets for , say , bicycles or cameras .
As mentioned at the outset , lay people are , as a general rule , perfectly happy to concede that these high - end products are better in ways that they do n’t perceive or understand or care about .
The difference is that with cameras and bicycles , the differences between high - end and consumer - end products are almost always measurable .
Expensive bikes weigh less and have sturdier frames .
High - end cameras have faster lenses and digital sensors with higher ISO sensitivity and can shoot more frames per second .
Lay people may not understand or know about these differences , or why these differences are worth thousands of extra dollars to serious cyclists and photographers , but they could understand them if they wanted to sit down and learn about them .
It ’s just that they do n’t care so they do n’t bother .
I.e. the key to understanding high - end bikes and cameras is knowledge , not perception .
( It ’s a matter of taste which high - end bike or camera you buy , but not a matter of taste whether you want a $ 2000 DSLR or a $ 200 point - and - shoot . )
Whereas if we concede that the Mac is a computer with a high - end user interface , what it is that makes its UI “ high - end ” is a matter of taste and perception .
There do exist ways that you can scientifically measure and test the usability of software — i.e. that by Fitts ’s Law you can prove that the Mac menu bar is more usable than the Windows - style menu bar within each window — but that ’s not why Mac users are Mac users .
No one goes out and subjects themselves to serious usability testing to determine which OS they should use .
Mac users prefer the Mac because they just prefer it .
You can explain the reasons why you prefer the Mac , but can you explain why you care about those reasons ?
You either feel it or you do n’t .
Hence the difficult situation faced by small - minded Windows users who do not get the appeal of the Mac ; to admit that Mac users ’ strong preferences are reasonable would be to admit that they ( the Windows users ) are unable to perceive something that Mac users can .
That to concede that Mac users are reasonable would n’t just imply that Mac OS X is in at least certain ways much better than Windows , but that Mac users in certain ways have a more refined sense of taste than Windows users , which in turn cuts way too close to implying that in certain ways Mac users are smarter , which is where things turn ugly because those certain ways are , to Mac users , the ways that really matter , and any chance at reasonable discourse evaporates because both sides feel deeply insulted by the other .
The openness issues that Pilgrim is talking about are like that — except that maybe even fewer people perceive or deeply care about these issues than about user interface design .
And the way that his arguments are being dismissed , by most of the responses I ’ve seen , is similar , rhetorically , to the infuriating manner in which many Windows partisans have long dismissed the Mac .
To wit : denying that the cited factors exist or matter , and thereby ascribing the avowed preference to irrational zealotry rather than to refined or acute sensibilities .
Telling Pilgrim that he ’s making a mistake because Ubuntu does n’t have as refined or cohesive a UI as Mac OS X is like telling someone who is switching from a Chevy Tahoe to a Toyota Prius that he ’s not going to have as much cargo room .
He knows it .
3 .
The point here is n’t that everyone ought to agree that the Mac has a “ better ” user interface than Windows or that the Mac is n’t “ open ” enough compared to Linux ; the point is that everyone ought to be able to have a reasonable discussion about these issues and their relative merits , and do so with the understanding that no one ought to expect to be able to outright prove their case one way or the other .
It ’s not a binary situation , where Windows and Linux have bad UIs and Mac OS X has a good one , and but Linux is “ open ” and Mac OS X and Windows are not .
Nor is there just a single continuum upon which to gauge these choices .
It ’s often said that you should n’t compare apples and oranges — generally used figuratively , but even looking at it literally you can see that it ’s not true .
You need to compare apples and oranges when you ’re deciding what to pack in your lunch .
What you ca n’t do is compare apples and oranges and somehow conclusively prove that one is better than the other .
Or ask yourself this : what would you rather read : a well - plotted but poorly - written potboiler or a well - written novel with a rather nondescript story line ?
A quick look at the best - seller lists tells you how most people would answer .
The point is that you do n’t choose one novel over another because it is somehow universally “ better ” , but rather because it is somehow more appealing , better for you , as an individual , based on the innumerable inscrutable tastes and desires and opinions that make you the unique snowflake that you are .
The reason this Pilgrim situation is so hideously complex is that all modern operating systems are complex .
It takes a lot of work and investigation and expertise just to understand and form opinions about one of them , on its own ; comparing one against another ca n’t be done by reducing the comparison to some single metric because they ’re different in so many different ways .
It ’s easy to choose between two things that differ from each other in just one way — and it ’s easy to explain your decision .
Not so when choosing between things that differ in hundreds or maybe even thousands of ways .
Assuming you ’ve made your choice with an open mind , it ’s really unlikely that your decision came down to just one factor , or even just a handful .
The interesting decision is n’t really about which choice you ultimately make , but in which factors you use to make that decision , and how much relative weight to ascribe to them .
It might strike you as crazy that when Pilgrim first decided to switch , he had n’t even yet decided what open source operating system to switch to .
I.e. how could it be anything other than a rash decision if he did n’t even know exactly what he was switching to ?
But the particulars of the OS he ’s switching to do n’t really matter , because what ’s changed is n’t his opinion about Mac OS X or any particular distribution of Linux , but rather the amount of importance he ’s decided to place on the openness of the OS he ’s using .
To place more value on openness , less on UI refinement , and thus to conclude that he’d be happier switching to Linux .
That he has a long list of petty annoyances about Mac OS X and that desktop Linux continues to improve in terms of UI refinement — these things of course factor in as well .
Everything factors in is what I ’m trying to say .
What ’s more important ?
Openness of data and control over one ’s environment ?
Or aesthetic appeal and usability ?
It ’s a gross error to think that this is some sort of binary choice , that on the one side you have openness , and on the other usability .
Many aspects of Mac OS X are open .
Ubuntu ’s UI is steadily improving .
The hard part is deciding how much importance to give to each factor you care about .
How much openness are you willing to give up for a system with a better interface ?
How awkward of a UI are you willing to tolerate for a system that offers you the source code to everything ?
Now factor in your habits and what you already know .
I , for example , am far less likely to switch away from Mac OS X than I would be if I were n’t already an expert user .
This is n’t blind loyalty or zealotry ; expertise has value , and in my case it would take a lot of time to become equally proficient on another system .
So how do you evaluate so many different factors and reach a conclusion ?
I do n’t know .
( Paging Malcolm Gladwell . )
You ca n’t just test drive an Accord and a Camry and conclude that one is good and the other is bad and drive off with the good one .
There ’s no way to compile a list that conclusively shows one is absolutely better .
At some point it comes down to a feeling .
Informed by thinking , after measuring the facts , yes .
But a gut decision nonetheless .
4 .
You ’re doing yourself a disservice if you dismiss an argument like Pilgrim ’s simply because you believe he ’s an open source / open format ideologue ; ideologues are n’t necessarily irrational zealots .
( And even irrational zealots or fanatics are n’t necessarily wrong ; cf. Henry Kissinger ’s quip : “ Even a paranoid has some real enemies . ” )
An ideology is an organized system of beliefs ; just because you do n’t share them does n’t mean they are n’t valid .
Ideological conviction does n’t necessarily imply a rigid , quick - to - judge closed mind ( even though , admittedly , that is often the case ) .
You can be an ideologue with an open , honest mind — to believe otherwise is to say that someone with an open mind can never reach an uncompromising conclusion .
If your reaction to Pilgrim ’s announcement was a snap judgment that he ’s lost it , or that he ’s being an asshole who ’s just looking for attention as the guy who switched away from the Mac just at the time when it ( the Mac ) seems poised to become more popular than ever , or that he ’s an open source fanatic who just ca n’t be reasoned with or trusted — are you sure that the zealotry at play is his ?
Thought experiment : Let ’s say that Microsoft puts together a miraculous fourth - quarter comeback and that Windows Vista rocks .
Not just rocks compared to the way it currently appears as though Vista is actually going to turn out , but rocks , period .
As in looks better than Mac OS X . More elegant than Mac OS X. Noticeably faster and snappier than Mac OS X .
( That one ’s actually quite likely . )
I.e. “ better ” than Mac OS X , in glaringly obvious ways .
How would this make you feel ?
If your answer is that it would depress you , or sicken you , or really in any way dampen your spirits — why ?
Would n’t this be good news for everyone , including Mac users ?
Either Apple would have to up the ante and improve Mac OS X in similar ways , or , Mac users could just switch .
Either way the result is that we’d be able to use something better than what we ’re using now .
One reasonable objection would be to point out that the Microsoft Corporation has a proven record of cheating and rule - bending and law - breaking and really just generally unsavory conduct at its executive levels , and that because of this track record it really ought to be depressing for Microsoft to “ win ” in this regard .
So let ’s say instead it ’s Ubuntu Linux .
How can you argue that this would be anything but a good thing ?
I ’m deeply suspicious of Mac users who claim to be perfectly happy with Mac OS X. Real Mac users , to me , are people with much higher standards , impossibly high standards , and who use Macs not because they ’re great , but because they suck less than everything else .
Pilgrim , to me , is a quintessential Mac user in that regard ; and what he ’s doing is wondering if maybe things might suck less somewhere else .
“ Better ” for Mark Pilgrim does n’t mean better for you , and nowhere has Pilgrim implied that it does .
Admitting that he has a point , or several points , or that he may well be correct that he ’s going to be more satisfied with Ubuntu than he was with Mac OS X , does not imply that Mac users are wrong or stupid or foolish .
And the truth is I ’m not entirely sure he ’s making the right decision , even for himself .
Forget all the niggling details he cites , and focus only on his central beef — that Apple is a company that does not “ get ” openness , and that this deficiency is going to hinder Pilgrim ’s long - term access to the data he ’s creating .
But if that ’s the case , and Pilgrim has been using Apple computers for 22 years , why has n’t it happened already ?
Openness is n’t binary , a choice between totally open and totally closed , it ’s a continuum .
The question is n’t “ Does Apple get it ? ” , but “ Does Apple get it enough ? ”
But from the perspective of someone immersed in the free software culture , where everything operates near the extreme edge of the open / closed continuum , it ’s easy to see how things begin to look binary — not open / closed , but totally - open / not - totally - open .
That , to me , is the most convincing counter - argument to Pilgrim’s .
That if Apple ’s lack of openness were a disaster in the making , it ( the disaster ) would have occurred already .
And while it is easy to find ways to complain that Apple is not open enough — under - documented and undocumented security updates and system revisions , under - documented and undocumented file formats — it would be hard to argue with the premise that Apple today is more open than it has ever been before .
( Exhibit A : the Web Kit project . )
But there are things that could be better , should be better , but are n’t , and it ’s hard to ascribe these policies to anything other than management that is , at best , indifferent to issues related to openness .
Cf. Tom Yager ’s report in Macworld yesterday of being invited to Apple to discuss his InfoWorld column on the closing of the x86 version of the Darwin kernel ; the gist of Apple ’s response was to tell Yager that he should n’t have written about it because no one cares , which response is rather painfully tone - deaf PR - wise , in that the reason Yager wrote it in the first place is that he obviously thinks his readers do care .
Stories like that give rise to the sinking feeling that Apple ’s executives are n’t merely indifferent to openness , but rather that their stance on openness is in fact highly calculated , and that the calculation is that Apple should be open only so far as necessary to be perceived as being open .
I.e. that openness only pertains to marketing , and not to engineering .
There ’s no question that Apple is chock - a- block with engineers and engineering managers who care about openness , but that does little good without a mandate from the executive level .
I ’m willing to admit that I do n’t have a finely - tuned sense for this stuff .
Pilgrim does , and that ’s why I ’m listening .
Be afraid !
Be very afraid !
Those evil particle physicists are at it again with their massive high - energy colliders , and if they 're not closely monitored , their high - falutin ' " experiments " might put an end to the universe as we know it .
This could be doomsday , people , the ultimate Apocalypse !
At least that 's what an average citizen might think if they happened to stumble on this little item on Slashdot , which Jen-Luc Piquant found courtesy of the mystery blogger behind Angry Physics .
It resurrects the rumor of universe - destroying mini- black holes that could be created once CERN's Large Hadron Collider goes online in -- is it 2008 ?
I have n't been keeping up with the official start date .
I 'm sure it 's just a coincidence that the item appeared on the five - year anniversary of those infamous terrorist attacks on NYC and DC .
Nonetheless , the smell of fear -- or at least of fear - mongering -- was still lingering in the air as various members of the Bush administration capped off a pre-election week of stumping across the nation , telling us why we should still be absolutely terrified of innocent - seeming items like bottled water and shampoo , which MIGHT EXPLODE ANY MINUTE .
However , in fairness to the White House , concerns over continuing terrorist threats are much , much more valid than the worry that the LHC will end Life As We Know It On Earth -- almost infinitely so .
Terrorist attacks have actually happened , and our country is still a major target of extremist groups , so a certain degree of caution should appropriately be exercised .
( I still say the whole liquids and gels ban on flights is ludicrous , however . )
Even in physics , one should n't dismiss a potential risk outright , particularly since the LHC will achieve unprecedented energies that will hopefully lead to exciting new physics .
" New physics " implies that scientists could find something surprising , or revolutionary , which could in turn be potentially dangerous .
After all , Wilhelm Roentgen never dreamed in 1898 that his newly discovered x-rays could be fatal in large doses -- the proverbial double - edged sword .
But in case people have forgotten , this is n't the first time we 've heard about mini - black holes being produced in colliders .
Brookhaven 's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) generated all kinds of world - ending rumors when it fired up in 1999 , prompting the Sunday Times of London to print an hysterical article with the headline , " Big Bang Machine Could Destroy Earth ! "
Congress called for special hearings , and legend has it that one reporter called Brookhaven to ask whether RHIC had already created a black hole that swallowed the plane of John F. Kennedy Jr. as it flew past Long Island .
( I would like to think this story is apocryphal , but alas , it probably is n't . )
Most of the RHIC hysteria centered not on mini - black holes , but on strangelets : an object formed should strange quarks stick around long enough after a high - energy collision to combine with up and down quarks .
If a resulting strangelet had a negative charge -- an even more unlikely prospect than a strangelet forming in the first place -- it would gobble up all normal matter it encountered , until the entire universe was converted into strangelets .
Aiee !
Fortunately , the probability of this happening is , at best , on a par with winning the lottery not just once , but more than 10 times in a row .
And that 's an optimistic estimate .
My favorite quote at the time was by MIT physicist Robert Jaffe , who told New York Newsday that , with regard to the formation of strangelets , it was more likely that " a spaceship is going to land in the middle of Texas , and that aliens are going to come out and tell us that the New York Yankees are all aliens . "
My point is that both of these prospects have been carefully studied , in depth , by a panel of top - notch experts in the field , a mere 7 years ago , and found to be , well , fairly preposterous .
Mini black holes might be a wee bit more likely than the formation of strangelets , but even if they are produced , they would n't pose a threat .
Why is that ?
You might well ask .
Two words : Hawking radiation .
Back in the 1990s , Stephen Hawking showed that black holes can emit tiny particles of radiation , which cause them to lose mass over time , gradually winking out of existence .
It 's the result of virtual particle pairs popping out of the quantum vacuum near a black hole .
Normally they would collide and annihilate into energy , but sometimes one of the pair gets sucked into the black hole , resulting in an apparent violation of energy conservation .
The mass of the black hole must decrease slightly as a result to counter this effect and ensure that energy is still conserved .
How fast it evaporates depends on the black hole 's size : the smaller it is , the faster it evaporates .
Ergo , even in the event the LHC produced mini black holes , they would be roughly the size of an electron , and would evaporate in mere fractions of a second .
Ultimately , the best argument against the latest " mini black holes " doomsday scenario is the same as for RHIC and its hypothetical strangelets : it has n't happened yet in the earth 's atmosphere , which is routinely bombarded by cosmic rays , and has been for billions of years , yet no evidence for strangelets or mini - black holes has been detected .
Ditto for the high - energy collisions at RHIC , which has been operating for several years now .
Okay , that last bit is not quite accurate : there 's some debate among particle theorists about whether RHIC has produced a fireball with properties strikingly similar to a black hole .
But as predicted theoretically , whatever it was proved too short - lived to pose a catastrophic risk ; it was n't even around long enough to collect much data beyond the mess of squiggly lines pictured at right .
Neither the RHIC nor the LHC doomsday scenarios are unique in modern physics history .
During the years of the Manhattan Project in the 1940s , there were concerns that a nuclear explosion would set the Earth 's atmosphere .
( Gratuitous Morpheus quote from The Matrix : " It was we who scorched the sky . " )
SLAC 's B factory caused ripples of doomsday concerns when it came online , and there were fears in the 1990s that Fermilab 's Tevatron might create a supernova instead of ( or in addition to ) discovering the top quark .
All proved to be unfounded .
So why does this kind of irrational panic keep happening every time a major physics experiment is slated to begin ?
For starters , human fear is n't logical , and we 're living in an age of unprecedented scientific progress , in which the public is both fascinated by , and fearful of , what science has wrought , and what it might produce in the future .
It 's also an era where the knowledge gap between scientists and the average person on the street could more appropriately be termed a yawning chasm .
The panic stems from ignorance of the actual physics at work .
Normally this would be our cue to decry , once again , the sad state of scientific literacy ( or lack thereof ) in this country .
And we are , indeed , still concerned about this .
But in fairness to the public , sometimes physicists forget what it was like not to have a PhD in the field .
Consider all the science stuff people need to know just to make sense of it all .
Thanks to popular authors like Hawking and the seeping of the notion into popular culture ( Futurama played with black hole physics in one memorable episode ) , the average citizen probably has a rudimentary grasp of black holes and the effects of extreme gravity .
But they do n't necessarily know about Hawking radiation , which requires a solid grasp of concepts like matter and antimatter , virtual particles , energy conservation , and energy / mass conversions , just for starters .
And they do n't have a good grasp of relative size scales , so a " mini black hole " might call to mind something the size of a donut , rather than a teensy subatomic particle .
Nor will they appreciate the associated physical differences related to size -- like the strength of the object 's gravitational pull , for instance , or the amount of energy required to produce a top quark .
( The energy to make a top quark is impressive when expressed in GeVs , but extrapolate that to the macroscale , and it amounts to roughly the energy required for an adult male to perform a single pushup . )
Matters are n't much better when it comes to the inner workings of the actual facilities .
The public knows ( at least one hopes they do ) that physicists are smashing atoms inside giant colliders , but they do n't understand that producing a mini black hole -- or a top quark , Higgs boson , or hypothetical graviton , for that matter -- requires concentrating sufficient mass into very tiny spaces to reach the literally astronomical high energies needed to recreate early cosmic conditions in the lab .
And even then , it would probably require that string theory be correct in its assumption that gravity is n't as weak as it seems to be , because it can seep into extra dimensions -- meaning it would be much stronger at the Planck scales at which such dimensions might exist .
So now we 're asking them to be conversant in basic string theory and extra- dimensional concepts as well , not to mention the notion of a Planck scale .
Given the fact that there are members of the public with active brain cells who can't even remember that the earth orbits the sun , not vice versa , and it seems a lot to ask of the average nonscientist , especially if they 're distracted by the season premiere of Grey 's Anatomy .
I wish I had a solution to the problem , other than to echo everyone else in calling for a redoubling of our education and outreach efforts .
But sometimes it seems to be a losing battle , does n't it ?
Granted , it 's discouraging at times , but I still say it 's a war worth waging .
Otherwise , think of what a less - than - scientifically - literate layperson might make of last month 's breaking news about graphene : " Black Hole in a Pencil , " the Science magazine headline read .
Pencils ?
Black holes ?
What could possibly be the connection ?
That headline gave me pause , and I 'm reasonably scientifically literate .
I even know a little bit about graphene , thanks to my regular attendance at certain physics conferences .
( I 'm hoping to write a more extensive post on the subject at some point , but I 'm still muddling through the technical details . )
In essence , graphene is the two - dimensional version of graphite , the stuff of pencil lead .
There was some doubt as to whether this was even possible -- for it to be truly 2D it would have to be a mere atom thick , making it also highly unstable -- but Andre Geim and cohorts at the University of Manchester in the UK succeeded in creating sheets of graphene in 2004 , and have been investigating this new substance further ever since .
It 's pretty exciting stuff .
Much has been made of the material 's potential for creating ultrafast molecular - scale transistors , especially the fact that the electrons in graphene zip along at the speed of light , as if they had no mass -- contrary to special relativity , which says no object with even the tiniest bit of mass can ever exactly reach the speed of light .
Geim 's latest results suggest that graphene can also shoot electrons through other materials as if they were invisible , making it possible to test the so - called Klein paradox in a tabletop experiment .
( You can see nifty movies of the effect here . )
It 's related to quantum tunneling , in which electrons can tunnel through supposedly insurmountable energy barriers .
The likelihood for tunneling decreases the higher or thicker the energy barriers that are raised , and infinitely high walls should reduce those chances to zero .
Oskar Klein , however , said that if particles were moving fast enough ( i.e. , at the speed of light ) , they could pass through even infinitely high barriers .
It 's the kind of bizarre behavior that would normally require superheavy atoms or -- ta-da ! -- black holes .
Um ...
That 's it ?
That 's the " connection " between pencils and black holes ?
I understand if you feel a bit cheated , since the connection seems pretty tenuous at best .
Sure , Science was attempting to find a creative , fun little angle to liven up a potentially dry topic , but in this case , it 's highly misleading .
They let their own cleverness impede effective communication of the essential concepts .
I guarantee the average non-scientist reader would just hear " black hole " and " pencil , " and react accordingly .
( On the upside Jen -Luc points out that hardly anyone outside the scientific community is likely to read Science . )
Blame the editors if one day , in the near future , some poor kid taking the SATs starts worrying that his Number 2 pencil could make like a black hole at any moment , and quite possibly destroy the universe .
しつこく Hello world !
を作ります。
http://shinh.skr.jp/ttyplay/gdb_hello.html
えーと上記はデモです。内容は、
main ;
だけのコードで gdb を起動して、対話環境チックに動作内容を確認しつつ main の中身を作って、うまくできたらそれを保存して実行ファイルにする、というような内容です。
デモの説明とかは今度気が向いた時に書きます。あと
Hello world !
の改行が出てなかったのはそもそも改行を忘れてたからでした…
すぐに気が向きました。解説入ります。
一番近いのはあれです 。BASIC 。 ウソ
ウソと言ってますが後述しているように、割と似てます。同じ行番号のコードを書いたら上書きできるとか、
LIST コマンドぽいのがあるとか。
ここで冒頭の main ; だけのファイルを作ります。ここで重要なことは .data セクションに置くだけです。こうしておかないと書き換えがスムーズにできないからです。
さてとりあえず対話環境を作ります。 たった5バイトです！！！
これは irb がなんかやたら小さ いRubyスクリプトであるとかウサギ本あたりに書いてあったので対抗意識というか。
まぁ普通に実行すると落ちてしまいます。
main=195 ; なら落ちないのは勉強ずみですよね！
GDB で書き込みに使ったコマンドをはっておきます。
set *(( char * ) &main+40 ) =' H ' set *( ( char * ) & main +41 ) ='e ' set *( ( char * ) & main +42 ) ='l ' set *( ( char * ) & main+43 ) ='l ' set *( ( char * ) & main +44 ) ='o ' set *(( char * ) & main +45 ) = ' ' set *( ( char * ) &main +46 ) ='w ' set *( ( char * ) & main +47 ) ='o ' set *( ( char * ) & main +48 ) ='r ' set *(( char * ) &main+49 ) ='l ' set *(( char * ) &main+50 ) ='d ' set *(( char * ) &main+51 ) ='!' set *(( char * ) &main+52) =0
ここで
p ( char * ) &main+40
をして Hello world を置いたメモリ位置を確認しています。このメモリアドレスは直後で使用するわけです。
set *( ( char * ) &main ) = 0xb9 set *(( char * ) &main +1 ) = 0x46 set *(( char * ) &main +2 ) = 0x95 set *(( char * ) &main+3 ) = 0x04 set *(( char * ) &main +4 ) = 0x08 set *(( char * ) &main +5 ) = 0xcc
こんな感じで mov を作りました。ここはデモとは違うアドレスになってると思います。ここだけ手入力してたのはデモを調整してるうちに変わってたからです。ケツに
0xcc を置いておいて、 cont で実行させて、 i r でレジスタを確認しました。なんてインタラクティブ性の高い環境でしょう。戻る時には
( gdb ) p &main $ 4 = ( < data variable , no debug info > *) 0x8049528 ( gdb ) set $ eip=$
4
などとしてました。いったん &main を表示させてたのは、 set $ eip=&main とかできないなーという感じだったので適当な workaround です 。
さて続くの は
set *( ( char * ) &main +5 ) = 0xbb set *( ( char * ) &main +6 ) = 0x01 set *( ( char * ) &main +7 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +8 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +9 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +10 ) = 0 x ba set *(( char * ) &main +11 ) = 13 set *(( char * ) &main + 12 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +13 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main + 14 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +15 ) = 0xb8 set *(( char * ) &main +16 ) = 0x04 set *(( char * ) &main +17 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +18 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +19 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +20 ) = 0xcd set *(( char * ) &main +21 ) = 0x80 set *(( char * ) &main + 22 ) = 0x bb set *(( char * ) &main +23 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main + 24 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +25 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +26 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +27 ) = 0xb8 set *(( char * ) &main +28 ) = 0x01 set *(( char * ) &main +29 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main+30 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main+31 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +32 ) = 0xcd set *(( char * ) &main+33 ) = 0x80
というような要するに write して exit するだけのコード。保存は gcore コマンドで行いました。そんで実行してみた後、 gdb を去りました 。
gcore で吐いた core の中身 を
od -t x1z core .
15392
で確認して、 Hello world で検索してプログラムがどこから始まってるか調べました。そんで dd で適当に切り出しです。以下のような感じで 。
dd skip=7016 bs=1 count=60 if=core.15392 of=hello.bin

It has been a busy week in the Apple world .
Not only did Snow Leopard finally come out ( along with our epic review ) , but Apple announced a special media event that is expected to see updates to the entire iPod line .
What else was at the top of the news this week ?
Read on for our roundup .
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard : the Ars Technica review : Mac OS X 10.6 , aka Snow Leopard has landed .
This time around , Apple goes light on the glitz in favor of some heavy work under the hood .
John Siracusa dives deep into Apple 's new OS offering to see what 's new , what 's still the same , and whether it 's worth upgrading .
Apple confirms September 9 , 2009 " rock and roll " event : Apple has announced a special media event to take place on September 9 , 2009 .
The invitation indicates that it will be iPod- related ( just like in previous years ) and will take place in San Francisco .
5 ways to listen to music on the iPhone without using iTunes :
One of the iPhone 's main selling points is its ability to play music .
But we do n't always want to listen to music from our iTunes libraries , do we ?
Here are five ways to listen to music on an iPhone without using iTunes .
Apple rumored to have supersized prototype tablets ( poll ) :
The latest tidbit out of China suggests Apple is looking at larger sizes for tablet computers , and they might just run Mac OS X , too .
Take our poll and let us know what you think about an Apple tablet .
Snow Leopard 's " Wake on Demand " could lead to Apple TV bliss :
If you are using Snow Leopard and have some newer Apple hardware , there 's a new way in which your devices can be awoken from sleep — and not just over a wired connection .
OpenCL gets tires kicked , run around the block : Early attempts to benchmark OpenCL performance on Snow Leopard reveal some details about Apple 's first - out - of - the - gate implementation of the GPGPU language — as well as some hints at impressive processing speed .
Sources : Current iPod SKUs discontinued , hinting at refresh : According to insiders speaking to Ars , stock of current iPod models is running dry and new ones are n't coming in anytime soon .
This all but confirms that an iPod refresh is on the way , but we already knew that .
Apple lists software known to be janky with Snow Leopard : Forget Adobe CS3 .
There 's a whole swath of software applications that wo n't work well ( or at all ) with Snow Leopard , and Apple has listed out a handful of them for your convenience .
Some will be prevented from loading , so check out the list before you install .
Poll Technica : Will Steve Jobs present at September 9 event ?
Is Steve Jobs planning to present at next week 's iPod event ?
Two analysts have taken opposing views on the matter , and so has the Ars staff .
What do our readers think ?
Tell us in the poll .
Apple TV might be on the agenda for September 9 event : Low availability of one Apple TV model leads at least one analyst to speculate about an Apple TV announcement next week .
An Apple TV update would be welcome — especially if it adds oft - requested features — but we think it 'll be " only rock and roll " next Wednesday .
Apple says exploding iPhones due to " external pressure " : Apple 's investigation into spontaneously exploding and cracking iPhones has yet to yield any evidence of product defects .
That is the story the company told to France 's minister of consumer affairs , anyway .
Have a great weekend , everyone !
The allegations in Newsweek magazine contribute to an ever more disturbing portrait of embattled marines under high stress , some on their third tour of duty after ferocious door - to - door fighting in the Sunni insurgent strongholds of Falluja and Haditha .
The wife of the unnamed staff sergeant claimed there had been a " total breakdown " in the unit 's discipline after it was pulled out of Falluja in early 2005 .
" There were problems in Kilo company with drugs , alcohol , hazing [ violent initiation games ] , you name it , " she said .
" I think it 's more than possible that these guys were totally tweaked out on speed or something when they shot those civilians in Haditha . "
The troops in Iraq have been ordered to take refresher courses on battlefield ethics , but a growing body of evidence from Haditha suggests the strain of repeated deployments in Iraq is beginning to unravel the cohesion and discipline of the combat troops .
" We are in trouble in Iraq , " Barry McCaffrey , a retired army general who played a leading role in the Iraq war , told Time magazine .
" Our forces ca n't sustain this pace , and I 'm afraid the American people are walking away from this war . "
The Newsweek account described a gung - ho battalion that had staged a chariot race , complete with captured horses , togas and heavy metal music , before the battle for Falluja in late 2004 .
The marines were given loose rules of engagement in the vicious urban warfare that followed .
" If you see someone with a cellphone , " said one of the commanders was quoted as saying , half - jokingly , " put a bullet in their fucking head " .
At one point in the battle , a marine from the 3rd battalion was caught on camera shooting a wounded , unarmed man as he lay on the ground .
However , the marine involved was later exonerated .
The third battalion lost 17 men in 10 days in Falluja and by the time the troops arrived in Haditha , in autumn last year , it was clear morale had plummeted .
A Daily Telegraph reporter who visited its headquarters early this year at Haditha Dam , on the outskirts of the town , described it as a " feral place " where discipline was " approaching breakdown " .
He reported that some marines had left the official living quarters and had set up separate encampments with signs ordering outsiders to keep out .
Other observers , however , have come away from time spent with the marines with different impressions .
Lucian Read , a photographer who spent five months with Kilo company , said it was generally well led , although sometimes squads had to go on patrol without an officer because there were not enough to go around .
Mr Read told Time magazine that Kilo company was the " most human " of the many units he had accompanied in Iraq .
" They were never abusive , " he said .
" There was a certain amount of antagonism and frustration when people did n't cooperate .
But it 's not like they had ' kill 'em all ' spray - painted on the walls . "
Three senior officers in the Haditha - based 3rd battalion of the first marine regiment , known as the Thundering Third , have been relieved of duty because of a " lack of confidence " in their leadership .
The officers include Captain Lucas McConnell , the head of Kilo company , which was directly involved in the deaths of 24 unarmed Iraqis there on November 19 .
Another captain from the battalion , James Kimber , was relieved of duty for a separate incident , according to his lawyer , who said his subordinates in India company had sworn and derided Iraqi security forces in an interview with Sky News .
The commander of the third battalion , Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Chessani , has also been made to step down pending the outcome of the Haditha investigation .
A criminal investigation conducted by navy investigators into the Haditha killings is still under way , but a parallel army inquiry into the wider issues has been completed .
However , a military official said some findings might be withheld pending the principle inquiry findings .
On Saturday the Iraqi government rejected the findings of a US inquiry into the death of nine civilians in a US raid in the town of Ishaqi and said it would conduct its own investigation .
All eight members up for re-election to the Pennsylvania school board that had been sued for introducing the teaching of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in biology class were swept out of office yesterday by a slate of challengers who campaigned against the intelligent design policy .
Among the losing incumbents on the Dover , Pa. , board were two members who testified in favor of the intelligent design policy at a recently concluded federal trial on the Dover policy : the chairwoman , Sheila Harkins , and Alan Bonsell .
The election results were a repudiation of the first school district in the nation to order the introduction of intelligent design in a science class curriculum .
The policy was the subject of a trial in Federal District Court that ended last Friday .
A verdict by Judge John E. Jones III is expected by early January .
" I think voters were tired of the trial , they were tired of intelligent design , they were tired of everything that this school board brought about , " said Bernadette Reinking , who was among the winners .

If you were to say " programmatically send an email in . NET " to a .NET programmer , he 'd almost immediately reply " SmtpMail class in System .

A less experienced .NET programmer might take a moment to search the documentation , and then reply " SmtpMail class in System .
Web.

Someone with absolutely no .NET programming experience would take a few minutes on Google , and then reply " SmtpMail class in System .
Web. Mail . "
When Maxim Rouiller 's predecessor ( the company 's former . NET whiz ) was presented with the requirement to " programmatically send an email in . NET , " he used a slightly different approach .
With the change log and source control history , Maxim was able to reconstruct the trials and tribulations he must have gone through to finally master this requirement .

ACLU and NYCLU Release Government Records on " Ideological Exclusion " Policy

NEW YORK --
The American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union today released new documents that indicate the government is broadly interpreting and using a controversial Patriot Act power known as the " ideological exclusion " provision to block people from entering the country .
The ACLU is concerned that the provision is increasingly being used to target foreign scholars and others whose politics the government disfavors .
" The American public suffers when our government abuses anti-terrorism laws to shut out voices and ideas that it does n’t want us to hear , " said ACLU attorney Melissa Goodman .
" America has a rich tradition of robust academic debate .
The government dishonors that tradition when it censors ideas at the border . "
The ACLU and NYCLU obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit filed in coordination with PEN American Center and the American Association of University Professors ( AAUP ) .
Although the documents are heavily redacted , the records suggest that the government used the ideological exclusion provision to exclude from the country , among others , an Italian woman residing in Colombia , a mother and daughter residing in Canada , a businessman from Venezuela , and a woman from Costa Rica .
The names of the individuals have been redacted .
The ideological exclusion provision permits the government to exclude anyone from the country who , in the government ’s view , " endorses or espouses " terrorism or " persuades others " to support terrorism .
While the provision is nominally directed at terrorism , the government appears to be using the provision to censor and manipulate debate , said the ACLU .
Other documents released through the FOIA confirm that the Departments of State and Homeland Security are interpreting the law broadly .
One document states that the law is directed at those who voice " irresponsible expressions of opinion . "
Another states , somewhat bizarrely , that an individual can be excluded under the provision even if he or she endorsed terrorism unintentionally .
" It is wholly inappropriate for immigration officials to keep out people whose politics they do n’t like , " said Donna Lieberman , NYCLU Executive Director .
" Barring the doors is not the way a democracy deals with its critics . "
Little is known about the specific incidents included in the new documents , but the ACLU pointed to several recent cases of high - profile individuals who have been excluded from the United States for what appear to be ideologically motivated reasons , including :
In June , 75 South Korean activists were denied visas as U.S. and South Korean officials met for free trade negotiations in Washington , DC .
The South Korean farmers and trade unionists had hoped to voice their opposition to the draft free trade agreement .
In June , Professor Yoannis " John " Milios of the National Technical University of Athens was blocked from presenting a paper entitled " How Class Works " at the State University of New York at Stony Brook .
Though he visited the United States as recently as 2003 , upon arriving at JFK airport in New York he was detained and interrogated about his politics .
After several hours , he was told that he would have to return to Athens .
In May , London - based Hip Hop artist M.I.A. revealed that she was denied a visa to come work with American music producers on her next album .
News reports indicate that the Sri Lankan - born artist was excluded because government officials concluded that some of her lyrics are overly sympathetic to the Tamil Tigers and the Palestinian Liberation Organization .
In March , Iñaki Egaña , a Basque historian from Spain , arrived at JFK airport with his two children with the intention of researching Basque people in the United States .
Egaña and his family were detained while Egaña was questioned about Mario Salegi , a Basque political activist and writer whom Egaña had intended to study .
After being detained for 24 hours , Egaña and his family were sent back to Spain .
In Spring 2006 , Dr. Waskar Ari , a scholar of race and ethnic studies and a member of the Aymara indigenous people in Bolivia , was blocked from assuming a teaching position at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln .
Dr. Ari , who earned a Ph.D. in history from Georgetown University , applied for a work visa after accepting the Nebraska offer in June 2005 .
More than a year later , U.S. immigration officials have yet to act on his visa application , but have since revoked his student visa , leaving Dr. Ari inadmissible to the country .
The State Department recently said that Dr. Ari is being excluded on national security grounds , but it has not offered any evidence to support this allegation .
In 2005 , Dora Maria Tellez , who served as a Parliamentary leader and Minister of Health in Nicaragua in the 1980s , was forced to abandon her teaching post at Harvard University after the government rejected her visa application .
Tellez , who had visited the United States several times up to 2001 , was reportedly excluded because of her role in the 1979 Nicaraguan revolution that overthrew the dictator Anastasio Somoza .
A lawsuit challenging the provision is currently pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York .
That lawsuit was filed by the ACLU , NYCLU , AAUP , PEN and the American Academy of Religion , and charges that the provision is being used to prevent United States citizens and residents from hearing speech that is protected by the First Amendment .
The groups filed the lawsuit after Professor Tariq Ramadan was barred from entering the United States , where he was offered a teaching position at the University of Notre Dame .
Although the government has since backed away from its claim that Professor Ramadan is inadmissible under the Patriot Act provision , on June 23 , Judge Paul A. Crotty ruled that the government must act on Ramadan ’s pending visa application , and that it cannot bar non-citizens from the United States simply because it disagrees with their political views .
" Ideological misuse of the immigration laws has significant effects on the freedom of academic and political debate inside the United States , " said Jameel Jaffer , Deputy Director of the ACLU ’s National Security Program , who argued before Judge Crotty .
" As the court recognized , the government cannot use the immigration laws as a means of silencing its critics and denying Americans the opportunity to hear dissenting voices . "
The Patriot Act ’s ideological exclusion provision echoes laws that were used in the 1960s , 70s , and 80s to bar those who were associated with the Communist Party .
Those laws were used to bar , among many other prominent individuals , the writers Graham Greene , Gabriel Garcia Marquez , Dario Fo , and Pablo Neruda , and former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau .
Attorneys in the FOIA case are Goodman and Jaffer of the ACLU ; Arthur N. Eisenberg of the NYCLU ; and New York immigration lawyer Claudia Slovinsky .
The documents released today are online at www.aclu.org/exclusion.

As you run to the wall , you should pump your arms like you ’re sprinting , rather than swinging your arms from behind and up as you did in the one - legged wall flip . [ 33 ]
In order to figure out what will be most comfortable for you , practice running at the wall and using both your right and left foot as your first step .
Run up to the wall a bit faster than you did for the one - legged wall flip .
With a two - step wall flip , deciding which foot to start your steps with lies more with personal preference rather than a clear cut right or left step .
For example , if you are a righty , your right foot will be your dominant foot .
You may want to take your first step using your right foot so you can get a lot of height in your first jump up the wall .
However , you may want to take your first step with your left foot , so your dominant foot can push off the wall and provide better control in your flip .
It all depends on what ’s more comfortable for you .

A security flaw in the PayPal web site is being actively exploited by fraudsters to steal credit card numbers and other personal information belonging to PayPal users .
The issue was reported to Netcraft today via our anti-phishing toolbar .
The scam works quite convincingly , by tricking users into accessing a URL hosted on the genuine PayPal web site .
The URL uses SSL to encrypt information transmitted to and from the site , and a valid 256 - bit SSL certificate is presented to confirm that the site does indeed belong to PayPal ; however , some of the content on the page has been modified by the fraudsters via a cross - site scripting technique ( XSS ) .
The genuine PayPal SSL certificate used by the scam
When the victim visits the page , they are presented with a message that has been ' injected ' onto the genuine PayPal site that says , " Your account is currently disabled because we think it has been accessed by a third party .
You will now be redirected to Resolution Center . "
After a short pause , the victim is then redirected to an external server , which presents a fake PayPal Member log -
In page .
At this crucial point , the victim may be off guard , as the paypal.com domain name and SSL certificate he saw previously are likely to make him realise he has visited the genuine PayPal web site – and why would he expect PayPal to redirect him to a fraudulent web site ?
Fraudsters manipulating content on genuine PayPal site
If the victim logs in via the fake login page , their PayPal username and password is transmitted to the fraudsters and they are subsequently presented with another page which requests them to enter further details to remove limits on the access of their account .
Information requested includes social security number , credit card number , expiration date , card verification number and ATM PIN .
The server currently running the scam is hosted in Korea and is accessed via a hex - encoded IP address .
The Netcraft Toolbar already protects PayPal users by blocking access to this site .
UPDATE : Paypal has now addressed this vulnerability .
A company spokesman said Paypal is working with the Internet service provider that hosts the malicious site to get it shut down , and does not yet know how many people may have fallen victim to the scam .
Netcraft 's Web Application Security Testing service can identify similar cross -site scripting flaws on your organization 's web servers .

' Egregious disregard for safety ' caused NY limo crash
Two years after the country 's worst road transportation disaster since 2005 , the NTSB finalized its report on the cause .
We have implemented VirtualWiFi on Windows XP .
The current version is a prototype implementation of VirtualWiFi , and we are in the process of making our software more robust to include more features .
Your comments are very welcome .
The third application of VirtualWiFi is called WiFiProfiler , which enables clients to cooperatively diagnose the root cause of various wireless problems .
Clients , including the ones that are disconnected from the WLAN , use VirtualWiFi to form an information plane , which is different from the data plane ( the WLAN ) .
All clients then exchange configuration information over this information plane and use this information to diagnose the root cause of various wireless failures .
The details of this idea are described in a technical paper , titled : “ WiFiProfiler : Cooperative Diagnosis in Wireless LANs “ .
The second application of VirtualWiFi that increases the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks using orthogonal channels is called Slotted Seeded Channel Hopping ( SSCH ) .
SSCH uses VirtualWiFi to virtualize a wireless card with as many instances as the number of orthogonal channels .
It then connects each virtual wireless card on a different orthogonal channel .
Furthermore , SSCH proposes a novel scheme of partial synchronization that can be used with VirtualWiFi .
The details of the SSCH protocol are described in another paper , titled : “ SSCH : Slotted Seeded Channel Hopping for Capacity Improvement in IEEE 802.11 Ad- Hoc Wireless Networks “ .
We have explored several other applications of VirtualWiFi .
The first application is called Client Conduit , which is a very useful tool for fault diagnosis and recovery in Wireless LANs .
Client Conduit is a tool that provides a thin pipe of communication for disconnected clients to exchange diagnosis information with the back end servers .
The thin pipe is achieved by running VirtualWiFi on the connected clients .
These clients dynamically connect to disconnected clients over an ad hoc network , and send messages from them to the back end servers .
VirtualWiFi enables this thin pipe without requiring the connected client to explicitly disconnect from the infrastructure network .
A more detailed description of Client Conduit can be found in the paper titled : “ Architecture and Techniques for Diagnosing Faults in IEEE 802.11 Infrastructure Networks “ .
VirtualWiFi ( previously known as MultiNet ) is a virtualization architecture for wireless LAN ( WLAN ) cards .
It abstracts a single WLAN card to appear as multiple virtual WLAN cards to the user .
The user can then configure each virtual card to connect to a different wireless network .
Therefore , VirtualWiFi allows a user to simultaneously connect his machine to multiple wireless networks using just one WLAN card .
This new functionality introduced by VirtualWiFi enables many new applications , which were not possible earlier using a single WLAN card .
For example ,
The current version of VirtualWiFi does not implement some features .
Please keep checking this page for updates .
The features not implemented in this release of VirtualWiFi are :
VirtualWiFi software is also available as part of the Academic Resource Toolkit .
In addition to VirtualWiFi , this toolkit has the Mesh Connectivity Layer ( MCL ) software .
MCL was developed as part of the Mesh Networking Project in the Networking Group at Microsoft Research .
( VirtualWiFi is an old project , and we started working on it in 2002 .
We are not actively working on this project since 2006 , and will not be supporting this software at Microsoft Research .
Thanks for your interest .
However , the software and code will still be available for you to play around with .
Also , check out the supported VirtualWiFi OIDs in Windows 7 .)
A screen snapshot after installing VirtualWiFi shows the checked VirtualWiFi attribute for the Orinoco wireless card .
It also shows the VirtualWiFi Virtual Miniport named “ VirtualWiFi_IS_rover ” , since the card was in IS mode , and the ssid was “ rover ” .
( Note that for better viewing of this figure , you might want to watch it in its original size . )
To uninstall VirtualWiFi , open the command prompt , go to the directory where you unzipped the VirtualWiFi binaries , and type : “ VirtualWiFi uninstall ” Note that the wireless card over which you installed VirtualWiFi should be plugged in and enabled for uninstall to be successful .
If you face problems , refer to the VirtualWiFi uninstallation FAQ .
Remember to press “ Continue ” if prompted for driver signing .
If you face problems , refer to the VirtualWiFi installation FAQ .
To install VirtualWiFi , open the command prompt , go to the directory where you unzipped the VirtualWiFi binaries , and type :
The following tests could be used to verify the correct operation of VirtualWiFi :
In the screen snapshot after running the above commands , we see two new virtual adapters , with the following names : VirtualWiFi IS rover and VirtualWiFi AH MultiNet corresponding to the two networks .
The task manager also shows the service , and the corresponding executable VirtualWiFiSvc.exe , which is created and started by the installer .
The name of the service is VirtualWiFiService .
If we were connected to an infrastructure network called rover , and wanted simultaneous connectivity to an ad hoc network with ssid VirtualWiFi , with non-adaptive switching , and a switch time of 500 ms for the infrastructure network , then our sequence of commands would be as follows :
The instructions on this page assume that you have correctly installed VirtualWiFi using the steps described in the VirtualWiFi install section .
VirtualWiFi worked over all the cards we tried .
Let us know if VirtualWiFi does not work over any IEEE 802.11 card .
To find out if your card supports VirtualWiFi , install VirtualWiFi and try the verification steps described in the VirtualWiFi Install section .
We have provided a file called “ copyobjchkfiles.bat ” that will copy all the sys , dll and exe files into a directory called “ installfiles ” .
At this point , copy the VirtualWiFi sources .
Unzip the contents to a directory , and go to that directory in the Windows XP Checked or Free build environment in DDK .
Run build - ceZ , and this should compile the entire VirtualWiFi tree .
Copy the following files required for installing VirtualWiFi to one directory :
The following are required on the machine used for building VirtualWiFi :
VirtualWiFi Frequently Asked Questions
Q : Why do we need VirtualWiFi ?
Why not use one wireless card for each network ?
A : Using multiple cards will cost you more money and what is worse is that your machine will consume more energy ( battery power ) .
Also , in most legacy laptops , it is cumbersome to fit multiple cards .
Q : Could you briefly describe the working of VirtualWiFi ?
A : The VirtualWiFi virtualization architecture exposes multiple virtual adapters , one for each wireless network to which connectivity is desired .
It then uses a network hopping scheme that switches the wireless card across the desired wireless networks .
The goal is to make the switching transparent to the user , such that he feels connected on all the wireless networks .
Q : Briefly , how is VirtualWiFi implemented ?
A : VirtualWiFi is implemented as an NDIS intermediate driver , and a user - level service in Windows XP .
VirtualWiFi interacts with the card device driver at the lower end , and network protocols at the upper end .
The buffering protocol is implemented in the kernel , while the switching logic is implemented as a user - level service .
Q : Why not use a different design of VirtualWiFi , where we queue packets , and switch to the network over which the packet in the head of the queue is to be sent ?
A : Switching the wireless card to another network incurs a significant overhead .
Incurring this overhead for every packet will significantly degrade the performance of VirtualWiFi .
Q : Why does VirtualWiFi have to switch across different networks ?
Ca n’t nodes receive packets from other networks , if it is promiscuous mode ?
A : Different networks could be on physically different channels .
In such a case , nodes might not receive packets from other networks , even in promiscuous mode .
Furthermore , if a node is not associated on a network , it is in media disconnected state , and will be unable to send any packets on the network .
Therefore , VirtualWiFi has to switch and associate to a network in order to send and receive packets on it .
Q : What all is implemented in the current version of VirtualWiFi software ?
A : The current version of the VirtualWiFi software allows a user to connect a WLAN card to multiple wireless networks .
It dynamically adapts to the switching delay incurred by a wireless card , independent of the manufacturer .
It also does not require manual intervention for assigning IP addresses on individual networks .
Furthermore , this version of VirtualWiFi also provides users with a command - line interface to dynamically add and remove connectivity to a network .
The adaptive scheduling technique described in the paper is also implemented .
Q : What all is NOT implemented in the current version of VirtualWiFi software ?
A : However , some features of VirtualWiFi have only been prototyped , and not included in this release .
In particular , the idea of using PSM and remote node buffering is not implemented .
Users will notice hooks in the driver code to provide remote node buffering , but our user - level service currently does not support it .
Similarly , although the VirtualWiFi kernel module has support for multiple WLAN cards , the VirtualWiFi service does not support it yet .
Finally , we have not yet included support for WEP and 802.1X in the current VirtualWiFi software release .
Q : Is VirtualWiFi specific to IEEE 802.11 , or can it be used with other schemes such as HomeRF , Bluetooth , etc . ?
A : We believe that the VirtualWiFi idea can be applied to any standard .
However , we have only tested our system with IEEE 802.11 cards .
Q : Can VirtualWiFi connect to two networks , such that one is IEEE 802.11a and the other is 802.11 b ?
A : Yes , if the underlying wireless card supports it .
However , switching an A , B wireless card across the modes incurs a higher switch time , and will adversely affect the performance of VirtualWiFi .
Q : What is the time taken by a card to switch to another wireless network ?
A : This number varies across cards .
It also varies across networks , and across ad hoc and infrastructure networks .
In our experience , switching delays vary from 100 ms to 600 ms across commercial cards .
Over special Native WiFi cards , this delay was a few tens of ms .
Ideally , as has been pointed out by recent research in solid state circuits , and the values that have been used in our SSCH paper , this switching delay should be of the order of 100 micro seconds .
VirtualWiFi Installation
Q : I am having problems installing VirtualWiFi .
An error report comes up when I run “ VirtualWiFi install ” .
No virtual miniport as shown in the screen snapshot comes up in the Network Connections window .
However , there is an unchecked VirtualWiFi attribute in the properties of my wireless card .
How should I fix this problem ?
OR
Q : The device name of my wireless card does not have any keywords mentioned in the prerequisites .
How do I use VirtualWiFi ?
A : Copy the VirtualWiFi source code to a local directory .
Open notifyob
otify.cpp , and in the lines 758- 771 , add for any word in your Wireless adapter , and include it in the condition .
Note that this word should not be in any other network adapter .
Recompile , and install VirtualWiFi .
Read the documentation for building the binaries from the VirtualWiFi sources , and compile the software .
You are all set !
Q : I see an extra virtual adapter for my Ethernet adapter ?
A : Verify that none of the adapters in the “ Network Connections ” window of XP have a keyword mentioned for wireless adapters .
If so , remove it as described in the previous answer .
Q : The installation just exits without any messages , but VirtualWiFi is not installed .
Why does this happen ?
A : This could happen due to three reasons .
Firstly , check to see that you have administrative privileges on your machine .
Secondly , VirtualWiFi will not be installed if your card is currently not connected to any network .
Connect your card to any desired network before installing VirtualWiFi .
The third reason is as follows .
We have noticed this sympton on some machines , which occurs when VirtualWiFi is being installed for the first time on the machine .
In such a case , you should do the following to overcome the problem .
Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Connections ->Wireless Connection , then right click to go to Properties -> Install -> Protocol ->
Have Disk and go to the directory where you have unzipped the binaries .
Press “ Continue ” when asked about driver signing .
Once installed , uninstall VirtualWiFi by going to Properties of the Wireless Adapter , or using “ VirtualWiFi uninstall ” .
After uninstalling VirtualWiFi , subsequent installations can be done automatically using the “ VirtualWiFi.exe install ” command described in the install section .
Q : During installation I get an error message saying “ could n’t create service .
The service has been marked for deletion ” .
How do I get over it ?
A : Do a “ VirtualWiFi uninstall ” .
Then go the Task Manager , and kill VirtualWiFiSvc.exe .
The install after this should work .
Q : Why does VirtualWiFi not work with my card ?
A : VirtualWiFi will not work over cards whose drivers do n’t forward packets that have a source address .
This functionality is required since VirtualWiFi virtual miniports already have a MAC address .
Another reason VirtualWiFi could fail is when the wireless card does not support packet filters NDIS_PACKET_TYPE_DIRECTED and NDIS_PACKET_TYPE_BROADCAST .
Q : The “ VirtualWiFi install ” command never completes .
It gets to a point , and continues to wait .
A : This happens on non-English versions of XP .
You will have to manually install VirtualWiFi as described in the answer to the next question .
Q : Is there a manual way of installing VirtualWiFi , not through VirtualWiFi.exe ?
A : Yes .
Stop Wireless Zero Config , and then go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Connections -> Wireless Connection , then right click to go to Properties -> Install -> Protocol ->
Have Disk and then point to the directory where you unzipped the VirtualWiFi Binaries .
Click on “ Continue ” when warned about driver signing .
This will install VirtualWiFi .
Rename the added virtual miniport to “ VirtualWiFi MM SSID ” where MM is the mode , and SSID is the current network SSID .
Then install the VirtualWiFi service using : “ VirtualWiFiSvc.exe - install ” .
Finally , for VirtualWiFi to work correctly across reboots , add an entry for network name , i.e. “ VirtualWiFi MM SSID ” in C: \Windows \VirtualWiFiData.txt .
VirtualWiFi Uninstallation
Q : Why am I unable to uninstall VirtualWiFi ?
The uninstall command seems to hang .
A : This will happen if the VirtualWiFi service is not running .
To start the service , either run “ net start VirtualWiFiService ” , OR “ VirtualWiFiSvc.exe - start ” .
If VirtualWiFi Service is not installed , you could install it using “ VirtualWiFiSvc.exe - install ” .
Q : Is there a manual way to uninstall VirtualWiFi ?
A : Yes . Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Connections ->Wireless Connection , right click and and go to Properties .
Click on VirtualWiFi Miniport Driver , and click Uninstall .
Note that the VirtualWiFi Service should be running at this time .
Once the driver is uninstalled , you should remove the service , by executing “ net stop VirtualWiFiService ” ” , followed by “ VirtualWiFiSvc.exe - remove ” .
Q : I am unable to uninstall VirtualWiFi .
Nothing seems to work .
Is there a brute force method ?
A : Yes .
Go to the Windows registry using Start -> Run ->” regedit ” .
Note that you will be modifying the registry at your own risk .
It is always better to save a copy of the registry before modifying it .
From the registry , look for all entries having VirtualWiFi , and delete them .
This is better done in safe mode .
Also run “ VirtualWiFiSvc.exe - remove ” to remove the service .
We have provided an easier way to delete these registry entries .
Follow these steps : ( i ) Run “ VirtualWiFi uninstall ” ( ii ) Reboot your machine ( iii ) Run “ RegDelete ” .
Note you will have to delete one entry manually , which is prompted by RegDelete .
( iv ) Reboot , and you are all set !
However , please use RegDelete carefully .
Check carefully the entries that RegDelete prompts !
It should not belong to another program , and correspond to README. txt in the RegEdit directory under Sources .
Using VirtualWiFi
Q : If VirtualWiFi automatically determines the switch time of a card , why is the switch time used in VirtualWiFi.exe changeparams important ?
A : Think of this value as a timeout value for switching a card to another network .
Even if VirtualWiFi is unable to associate to another network , it still buffers packets sent on that network .
These packets will be freed , only when the switch timeout is exceeded .
In most cases , the timeout value used by default works well , and need not be changed .
Q : What is a good number for the switch time to use in VirtualWiFi.exe changeparams ?
A : This number varies across different cards , and across different implementations .
For a Lucent card , you could use numbers around 400 ms to switch to an ad hoc network , and 500 ms to switch to an IS network .
For Compaq WLAN cards , this number was worse , around 650 ms to switch to an IS network .
Overall , our suggestion is to try a safe number .
Q : How do I find out the time my card takes to switch to a network ?
A : We found this value using Airopeek , which is a wireless sniffer .
However , you do not have to use this expensive tool .
An easier way to measure this number is using the utility we provide with our distribution of VirtualWiFi , called VirtualWiFihelper.exe .
The command VirtualWiFihelper.exe - op getCardSwitchTime gives the time taken by the card to switch to a network .
Q : Why does the card seem not to connect / stay on a network ?
A : You should try increasing the switch time using “ VirtualWiFi changeparams - switch “ .
Also make sure the wireless zero config is turned off , and you are able to connect to the network .
A way to check for connectivity is by following these steps .
Firstly , turn off the VirtualWiFi service , using “ net stop VirtualWiFiService ” .
Then , turn on Wireless Zero Configuration , and try connecting to your network .
Once you are done testing , turn off Zero Configuration , and turn on the VirtualWiFi service .
Q : Why do you ask me to stop wireless zero configuration service , and other wireless adapter utilities ?
A : These utilities interact with the wireless card , and try to force connectivity to their preferred networks .
This might interfere with the correct operation of VirtualWiFi .
Q : Why did my ad hoc network get a DHCP address , and not an autoconfig address ?
A : In our current implementation of VirtualWiFi , all packets arriving at a wireless card are forwarded to the currently active virtual adapter .
As soon as you start VirtualWiFi over an ad hoc network , the virtual adapter starts a DHCP request .
In the non-VirtualWiFi scenario the card will get an autoconfig address after the DHCP request fails .
If you started another network before the DHCP request timed out , it is possible for the card to receive a DHCP reply from another network and forward it to the incorrect virtual adapter .
We suggest that the user wait for an ad hoc network to get a valid autoconfig address before it adds another network .
Q : Will VirtualWiFi work when I reboot , or unplug and replug my card ?
A : Yes .
It will automatically work after reboot .
However , after an unplug and replug , you will have to manually restart the service using : “ net stop VirtualWiFiService ” , followed by “ net start VirtualWiFiservice ” .
Q : How does removing a network work across machine reboots ?
A : On rebooting the machine , VirtualWiFi starts connecting to all networks , including the ones that were removed .
You should explicitly add the networks you had removed , and remove them again to get back to a consistent state .
Q : My VirtualWiFi adapter always shows connectivity in the Network Connections window .
Does it mean that my underlying card is able to successfully switch to that network ?
A : No. VirtualWiFi stops MEDIA_DISCONNECT
messages from going up ( read paper for details ) .
So , you will be unable to monitor the state of the network by looking at the Network Connections window .
We recommend using “ VirtualWiFihelper.exe - op getSSID ” to check if VirtualWiFi is able to connect to a network .
Q : Is there a manual way , other than using VirtualWiFi.exe , to add a network ?
A : Yes .
First stop the VirtualWiFi Service by using “ net stop VirtualWiFiService .
Then connect your wireless card to the network you want to add , and do the following : Go to Start -> Control Panel - > Network Connections -> Wireless Adapter , right click to go to Properties .
Then high “ VirtualWiFi Miniport Driver ” , and go to its properties .
Click on “ Add a Miniport ” , and press Continue if prompted for Driver Signing .
Change the name of the newly added virtual miniport in the Network Connections window and make an entry in C : \Windows \VirtualWiFiData.txt .
Then start the VirtualWiFi Service using “ net start VirtualWiFiService ” , and your network has been added .
Q : Is there a manual way , other than using VirtualWiFi.exe , to remove a network ?
A : Yes .
Stop the VirtualWiFi Service .
Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Connections ->VirtualWiFi adapter you want to remove .
Right click , and press Disable .
Then , start the VirtualWiFi Service .
This will remove the miniport .
VirtualWiFi Source Code
Q : Why does DDK complain about undeclared SDK_INCLUDE_PATH when building the VirtualWiFi sources ?
A : You need to define it to the path of SDK include files .
Remember to handle blank spaces correctly .
So , if on my machine SDK was installed in C : \Program Files \Win-SDK , then SDK_INCLUDE_PATH would be defined as C : \Progra~1 \Win-SDK \include .
Q : How do I debug VirtualWiFi ?
Have you provided any hooks in the software ?
A : The best way to debug VirtualWiFi is to use a Windows kernel debugger , such as Windbg .
The code has DBGPRINT statements , with different verbosity level of debug messages to be printed .
To debug the install / uninstall / addnetwork / removenetwork commands , you could use “ VirtualWiFi.exe - v ” instead of VirtualWiFi , for more debug output .
Q : Why is copyobjchkfiles .bat unable to copy files to the installfiles directory ?
A : Depending on your settings , your obj directories in DDK might have a different name , for example objchk_wxp_x86 , or something similar .
Change objchk in copyobjchkfiles .
bat to the directory in your setting .
Copying will also not work if there is no directory called “ installfiles ” .
You should create this directory first .
Finally , files with similar names in “ installfiles ” should not have read - only permissions .
This will also cause the copy to fail .
Q : Why am I unable to replace vwifi.dll after recompiling it ?
A : Uninstall VirtualWiFi , if installed .
You might have to wait for a few minutes .
Close the Network connections Window and retry .
You should be successful .
Israel 's ambassador to Norway has complained to press regulators about a cartoon showing Israeli PM Ehud Olmert as a Nazi concentration camp commander .
Miryam Shomrat told the BBC the caricature in Oslo's Dagbladet newspaper went beyond free speech .
Ms Shomrat said it would be open to prosecution in some European countries .
Dagbladet 's editor said the caricature was " within the bounds of freedom of expression , " according to Norway 's NRK state broadcaster .
Ms Shomrat made the official complaint to the Norwegian Press Trade Committee following the publication of the cartoon on 10 July .
In an interview with the BBC's Europe Today , she said however that her protest could not be compared to the outcry in the Muslim world over the publication in a Danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed .
Lars Helle , Dagbladet 's acting editor - in - chief , said the newspaper was taking the complaint seriously .
" But I do not fear that Dagbladet will be found guilty , " Mr Helle told the NRK .
The cartoon shows Mr Olmert standing on a balcony in a prison camp .
He is holding a sniper 's rifle and a dead man is seen lying on the ground .
The drawing clearly alluded to the Hollywood film Schindler 's List , in which a sadistic Nazi commander shoots Jewish prisoners for fun , according to Dagbladet .

In the submicroscopic world -- the domain of elementary particles and individual atoms -- things behave in the strange , counter - intuitive fashion governed by the principles of quantum mechanics .
Nothing ( or so it seems ) like our macroscopic world -- or even the microscopic world of cells or bacteria or dust particles -- where Newton 's much more reasonable laws keep things sensibly ordered .
The problem comes in finding the dividing line between the two worlds -- or even in establishing that such a line exists .
To that end , Keith Schwab , associate professor of physics who moved to Cornell this year from the National Security Agency , and colleagues have created a device that approaches this quantum mechanical limit at the largest length - scale to date .
And surprisingly , the research also has shown how researchers can lower the temperature of an object -- just by watching it .
The results , which could have applications in quantum computing , cooling engineering and more , appear in the Sept. 14 issue of the journal Nature .
The device is actually a tiny ( 8.7 microns , or millionths of a meter , long ; 200 nanometers , or billionths of a meter , wide ) sliver of aluminum on silicon nitride , pinned down at both ends and allowed to vibrate in the middle .
Nearby , Schwab positioned a superconducting single electron transistor ( SSET ) to detect minuscule changes in the sliver 's position .
According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , the precision of simultaneous measurements of position and velocity of a particle is limited by a quantifiable amount .
Schwab and his colleagues were able to get closer than ever to that theoretical limit with their measurements , demonstrating as well a phenomenon called back - action , by which the act of observing something actually gives it a nudge of momentum .
" We made measurements of position that are so intense -- so strongly coupled -- that by looking at it we can make it move , " said Schwab .
" Quantum mechanics requires that you cannot make a measurement of something and not perturb it .
We 're doing measurements that are very close to the uncertainty principle ; and we can couple so strongly that by measuring the position we can see the thing move . "
The device , while undeniably small , is -- at about ten thousand billion atoms -- vastly bigger than the typical quantum world of elementary particles .
Still , while that result was unprecedented , it had been predicted by theory .
But the second observation was a surprise :
By applying certain voltages to the transistor , the researchers saw the system 's temperature decrease .
" By looking at it you cannot only make it move ; you can pull energy out of it , " said Schwab .
" And the numbers suggest , if we were to keep going on with this work , we would be able to cool this thing very cold .
Much colder than we could if we just had this big refrigerator . "
The mechanism behind the cooling is analogous to a process called optical or Doppler cooling , which allows atomic physicists to cool atomic vapor with a red laser .
This is the first time the phenomenon has been observed in a condensed matter context .
Schwab has n't decided if he 'll pursue the cooling project .
More interesting , he says , is the task of figuring out the bigger problem of quantum mechanics : whether it holds true in the macroscopic world ; and if not , where the system breaks down .
For that he 's focusing on another principle of quantum mechanics -- the superposition principle -- which holds that a particle can simultaneously be in two places .
" We 're trying to make a mechanical device be in two places at one time .
What 's really neat is it looks like we should be able to do it , " he said .
" The hope , the dream , the fantasy is that we get that superposition and start making bigger devices and find the breakdown . "
How To Set Up A Load - Balanced MySQL Cluster
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
This tutorial shows how to configure a MySQL 5 cluster with three nodes : two storage nodes and one management node .
This cluster is load - balanced by a high - availability load balancer that in fact has two nodes that use the Ultra Monkey package which provides heartbeat ( for checking if the other node is still alive ) and ldirectord ( to split up the requests to the nodes of the MySQL cluster ) .
In this document I use Debian Sarge for all nodes .
Therefore the setup might differ a bit for other distributions .
The MySQL version I use in this setup is 5.0.19 .
If you do not want to use MySQL 5 , you can use MySQL 4.1 as well , although I have n't tested it .
This howto is meant as a practical guide ; it does not cover the theoretical backgrounds .
They are treated in a lot of other documents in the web .
This document comes without warranty of any kind !
I want to say that this is not the only way of setting up such a system .
There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 My Servers
I use the following Debian servers that are all in the same network ( 192.168.0.x in this example ) :
sql1.example.com : 192.168.0.101 MySQL cluster node 1
: MySQL cluster node 1 sql2.example.com : 192.168.0.102 MySQL cluster node 2
: MySQL cluster node 2 loadb1.example.com : 192.168.0.103 Load Balancer 1 / MySQL cluster management server
: Load Balancer 1 / MySQL cluster management server loadb2.example.com : 192.168.0.104 Load Balancer 2
In addition to that we need a virtual IP address : 192.168.0.105 .
It will be assigned to the MySQL cluster by the load balancer so that applications have a single IP address to access the cluster .
Although we want to have two MySQL cluster nodes in our MySQL cluster , we still need a third node , the MySQL cluster management server , for mainly one reason : if one of the two MySQL cluster nodes fails , and the management server is not running , then the data on the two cluster nodes will become inconsistent ( " split brain " ) .
We also need it for configuring the MySQL cluster .
So normally we would need five machines for our setup :
2 MySQL cluster nodes + 1 cluster management server + 2 Load Balancers = 5
As the MySQL cluster management server does not use many resources , and the system would just sit there doing nothing , we can put our first load balancer on the same machine , which saves us one machine , so we end up with four machines .
2 Set Up The MySQL Cluster Management Server
First we have to download MySQL 5.0.19 ( the max version ! ) and install the cluster management server ( ndb_mgmd ) and the cluster management client ( ndb_mgm - it can be used to monitor what 's going on in the cluster ) .
The following steps are carried out on loadb1.example.com ( 192.168.0.103 ) :
loadb1.example.com :
mkdir /usr / src/mysql-mgm
cd /usr/src/mysql-mgm
wget http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.0/mysql-max-5.0.19-linux-i686-\
glibc23.tar.gz/from/http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.mysql.com/
tar xvfz mysql-max -5.0.19-linux-i686-glibc23.tar.gz
cd mysql-max-5.0.19 -linux-i686-glibc23
mv bin/ndb_mgm /usr/bin
mv bin/ndb_mgmd /usr/bin
chmod 755 /usr/bin/ndb_mg *
cd /usr / src
rm - rf /usr / src/mysql-mgm
Next , we must create the cluster configuration file , / var/lib/ mysql-cluster /config.ini :
loadb1.example.com :
mkdir / var / lib / mysql-cluster
cd /var/lib/ mysql-cluster
vi config.ini
[ NDBD DEFAULT ]
NoOfReplicas=2
[ MYSQLD DEFAULT ]
[ NDB_MGMD DEFAULT ]
[ TCP DEFAULT ]
# Section for the cluster management node
[ NDB_MGMD ]
# IP address of the management node ( this system )
HostName=192.168.0.103
# Section for the storage nodes
[ NDBD ]
# IP address of the first storage node
HostName=192.168.0.101
DataDir= / var / lib / mysql-cluster
[ NDBD ]
# IP address of the second storage node
HostName=192.168.0.102
DataDir=/ var/lib/mysql-cluster
# one [ MYSQLD ] per storage node
[ MYSQLD ]
[ MYSQLD ]
Please replace the IP addresses in the file appropriately .
Then we start the cluster management server : AdvertisementAdvertisement
loadb1.example.com :
ndb_mgmd -f /var/lib/mysql-cluster/config.ini
It makes sense to automatically start the management server at system boot time , so we create a very simple init script and the appropriate startup links :
loadb1.example.com :
echo ' ndb_mgmd -f /var/lib/mysql-cluster/config.ini ' >
/etc/init.d/ndb_mgmd
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/ndb_mgmd
update - rc.d ndb_mgmd defaults
BAGHDAD , Iraq , Dec. 13 - Less than two days before nationwide elections , the Iraqi border police seized a tanker on Tuesday that had just crossed from Iran filled with thousands of forged ballots , an official at the Interior Ministry said .
The tanker was seized in the evening by agents with the American - trained border protection force at the Iraqi town of Badra , after crossing at Munthirya on the Iraqi border , the official said .
According to the Iraqi official , the border police found several thousand partly completed ballots inside .
The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly , said the Iranian truck driver told the police under interrogation that at least three other trucks filled with ballots had crossed from Iran at different spots along the border .
The official , who did not attend the interrogation , said he did not know where the driver was headed , or what he intended to do with the ballots .

The friend of information but the enemy of thought .
About two years ago , my online life began to be centered on a computer application : not my word processing program , or my email program , but my rss news reader .
rss ( which apparently stands for Really Simple Syndication , though there is some debate about that ) is a technology for capturing news headlines and summaries of stories , or their first few sentences , from websites .
A site that offers these headlines is said to be providing news " feeds " to those who ask for them .
The advantage of such syndication is that you can scan many headlines quickly , and open in your browser only the ones you really want to read .
Using NetNewsWire , I found I could get news from dozens of sources every day and thereby keep myself informed on pretty much everything I am interested in .
For me the most exciting features of NetNewsWire were two : first , I could set the frequency with which I wanted to check my sites for new items , as often as every half - hour ; and second , I could organize my sites in folders .
Pretty soon I had a Technology folder , a Macintosh folder , a News folder , a Culture folder , a Literature folder , a Christianity folder , and so on .
Some of these sites were from what online writers call the msm ( for " mainstream media " ) , but most of them were blogs , and with blogs you never know when someone is going to post except for Glenn Reynolds , the InstaPundit , who posts all day every day .
Normal people might write an entry three out of four days , and then go on a fortnight 's hiatus ; it gets tiresome to peek in at the website every day .
NetNewsWire did the peeking for me , and let me know when it found something .
At first my interest was in news whether about technology or politics or culture  but increasingly I became excited by the idea that the blogosphere could be a great venue for the exchange and development of ideas .
One of the first blogs I got really attached to was called Invisible Adjunct .
Now , alas , defunct , it was written by a woman who worked as an adjunct ( that ...

Women from the Islamic world are attending the three - day conference
Organiser Abdennur Prado Pavon says the struggle for gender equality in Islamic countries involves refuting chauvinist interpretations of Muslim teachings .
The congress is being held in Spain , organisers say , because they want their message to reach the growing number of Muslim women in Europe .
Around 300 delegates are looking at women 's rights in the Islamic world .
Mr Prado , of the Catalan Islamic board , believes a common misconception in the West is that women 's liberation is not possible in Muslim societies .
Activists representing the Islamic feminist movement are in Barcelona to counter that view and discuss ways of achieving female equality in an Islamic context .
Collaboration
Among the delegates is the Pakistani feminist Riffat Hassan , regarded as one of the pioneers of Islamic feminist theology .
Also here are representatives from the international association , Islamic Feminism .
Islamic Feminism argues that the inferior legal and social status of women in Muslim countries is a result of misogynistic distortions of the teachings in the Koran .
Organisers say they want more collaboration with western feminists but say non-Muslim feminists need to challenge their anti-Islamic stereotypes .
What do you think should be done to address misconceptions of women and Islam ?
The following comments reflect the balance of views received :
It is a common misconception in Western nations that Islam is an inherently oppressive religion with regards to women , but as the Islamic feminists themselves argue , it is the interpretations and cultural influences of the societies in which the religion spread that allowed for the current status for women in Islamic cultures today .
The West is hardly so far advanced from Islam as we would like to believe .
We are just less open in our practices than others .
Carolyn Bailey , Gothenburg , Sweden
The major factor behind discrimination against women in the Muslim world is lack of knowledge about rights and duties as defined in the Holy Quran .
We reject and accept whatever we feel like without even bothering to consult the Quran .
We Muslims should understand that our religion is not just a few praying rituals but a doctrine defining our behaviours and ways of life .
Lack of education and weak financial conditions make men insecure and more liable to turn oppressive , violent and dominant , proving to themselves and others that they are still " Man enough " .
Education and good job opportunities is a way to make them realise that there are better ways to prove themselves " Man " rather than beating their wives .
Shaheera Munir , Lahore , Pakistan
There is a lot of action these days in the context of activism among Muslim women .
This is very gratifying .
I am happy to see that the educated women in Islam are taking the lead .
Some times , it borders on the ridiculous - as when a lady decided to lead Muslim prayers in congregation .
But the movement is gaining momentum - despite false starts like this .
And it is not just the liberated , educated , western Muslim woman - we also have Mukhtar Mai from Pakistan ( in New York at present ) - one can have nothing but admiration for her .
Usman Suleman , Wappingers Falls , NY , USA
It is about time that women 's rights are addressed within Islam without feeling the need to reject Islam itself .
We in the West tend to forget that women here were not treated with any semblance of equality until fairly recently .
The rights of women in many Islamic countries is indeed a disgrace .
But that is more likely to be due to a bunch of old men than to any innate aspect of Islamic faith itself .
We should continue to engage Muslim theologians , governments and immigrants on women 's ' rights .
Jean - Luc , Vancouver , Canada
Bravo and all that , but Muslim women in Europe are not really the ones who face most of the sexual discrimination that has tarnished the reputation of Islam .
Why not hold this in Pakistan or in the Middle East ?
These are the places where wonderful opportunities like this could go a long way in changing mindsets .
Suraj Menon , Cardiff , Wales
The best way to solve discrimination against women and other races is education .
If you study more educated societies you find women in better social status .
Even in America , New York is a location where women are most prosperous .
Mohammad 's first wife was his boss even before she married him .
After the revelation he stopped working to devote his energy for the message while his wife carried on the business .
Mazhar Raslan , New York , US
Unfortunately , one of the tallest hurdles these women face is an internal one .
Traditional gender roles and subjugation to fathers and husbands have been ingrained in the minds of women from birth .
Mothers too , pass this mindset on to their daughters and so most women defend their second - class status whenever it is challenged .
For a women 's liberation movement to get off the ground , we must first convince the women themselves .
Zaher Ali-Dib , Damascus , Syria
Why must women in Middle Eastern countries / cultures be forced to define themselves according to religious terminology at all ?
Women 's liberation does not require the rubber stamp of Islam or any other religion .
If Westerners will not accept " Christian feminism " as the basis for the feminist argument , then we must also not accept " Islamic feminism " for the argument as well .
Feminism is liberation , and any time it is recast in religious terms , women 's liberation inevitably becomes deceptive yet beautified misogyny and discrimination .
Daniel Schereck , San Francisco , USA
Judaism and Christianity were not the first to give women the right to vote in history .
It was Islam , though it is bitterly hurtful to see many cultures today prohibiting women from exercising the rights Islam gave them .
Do not blame Islam for the actions of these self serving idiots who name their cultures pro-Islam and destroy the peaceful image it bought centuries ago .
The fact is the US still has never elected a female president , though many Islamic countries have or had female heads of the nation .
Farrukh , St Louis , Missouri
I think that education and public discussion can change perceptions on any issue over time .
However , as long as women continue to raise their sons to believe that they are little princes , I do n't think that things will change much for their daughters .
Regardless of where they live , or what religion they believe in ( if any ) , mothers and grandmothers have a lot of power over society that is unrealised at present .
Zena Curwain , Toronto , Canada
I am a Muslim woman , some would say an " Islamic feminist " .
Despite the stereotypes , radical Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood , or Hizb - ut - tahrir , unlike the traditionalists or culturalist movements like the Taliban , are usually the source of most Muslim women 's sense of Islamic empowerment or Islamic liberation away from things like forced marriage , child custody , abortion , domestic violence , sexploitation , etc .
It is these movements on a grass roots level that have advanced a message of re-visiting the Quran to see how it does not in any way endorse the above oppressive practices , and this is one of the reasons why they find support .
The sad thing is they are viewed as " extremists " and unpalatable to the West because they are also fiercely against Western foreign policy , and crude capitalism .
Dr Habibah Ellahee , London , UK
Aside from the humanitarian aspect , this is a vital economic issue for the Muslim world , as cultures that treat their women more equally just function better .
Before anyone in the West starts making condescending remarks , we 've got a long way to go as well .
Eliot Axelrod , Bloomington , Minnesota
I am a father of three , two of whom are girls , all under ten .
I wish to see my children treated equally in all and every aspect of their lives by the religion whose core values I am trying my very best to pass on to them .
This is an encouraging news item to me .
I wish the organisers the best of luck and hope they will avoid the early trajectory of feminism in the West , that of excluding men from their just struggle .
If they do exclude men of good will , I worry progress will be so slow that even my under tens will not enjoy the fruits .
Kamal Ibrahim , Carbondale , IL , USA
First , I think we should not think misogyny in the Islam world is " their " problem .
The oppression of women is global and we are all involved with it to great extents .
As a male , I feel especially responsible to deconstruct myths of " masculinity " and how many historic and current interpretations use masculinity to support a patriarchy .
But to do this , I feel it seems a great deal of the problem could be alleviated if the media stops looking at the oppression of women as transparent or like it is some one else 's problem .
I would like to hear and read a lot more about Islamic misogyny and to begin to understand what Islam means to many women and men .
Josh Zimmerman , Portland , Oregon USA
Having been a resident of Middle East a few years back , there is a long struggle ahead .
We must remember however , that gender equality is as important as racial , religious , sexual orientation , political affiliation equality .
We can not shy away from the fact that many religions openly ( it is not a misinterpretation ) reject under the " word of lord " these and many other rights .
In my opinion , we need not constantly be defensive and try to appease to people who believe in the infallible status of religions .
Ketan Sudhakar Khare , Mumbai , India
The religion of " Patriarchy " predates Islam , Christianity , and Judaism , and underlies them all .
If we see an " ugly face " to Islam , let us Christians remember to look to our own house first .
What we have done in the name of Jesus has surely made him grieve a thousand times over .
Thomas McCabe , Lakewood , OH , USA
One can guess the relative support of a religion by counting the number of priests ( or whatever the religious ' leaders ' are termed ) who are women .
Using that criterion it is quite obvious that Islam is not alone in promoting male chauvinism .
John , Canada
I grew up though the " women 's movement " in North America .
We have the issues with feminism today , all over the world , simply because religious male leaders quote from their religious texts why a female is considered unequal ; or my favourite : equal but different .
In some countries , as in Canada , females are protected against this male mindset by human right laws .
In many countries the law of the country is the law of the religious faith of the country .
Adjusting a male mindset from self interpreted religious text will take generations , maybe never .
Civil laws outside the boundaries of this text must be written and enforced to protect females .
The civil law is without passion to the unreasonable demands of a religious text , civil law is concerned of what is just and fair , not a passionate plea to keep a gender superior simply because they hold the XY chromosome .
Carolyn Hortie , Dartmouth , NS , Canada
There is no sexism in Islam .
Many people have misinterpreted it .
People who say Islam is sexist should learn about the Shariah , the Quran and Islamic history before they make such an idiotic statement .
I admit that violations of women 's rights have taken place in Muslim countries but Islam should not be blamed for it .
Abrarur Rahman , Dhaka , Bangladesh
Islam , like any other religion , is viewed through the actions of the people .
If there are misconceptions , then it is the responsibility of its followers to present itself as they wish to be seen .
A veil of misconception can only be removed by those who wear it .
Brian K Smith , Maryville , TN , USA
Surely it's not the Muslim women in Europe they need to focus on here , as they have comparatively much greater freedom given the make up of our societies .
It is those outside Europe that appear to be greatly oppressed by their governments and families .
Maybe they are doing this in Spain as it would be much more difficult to get away with in say Tehran ?
Marek , Hungerford , UK
Unfortunately ' Islamic sexism ' is an issue that only women from the Islamic world can defeat .
Western feminists are trained to challenge the Western style of thinking to promote positive change .
It must be the same for Islamic women , only they can understand how they see their problems and how they want them changed .
John Roman , Toronto , Canada
All religions and most men see women as second class citizens .
You can see it with the violence and the job structures everywhere .
Until men can actually start believing women are equals ( and they are ) we will not have peace & prosperity .
Charles Fetterman , Lena , IL USA
We put so much emphasis about how Islam does not treat its women right , we forget how Hinduism and Christianity in their own way deprive the women community from directly participating in their religion .
All religions must start empowering women , but over - emphasis on Islam will only leave the other religions behind !
Chetan , Bangalore , India
Well since I am responding to a media source , I think its only appropriate that it should start here .
Aside from Hollywood , news agencies have a strong influence to alter people 's stereotypes about Muslim women .
Saotomae , Tokyo , Japan
This article was helpful in debunking myths about women and Islam by stating " gender equality in Islamic countries involves refuting chauvinist interpretations of Muslim teachings . "
This tells your reader that it is not Islam itself which is bad , but it is poor interpretations of it which places women in a subordinate place .
Jessie Pettigrew , Rapid City , SD
I believe that " role equity " issues are needed in the feminist debate .
Western feminists have neglected this point .
The home tending that women have traditionally done is vital to the survival and health of the human species and , done well , serves to change both the marketplace and the environment in fundamentally positive ways .
Muslim women are powerfully home - based still .
I believe bringing the concept of " role equity " to the feminist debate would do many things , including help address the misconceptions about women and Islam .
Nancy Woodruff , Washburn , TN , USA
I am thrilled that we are re-examining the place of women of in Islam - especially as the mother of three daughters - we have a vested interest in seeing women having greater self - expression and autonomy , with a stronger emphasis on education .
While the efforts of non-Muslim feminists are valuable and enlightening , the real change will come from within .
With women moving into positions of strength , we will experience the love , peace and compassion that are the true essence of Islam .
Ameena Meer , New York , U.S.A .
I am delighted that feminist Muslim women are speaking out and telling us how we can support them .
That act in itself is countering the stereotype .
All of us in Britain need to be informed by them to counter the possible rising Islamic fundamentalism and also our idea that all Muslims approve of fundamentalism .
Jessie , London , UK
Misconceptions of women and Islam are effectively addressed when people understand the life and times of Prophet Muhammad in a sincere and honest manner .
Looking back , there is no doubt that women enjoyed equal rights and freedoms with their male counterparts while maintaining public and personal dignity .
Yet the pioneering role of women in early Islam in society , economics , and politics have been conveniently ignored in the male dominated cultures of many societies .
The best way to address misconceptions about women and Islam is to make a sincere effort to understand the religion and then through our collective behaviour to ensure that Muslim women and men around the world live the true word and spirit of God 's universal system .
Dr Basma Abdelgafar , Ottawa , Canada
This is centuries overdue .
I am afraid that this round of call for revolution is another wave of words and no action .
The inaction by the Islamic Feminists encourage the Islamic male chauvinist to continue suppressing women in the Islamic societies and further erode their civil and human rights .
John S , USA
You need to continue fighting for your rights .
Yours is a power struggle that is masked by your religion , over a millennium dominated by men .
You must chip away at stereotypes and educate .
It will take time but persevere and good luck .
Brandon , LA , Ca , USA
We as Muslim women need to be more visible in the public arena so that people can see that we are independent beings who have a mind of their own .
For too long Muslim women have been portrayed as submissive and meek .
Its about time that we stand up tall and tell the world that we exist .
Asya Jalil , Toronto , Canada
Islam is not against women .
Koran can be interpreted in a way to help women reach closer to equality in the society .
Islam as a Semitic religion protects the right of women better than Judaism and Christianity .
Money , sex and women have been clearly discussed in Islam .
Women 's issue is a civilisation .
" Please do n't use women to bash Islam " .
Women can be used easily to bash any philosophy on the Planet Earth .
Victoria Arshad , Toronto , Canada
I am an artist living in the middle of the USA , far from the coasts and even farther from the Islamic world .
It is very apparent to me however , that the only way our cultures can coexist is through the efforts of women activists .
The key to the " war on terror " is in the hands of women world - wide .
As long as men are in charge nothing will change .
Women must throw off the shackles of oppression and misogyny .
Louis Copt , Lawrence , Kansas USA
The phrase " never judge a book by it's cover " is probably the perfect way to describe a Muslim woman .
People automatically assume that a headscarf means a Muslim woman has no rights , civil liberties or a voice of her own .
Look beneath that and you will find a woman who has as many rights as a Western woman .
Anon
There are no misconceptions about Islam and the status accorded to women in Islam .
Not to single out Islam and considering the overlapping influence of religion on cultures and societies at large , the treatment meted out to women in almost every corner of the world bar none is that of a second class individual .
I have witnessed barbaric acts of violence inflicted upon women in Pakistan , yet again I have seen and witnessed violence on women in the US .
Wacar Rizvi , Gaithersburg , USA
Any religion that denigrates half its members ( or any of its members ) has no credibility .
Islam is supposed to be about peace .
There can never be peace when women are denied the basic freedoms and respect that men enjoy .
All world and religious leaders and people of good conscience should stand up and say so in support of these brave women .
Michelle Godwin , Howell , MI , US
Western feminism is incompatible with Islamic feminism by definition .
Witness the Western and university educated young women ( most born in the west ) revert to Muslim dress .
Western feminism has failed women , despite Western countries being educated and highly developed democracies .
Women 's rights in the lesser developed countries are no worse .
It remains a novelty for a Western government or political party to be lead by a woman .
Meanwhile Muslim countries like Pakistan , Bangladesh , Turkey and Indonesia have had female leaders .
Iran had a female vice - president and there are proportions of seats reserved for women in parliaments of Pakistan , Iran , UAE and few others while women are free to contest the others too .
These facts are overlooked in the West .
Shoukat , London , UK
In order to address misconceptions of women in Islam all women need to come together to spread the needs and viewpoints of Muslim women .
We must demand all political leaders stand and represent us .
The Western world has let the issues slide for so long now because there is not enough of us coming together to demand the human rights of our sisters around the globe .
If we can make a big enough ripple , leaders will rise to the task .
Angie Binoz , Tyler , Texas USA
Muslim women should be encouraged to take a leading role in Islamic academia and re-interpret texts which have been interpreted predominantly by men .
As long as religious monopoly lies with a particular group , and religion continues to exercise the social , political and spiritual influence it does , it is hard to see how less fortunate groups are ever going to get a fair hearing .
Dr Saqib Qureshi , London , UK
I am reminded of the Prophet 's most beloved wife ; Aisha who rode on top a camel into a battle to fight for what she believed to be right .
I hope that these women are successful in their long struggle for equal rights .

As a woman of faith , I would love to see more co-operation when possible amongst feminist movements within faith organisations .
We should definitely all pray for each other and be willing to lend a hand breaking the stained glass ceiling when our sisters request it .
As for a perception in the West that Islam is not capable of feminism , I would like to remind us that our stained glass ceiling is not yet broken , it was not so long ago Christians debated whether or not women had souls , Jewish women who pray at the Western Wall do so at risk to themselves in the 21st century , and finally , that with God , all things are possible .
Cait , Boston , MA , USA
First and foremost , a lot of non-Muslim women , especially feminists , need to talk and interact with Muslim women .
I have several friends that have joined me in feminist activities and they wear the veil and that 's not a bad thing .
The veil can be used as a symbol of oppression , but just as equally it is used by women as a defiant act .
Communication is key to understanding the differences between Muslim and non-Muslim women without using stereotypes to do so .
Rachael , Washington DC , US
Misconceptions about women and Islam could be addressed through first - hand writings from women in Islamic countries about what everyday experience as a woman is like in those countries .
In the West , too , traditionally female - or home - focused work is often thought of as less important or valuable than office or career - centred work .
This tendency needs to be countered in both the West and Islamic countries .
Women 's experience is not a pale shadow or bad reflection of men's .
It 's different than men's and needs to be explored and written about as it's own goal .
Sheridan Mahoney , Portland , OR , USA
I have not read the Koran and it's not likely that I will .
I have a hard enough time understanding Christian feminist issues .
We struggle with why Jesus did n't seem to have any trouble with women and yet his most vocal follower , Paul , had some big issues .
How did we get strapped with Paul 's views instead of Jesus ' ?
I would like to know , in a less than Koran length article , what the similar struggles are for Islamic women .
Marguerite Casparian , Oyster Bay , NY , USA
I do n't know if the Koran has been interpreted wrongly to suit men's ideas , but what I see here in Dearborn ( highest concentration of Middle Eastern people in America ) is that these women see the American lifestyle - which is of course the complete opposite - and have to keep living this suppressed life .
Unless the men arrive at seeing the women as equal , women will stay suppressed .
Of course it has been very nice for the men to have the women in these roles , so why would they want to change that ???
It will be a process over many generations to try and achieve equality as this religion has been around for thousands of years and nothing has been done ...
Petra Elliott , Dearborn , MI , USA
Therefore , whatever other influences are involved in the production of PT911 , the role of YWAM has to be considered as an important contributor .
It 's all too easy for those left of center to refer to the " religious right " as a sort of short - hand , but this is often politically foolish when we are dealing with specific groups or individuals whose beliefs and practices are strikingly at odds with what the majority of Christians believe -- or sometimes even with what the majority of rightwing Christians believe .
For example , journalist Robert Parry , who broke the Iran - Contra scandal while working for AP in 1986 , has written extensively about the Reverand Sun Yung Moon , in a series , ' Dark Side of Rev. Moon ' .
The summary of one of Parry 's story 's " Buying the Right " , reads :
Rev. Sun Myung Moon calls America " Satan 's harvest " and vows to subjugate its people under a Korea - based theocracy .
Normally , this anti-Americanism would not sit well .
But Moon has spread around billions of dollars from mysterious sources to Washington conservatives .
The money has helped key allies , such as Jerry Falwell and Oliver North .
It 's the real Asian money scandal -- and the Washington media is missing it .
( 8/11/97 )
Better than Jesus ?
Falwell also might have been shy about disclosing his alliance with Moon because the Korean 's theology upsets many Christians .
Moon asserts that Satan corrupted mankind by sexually seducing Eve in the Garden of Eden and that only through sexual purification can mankind be saved .
In line with that doctrine , Moon says Jesus failed in his mission to save mankind because he did not procreate .
Moon sees himself as a second messiah who will not make the same mistake .
He has engaged in sex with a variety of women over the decades .
The total number of his offspring is a point of debate inside the Unification Church .
Moon 's rhetoric has turned stridently anti-American , another problem for the Religious Right and its strongly patriotic positions .
On May 1 , 1997 , Moon told a group of followers that " the country that represents Satan 's harvest is America . "
[ Unification News , June 1997 ]
In other sermons , he has vowed that his victorious movement will " digest " any American who tries to maintain his or her individuality .
He especially has criticized American women who must " negate yourself 100 percent " to be a receptacle for the male seed .
[ For details of Moon 's speeches , see The Consortium , July 28 , 1997 ]
A brief segment of this story reads as follows : Clearly , when we are dealing with a figure like Moon , it is a mistake to use the label " religious right , " as it helps to paper over the fact that his actual teachings are deeply anathema to vast majority of followers of the religious right -- even if their mamon - crazed leaders feel differently .
And so we turn to look at YWAM with the lesson of Moon in mind .
I do not wish to equate the two .
YWAM is nowhere near the blatantly anti-Christian ideology of Moon and his Unification Church .
But neither is it a perfectly normal missionary organization , like the missionary outreach of any long - standing denomination .
Founded in 1960 by Loren Cunningham , it claims a staff of thousands in over a hundred countries .
Two types of charges against it are significant for our consideration : its theology and its cult - like aspects .
Both are potentially significant in terms of potential influence on the nature of PT911 .
Evidence of YWAM's Questionable Theology
In " The False God & Gospel of Moral Government Theology " , E. Calvin Beisner , an author and theologian with Christian Research Institute , and himself a solid member of the religious right , describes Moral Government Theology and its association with YWAM -- an association the YWAM denies .
In the summary , Beisener says :
Moral government theology ( MGT ) , rooted in the philosophical definition of freedom as the " power of contrary choice , " denies the fundamental Christian doctrines of God 's perfection in knowledge , goodness , and power ; original sin ; human moral inability ; the substitutionary satisfaction of God 's justice in Christ 's atoning death ; redemption ; and justification by the crediting of Christ 's righteousness to believers by grace through faith apart from works .
As documented in this article , these denials are unbiblical and are so serious as to warrant classifying MGT as non-Christian .
Contemporary moral government theology is principally the brainchild of the late Gordon C. Olson .
During the 1930s and 1940s , Olson 's studies led him to believe that God 's foreknowledge is necessarily limited by human free will and that the classical doctrines of original sin , human depravity and moral inability , the Atonement , and justification were as wrong as the classical doctrine of absolute foreknowledge .
During the 1960s and 1970s , Olson and an engineering associate of his named Harry Conn began to teach moral government theology for various mission organizations , often in recruiting , motivating , or training young people .
Moral government theology ( hereafter MGT ) first began to spread rapidly when Olson and Conn became regular speakers for Youth With A Mission ( YWAM ) , which has since become one of the larger youth missionary organizations in the world .
Contrary to YWAM 's repeated denials that MGT was an important part of its teaching , it was in YWAM training that tens of thousands of students from the late 1970s through the 1980s , and some even into the 1990s , learned MGT ( although today some YWAM leaders speak against MGT ) .
In the body of the article he explains : Clearly , it is not alleged that YWAM still teaches this theory .
However , the fact that they once did ( even though they now deny it ) is evidence that we should not casually lump them in with the rest of the religious right .
Some on the religious right clearly accept them , but some obviously do not .
So why help them by lumping them all together ?
It 's best to describe them as they are -- which is , at least , as a controversial organization , as we shall see more fully in the next section .
Evidence of YWAM's Cult - Like Features
Any discussion of churches and cults is bedeviled by the difficulties of subjective judgment , since there is real truth in the claim that " one man 's cult is another man 's religion . "
Yet , some examples of religious cults are so clear that no one ( except their members , of course ! ) can deny what they are .
YWAM is clearly not one of those .
But it does have a record of clearly cult - like activities , and has been investigated as such on several occasions .
The most comprehensive set of writings on it I 've been able to find online comes from the Rick A. Ross Institute of New Jersey ( RRI ) , which describes its mission thus :
RRI 's mission is to study destructive cults , controversial groups and movements and to provide a broad range of information and services easily accessible to the public for assistance and educational purposes .
During the month of September 1990 , I was contacted and subsequently retained by a family in Long Island New York .
Their concerns centered upon their adult single daughter 's involvement with the organization known as Youth With A Mission ( YWAM ) .
She planned to enter a Discipleship Training School ( at a cost of $ 1700.00 ) operated by YWAM in late September located in Elizabeth , New Jersey .
After completing the training program she might then be selected as a staff member ( full time missionary ) at the salary of $ 7.00 per week .
The young woman could be placed within the third world .
Once placed she would be totally dependent upon YWAM for financial support , food , medical attention and security .
She had liquidated all her assets .
The family accepted fully their daughter 's religious commitment , but felt that they should investigate YWAM .
My work on their behalf consisted of gathering information .
There is an evident pattern to all the complaints about Youth With A Mission .
If these statements are accurate , ( which they seem to be ) YWAM practices the so - called " sheperding " leadership method .
Implementing direct control over their members through " discipleship " training .
This training appears to employ recognized techniques of thought reform and mind control as listed by Robert J. Lifton in his " eight criteria " ( see The Future of Immorality and Other Essays for a Nuclear Age , New York , Basics Books , 1987 ) .
This can be seen clearly through a comparison of those eight criteria to the practices employed at YWAM DTS facilities .
* " Milieu control ; essentially the control of communication within an environment . "
This appears to be accomplished at the DTS through the school 's relative isolation from the outside world .
Also , through rules concerning dating , television , discussion alone with other new members and communication with family .
Another example of " milieu control " would be " group leader 's " influence during " intercession " .
Lifton seems to be describing YWAM DTS when he states that " there is often a sequence of events , such as seminars , lectures and group encounters , which become increasingly intense ... " * " Mystical manipulation ; a systematic process that is planned and managed from above ( by the leadership ) but appears to have arisen spontaneously within the environment . "
This process seems to occur through " intercession " when one receives a " confirmation " through Bible verses ( step 8 ) or when " God ... brings things to your mind " ( step 9 ) .
Also , when " group leaders " receive a " word from the Lord " .
The profound influence exercised by leadership during " intercession " probably promulgates these seemingly spontaneous spiritual experiences .
* " The demand for purity ; radical separation of pure and impure , of good and evil , within an environment and within oneself . "
This can be seen through several steps within " intercession " ( steps 1,3,4 ) .
A YWAM lecturer " reasoned that there are three kinds of thought : yours , Satan 's and God's " .
There is no gray area .
Everything is black and white .
As Lifton relates the group has a " Manichean quality " .
* " The cult of confession ; a confession process that has its own structure ... accompanied by patterns of criticism and self - criticism , generally transpiring within small groups . "
Confession seems to be the most prevalent feature of " intercession " .
DTS students said " confession emotionally exhausted us " .
Students who had nothing to confess were told they were " guilty for not confessing anything " .
* " Sacred science ; a sacred set of dogmatic principles with a claim to a science embodying the truth about human behavior and human psychology . "
Again , the process of " intercession " seems to be the " sacred science " of YWAM .
This technique within the overall structure of " discipleship " can be " the truth " for every person involved .
It can be seen as the science by which every student can become " clean : and reach God ( steps 1,2,3 ) .
* " Loading of the language ; literalization of language - words or images becoming God .
A simple slogan to which the most complex and otherwise difficult questions can be reduced .
The language of non-thought . "
Phrases such as " openness and brokeness , causing disunity , being rebellious , give up your rights , with the appointing comes the anointing and do n't say it , pray it are just a few examples of the " thought terminating cliches " reportedly used within YWAM .
These slogans could discourage questions , individuality and critical thinking .
* " Doctrine over person ; one must find the truth of the dogma and subject one 's experiences to that truth ... doubts are reflections of one 's own evil . "
This can be seen in ( step 3 ) " die to your own imagination " .
The students at the DTS are asked to subject their experiences to that of the " group leader " .
The doctrine of " intercession " comes before individual rights .
They were told " give up your rights " and " you get the leader you deserve " .
They must be part of the whole " in God 's Kingdom there is structure " .
* " Dispensing of existence ; those who have not embraced that truth ... are bound up with evil and do not have the right to exist .
There is a being verses nothingness dichotomy . "
Nancy Brown stated that YWAM depicted the " world " as " Satanic " .
" Bind Satan " and " deal aggressively with the enemy ( step 6 ) " .
All thoughts could be labeling dispenses with the individual thought and the outside world as evil .
Ultimately , when one student decided to quit a YWAM DTS , her group leader said , " well , at least God never quits on us " .
Somehow she had rejected God by leaving YWAM .
One very disturbing feature of YWAM is its seeming inability to engage in open dialogue .
Mr. Savoca [ the WYAM higher - up Ross interacted with ] never really responded to any concerns .
He was evasive and finally fled rather than answer specific questions .
This would lead to the conclusion that YWAM has little if any intention of changing .
RRIs main page on YWAM contains links to its own comprehensive report , as well as testimonies by two former members , a family - member of a YWAM member , an overseas missionary with extensive experience of YWAM , a critical news story from New Zealand , and a positive one from Florida .
The comprehensive report -- by Ross himself -- begins with a brief description of WYAM , then continues :
The report combines a description of the specifics of the case , including interactions with a high - ranking YWAM official , as well as a digest of material Ross uncovered in his background research .
The picture that emerges is definitely disturbing , but deserves to be read in full .
However , toward the end of the report , Ross offers an analytical perspective that is worth reproducing in full :
Now , keep in mind , Cunningham is not just a product of this environment , and a promoter of it .
He is the son of the founder of it .
Everything about this description seems to mitigatethe ability to make a fair - minded film .
Indeed , the veryof a fair - minded film would appear to be anathema to such a mindset .
With this list before us , there should be little doubt about how Monica Lewinski came to be such a central figure in 9/11 - -" The demand for purity " says it all .
But more than sexual purity is involved here .
" There is no gray area .
Everything is black and white . "
This is how Bush thinks , and so it is no wonder that his failings are excused .
Note -- I 'm not saying this is the reason for why the film is as it is .
There are surely many contributing factors .
But I am saying it's a powerful reason why it is n't as it should be .
Similarly , the principle of " Doctrine over person " helps explain why the facts and intelligence were fixed around the policy that Clinton , not Bush , was to blame for 9/11 , since Bush was pure and Clinton was not .
" one must find the truth of the dogma and subject one 's experiences to that truth . "
Finally , regarding " Loading of the language " intended to " discourage questions , individuality and critical thinking . "
Loaded language is hardly limited to mind - control cults .
They are , however , extremely sensitive to its potential .
With that in mind , consider how Cunningham responded recently :
According to Cunningham , critics are simply taking scenes out of context or relying on a competing set of experts .
Here 's what Cunningham told The Crimson White , a University of Alabama newspaper : " A lot of these critics have n't seen the whole thing or , in some cases , any of it , " Cunningham said .
" We have these CNN pundits who have n't seen it who are taking scenes out of context as examples [ of factual inaccuracies in the film ] . "
Cunningham also pointed out that the critics , many of whom are Democrats , are just telling their side of the story .
" We have out [ sic ] CIA consultants and Clinton has his .
It 's kind of a `he said , she said ' situation right now , " Cunningham said .
At one level , this is simply typical rightwing spin .
But at another level it is rather adroit use of language to " discourage questions , individuality and critical thinking " that is almost certainly second nature to Cunningham , given his upbringing and who he is .
The emblematic phrases he uses are n't even rationally related to the charges .
There is no way that a false , defamatory scene can be altered by context .
Nor does it involve conflicting experts to note how a film script clashes with its purported source material .
A sixth grade reading level will more than suffice for that .
This is the use of language as talisman , to magically stop the process of critical thinking .
Keep in mind , this is only a brief , initial peek behind the curtain at the sort of organizational world in which Cunningham was born and raised .
There is bound to be much , much more for us to learn about YWAM and how it influenced the making of PT911 .
THEY say a picture says a thousand words - and if we were Kevin Federline we'd be very worried indeed .
Pregnant Britney Spears has posted an extraordinarily rude message to her waste - of - space hubby on her website ... giving him a one - fingered salute .
After days of speculation that their stormy 20 - month marriage has hit the rocks - with no denials from either side - she seems keen to display her anger and bitterness .
And , in yet another sign that Federline 's meal ticket has expired , we 're told that mum - of - one Brit has asked her own mother Lynne to move into her mansion to keep her company .
But none of this seems to worry the ferret - faced freeloader .
Feds has been telling friends : " Do n't worry , she ain't got the balls to leave me . "
Charming !
Brit , 24 , has slapped the bizarre photo of herself on her website under her poem Remembrance Of Who I Am - a thinly veiled confirmation that her marriage to would - be rapper Federline , 28 , is all but over .
It reads : " No more chains that you gave me .
My crown is back and it's way too high for you to be in my presence . "
We told last week how the couple - who have an eight - month - old son , Sean Preston - had drifted apart after a series of furious rows .
Brit despaired of the ex-dancer smoking dope and drinking with his friends , who she loathes , and banished him to a selfcontained bachelor flat in the basement of their Malibu home .
A source tells us : " Britney is at her wits ' end .
She 's furious with Kevin .
And as usual , when things go wrong for her , her mum Lynne has stepped in to offer support .
" Brit has some very serious decisions to make and she knows her mum is the best person to help her make them .
She really wanted the marriage to work for her family , but it seems harder by the day . "
Despite all signs to the contrary , arrogant Federline believes she will come crawling back for him .
He has told pals : " She does n't have the guts to leave me , she 's been threatening to divorce me since the honeymoon . "
The former dancer has already planned his next career move .
We hear he 's launching his very own urban street fashion line .
" Kev thinks that because he shops so much and gets his picture taken by paparazzi that people would want to dress like him , " our Californian confidante spills .
" He has already had talks with a number of companies to get his clothes range out there . "
Well , he 'll need all the money he can get when Brit finally kicks him to the kerb !
Hi all , Blake Ross here .
Alex asked me to guest write a post this week because he 's a fan of the Firefox project , which I cofounded .
Before Firefox , I worked at Netscape throughout high school on its 6.x and 7.x releases .
It was my first experience in a professional programming shop .
I 'm writing this now from my therapist 's couch .
It 's hard for me to write a WTF , not because I can't remember one , but because I remember too many .
Netscape was one giant WTF , or as they called it back then , AOL .
The company had grown so inept that " WTF " became just another thing we said each day , like " Hey " or " What time is it ? " or " We just lost another 5 % " or " Marketing wants to replace the Back button with an ad for Bowflex " .
In fact , as I 'm sure you know , the Mozilla movement itself was born when Jim Barksdale looked at the old Netscape 4.x codebase and announced , with tremendous gusto and wondrous pride : WTF ?
I 've been reading this site since its inception and seen most of the classic coding errors .
There are a few doozies I could share -— a Netscape engineer who shan't be named once passed a pointer to JavaScript , stored it as a string and later passed it back to C , killing 30 —- but most are what I call " nested WTFs . "
The surrounding code is so equally offensive that you'd have to understand all of it before finally experiencing the epiphany of The One True WTF .
Such experiences , therefore , are best left to ABC miniseries .
If you 'll indulge me , I will instead share a poor product decision made about Netscape 7 , and that is : it was released .
More importantly , it was released without popup blocking , an egregious mistake given that :
Popups dominated the Web in 2002 .
No major consumer browser blocked them natively .
Mozilla 1.0 did , and that release was the basis of Netscape 7 .
AOL ordered us to cut popup blocking because its web properties , especially Netscape.com , relied on the advertising format .
Such is the life of an engineering organization which must design a browser for 20 billion websites and then optimize it for one of them .
( See also : theming the browser to integrate seamlessly with that site while clashing savagely with all others . )
So Mozilla 1.0 came out in June with popup blocking , and Netscape 7 came out six months later without it , but offered , as consolation , 12 AOL icons on your desktop .
Technology reviewers who understood the Netscape / Mozilla relationship did not miss the fact that Netscape went to additional trouble to remove popup blocking .
To put it another way , all Netscape had to do to release one of the most compelling browser features in years was : nothing .
They still managed to mess up for reasons I have n't yet figured out .
During my tenure at Netscape , I sat through more meetings than we had users , throughout which people seemed very good at doing nothing .
Fortunately , AOL management got the picture after c|net , in flagrant violation of marketing 's press kit , slammed the release for omitting the blocker .
To make things right , Netscape quickly released a version 7.01 that included it , but only after renaming it the " popup suppressor " ( " popup decongestant " was trademarked ) .
Unfortunately , the release also contained a feature called the " popup suppression whitelist . "
This was a list of sites that were still allowed to open popups , and it was seeded with all of the AOL properties that used them , such as Netscape.com .
By the way , Netscape.com was the default homepage .
Now back to my therapy , already in progress :
When dozens of people eagerly fired up the New Netscape 7.01 , Now With Popup Blocking ! , the very first thing they saw was a popup ad .
WTF ?
* Much has changed since these glorious years .
For instance , Netscape now adds only 7 AOL icons to your desktop .
But also , Netscape.com no longer has a popup ad .
You can still download Netscape 7.01 , turn on " popup suppression " and change your homepage to CNN to relive the magic .
Interested in creating a game in a week ?
I mean who would n’t be .
Everybody ’s got great ideas for a game .
Unfortunately you ca n’t design fun on paper .
So the best way to see if a game is fun to play , is to create the damn game ( or at least a playable prototype ) .
That ’s enough of an excuse for any game developer to be interested in learning the art of rapid prototyping .
That and the fact that it takes more than 7 days to write the out dated 250 page design document that nobody reads .
I thought I would gather here a little list of articles about rapid game prototyping .
These are from very different contexts and there might be some segments in these articles not directly related to rapid development .
Even though the information might seem irrelevant its usually pretty interesting and useful in some way .
If you know other articles about rapid game prototyping please let me know about them and I ’ll update this list .
Easiest way of contacting me would be to write a comment or to send me a email at petri dot purho [ ät ] gmail.com .
How Not To GID by Paul Malyschko
http://www.garagegames.com/index.php?sec=mg&mod=resource&page=view&qid=5982
The first article on the list is about how to create a game in day .
Or actually how to not create a game in a day .
Game
In A Day ( or GID for short ) is semi competition hosted by Garage Games , where you have 24 hours to create a game .
It ’s not really a competition as much as its encouragement to create games in extremely short time span .
Article was written by Paul Malyschko and its about lessons he learned from trying to GID .
It ’s written more from a hobby game developer perspective , but the lessons told there are valuable to anyone trying to create a quick prototype .
How to Prototype a Game in Under 7 Days
http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20051026/gabler_01.shtml
The second article is the now classic paper by Carnegie Mellon students who started the Experimental Gameplay Project .
If you have n’t read the article GO READ IT NOW .
If you have read the article and your thinking about prototyping a game , go read the article again .
It ’s the article that inspired me to start developing experimental - done - in - a - week games .
Sol ’s “ rules ” for surviving Ludum Dare 48h
http://sol.gfxile.net/ldsurvival.html
Third article is Jari Komppa ’s ( A.K.A. Sol ) guide to surviving Ludum Dares 48 hour game development competitions .
Because its a real competition , where you have only 48 hours to make a game , the article has a lot of information about managing the stress of the competition .
That might not be relevant , when you have a week to create game and it ’s not for a combo , but there ’s also lots of info about the rapid game development .
For example the 3.2 Design considerations - segment is all golden rule stuff .
How To Build a Game In A Week From Scratch With No Budget
http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article2259.asp
Jay Barnson ( A.K.A. Rampant Coyote ) created a RPG in a week from scratch without a budget and without the help of any existing game engines .
It ’s impressive when you consider how content heavy genre RPG is .
I ’m just waiting for someone to do this with a MMORPG .
The article is more of a development log , which is interesting in its way , but the real meat for us is at the end of the article :
The postmortem , or the top ten lessons learned from developing a RPG in a week .
Like the “ Lesson 3 : Do n’t underestimate the art requirements ” .
Sounds like common sense , but I fell for that one .
Torque Game Engine Documentation – Step 4 ) Build a quick and dirty prototype
http://www.garagegames.com/docs/tge/general/ch02s05.html
This is snippet from the Torque Game Engine Documentation .
There ’s some general information about creating a prototype , experiences learned from Marble Blast ’s development .
At the end , there ’s some more specific info about how they created Marble Blast ’s prototypes using the Torgue Game Engine .
ALGDS – General Advice
http://www.algds.org/#Advice
Ad Lib Game Development Society runs these semi annual sessions where they create few game prototypes .
It ’s a little like Indie Game Jam .
The link is n’t really an article as its more of list of random pointers they picked up during the development .
It ’s more concentrated on how to create a prototype with a team and how to host the event .
I know this is n’t directly related but for the sake of completeness here ’s a link to Raph Koster ’s blog , where he gives an interesting alternative approach to gameplay prototyping .
There was also an interesting article about Paper Prototyping on gamasutra.com .
There was a lot of talk about prototyping in this years Game Developer Conference .
Unfortunately I was n’t there , but there is a nice trail of articles about GDC on the web from which I learned a lot .
The Experimental Gameplay project guys gave a talk about “ How to Prototype a Game in Under 7 Days “ .
What I understood from the blog coverages and the Power Point slides the information was mostly the same as in the gamasutra article .
But there were also developers from Maxis talking about their Spore prototyping experiences .
Their talks where more from the perspective of why you should prototype opposed to how you can prototype , but its makes an interesting reading none the less .
Advanced Prototyping
https://www.cmpevents.com/GD06/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=1914
Chris Hecker and Chaim Gingold talked about what makes a good prototype .
Here ’s the Game Spy ’s coverage about the presentation and Power Point slides .
There are some very good points even though its more from a professional game development teams point of view .
Pre-Production Through Prototyping
https://www.cmpevents.com/gd06/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=1619
Also Eric
Todd talked about what problems does prototyping solve for the preproduction .
There is a good coverage by Gamasutra and here are the Power Point slides .
Even though its more about how game designers see prototyping there are some good hints for creating a good gameplay prototype .
Like :
“ Though you do n’t want to obsess , Todd said , “ a little aesthetics goes a long way ” toward making your prototype something that people will actually use .
He called this minimal kind of design a kind of “ coating on the aspirin ” ”
That ’s about all the googling and bookmarks I had on this subject .
I do n’t know if there are some other articles about rapid game prototyping , but I know that the BEST source of information about this subject is experience .
So go and create a small game .
It does n’t ( or at least should n’t ) even take that much time .
Less reading more prototyping .
Adam Barr writes about Workplace Advantage , a new project going on at Microsoft to rethink how offices are arranged .
“ This is the plan to have people working in flexible space that can be quickly reconfigured into offices , cubicles , open desks , pods , or whatever you want , ” writes Barr .
Microsoft is famous throughout the tech industry for putting literally everyone in individual , private offices , about half of which have windows .
There ’s not much debate that this is the most productive environment for programmers , but not everyone at Microsoft is a programmer .
“ The goal of Workplace Advantage is to reconfigure offices to fit the 4 employee types that were identified after studying the workforce : travelers , orchestrators , concentrators , and providers ( examples of which , respectively , are sales , program management , dev/test , and IT ) , ” Barr reported in an earlier post .
Makes a lot of sense : private offices are n’t right for every type of work .
Not every programmer in the world wants to work in a private office .
In fact quite a few would tell you unequivocally that they prefer the camaradarie and easy information sharing of an open space .
Do n’t fall for it .
They also want M&Ms for breakfast and a pony .
Open space is fun but not productive .
Last summer , the Project Aardvark interns were all in a big open space .
The net result was that there was no such thing as a conversation between two people .
Every time I went out there to talk to one of them , it became a conversation with all of them ; every time two people had to talk , instead of going off to a quiet space somewhere , they just spoke directly to each other , interrupting the other two ’s concentration .
Although this slightly helps keep everyone “ in the loop , ” it also knocks programmers out of flow causing them to lose their concentration and devastating productivity , so I prefer to keep people in the loop using more formal methods , like weekly email status reports , and through informal methods like eating lunch together every day , which is why we have free catered lunches and a really big table .
This summer , we have much more private niches ( not quite offices ) for the summer interns , and I ’ve noticed that when I talk to one of them , the others do n’t even notice and certainly do n’t stop cranking away at their work .
I do n’t think it has hurt communication much , either .
TALK is cheap , but money speaks the truth .
That might be the credo behind the recent , rapid rise in the use of novel markets to forecast everything from political events to business successes and failures .
During America 's recent presidential election , bets on the Iowa Electronic Market , based at the University of Iowa , and on online exchanges such as www.tradesports.com and www.betfair.com were watched almost as keenly as opinion polls .
These and other markets have in recent years been used to forecast almost everything from the fate of Saddam Hussein to the outcome of celebrity trials and the box - office takings of films on their opening weekends .
Markets like these , which are intended to elicit punters ' best collective guess about the outcome of some future event , are known as information , prediction or decision markets .
Take the presidential election : people could bet on George Bush by buying a contract that paid a dollar if he won and nothing if he lost .
Anyone certain of a Bush victory should have been willing to pay up to a dollar for the contract .
Anyone confident that Mr Bush would lose could have sold such a contract , expecting to pay nothing when the result came .
With many participants buying and selling in this way , the market discovered a price for the contract — in effect , its best guess of the probability of a Bush win .
The theory is that the aggregated hunches of many people with money at stake are likely to be more accurate than the opinion of disinterested experts or of whoever happens to be at home when a pollster calls .
Indeed , it is easier to put your money where your mouth is in information markets than in many “ proper ” markets .
Because you can “ sell ” without first “ buying ” , short - selling , which is limited in many financial markets , is essentially unconstrained .
And because the bets are smaller than in financial markets , participants are unlikely to be prevented from backing their opinions by restrictions on borrowing .
Most anecdotal evidence seems to bear this theory out .
A recent paper * surveying the academic literature , by Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz , both of Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business , reaches a similar conclusion .
For instance , one study found that the Iowa Electronic Market , which started life in the late 1980s , predicted the vote shares of candidates in several elections between 1988 and 2001 with an average margin of error of 1.5 percentage points , compared with the polls ' average error of 2.1 percentage points .
This year the Iowa market and other exchanges predicted a narrow win for Mr Bush .
Businesses have also made good use of information markets .
Siemens , a German conglomerate , used an internal market to forecast ( correctly ) that the firm would fail to deliver a software project on time , even though internal planning methods purportedly showed that the deadline could be met .
At Hewlett - Packard , a market did a better job than traditional methods in forecasting printer sales .
A joint - venture by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank that uses markets to predict economic indicators has been at least as accurate as economists ' median forecasts .
This is reassuring , but information markets are also prone to imperfections .
One is that they can exaggerate traders ' misperceptions of risks .
Punters tend to put too much weight on the most likely events and on very unlikely ones , and too little on those of intermediate probability .
According to the authors , one contract recently traded on Tradesports ' exchange showed that gamblers were assigning much more optimistic odds to extreme stockmarket outcomes than were traders on Chicago 's derivatives exchanges , where liquidity is much higher .
Participants in information markets also get swept away by their personal tastes : in much the same way that some people bet on their favourite team regardless of the odds , people are likelier to back the political party they belong to .
This should matter less in more liquid markets , because cooler participants will spot that partisanship has pushed prices out of line with probabilities , buy or sell to take advantage , and shift prices back .
But smaller , illiquid markets might not be corrected in this way .
Better informed policies
There have been some efforts to use prediction markets to improve public policy .
Last year , an American government body , the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency , tried to create an exchange to trade contracts on the likelihood of a terrorist attack .
( The Economist Intelligence Unit , a sister company of The Economist , provided data for this venture . )
After protest — someone pointed out , among other things , that terrorists might profit from insider trading before striking — the project was shelved .
Cheekily , one betting exchange created a contract on whether the project 's boss , John Poindexter , would still be in his job on a certain date .
It predicted , accurately , that he would not be .
Despite this debacle , Robert Hahn , director of the American Enterprise Institute - Brookings Joint Centre for Regulatory Studies , argues in a new paper† that information markets could be of great help in forming policy , especially when combined with performance - related contracts .
Suppose that a foundation is thinking of paying $ 5 for every child vaccinated against a certain disease .
Information markets can be used to estimate the number of children who will suffer from the disease both with and without the bounty .
That gives a market - based estimate of the benefit to be had from paying the bounty .
The foundation might then auction the rights to the bounty to ensure that the vaccinations are performed at the lowest cost .
That sounds far - fetched now , but such schemes may one day be common , given the ability of well - designed , liquid markets to reveal information .

Now you can extend that truism about oil and water to water and itself .
Water and water do n't always mix , either .
The textbooks say that water readily comes together with other water , open arms of hydrogen clasping oxygen attached to other OH molecules .
This is the very definition of " wetness . "
But scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have observed a first : a single layer of water - - ice grown on a platinum wafer -- that gives the cold shoulder to subsequent layers of ice that come into contact with it .
" Water - surface interactions are ubiquitous in nature and play an important role in many technological applications such as catalysis and corrosion , " said Greg Kimmel , staff scientist at the Department of Energy lab and lead author of a paper in the current issue ( Oct. 15 advance online edition ) of Physical Review Letters .
" It was assumed that one end of the water molecule would bind to metal , and at the other end would be these nice hydrogen attachment points for the atoms in next layer of water . "
A theory out of Cambridge University last year suggested that these attachment points , or " dangling OH's , " did not exist , that instead of dangling , the OH 's were drawn by the geometry of hexagonal noble - metal surfaces and clung to that .
Kimmel and his co-authors , working at the PNNL - based W.R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory , tested the theory with a technique called rare gas physisorption that enlists krypton to probe metal surfaces and water layers on those surfaces .
They found that the first single layer of water , or monolayer , wetted the platinum surface as they had expected but " that subsequent layers did not wet the first layer , " Kimmel said .
" In other words , the first layer of water is hydrophobic . "
The results jibe with an earlier Stanford University study that used X - ray adsorption to show that rather than being fixed pointing outward in the dangling position , wet and ready to receive the next water layer , the arms of a water monolayer on a metal surface are double - jointed .
They swivel back toward the surface of the metal to find a place to bind .
To the water molecules approaching this bent - over - backward surface , the layer has all the attractiveness of a freshly waxed car 's hood .
The second layer beads up , but that 's not all : Additional water 's attraction to that first hydrophobic water monolayer is so weak that 50 or more ice - crystal layers can be piled atop the first until all the so - called non-wetting portions are covered -- akin to " the coalescence of water drops on a waxed car in a torrential downpour , " said Bruce Kay , PNNL laboratory fellow and co-author with Kimmel and PNNL colleagues Nick Petrik and Zdenek Dohnálek .
Kimmel said that self - loathing water on metal is more than a curiosity and will come as a surprise to many in the field who assumed that water films uniformly cover surfaces .
Hundreds of experiments have been done on thin water films grown on metal surfaces to learn such things as how these films affect molecules in which they come into contact and what role heat , light and high - energy radiation play in such interactions .

Authorship gets lost on Web The Internet is becoming a cesspool of plagiarism .
Steve McKee , a partner at Albuquerque advertising agency McKee Wallwork Cleveland , found that out in June after he wrote his monthly column for BusinessWeek.com .
The column , entitled " Five Words Never to Use in an Ad , " was one of his more popular pieces .
A search revealed that 36 blogs had picked it up and posted it to their sites , something that is usually considered to be fair use in the blogosphere .
However , to McKee 's annoyance , 13 of those took credit for writing it as their original prose .
" They 're like cockroaches , " McKee says .
" Ideas are our assets , and it 's frustrating when people take them from you without shame . "
Other examples abound .
WiserAdvisor.com , a sort of Yellow Pages for financial advisers , posts articles of advice to attract traffic .
One recent article was about Social Security issues that arise when married couples are not close in age .
The byline on the article is Michael Bischoff , a certified public accountant with Webb Financial Group in Bloomington , Minn .
However , the identical article appeared Aug. 15 on the website MarketWatch by reporter Andrea Coombes .
Bischoff said Coombes interviewed and quoted him , and he had e-mailed the MarketWatch story to WiserAdvisor .
He said he did not know why he was given a byline .
Tom Murcko , CEO of WiserAdvisor publisher WebFinance , said the site requires financial advisers to submit original material only .
" We are certain this was an honest mistake on ( Bischoff's ) part , " Murcko said .
Last week , WiserAdvisor removed all seven articles that Bischoff has submitted and invited him to resubmit any that he wrote .
Murcko says his company takes intellectual property seriously and is itself frequently the victim of Internet plagiarism .
So is NewsFactor Network , but no one has the resources to do anything about it , says David Geller , president of the Internet magazine .
It started here ... A July 3 column written for BusinessWeek by former General Electric CEO Jack Welch and his wife , Suzy , was posted on the Indian Institute of Planning and Management ( IIPM ) site from New Delhi .
There was no attribution to either BusinessWeek or the Welches , only a photo that appeared with the column of professor Arindam Chaudhuri , a business guru and best - selling author in India who works for IIPM .
When USA TODAY tried to contact Chaudhuri by e-mail on July 21 , the e-mail was forwarded to Naveen Chamoli , dean of IIPM's Centre for Planning and Entrepreneurship .
Chamoli e-mailed back saying that Chaudhuri was traveling , inaccessible and had nothing to do with the Welch column being posted beneath his photo .
Chamoli said in his e-mail that IIPM has rights to the Welch column through the New York Times News Service / Syndicate .
Chamoli said in a subsequent e-mail that a Welch byline was added after the USA TODAY inquiry because , " others could be confused . "
Jack and Suzy Welch , on vacation , had no comment .
In some quarters , plagiarism remains a serious offense .
But where it involves the Internet , an acceptance of plagiarism is taking hold , and when confronted , offenders often shrug it off as hardly newsworthy .
Pew Research two weeks ago said it found that of the 12 million adults who blog , 44 % say they have taken songs , text or images and " remixed " them into their own artistic creation .
A new twist is software used by spammers to automatically and intentionally grab original content to post on blogs and Internet sites .
Authors are byproduct victims of an attempt to draw traffic to the content so that readers will click on deceiving links that take them to advertising .
Legalities next ?
It 's going to take a high - profile legal case to slow it down , says Howard Kaushansky , president of Umbria , which companies hire to monitor the Internet and report back what is being said about them and competitors .
McKee's BusinessWeek.com column shows how Internet plagiarism takes a winding road .
It was first picked up by CRM Daily , a Web - based publisher owned by NewsFactor Network , which has a contract with a syndicate to post BusinessWeek.com content .
The attribution CRM Daily gave BusinessWeek.com was at the bottom and in smaller print , and McKee was not mentioned as the author .
Other blogs then picked up the content from CRM Daily .
Some mistakenly attributed the original work to CRM Daily , some attributed it to no one .
At least four blogs attributed McKee 's words to Jim Berkowitz , who writes a blog called CRMMastery.com .
Berkowitz says he picked up McKee 's column from CRM Daily , and mistakenly gave CRM Daily credit .
Then , when other bloggers lifted it from CRMMastery , they mistakenly attributed Berkowitz as the author because his blog is where they found it .
" People are incredibly sloppy , " says Berkowitz , who says he publishes a lot of content that he takes from elsewhere but identifies what is not his original work by indenting it and highlighting it in yellow .
" It 's like the Wild West out there , " Berkowitz says .
AT CHRISTMAS , many people do things they would never dream of the rest of the year , from giving presents to getting drunk .
Some even go to church .
Attendance soars , as millions of once - a - year worshippers fill the pews .
In Britain , where most weeks fewer than one person in ten goes to church , attendance more than triples .
Even in America , where two - fifths of the people say they go frequently , the share climbs in December .
Some of the occasional churchgoers must wonder whether they might benefit from turning up more often .
If they did so , they could gain more than spiritual nourishment .
Jonathan Gruber , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , claims that regular religious participation leads to better education , higher income and a lower chance of divorce .
His results * ( based on data covering non-Hispanic white Americans of several Christian denominations , other faiths and none ) imply that doubling church attendance raises someone 's income by almost 10 % .
The idea that religion can bring material advantages has a distinguished history .
A century ago Max Weber argued that the Protestant work ethic lay behind Europe 's prosperity .
More recently Robert Barro , a professor at Harvard , has been examining the links between religion and economic growth ( his work was reviewed here in November 2003 ) .
At the microeconomic level , several studies have concluded that religious participation is associated with lower rates of crime , drug use and so forth .
Richard Freeman , another Harvard economist , found 20 years ago that churchgoing black youths were more likely to attend school and less likely to commit crimes or use drugs .
Until recently , however , there was little quantitative research on whether religion affects income directly and if so , by how much .
A big obstacle is the difficulty of disentangling cause and effect .
That frequent churchgoers have higher incomes than non-churchgoers does not prove that religion made them richer .
It might be that richer people are likelier to go to church .
Or unrelated traits , such as greater ambition or personal discipline , could lead people both to go to church and also to succeed in their work .
To distinguish cause from coincidence , Mr Gruber uses information on the ethnic mix of neighbourhoods and congregations .
Sociologists have long argued that people are more likely to go to church if their neighbours share their faith .
Thus Poles in Boston ( which has lots of Italian and Irish Catholics ) are more likely to attend mass than Poles in Minneapolis ( which has more Scandinavian Protestants ) .
Measuring the density of nationalities that share a religion in a particular city can therefore be a good predictor of church attendance .
But ethnic density is not wholly independent of income .
Studies have found that people who live with lots of others of the same ethnic origin tend to be worse off than those who are not “ ghettoised ” .
So Mr Gruber excludes an individual 's own group from the measures , and instead calculates the density of “ co-religionists ” , the proportion of the population that shares your religion but not your race .
According to Mr Gruber 's calculations , a 10 % increase in the density of co-religionists leads to an 8.5 % rise in churchgoing .
Once he has controlled for other inter-city differences , Mr Gruber finds that a 10 % increase in the density of co-religionists leads to a 0.9 % rise in income .
In other words , because there are lots of non-Polish Catholics in Boston and few in Minnesota , Poles in Boston both go to church more often and are materially better off relative to , say , Swedes in Boston than Poles in Minnesota relative to Swedes in Minnesota .
Mr Gruber finds little evidence that living near different ethnic groups of the same faith affects any other civic activity .
Poles in Boston are no more likely to join secular organisations than Poles in Minnesota .
Since general differences between cities are already controlled for , that leads him to conclude that it must be religious attendance that is driving the differences in income .
Looking for a cause
Other economists , though they think Mr Gruber 's approach is clever , are not sure that he has established a causal link between religious attendance and wealth .
So how might churchgoing make you richer ?
Mr Gruber offers several possibilities .
One plausible idea is that going to church yields “ social capital ” , a web of relationships that fosters trust .
Economists think such ties can be valuable , because they make business dealings smoother and transactions cheaper .
Churchgoing may simply be an efficient way of creating them .
Another possibility is that a church 's members enjoy mutual emotional and ( maybe ) financial insurance .
That allows them to recover more quickly from setbacks , such as the loss of a job , than they would without the support of fellow parishioners .
Or perhaps religion and wealth are linked through education .
Mr Gruber 's results suggest that higher church attendance leads to more years at school and less chance of dropping out of college .
A vibrant church might also boost the number of religious schools , which in turn could raise academic achievement .
Finally , religious faith itself might be the channel through which churchgoers become richer .
Perhaps , Mr Gruber muses , the faithful may be “ less stressed out ” about life 's daily travails and thus better equipped for success .
This may make religion more appealing to some of those who turn up only once a year .
But given that Jesus warned his followers against storing up treasures on earth , you might think that this was n't the motivation for going to church that he had in mind .

The enemy has landed .
One of the worst nightmares of ' patriotic Americans ' may soon come true .
An unsolicited $ 18.5 billion offer from state - owned Chinese oil firm CNOOC to buy Unocal , America 's ninth largest oil firm , has given a nation obsessed with energy security a shock .
US - Sino relations are already tense - and this could be the moment the world realises a rival superpower to America has come of age .
Last Thursday as Chinese executives stalked Wall Street to get their bid accepted by Unocal , Congress voted 398 - 15 , backing a resolution that Chinese ownership of Unocal would ' threaten to impair the national security of the United States ' .
Furthermore , approval by Unocal 's board of the bid should result in a ' thorough review ' by President Bush .
With the issue setting Beijing against the White House , Unocal 's shareholders are caught in the headlights .
The question is whether they have the courage to take Chinese cash that values Unocal 's shares at $ 67 - especially as there is an agreed offer from US major Chevron on the table worth $ 60 per share that comes without political complications .
Chinese officials were last week in New York on a charm offensive downplaying Unocal 's strategic importance .
By emphasising that it supplies a tiny fraction of America 's domestic output , CNOOC argues that Unocal 's takeover cannot represent a US security threat .
It is Unocal 's oil and gas in Asia that the company prizes .
But the deal would also give China a 9 per cent stake in the BP - led consortium building the $ 6bn Baku - Tiblisi - Ceyan oil pipeline , a project aimed at easing US reliance on the Middle East for oil .
Wall Street oil analysts agree that what makes Unocal a must - have is the technical expertise that will allow CNOOC to compete for giant gas and oil exploration projects .
' Unocal has been portrayed as a state - controlled resource grab , which is silly , ' said a CNOOC spokesman .
' In the US just 1 per cent of US domestic consumption is from Unocal .
And at least 73 per cent of its assets are in Asia . '
Critics of the Chinese not only cite US national security but argue that the deal acts against basic free - market principles , because $ 13 billion of the $ 18.5 bn Chinese offer comes in government - backed loans , amounting to state aid .
' Frankly it 's not a level playing field , ' said one US analyst .
The Chinese state media last Thursday admitted the size of the loans to buy Unocal could put downward pressure on the yuan .
This will exacerbate US concern over Chinese imports .
Beijing has been under pressure to allow the yuan , pegged near 8.28 to the dollar , to float freely , with the US and others saying the exchange rate is artificially low , giving prolific Chinese exports an unfair advantage .
But there are suggestions from Treasury Secretary John Snow and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that Beijing will soon allow the value of the yuan to rise .
Although this will prove politically expedient in the light of the Unocal transaction , it will also make US bid targets cheaper for the Chinese .
Could Unocal be the start of a further Chinese hoovering up of Uncle Sam 's assets ?
Whatever the outcome , the world 's two superpowers are on collision course over crude oil .
Dave Simpson , America 's acting deputy secretary of commerce , recently said : ' We appear to be competing more than partnering . '
That competition is getting hotter .
Only last week , consolidation in the Chinese oil industry saw the creation of its largest private oil enterprise , Great United Petroleum Holding Co , from more than 30 small and medium - sized private oil companies .
It also emerged last week that China National Petroleum is poised to bid for Petro - Kazakhstan , the Canadian - based oil producer .
China 's spending on oil assets has been accelerating this year .
Last January , Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin visited China to discuss Chinese access to the Alberta tar sands .
The summit yielded a crucial production - sharing agreement .
In the same month , China National Petroleum Corporation signed a deal with Peru to study exploration deals .
In all , it is thought Beijing has signed agreements worth $ 100bn with Latin America .
In February , Venezuala and China signed 19 agreements , including investment in Venezualan oil fields .
During the Nineties , Chinese petroleum consumption increased at a compound annual rate of 6.3 per cent but its oil production only grew at a compound annual rate of 1.7 per cent and since 1996 , it has been a net importer of oil .
CNOOC 's bid will inevitably face delays , whereas shareholders have the option of taking Chevron 's money at a vote on 10 August .
But Unocal 's share price , which on Friday closed at $ 6· , implies the market either thinks CNOOC will win or that Chevron will sweeten its offer .
CNOOC executives have just six weeks to overturn Unocal 's recommendation of Chevron 's offer .

You can read the machine translated English article here .
The cost of individual cyber attacks fell dramatically in the US last year but unauthorised access and the theft of proprietary information remain top security concerns .
The 10th annual Computer Crime and Security Survey , put together by the Computer Security Institute ( CSI ) in conjunction with information security experts at the FBI , shows financial losses resulting from security breaches down for the fourth successive year .
The cost of breaches averaged $ 204,000 per respondent - down 61 per cent from last year 's average loss of $ 526,000 .
Virus attacks continue as the source of the greatest financial pain , making up 32 per cent of the overall losses reported .
But unauthorized access showed a dramatic increase and replaced denial of service as the second most significant contributor to cybercrime losses .
Unauthorised access was fingered for a quarter ( 24 per cent ) of losses reported in the CSI / FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey 2005 .
Meanwhile losses from theft of proprietary information doubled last year , based on the survey of 700 computer security practitioners in various US corporations , universities and government agencies .
The study found fears about negative publicity are preventing organisation from reporting cybercrime incidents to the police , a perennial problem the CSI / FBI study reckons is only getting worse .
Assuming that this is n't true of what respondents also told CSI 's researchers ( academics from the University of Maryland ) , the study presents a picture of reducing cyber crime losses that contrasts sharply with vendor - sponsored studies .
Chris Keating , CSI Director , said its study suggests that organizations that raise their level of security awareness but warns against complacency in the face of a changing cybercrime threat .
" Individual users are more exposed to computer crime than ever , due to the growth in identity theft schemes .
We can't help but note the shift in the survey results toward more financial damage due to theft of sensitive company data .
This is an ominous , though not unexpected , development and underscores the need to insist that enterprise networks be properly safeguarded , " he said .
The CSI / FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey aims to help determine the scope of computer crime along with promoting security awareness .

Given the fact that you have already experienced a similar scenario , what is your assessment ?
Samir : I want my message to reach the Americans themselves .
If their goal was to create the new Middle East and the foundation of a democratic example of a country that chooses its leaders , then I will tell them that the result of their military action is totally the opposite .
The majority of people in the Middle East are now holding their leaders close to them even if they are unfair , because they fear facing the same fate as Iraq .
The military action did not work .

Would it be that we will have to see another dictatorship before we see peace in Iraq ?
Sa'ad : Unfortunately this is what we have been seeing .
We have replaced a military dictatorship with a religious one , for the time being .
Now we have Islamic parties , both Sunni and Shia and they are imposing their ideology on the people .
No -one is capable of standing up to them .
Lots of the killing we are seeing , and the violence , is because of this kind of ideology .
If you stand up , you will be eliminated .
So what 's new ?
It 's the same thing as under Saddam , but now we are dealing with several Saddams , not just one .

Zeynab :
This is a great failure .
It ca n't be an experience to follow .
What is happening now in Iraq should be the major lesson for US in order not to repeat this experience , the American intervention in Iran wo n't influence positively in Iraq as the pro Iranian militias will remain here , and will continue receiving support from Iran beside the possibility of similar violence in Iran .
Read more about Zeynab Question from a reader of the BBC PERSIAN website in Iran , 1900 Iraq time ( 1500 GMT ) Q :
It seems that Iraq 's currency has become stronger since the down fall of Saddam 's regime .
I have heard that the average salary of a teacher has risen from $ 3 to $ 100 .
Does this mean people are better off ?
COST OF BASIC GOODS US$ 1 kg lamb - $ 6 1 kg bread - $ 0.50 20 litres petrol - $ 3.50 ( subsidised ) or $ 6.80 - $ 8.20 ( black market )
All figures March 2006 Facts and figures about Iraq Sa'ad : No-one can deny that salaries have improved considerably .
Sometimes that salary under Saddam would have been even lower : $ 1 , not $ 3 !
But with the deteriorating services , people are spending more and more than during Saddam¿s time .
For example , then you could fill your car tank with fuel for 1,000 dinars .
Now , because of shortages in fuel products and the long , long queues at gas stations , you go to the black market and buy it for 50,000 dinars , if not more .
The same thing applies to electricity , cooking gas , heating and so on , and the total is enormous .
So the increased salaries often do n't cover it .
Question from a reader of the BBC PERSIAN website in Iran , 1850 Iraq time ( 1450 GMT ) Q : Given the history of war between Iran and Iraq , what kind of role do you think Iran has in the security situation in Iraq ?
Positive or negative ?
Sa'ad :
Well , I think the official statements from Iranian officials have been positive but at the same time you can hear some Iraqi officials and coalition officials blaming the Iranian authorities or security services of providing weapons and training and financing for some of the armed groups in Iraq .
Lots of people blame Iran for many things taking place in Iraq , because they think if there was a success story for the coalition in Iraq , this would encourage other nations to look for a similar liberation in their countries from dictatorships - whether they are military or religious .
So some analysts accuse Iran and even Syria of preventing a stable , secure Iraq from happening .
Question from Kim Donnelly , Capetown , South Africa , 1835 Iraq time ( 1435 GMT ) Q :
Do you think that the motivation for the US invasion of Iraq was truly to release you as human beings from an authoritarian regime or do you think that the US invasion was a self - serving act to ensure future US economic control within Iraq ?
Layla :
It was not to free us .
I 'm a victim of the regime , and Iraqi people understand that the US invasion of Iraq [ in 1991 ] gave them an opportunity to be free from the regime .
But America did n't support the uprisings in the south and north in 1991 .
Hundreds of thousands died .
If they really wanted to free the Iraqi people , they should have freed them at that time but they did n't .
This time it just so happened that their interests coincided with freeing the Iraqi people from the regime .
I 'm very happy that we got rid of Saddam , but I think all the western countries , the UK , US , and others , have an interest in Iraq .
It 's an oil country , in addition to its strategic position in the Middle East .
Question from Marije , Nottingham , UK , 1830 Iraq time ( 1430 GMT ) Q : For Layla .
Do you have good hopes for the future regarding the position of the female in family and society , now that the regime has changed ?
Layla : Definitely .
If we go back to the time when the regime was in power , there was no room for women except for women who were loyal to the regime , and even then they were tools of the regime , to transfer the opinions that the regime wanted .
Now there will be a role for women , they will have their rights , a right to play a big role in politics , and social life , and defining the family 's rights , kids ' rights .
And the political parties and NGOs are encouraging women to take their part in the political process .

Days after the end of the war , Zeynab 's family pose by a tank Zeynab :
Yes , I have relatives in other provinces who do not hear aircrafts or explosions .
When they came to visit us they were shocked at the state of things .
The provinces are calm , however .
My sister lives in a village near Baghdad where there is a concentration of American and Iraqi security forces .
The allied forces raided their home one night and forced them out .
Meanwhile Iraqi forces threatened them too .
Some places are not really calm but in general the provinces are more safe and calm than Baghdad and big cities .
The picture on the right is of my family just days after the end of the war .
This tank was abandoned near our home .
Many war devices were left all over Baghdad at that time .
BAGHDAD MOSQUE EXPLOSION
More than 40 people have been killed in an apparent suicide bomb attack on the Shia Buratha mosque in Baghdad .
The BBC News website asked the panellists for their response .
Baghdad mosque attack ' kills 51 ' Layla : I just came from nearby [ where the bombing happened ] .
It 's a very famous mosque - there is a cemetery in there .
Iraqis who do n't have the money to go to Najaf bury their dead there .
I just called my friend who is the sister of the sheikh - Sheikh Jalal [ Jalal al - Din al - Saghir , the imam of the Buratha Mosque ] .
She 's OK but she 's in a panic .
She said they are moving injured people from the mosque now .
It 's very sad and very bad , that they 've been trying to attack this mosque .
It played a very important role in the election campaign .
The Sheikh was a great activist .
He is one of the exiled peoples from Saddam 's regime .
He came back straight away after the fall of the regime .
His father was the Imam of this mosque 30 years ago .
The Friday prayer at that mosque is one of the biggest ones in Baghdad .
I 've been there on Fridays , but one day I had to come back because there was no way to make my way to the prayer room .
Read more about Layla al - Khafaji Essam : I am so shocked , I can not believe it .
I used to go to this mosque very regularly when I lived in Baghdad three years ago .
It is such a holy place and it has a big area .
You could hear the leaves shake in the trees when so many hundreds of Shia Muslims bowed down to pray .
It is over 1,000 years old and I used to go there because there is a holy well with holy water on the site - where Imam Ali visited centuries ago .
Zeynab :
This is becoming an everyday story in our lives .
Bombing a mosque , school or hospital is is something you always hear about .
I did n't hear the explosion as the mosque is not that near to me .
I do expect Shia to retaliate .
There are security forces who are supposed to protect the mosque .
Might they be involved ?

Everyone admits that there are Iraqi and foreign militias .
But in a civil war there is no winner Ask Rwanda ask Lebanon or any other country which had a civil war , all end up losing .
In my opinion what we have now was expected , and in order to go to a safe place we have to go through this road , but we did n't imagine it would be that bad .
I hope the United States might change its strategy here .
I hope it might work .
Read more about Samir Ali Question from Donald Currie , Edinburgh , UK , 1630 Iraq time ( 1230 GMT ) Q :
What can you tell me about how Sunnis and Shias in Iraq relate to each other ?
Samir :
It 's a religious difference .
The schism is related to historical approaches in Islam , to who has the right to interpret the Koran .
It 's a historical issue started more that thousand years ago .
Relations between Shia and Sunni were very good before the occupation .
There are many mixed marriages .
Nobody will be willing to give his daughter to man who he dislikes .
But in the last few months there has been a tense environment between the two parties .
It 's its all about differences between the political rivals .
I think if politics in Iraq was n't sectarian , things would have been much better .
Those parties are based on sectarian principles each wants his sect to be the dominant one .
That is why there is conflict .
Despite this , there is still a healthy relationship between Shia and Sunni - there are mixed marriages .
Question from Matt Sirotkin , Chicago , USA , 1540 Iraq time ( 1140 GMT ) Q :
In your opinion , from where do the intense violence and infighting come ?
Zeynab : I think the occupation , the Iraqi army and the police are all responsible for the current situation .
The Iraqi security forces are now sectarian and they coordinate with the occupation to carry out this terror .
The army during Saddam 's time was multi-ethnic ( Shia , Kurd and Sunni ) their mission was to protect Iraq and Iraqis but now nobody is defending the Iraqi people .
Question from Daphne Constantine , East Grinstead , UK , 1520 Iraq time ( 1120 GMT ) Q : Not so long ago Iraq did not exist as a country but was " invented " by the West .
Do you feel that dividing Iraq into two or three separate countries to cater for the disparate groups within it would make a better long - term solution ?
Sa'ad : Yes , Iraq was created in the 1920s .
But if you look at the 1950s and 1960s , you can see a real success story .
We were a modern state which was a model in the region , whose foundation was democracy and politics , education and people working hard .
It was a country which could not be considered part of the third world .
So I think we could go back to that modern state .
None of the regions - Shia , Kurdish , and so on - on their own will be strong enough to be a good state like Iraq in the 1950s and 60s .
It would be impractical to cut Iraq into three parts .
If we divide Sunni from Shia , what will people like me do ?
My mother 's side is Shia , my father 's side is Sunni .
You have tribes where one part is Shia and one part is Sunni .
All of these divisions only came into existence because of political parties who offered themselves as strictly Shia and strictly Sunni , so it 's impractical .

No way !
How can you divide the one land .
We have here in Samawa Shias , Sunnis and Kurds .
Iraq can never be divided .
We are just like a fruit cocktail .
When the Shia holy shrines in Najaf were destroyed we all went out in demonstrations - from south to north - holding hands together and speaking with one voice .
There is an attempt from some provocative media outlets to show Iraq as if it is a destroyed country about to vanish .
This is not true .
I was in the market yesterday and everything is in great order .
The army and police were everywhere .
I have n't seen such order in my life even in the era of Saddam Hussein which was dominated by the secret service presence in the streets .
We are fine and Iraq is beautiful .

Is this reducing at all ?
Essam : Iraq is an Islamic country and Islam prohibits the unjustified killing of human souls .
Those suicide bomber are not Iraqis .
Iraqi people do not like them at all .
Those fighters of al - Zarqawi are outsiders who came into Iraq and recruited people to operate in highly populated areas - the last time they bombarded a group of workers .
The real martyrs from the Iraqi viewpoint are those innocent victims of terrorism .
Nobody encouraged those suicide attacks , neither now nor in the era of the unjust and harmful regime of Saddam .

What in your opinion has been the single biggest mistake made by the US - led coalition in its invasion and occupation of Iraq ?
Sa'ad : I think the biggest mistake was that they adopted similar policies to those used after the fall of Nazi Germany .
They thought that whoever was a Baathist was like a Nazi - but that is not true , because Iraqis were forced to join the Baathists , not like in Germany when members actually believed in the party 's principles .
There was a witch - hunt .
Lots of efficient , qualified people were marginalised , put aside and sent home , not to have any role in building the new Iraq .
Of course , they did not lay down and die in their houses , they had to do something , and it became a struggle for survival .
In order to stay alive and survive you had to fight and this was the start of the insurgency .
This applies particularly to the Iraqi army which was disbanded .

Have suicide levels risen ?
Sa'ad :
Well , sectarian feelings are now at a peak , because when you have a certain sect on one side becoming strong , the other sect feels threatened , so it leads them to gather and face down the other side .
If you are a sociologist , you will find that whenever there are troubles or wars , people tend to go towards religion and God for hope , for some kind of moral boost .
I do n't think suicide has risen , mostly because suicide in Islam is seen as a sin , like any other religion , and the punishment is that you go to hell .
Suicide bombers do n't see themselves as committing suicide but becoming martyrs .
Question from Matt Sirotkin , Chicago , USA , 1410 Iraq time ( 1010 GMT ) Q : What misconceptions do you feel Westerners have about Iraq and the Middle East ?
Zeynab : Westerners can't see us as we really are .
We have our own civilisation and culture .
We have modern life .
The media does n't represent that picture so our culture is not clear for the West .
Satellite channels should introduce more details of our life in different areas and not only politics .
That might help for better understanding .
Our country had good security during Saddam and we were able to walk down the streets at midnight .
Financially it was n't about luxury but at least it was sufficient for a moderate life .
It was stable somehow .

Do you worry that the " new Iraq " will be very conservative , and perhaps restrict women 's rights ?
How are the children coping with the all the violence going on around them ?
Do you think that their generation will look back on this and feel bitter towards the US and their allies ?
Zeynab says women are determined to hold on to their rights Zeynab :
Only women close to Saddam regime had their full rights but the normal women did n't have that .
I do n't think the situation would be worse , we did n't have enough rights , and nobody will reduce the few that we have .
Our children are scared , they live in a civil war .
The bombing and shooting should have been ended by the ousting of the ex-regime but there is still violence everywhere .
There will definitely be bitterness .
My son is now 13 years old .
When he reaches his twenties he will say that when the US entered our country and the regime was ousted , robbery and assaults spread everywhere , central authorities were dissolved and chaos was there .
He will definitely remember that .
Mateen :
For my children , the situation here in Kurdistan is very calm , we are not being affected directly by the violence .
It 's like life in the US , UK , any European country , except the level of services is not as good as there or even comparable .
EDUCATION IN IRAQ
By 2004 , 315 schools were partially or fully restored In 2005 , 50,000 primary school teachers underwent training In 2005 , 7.9 m boys and girls went to school Source : Unicef
But from a security point of view , we do n't have those kind of problems .
We are in a safe part of the country , everyone is free , there are no thieves , you can leave your door open , travel at any time , go for picnics , go shopping late at night - so our children are not witnessing those kinds of problems .
People have lost interest in the [ security ] situation [ elsewhere ] - they do n't want to watch those bad things on the TV .
Of course we are very sorry about what is happening .
Many of my wife 's relatives are living in those parts of the country , and their situation is very difficult .
They are living in a kind of prison and their children are traumatised .
But remember we ourselves have gone through this kind of situation - not for a few years but for 40 or 50 years from the time I was born .
We have been displaced , we have been immigrants , we have seen bombings .
So my children were already adapted to that .
Read more about Mateen Question from DM , London , UK , 1320 Iraq time ( 0920 GMT ) Q: For a while I have been wondering about the infrastructure in the larger cities in Iraq .
What kind of condition was the infrastructure in before the second war ?
Were there regular power cuts and brown - outs ?
How sophisticated was the sewerage and water supply ?
What are they like now and how are they improving ?
Mateen says his home city of Dohuk has no sewage system Mateen : During the early 90s our city of Dohuk was without electricity for more than two years .
We did n't have any kind of electricity .
Then people adapted themselves and started to set up big generators and we were getting limited quantities of electricity from Turkey - but only for a few hours .
The situation currently is very good , but it 's not sustainable because unless you have electricity or a power generation plant , you do n't feel safe .
Still we are face blackouts but those private generators are still there .
The water situation is not bad .
There is no shortage .
People are getting enough tap water .
In the past there was a big problem of water supply because of the [ city 's ] expansion .
Nothing has changed regarding sewage .
In our city we do n't have a sewage system , the waste water is running all over the street .
That 's a big problem .

Inside the building it remains the same , if not worse .
We have only one source of light inside classrooms and this is insufficient .
Before the war we used to have cleaning service employees but now the students have to leave their classes and do the cleaning themselves .
Some students are decided .
They will help to build the country in the future but others are very frustrated and do n't care about studies anymore because they see no horizon .
The major problem which we face every single day is the security issue , I myself moved my son from Al Mansour ( Baghdad ) school which is the best school in the area to another less prestigious school , I took this decision when the school guard was killed and also in order to avoid car bombs .
I 'm grateful to you and every one who is concerned about my country and as a colleague I wish you all the best , Thanks a lot .
Question from Christina Rush , Memphis , USA , 1210 Iraq time ( 0810 GMT ) Q : Do you think Iraq would be safer if the U.S. troops left right now ?
Why or why not ?
Samir :
No , I do n't think it would be safer .
There would be a civil war .
But they [ the US troops ] are dealing with the situation in the wrong way .
They should leave the cities and the roads , get away from our homes .
They are trying to enter our homes and search our homes .
We do n't know why - we do n't believe their excuses for it .
But we need them to support our country .
Iraq needs the Americans to get out of this bad situation .
I think most Iraqis hate them , dislike them - but they 're not afraid of them , I do n't think .
Read more about Samir Ali Zeynab :
No , I do n't think so .
Not now .
If they go now Iraq would n't be safer .
The Iraqi army and the police can't maintain security in this stage , they wo n't be able to do the job .
Read more about Zeynab Mateen :
No , I think it would be a fatal mistake for allied forces to withdraw from Iraq immediately without preparation and making sure the country is strong enough to cope with security problems .
I assure you , the country would separate immediately into several entities - it would be worse than Somalia .
I do n't think the US and UK would make that mistake .
If they left , everyone would be in trouble , the country would separate .
The current government is not strong enough at the moment to control the security situation and face the security threat .
Iraq has a very difficult geopolitical position .
Question from Andrew Bayly , Melbourne , Australia , 1150 Iraq time ( 0750 GMT ) Q : I am interested in your students ' reactions to daily life .
Are the children happy ?
What do they worry about ?
Have things improved or worsened for the children since this war began ?
And thank you Zeynab for doing your job .
My own young children love their teachers , but they have never had to live through a war .
Facts and figures about life in Iraq Zeynab :
My children live in great fear .
There are bombs and aircraft everywhere so they can't even follow their lessons in class for the high volume of aircraft sound .
They can't be happy in such circumstances .
As all children when they have opportunity they play although sometimes explosions stop them from playing .
They are really concerned about security and also about social conditions .
I 'm speaking about money .
The dissolved ministries did n't pay salaries for its ex-employees so families and of course kids were badly affected .
Whether they grow up to be fulfilled will depend on each student .
There are some who are ambitious and think they might be able to rebuild the future of Iraq , while others do n't .
However , I think that if the sectarian faces of the political leaders remain here Iraq wo n't change .
We have had too many false promises from politicians .
Read more about Zeynab Question from Omar , Rome , Italy , 1140 Iraq time ( 0740GMT ) Q : To Sa'ad al - Izzi : Other Arab states have been absent from the political arena in Iraq ?
To what extent is the Iraqi government isolationist .
Can Iraq engage actively in the Arab region ?
Sa'ad :
Most of the Arab people in surrounding countries were cheering for Saddam .
This may have created a backlash from Iraqis .
It seems to me that the Arabs looking at the government which came after Saddam saw them as a bunch of traitors - and they saw Saddam as a patriotic pro-Arab leader .
Saddam is the only one who hit Israel with missiles and this made him a real hero in the Arab world .
So there was a lot of disappointment in the Arab world when he was deposed .
In some senses there is a rift between some Iraqi people and the people in the rest of the Arab world .
Read more about Sa'ad Al - Izzi Question from Laura , Orange , USA , 1135 , Iraq time ( 0735 GMT ) Q : To Samir Ali : Would you prefer security under Saddam 's rule to the present unpredictability of today 's situation ?
Samir :
That 's a great question and difficult to answer .
Security is a very important issue in our lives , but Saddam 's time was a very dark era .
I think we need to pass through this bad time in order to reach our goal of a good , stable , progressive country .

When I was there , I was n't able to leave our base and see what Iraq is like .
Does any one of the commentators envision a day when veterans such as I will be able to visit Iraq as a tourist and be able to explore the country and culture that we fought for ?
Essam works at the police training academy in the town of Samawa Essam : Yes , of course .
But you should come to the south of Iraq .
Do n't go to the North as Baghdad is dangerous and Fallujah is unsafe as well .
But in the south we have water and many ancient and beautiful places that you can visit .
It is not a problem .
I feel very safe in my town , where I work with the army .
There is a police training academy here too .
Just last year during our elections , two Japanese people came .
We walked everywhere with them and people would come and say hello to them .
They had total freedom of movement .
The north of Iraq is also beautiful .
It 's really nice country up north in Iraq , which I believe has been virtually independent since 1991 .

Are there enough doctors and nurses staying over night in the hospitals to take care of sick people and is there enough medicine to keep them alive ?
Samir :
No , there is a great shortage of medical supplies and medicine and also our senior [ doctors ] have left the country due to the bad security situation here .
There 's a good number of doctors and nurses , but we have lost our senior doctors .
Read more about Samir Ali Question from Alexander Ames , USA , 1105 Iraq time ( 0705 GMT ) Q : Are any of the universities back in operation ?
I read that most universities were looted and lacked books , desks and computers .
Has this situation improved ?
Essam :
This is a good question because my answer will tell you about the wonderful people in our country .
Maybe some books were looted .
But the people who were responsible for the libraries took many really valuable books to their homes and kept them in safety .
Afterwards , they returned them to the libraries of each university .
This is why our country is so rich .
It is full of good people .
I heard of one lady in Basra who without the agreement of the dean of Basra college , loaded up a truck and kept the valuable manuscripts herself .
When the Coalition Provisional Authority started functioning , she brought back the book to the college .
Read more about Essam Hamoudi Question from Sam Hawkins , Edinburgh , 1100 Iraq time ( 0700 GMT ) Q :
Do you think the news coverage of Iraq by Western journalists , including the BBC , who are heavily reliant on military press releases and almost never venture outside the green zone , bears any resemblance to reality ?
Is the story we are given manipulated by the coalition forces ?
Sa'ad : I doubt coverage is manipulated , especially the coverage that comes from Western , high - standard media establishments .
Many journalists
I know have been committed to the Iraqi story for more than three years .
It is obviously easier for Arab journalists , such as myself , to mingle in the streets and meet people .
Arab journalists do not stand out in a crowd .
But just yesterday , I went to Najaf with a couple of reporters from the Washington Post .
We went through a very " hot " area - it is known as the triangle of death .
We heard about five people who had been killed on the road that day .
Many people are targeted in this country - doctors , masons , college professors too .
It 's just a dangerous place but everyone tries hard to work .

Mel Gibson checked into rehab yesterday as his rep hinted at the star ’s uphill battle , saying , “ The guy is trying to stay alive . ”
After spewing anti-Semitic comments and cursing a cop when he was arrested for drunken driving last week , the “ Lethal Weapon ” actor has begun “ participating in an ongoing program to deal with this , ” publicist Alan Nierob said .
He declined to detail Gibson ’s treatment or reveal where he was receiving it .
News of Gibson ’s rehab stint came as In Touch Weekly photos surfaced , capturing Gibson ’s passion for booze and blondes just hours before his arrest in Malibu , Calif .
The bleary - eyed star was spotted at celeb - studded Moonshadows restaurant with a babe on each arm and a beer bottle in his right hand late Thursday and into the wee hours Friday .
Revelers said Gibson admitted that he had been downing wine at a dinner party earlier Thursday .
He then readily chatted with fans about everything from his movies to religion to his seven kids – and even called his wife of 26 years , Robyn , “ a saint . ”
“ Mel had bloodshot eyes and looked drunk , ” Todd Hausberger , 29 , of Phoenix told In Touch .
“ He was slurring his words . ”
At one point , Gibson switched to drinking water and put his head in his hands , saying , “ I am drunk , ” recalled Kimberly Lesak , 29 , of Louisville , Ky .
At 2 a.m. , Gibson – who reinvented himself as a producer and director with the controversial mega-hit “ The Passion of the Christ ” – then decided it was time to head home , the mag said .
“ We all offered him rides , and he shrugged it off , ” Lesak said .
Hausberger said he urged the star , who lives a few miles away , not to drive , but that Gibson responded :
“ No , I ’m fine .
I ’ll take care of myself . ”
A Los Angeles Sheriff ’s deputy busted the Road Warrior in his 2006 Lexus going 87 mph in a 45 mph zone , shortly after 2:30 a.m. Friday .
A bottle of tequila was found in his car .
Gibson tested at an 0.12 percent blood - alcohol level , cops said .
California law considers drivers at 0.08 percent to be impaired .
Gibson , 50 , has apologized for making “ despicable ” remarks during his arrest , during which he allegedly said , “ Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world , ” before asking arresting Deputy James Mee , “ Are you a Jew ? ”
A leaked sheriff ’s report showed Gibson was originally cooperative and fearful about his impending arrest , blurting out , “ My life is f- – - ed . ”
But the actor soon turned combative .
He threatened the arresting cop that he’d “ get even with me , ” the deputy said .
“ I ’m going to f- – – you .
You ’re going to regret you ever did this to me , ” the actor allegedly told deputies .
That ’s when Gibson allegedly let loose with a series of anti-Semitic slurs , ripping the “ f- – - ing Jews . ”
Mee yesterday said he hopes Gibson gets the help he needs .
“ I do n’t take pride in hurting Mr. Gibson , ” said Mee , who is Jewish .
“ What I had hoped out of this is that he would think twice before he gets behind the wheel of a car and was drinking .
. . .
I do n’t want to ruin his career .
I do n’t want to defame him in any way or hurt him . ”
As for Gibson ’s anti-Semitic rant , Mee dismissed it as “ booze talking . ”
“ There ’s two things that booze does .
It amplifies your personality . . .
If you are a high - strung person , it ’s going to amplify that , and all the bad things are going to come out . ”
Mee , a 17 - year veteran of the force , said he considers the bust routine .
“ I guess I ’m a little naive , because all the other deputies who came into the station that morning , they were taken by his celebrity , ” he said .
The celebrity news Web site http://www.tmz.com reported that Gibson has been pulled over twice in Malibu over the past three years and was not cited either time .
During a traffic stop three years ago , a deputy suspected Gibson might have been impaired but let him go anyway , the report said .
Sheriff ’s officials denied Gibson ’s received any preferential treatment – but are still conducting an internal review to determine if deputies ever pulled over the actor , or cut him slack .
Gibson once filmed a public service announcement for the L.A. Sheriff ’s Department , dressed in a sheriff ’s uniform .
‘” He has no prior record , ” said Sheriff ’s spokesman Steve Whitmore .
“ We have done our job . ”
Whitmore acknowledged that Gibson ’s name might not be in any police reports , if deputies did n’t arrest him .
“ The hope is not [ that Gibson received any star treatment ] , ” Whitmore said .
“ Our job is to treat everyone equally , regardless of race , class or celebrity . ”
The Oscar winner is free on $ 5,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in a Malibu courtroom Sept. 28 .

Cursed
Statement made by Mel Gibson , according to an arrest report .
The star recently shot an ad for the L.A. Sheriff ’s Department ( right ) :
The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world . . .
Are you a Jew ?
I ’m going to f–k you .
You ’re going to regret you ever did his to me .
My life is f—-d .

That was the phrase that got my attention .
I was talking to an exec at a 1999 new media company … one of those anchor tenants on the web , a big content website .
She said something that , in retrospect was obvious , but so shocking it made me sit up straight .
" Google does n’t help us at all .
It would be great if they went away . "
It ’s so easy to count on search , depend on search and assume for search that most people do n’t realize how the dynamic has changed .
If you ’ve got a portal or a big store of content , Google is , probably , not built into your DNA .
If there ’s no search engine and you need a recipe or a pot , you visit cooking .com and they find you the best match on their site .
And it goes beyond web companies .
If there ’s no search engine and you need to buy coffee , you go to Starbucks.com , right ?
Leaders in every field had no reason to invent for search … it ’s not good for them .
In fact , most market leaders still have web sites , not web pages .
A website is a place , a sticky collection / connection of web pages with a search field .
A website is a place you want people to " check back often and see what ’s new " and where people are either in or out .
I ’ve gotten a bunch of invitations to feature my RSS feed on other people ’s sites lately .
At first , it feels a little weird … my content on your site .
But then , once I get past issues re endorsement etc. , it makes perfect sense .
Because search and RSS have exploded the web .
( Tip to David Weinberger , twice in one day ) .
It ’s no longer an organic web filled with organisms or even a molecular one .
It ’s atomic .
Each page on its own , each RSS drip its own entity .
The punchline is that you can wish all you want , it ’s not going to make search go away .
Wishing is not much of a business strategy , and the realists among us will probably focus on three things :
turn your website inside out as fast as you can .
That means RSS everywhere –in and out .
And it means encouraging your readers to flip the funnel .
continue integrating your pages into your site , but prepared to do a better job of integrating your pages into the web .
remember that every single page is now a landing page .
" First time here ? " is going to be answered yes more often than not in an atomic world .
What has n’t changed is an imperative to get active , explicit permission from one - time visitors to have an ongoing dialogue .
A dialogue that is anticipated , personal and relevant , and that leads to turning those strangers into friends … so that one day , they become customers .
Clues left in the clumsily encrypted notes of a Mafia don have helped Italian investigators to track his associates and ultimately contributed to his capture after years on the run .
The recently busted Bernardo Provenzano , reputed to be the " boss of bosses " of the Sicilian Mafia , used a modified form of the Caesar cipher to obscure " sensitive information " in notes left to either his family or underlings .
According to a biography ( written by Italian journalists Salvo Palazzolo and Ernesto Oliva ) on bernardoprovenzano.net , the content of these notes varied from meal requests to his family to orders to his lieutenants where numbers were used to disguise people 's names .
Provenzano , 73 , was arrested last week in a farm close to his home town of Corleone on the Italian island of Sicily after almost 40 years on the run .
He 's accused of numerous homicides including the 1992 murder of two judges , a crime that earned him a life sentence in absentia .
Provenzano who earned the nickname Binnu u tratturi ( Binnu the tractor ) because of his rep for mowing down enemies , latterly took to writing instructions incorporating basic encryption on small scraps of paper , known locally as pizzini .
The classic Caesar cipher moves every letter in the alphabet three charecters later ( so A becomes D and B becomes E , etc . ) .
The so - called Binnu code assigns a number in order to each letter in the Italian alphabet and adds three to that number in the ciphertext so that " A " is 4 , " B " is 5 and so on .
The code would have been more secure if the numerical shift applied to the ciphertext was varied from time to time .
As it was , the contents of messages was readily deciphered .
" Looks like kindergarten cryptography to me .
It will keep your kid sister out , but it wo n't keep the police out .
But what do you expect from someone who is computer illiterate ? " security guru Bruce Schneier told Discovery News .
Provenzano left school aged only eight , a factor which might explain the simplistic nature of the way sensitive messages , normally typed out on old typewriters , were encoded .
The decipherment of the pizzini sent and received by Provenzano allowed police to identify his associates and ultimately contributed to investigative efforts that led to Provenzano 's arrest , Discovery News reports . ®

The trials successfully transmitted data from sky to Earth
Airships in the stratosphere beaming back broadband capable of speeds up to 120 M bps may seem like fantasy .
But tests in Sweden have suggested it could become a reality within three to five years .
A successful trial of the technology has been conducted by researchers , led by the University of York in the UK .
Trials using a 12,000 cubic metre balloon , flying at an altitude of around 24 kilometres for nine hours , have proved it can successfully operate a data rate link of 11 Mbps .
" Proving the ability to operate a high data rate link from a moving stratospheric balloon is a critical step in moving towards the longer term aim of providing data rates of 120 Mbps , " said Dr David Grace , the project 's principal scientific officer .
Broadband on the move
The Capanina research consortium consists of 14 worldwide partners , including BT 's research wing , and is partly funded by the European Union .
The radio link equipment was developed by the University of York
Broadband via telephone lines has speed limitations while satellite is expensive and can support only a limited number of users .
Balloons hovering in the stratosphere could become an attractive alternative as consumers demand ever higher bandwidth , said Alan Gobbi , the marketing manager of the York Electronic Centre .
The centre is the commercial unit of the University of York and the body charged with co-ordinating the project .
" One business model could be an alternative to wired access in suburban areas where costs of roll out are high .
It could be offered on high - speed trains and in remote areas , " he told the BBC News website .
Stacked up against satellite the cost is likely to be attractive , he said .
" The launch cost of the infrastructure is likely to be one - tenth that of satellite and one airship can support a user density one thousands times that of satellite , " he said .
During the trials , the researchers managed to send data via wi- fi at at distances ranging up to 60 kilometres .
Trials of the technology will continue in Japan next year .

Hizbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been named the most popular figure in the Middle East in an Egyptian poll .
Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal took second place and Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad third , said Saadeddin Ibrahim of the Ibn Khaldoun Centre for Development Studies .
Researchers asked about 1,200 people from a range of backgrounds in 15 of Egypt 's 26 governorates to rank a list of 30 prominent people in the Middle East including writers , politicians , judges , statesmen and religious scholars .
People slavering to get Apple 's " impossibly small " iPod Nano into their sticky hands may want to pause a moment : those ahead of them in the queue have discovered that it's also unbelievably easy to scratch the screen , nixing its photo - displaying abilities .
Apple 's discussion forums are already host to a 188 - post thread on the topic , where people have spotted that the plastic used for the screen and front of the product is as sensitive as a Kate Moss sponsor .
Trouble is that a few scratches will quickly make the colour screen all but useless for viewing album art and photos stored on the machine .
In which case you might as well have bought the cheaper , screenless iPod shuffle , hmm ?
When the point was put to the head of Apple 's iPod division , Jon Rubenstein - who in the past oversaw the development of the Titanium PowerBook - the one that killed off Wi -Fi reception , because metal cages do that - he replied : " Nah , you do n't really think that ?
It 's made of the hardest polycarbonate ...
You keep it in a pocket with your keys ? "
Actually , not so for owners we 've heard from .
" I found that my black 4GB Nano scratched within minutes after peeling off the protective wrapper and wiping it with a cotton T - shirt .
I put it in a pocket just once and it was inside the soft case that came with my third - gen iPod , " comments poster number 188 in that monster Apple thread .
He 's hardly alone : Register reader Matt Baker says " the plastic on the front panel scratches insanely easily " , and comments that that hardly makes sense , " especially for a device that 's sold in a large amount based on its appearance , and that launched at least a month before any cases for it will be available .
Mine has lived either on a work surface , in a shirt pocket on its own , or ( as demonstrated by Steve Jobs to be a suitable place when he launched it ) in the change pocket of my jeans , again on its own . "
You 'll also find plenty of irked people at Macintouch ( search for " scratch " ) who 've rushed out , as commanded , to snap them up only to find that they 're squinting through some sort of fog to see the song name .
So what 's gone wrong ?
Although Apple 's award - winning designer Jonathan Ive has improved various things about the iPod Nano over its predecessor - for example , the scroll wheel has texture , making it easier to use - he seems to have overlooked how people really use them .
Consumer gear has to live in pockets with change and keys .
Only the polycarbonate survive , or something like that .
Apple had similar problems with its ill - fated Cube , where some developed cracks in the plastic moulding - though Apple tried very hard to insist this was n't so .
The difference here though is that the Cube sold dismally , so nobody cared .
Much more is riding on the success of the Nano .
Matt Baker , who bought his Nano at the Apple Store in Regent Street , said he went back and found that the assistant manager was " ( a ) fairly apologetic and ( b ) seemed to have been fielding the same comments all day , and getting rather fed up of them !
He said there 's no official company policy at the moment on the scratching , but that it is obviously an issue ' just from looking at mine ' , and that they 'll swap it for me with no problems if I bring the whole thing back " .
So if you see a long queue , it might be the returns .
In the meantime , any Nano buyers are warned to leave the sticky plastic over the screen , if they want to keep seeing what 's on it .
But perhaps this is just another step in the dastardly master plan .
Next step , the diamond iPod , sold with the slogan " Impossible hard to scratch ? " ®
The Open Source Elephant in the room : the source sucks Firstly , since I 'm about to slam Free and Open Source Software let me point out that I am not a Microsoft fan boy , that I use Firefox , Thunderbird , Ubuntu , EMACS , all the GNU tools , the GIMP , Apache , TRAC , OpenOffice , etc. on a daily basis .
I live and work on FOSS .
But there 's a real problem with most FOSS : for something that prides itself on the source being readable by everyone , and even cames up with ' laws ' like ' given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow ' , the actual source code of most FOSS is horrible , unreadable , garbage .
Actually , I wonder if ' Linus ' Law ' should n't actually be something like ' Linus ' Necessity ' : given that the source is so horrible we need lots of people so that one of them will be able to figure out what the hell it was we wrote .
When I started my
The second thing turned out to be really important for two reasons : firstly , other people were able to read my code and contribute and I kept them to a similar coding standard and style and hence the code is ( reasonably , I 'm not claiming I 'm perfect ) readable .
Perhaps more importantly one day I was being interviewed for a job and the interviewer said : " Yes , we 've all read your code " .
They 'd downloaded my project and checked me out .
( I got the job ) .
Now , I 'm not trying to slam all FOSS here and for the purposes of this entry I have not examined some of the most famous projects ( e.g. Linux kernel , Apache , Firefox , ... ) , but I decided to take a look at the
Then I would pick at random two source files ( each source file had to be fairly large , i.e. more than 100 lines of code ) and score them being as generous as possible using the following categories and assigned a score to each .
I weighted the scores heavily towards doing simple things that have a high benefit ( for example , describing the purpose of a file of function ) :
File Description ( FD ) : did the file I open have some sort of description ( near the top ) of what the purpose of the file was for .
I was n't asking for a detailed explanation , but just a little helper so that a new reader could get going on the purpose .
Score : +5 ( if present ) , - 5 ( if not )

Score : +5 ( if present ) , - 5 ( if not ) Function / Interface Description ( FID ) : did any of the functions , or interfaces , in the file have a description .
I would have liked to have seen all the arguments specified and return codes and caveats explained , but I was extremely generous : even if one function had a little header with a minimal description of the function it got into this category .

A positive score here was for particularly well documented , and written code , neutral for most code and negative for really hideous stuff .
Score : +10 ( loved it ) , - 10 ( yuck ) , 0 ( in general )
Of the top 50 projects one ( XAMPP ) was excluded because it's a distribution of other code and not new code .
What I found was not a pretty picture :
65 % do n't bother describing even in the most minimal way even one of the functions I saw
60 % of the projects do n't bother with describing the purpose of a file
59 % of the projects scored negatively using my system
53 % contained useless comments
40 % looked incomprehensible to me without major effort
33 % contained commented out or # if 0 code
There was one bright spot : 85 % contained at least one useful comment .
But given that my percentages underestimate the problems ( because I was very generous ) these figures are horrible .
The best projects were ( in order of score ) : GNUWin32 ( thanks GNU Project ! ) , GTK + and The GIMP installers for Windows , NASA World Wind , Ghostscript , WINE , Miranda , MinGW ( thanks GNU Project ! ) , Erases , and DC ++.
Come on FOSS people .
Have some pride in your work !
Remember , writing some decent comments is a gift you are given to people who read your code , and to yourself .
( Note that if you are the author of one of the projects above it 's possile that I made a mistake and just happened to pick the wrong files to read .
Send me examples of how great your code is and I 'll publish a rebuttal here ) .

Carl Sjogreen delivered an extremely informative talk about how they built Google Calendar .
He covers everything from the initial customer interviews and research , to the vision they established for the product , the development iterations they went through , the launch and post - launch reflection .
I had a couple of questions that there were n’t time for and I ’ve thrown those in the end in case Carl comes across this and can answer then .
Here are my detailed notes …
— — — — ——
–
How did we build Google Calendar ?
Quick Demo
Manage your own personal schedule and share it with other people
Moved a lot of desktop metaphors and moved them to the web .
Invested a lot in this .
Also invested a lot in natural language ( quickadd )
Also focused a lot on sharing
In the beginning …
– a largely classic Google product team
– 1 product manager and 3 engineers
– Origin was from both customer feedback and internal interest
– Seemed like a space with little innovation — nothing out there was “ right ” –> exactly the kind of opportunity Google looks for
Okay now I ’ve got a team and a vague idea : “ Google should do something in the Calendar space ” What next ?
— — —-
The Road to Google Calendar : Talking to Customers
– First thing ’s first — go talk to “ real ” customers
– sounds cliche but it ’s amazing how little it ’s really done
– real customers , not your silicon valley geek buddies
– Spoke to many people , sometimes even in their homes
– students , families , schools , working couples , PTA organizers
– tried to find a whole spectrum of different technical backgrounds
– keep probing : busy is not the same as “ needs a calendar ”
– Key themes emerged quickly :
– Calendars are necessary but just a chore
– calendars are personal and emotional
– calendar “ collaboration ” is just too hard
—
I interview a lot of product managers and one of my favorite interview questions is :
How do you go from an idea to a product ?
One of the things that a lot of people miss is establishing a vision .
This is the thing that says that if we do n’t get anything else right , this is what we ’re going to do well .
Our Vision
– Set out to build a calendar that works for you
– fast , visually appealing and joyous to use
– drop dead simple to get information into the calendar
– more than boxes on a screen ( reminders , invitations , etc . )
– easy to share so you can see your whole life in one place
– Designed for a consumer world where not everyone has a calendar ( or one on the same system )
– open APIs ( import and publish )
– invitations for everyone
— — — — — — ——
–
The Road to Google Calendar : Development
– Vision in hand , we set off to turn an idea into reality
– Lots and lots of prototyping
– PHP , MySQL , no Google infrastructure
– relatively easy to get basic system up and running : details are hard
– focused on getting interactions and user model right before thinking about scale ( a significant challenge for us )
– Internal Use : Pros & Cons
– Got a ton of great feedback from other Googlers
– Got the interaction basics right & generated a lot of feature ideas
– However , keep in mind that your early user might be not your target users
— — — — — — ——
–
Once we felt we had it mostly right , worked on making it real
– backend infrastructure designed for scale ( ie “ Google Infrastructure ” )
– front - end / UI rewrite to pixel perfect mocks + static HTML
– doing all the hard parts ( recurrences , parsing icals , API testing , interop , etc . )
Worked on our UI design in stages as well
– Get the interactions down and try them out
– Focus on the look & feel while engineers are making it real
– Save the pixel pushing ( fine alignment on the user interface ) for when you know you have it right
— — — — — — ——
–
Private betas are a good thing
– Even with all of our internal testing we learned a ton from testing with a small group of “ real users ”
– Quickadd improvements ( being smart is n’t always the best )
– Underestimated the importance of import
– Fixed a bunch of issues with SMS alerts ( tough to test because of all the carriers )
– Better support for small screens ( screen density was really important )
Launch day : 4/12/2006
– Flipped the switch , and did n’t sleep for the next 36 hours !
6 key insights that might be useful for your next product or company
1. Easy is the most important feature
– “ simple things should be simple and complex things should be possible ” ALan Kay , Disney
– Always have an eye on the minimum useful feature set that most people will use
– talk to grandma in NYC
– a mother loved quickadd ( & then prints out the calendar for the fridge )
– Product usage tracks directly to how easy a feature is to find & use
– creating calendars = easy
– finding calendars = not easy enough
– Figure out what you absolutely have to get right and relentlessly refine it
– Redesigned the “ event page ” at least 3 times
– Kept adding new ways to get events into the system up until days before we launched
– Do n’t spend too much time on less importnat area
– Know where you ’ll get the most bang for the buck
2 . Know your real competition
– know what your real competition does well
– we spent a lot of time looking at the market — online and desktop
– but the competition that keeps me up at night is paper
– ~6 billion people in the world , all who have things going on in their lives
– ~300 billion desktop calendars
– Non-tech and low - tech mechanisms are the way that most people communicate and interact
– email vs. evite
– notepad vs. tada lists
– the ktichen calendar vs. google calendar
– paper has a bunch of great advantages that you need to beat
– easy to carry with you
– does n’t require boot time
– does n’t require a login
– focus on removing the hurdles to adoption
– import , offline , mobile , etc .
– mimic the flexibility of paper
– focus on what the web can do that paper can ’t
– collaboration
– access from anywhere
3. Visual design matters
“ Great Design ” it ’s that ineffeable quality that certain incredibly successful product have that makes people fall in love with them desptie their flaws . ”
– Joel Spolsky
– great design = usability + visual joy
– ipod vs. everyone else
4. Build products for people who do n’t want to use them
– Not everyone who can benefit from your service actually wants to use it
– change behaviour and workflows are very hard
– Need to make it as easy as possible for people to use your product with as little work as possible
– Get your product in front of the applications people use every day
– And then make it painless for peopel to start using your product without fully switching into a new way of doing things
– Google Personalized Module is a great way to get traffic , by the way … they get a ton of traffic from there .
5 . Timing launch properly
– launch early and often is the mantra of web companies
– it IS a fundamental structural differences that sets web companies apart from packaged software
– However the old adage of “ you can only launch once ” still applies
– leverage internal testing and private betas to get feedback early , but …
– make sure that you have something worthwhile once you land on digg / techcrunch / etc .
– launching is hard to do ( it ’s never an easy call )
– in our case , expectations were very high
– should we have waited for sync for example
– ask yourself if you could really …
6. Driving usage
– We have a steady rate of new users signing up daily with very little marketing
– How ?
Made it easy for there to be touchpoints everywhere .
( buttons on 3rd party sites , send invites , etc. : many touchpoints ) )
– Think about how your product can generate touchpoints that eten beyond your app [ ( and make iteasy to do so )
– social reinforcement is key for validation
– relentlessly remove account sign - ups
– this is pretty obvious but it was surprising to me how much of a barrier accounts can be

My questions
— WHAT PERIOD OF TIME DID THIS SPAN ?
— HOW MANY PEOPLE OVER THE SPAN OF THE PROJECT ?
— HOW WERE DECISIONS MADE ON UI ?
— WERE THERE OTHER PRODUCT MANAGERS LIKE YOU THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR PORTIONS OF THE EXPERIENCE ?
Im August 2004 gab es ausgesprochen negative Schlagzeilen für Linux .
Die Stadt München stoppte eine wichtige Maßnahme ihrer geplanten Migration von Windows auf Linux , die weltweit für Aufsehen sorgte .
Es bedurfte eines anwaltlichen Gutachtens , das darlegte , dass die Aussichten , patentrechtliche Schwierigkeiten zu bekommen , bei Linux und anderen Open - Source - Produkten nicht größer seien als bei anderer Software .
Oberbürgermeister Christian
Ude konnte an seiner erklärten Absicht festhalten , die Migration durchzuziehen .
Sie läuft seither weiter , aber mit Verzögerungen .
Jetzt ist bekannt geworden , wie es zur Krise des Projekts " Limux " kam .
Es steht in einem vorab veröffentlichten Kapitel aus einem Buch von Florian Müller , das demnächst erscheinen wird : " Die Lobbyschlacht um Softwarepatente " .
Müller berichtet , dass er im Sommer 2004 in größten Schwierigkeiten war , für die von ihm maßgeblich initiierte Kampagne gegen die geplante Patentrichtlinie der EU genügend öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit und damit politische Kraft zu bekommen .
" Eine richtige Krise musste her , und zwar sofort . "
Er fand Hilfe bei der Fraktion der Grünen im Münchner Stadtrat .
Diese stellte eine offizielle Anfrage an Ude , ob Patente die geplante Linux - Migration gefährden könnten .
Wilhelm Hoegner , Leiter des Amts für Datenverarbeitung der Stadt München , reagierte mit einer E - Mail auf einer Mailing - Liste des Limux - Projekts .
Darin hieß es unter anderem : " Aufgrund der zu prüfenden Fragen wurde die eigentlich für Ende Juli geplante Ausschreibung des Limux - Basis - Clients gestoppt .
Zunächst wird die Verwaltung die rechtlichen und finanziellen Risiken versuchen abzuschätzen , bevor das Verfahren weitergeht . "
Müller verbreitete am nächsten Morgen eine Pressemitteilung mit dem Titel " EU - Softwarepatente : München legt Linux - Projekt auf Eis " .
Darin hieß es ferner : " Die Entscheidung der Stadt München sollte alle Alarmsirenen in der Bundesregierung schrillen lassen .
Das Bundesinnenministerium empfiehlt allen öffentlichen Verwaltungen den Umstieg auf Linux , und das Bundesjustizministerium macht das Ganze zu einer Fehlentscheidung , die Milliarden von Euro kosten kann . "
Müller hatte seine Krise : Die Münchner Linux - Migration hatte in der Presse schon große Aufmerksamkeit gefunden ; mit ihr hatte Müller seine Kampagne gegen Softwarepatente erfolgreich verknüpft .
Außer dem Stopp der Linux - Migration kam die Frage der Softwarepatente in die Schlagzeilen .
Doch es hagelte auch Kritik am Vorgehen Müllers .
So kritisierten Open - Source - Aktivisten , er habe eine wichtige Referenzinstallation für Linux in Gefahr gebracht .
Das kurzzeitige Zurückzucken der Münchner IT - Verantwortlichen habe Bedenken gegen Linux Nahrung gegeben .
Insgesamt sei Firmen , deren Geschäft Open Source ist , in München und anderswo Schaden zugefügt worden .
Müller habe also unverantwortlich gehandelt , um für sein Anliegen Aufmerksamkeit zu gewinnen .
In seinem Buch verteidigt Müller seine Aktivitäten .
Unter anderem erklärt er : " In gewisser Weise war die Aufregung um Limux ein Sturm im Wasserglas , da die Stadt München ihr Migrationsprojekt fortsetzte , aber der Durchbruch in den Medien hatte nachhaltige Auswirkungen auf die Debatte über Softwarepatente . "
Andere meinen , Müller sei nur knapp dem zweifelhaften Verdienst entgangen , das Limux - Projekt zu Fall gebracht zu haben .
Zu seinem Glück hat München mit Christian Ude einen Oberbürgermeister , der sich nicht von seinem Entschluss abbringen ließ , die Linux - Migration durchzuführen .
Das hatte zuvor nicht einmal Microsoft - Boss Steve Ballmer mit einem persönlichen Besuch bei Ude geschafft .

For a good 75 years , the Republican Party has been the party of conservatism , the anointed vehicle for the hopes and dreams of those who believe in limited government and seek to preserve the legacy of the Founding Fathers .
No more .
It has n’t been true for quite a while , but at least the Republicans were rhetorically committed to conservative principles right up until the second Bush presidency .
George W. campaigned on a platform that old - time conservatives found at least recognizable : he opined that Americans ought to be able to keep a larger proportion of their income than the Clinton regime found permissible , and even on foreign affairs he sounded like a Taft Republican of the old school , promising a more " humble " foreign policy .
How far we have wandered off that road !
Under George W. Bush , today ’s GOP is in the vanguard of the biggest expansion of governmental power since 27 B.C. , the year Octavian was crowned with laurel leaves in the Roman Senate , and the yeoman ’s republic on the Tiber morphed into an Empire .
Government spending has not only increased , it has engulfed us in a veritable tidal wave of unsustainable debt and force - marched us to the brink of bankruptcy .
More ominously , the coercive power of government has expanded exponentially , and basic civil liberties  the right to a fair trial , the right to be secure in our own homes , the right to speak out against government policies without being harassed , spied on , and otherwise encumbered by said government  are in danger .
If , on the home front , the Republicans represent a brazen authoritarianism that seeks the overthrow of the Constitution , on the foreign policy front they are also revolutionaries .
Professor Claes Ryn , the noted conservative scholar and past president of the Philadelphia Society , calls them " Jacobins , " after the French revolutionaries who sent so many of their enemies to the guillotine .
The Jacobins sought the revolutionary transformation of society via a purifying violence , and their brief rule was a paroxysm of nihilistic carnage unprecedented in the history of European nations .
The neoconservatives , with their self - proclaimed objective of " creative destruction , " are playing a similarly sadistic game in the Middle East today .
Having seized the reins of government in Washington and commandeered the U.S. military in the service of their hubris , the neocons are on the march , like Orcs gathering at Isengard , shrieking their war cries and shaking their spears  first at Iraq , and now at Iran .
I wo n’t go into the history of how the neocons migrated from the Democratic Party to the GOP , since that subject has been covered , here and elsewhere , in mind - numbing detail .
Everybody knows about the neocons by now : Alcove B , the Trotskyist Irving Kristol and his fellow apostates , James Burnham and Max Shachtman , the infiltration of the Democratic Party by Shachtman and his confreres , and their effective control over the so - called " Scoop " Jackson wing of the party .
Their own whining and complaining memoirs , of which there are far too many , have informed us of their reasons for abandoning their historic home and migrating to the GOP .
It was the Vietnam War , and the whole issue of what foreign policy is best suited to the U.S. , that precipitated their break with the mainstream of their party .
The neocons  grouped around Commentary magazine , and , in the alternate universe of left - liberal politics , around Social Democrats , USA  stomped out of the Democratic Party when that party rejected the failed policies of Lyndon Baines Johnson .
In rallying around the candidacy of Eugene McCarthy , and later , George McGovern , the party ’s activist core rejected the Cold War liberalism that had prompted John F. Kennedy to mount the Bay of Pigs invasion  and vaingloriously declare that we would " pay any price , bear any burden " in the service of an interventionist foreign policy devoted to upholding " freedom " around the world .
Boring old hypocrites like Hubert Horatio Humphrey  a hero to the neocons  foundered on the rocks of the Vietnam conflict , and the pro-war AFL - CIO , long a bastion of neocon- Shachtmanite influence , had already passed the apex of its power .
Their policies discredited , their political fortunes in ruins , the neocons retreated to the tall grass and regrouped to fight another day .
The first stage of their strategy for a protracted conflict was a complete ideological makeover , a radical transfiguration that would catapult them to the opposite side of the political spectrum  but without , of course , in any way altering their core principle : devotion to the cult of the war god .
Militarism , not only as a foreign policy but as the organizing principle of the domestic order , is the central doctrine of the neoconservative creed , and they have never betrayed it no matter what their party registration .
The neocons , in their takeover of what used to be the conservative movement , have Prussianized the GOP .
The movement of Taft and Goldwater , of the Chambers of Commerce and the Rotarians of the old America where prudence and modesty , rather than revolution and grandiosity , were in style , is no more .
In its place is a party that stands for what the neocons call " national greatness , " which derides prudence as cowardice , and knows nothing of modesty .
Their role model is no longer Barry Goldwater , who questioned such government - guaranteed entitlements as Social Security , but Otto von Bismarck , whose name is a byword for militarism  and who introduced a government welfare scheme similar to our own Social Security system well before the New Deal came to America .
For libertarians , the GOP is a total loss : like the neocons and the old " Scoop Jackson " Democrats , they are bad on everything , including domestic policy .
Today , whatever skeptics of the government ’s power to effect positive change , at home and abroad , still exist inside the Republican Party are lonely guardians of a nearly forgotten tradition .
This is the party of Big Government , and Big Ambitions overseas : in the new Bushian GOP we are witnessing the triumph of " National Greatness " Republicanism .
Gone is the plain , republican cloth coat : in its place GOPers flaunt the imperial purple .
Libertarians no longer have any place in the GOP coalition , and any who remain will have long since betrayed their ostensible devotion to liberty .
The Republican Party is today hopelessly authoritarian .
Maddened by war , its leaders are so corrupted by power and their desperation to hold on to it , that they will resort to any tactic , any subterfuge , no matter how contemptible and / or self - defeating .
A good example is their secret funding of the campaign of Democrat Joe Lieberman against their own candidate for U.S. Senate in Connecticut .
As Insight magazine reports , the GOP ’s Karl Rove steered millions of dollars from big Republican contributors into Lieberman ’s coffers .
Lieberman , an advocate of Big Government and out - of - control spending if ever there was one , supported the president on the Iraq war question and has signed on to the campaign to provoke a similar conflict with Iran .
His defeat in the Democratic primary at the hands of Ned Lamont was a big blow to the War Party .
It marked the effective end of neoconservative influence within the party of Jefferson , and represented a real setback for the neocon strategy of effectively controlling the foreign policy stances of both major parties  a maneuver that has worked well in peacetime , but is always frayed as the consequences of our interventionist policies come back to haunt us in the form of body bags .
Republican support for a dyed - in - the - wool statist like Lieberman is proof positive that the GOP leadership could care less about their ostensible principles when it comes to domestic policy .
In truth , they care about one issue and one issue only : the war , including the one to come .
In supporting Lieberman , they are , in effect , saying : To hell with less government .
We ’ll settle for more war !
As Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos , the founding father of " netroots " Democratic activism , has said , there is room for libertarians in the Democratic Party  and especially now , when the Libertarian Party has thrown its wonderful platform overboard and adopted a self - consciously " pragmatic " stance that has rendered it indistinguishable from the majors .
If anyone is skeptical of government power and its dangerous increase in the era of Bush , he or she is probably a Democrat .
This skepticism of government power is particularly sharp when it comes to critiquing American foreign policy .
Although there is a growing contingent of Republican critics of the war , in Congress and among the ranks , the Democratic Party activists who are the most energized are solidly opposed to our presence in Iraq .
Significantly , many are extending their critique of intervention in that particular instance to a more generalized skepticism of our power to democratize the world at gunpoint .
This doubt of military power abroad is bound , in many cases , to translate into a similarly jaundiced view of the promiscuous employ of government coercion on the home front .
Not always , but often  and certainly more often , as the years of the " war on terrorism " drag on and the proto - fascist Republicans launch fresh assaults on civil liberties .
The sad decline of the GOP into a party that could credibly be described as scary , if not outright fascist , is bound to depress many longtime Republicans , particularly those with libertarian inclinations .
Yet I would not linger over this gravestone too long , mourning the demise of a tradition remembered by few .
And it is n’t all bad news , either .
The good news is that the American people are not going to look with favor on a party that stands for perpetual war and eternal debt .
Against all evidence and common sense , Republican leaders defend a war that has rightly been called the biggest strategic disaster in our history , one that even a full third of GOP voters reject as not worth fighting .
Against the principles of their modern leaders and their own platform , they are the biggest promoters and enablers of government expansionism , a trend that has provoked a rebuke even from Republican Sen .
Chuck Hagel , a potential presidential candidate and GOP stalwart with impeccable conservative credentials .
Republicans are headed for a drubbing at the polls , and it could n’t have happened to a more deserving party .
Ever since the neocon takeover of this administration , they have been headed for disaster , and now that it is finally striking I just want to sit back and enjoy the spectacle of their extended and agonizing demise .
That ’s right , " stay the course , " guys !
Until you fall right into that inviting abyss
With the single exception of Las Vegas , no city proper makes the list of substantial gainers ; American taxpayers by and large are outward bound .
But this is n't uniformly a migration to exurbs , or to traditional Sunbelt or Western destinations like Florida or Arizona .
The trails often lead north , to the lakes of Minnesota and Wisconsin ; to the foothills of northern Georgia ; to the forests of northern California ; to the fields of northern Michigan .
Cass County , Minn. , 120 miles from Minneapolis , is on the list , as is Shasta County , Calif. , 180 miles from San Francisco .
While Michigan , hard hit by auto industry cuts , is losing population overall , six of its counties are among the top gainers .
Yet the logic is not obscure :
The new destinations are precisely the places , like Archer County , that have been undervalued — whether by industry or agriculture or mass leisure or urban flight .
They are the places where you can still get something that feels like a good life , without the salary of a chief executive .
" South of the Twin Cities , it 's much richer soil , and more intense farming , and the land prices are high , " said Marty Ringham , a real estate agent who lives 80 miles north of Minneapolis in the heart of a remote boom area .
" Here the soil has more clay content , and the agricultural value is not so high .
It 's not an exact science , but we figure that the same house is about $ 1,200 cheaper for every mile you go north . "
We may be two peoples separated by a common language , as Shaw once suggested , but the US propensity to find teeth - grindingly literal explanations for the world around us never ceases to cause the British mirth .
The caricature of a fearful United States where every I must be dotted , and every T must be crossed , where coffee cups warn the the user of hot liquids inside , and where blogs are tattooed with incomprehensible license terms , is n't just the stuff of myth , however .
This nit -picking has become the foundation of the nation , one that pitches the established class of nit-pickers ( the lawyers ) against a new breed of nit-pickers ( the technocrats ) .
But few stories illustrate this derangement are well as the bizarre - but true - story we bring you here .
Bear with us .
The United States takes the separation of church and state ( and body and mind ) with a scary earnestness , so although it 's nominally a Christian country , the Christian time of celebration is formally celebrated through a complicated euphemism .
Here , it 's called " the Holiday Season " .
Is n't that a tautology ?
Hush for a moment .
Being the land of untrammeled commerce , this also throws up a few anomalies .
For example , the uptown department store Macy 's currently offers what the British call Christmas Trees ( here they 're called " Holiday Decorations " ) in a variety of pre-themed categories such as the South Park™ - theme and the Barbi™ - theme .
But we digress .
In a sphincters - held - tight culture such as this , little things mean a lot , so when the giant US big box retailer Wal - Mart recently changed a greeting from " Merry Christmas ! " to " Happy Holidays ! " it drew complaints .
And here the troubles began .
The emails duly arrived , and a customer - facing rep took it on herself to explain the change with this ill - advised exhibition of learning .
The employee , who we know only as Kirby , launched into a fantastically earnest historical explanation of what the Christmas Holiday Season™ really meant .
" Christmas is actually a continuation of the Siberian shaman and Visigoth traditions , " Kirby replied .
" Santa is also borrowed from the [ Caucasus ] , mistletoe from the Celts , yule log from the Goths , the time from the Visigoth and the tree from the worship of Baal .
It is a wide wide world , " the helpful Kirby replied , making sure every I was dotted and every T crossed .
All of which is true , but as you can imagine , these were n't exactly the soothing words the complainer wanted to hear .
The Wal - Mart punter simply wanted a reassuring pat , a promise that this sudden switch from religious to secular , did n't actually mean aliens had landed .
And she got fairly firm confirmation that aliens had not only landed , but - Worship of Baal ??
- actually had their scaly alien tentacles manning the tills .
Yikes !
What 's a god - fearing literalist to do , except call out the fire brigade ?
In this instance , it arrived in the form of Catholic League demagogue Bill Donohue .
A boycott was duly summoned , Wal - Mart relented , and heads rolled .
Kirby is no longer an Wal - Mart employee , we learn , which is a shame , as in her own painfully literal ( and right - on ) way , she was only trying to be helpful .
In a flash , the two worlds just shot past each other .
Integrating cultures is always messy , but it 's far from impossible , as the successes have proved .
France 's most notoriously " Arab " city , the port of Marseilles , escaped the recent riots unscathed and in Manchester , England the fireworks that mark Eid , the end of Ramadan , are celebrated by everyone .
As is Christmas .
The idea of a party seems to be universally understood - and when it is , recourse to weird schematas or diagrams simply does n't occur to anyone as an option , thankfully .
We just need to loosen a few sphincters , but the USA is a tense place these days . ®
Quickit
After Reddit was rewritten in Python , some Lisp fans got the idea of writing clones of Reddit in Lisp .
I do n't have many spare cycles right now , and I 'm not in the market for a long - term project , so I set myself a slightly different goal : I decided to implement the largest possible subset of Reddit 's features that I could within one hour .
I think I did an ok job , considering .
One hour passes by rather quickly when you try something like this !
Here 's the code :
quickit.asd
package.lisp
quickit.lisp
All the above code is released under the BSD license .
Update : After I put Quickit online , a bug was found : Ranking an article down , and then hitting reload would keep ranking that article down .
At first I was n't going to fix the bug .
The whole point of the Quickit was to write a clone very quickly .
Fixing bugs at this point felt wrong .
But I decided to set myself another challenge :
Fix the bug and deploy a patch onto the running Lisp process in less than five minutes ...
It actually took a little over a minute and a half to fix the bug and push the new code onto the server ( without , of course , stopping the Lisp process ) .
The patch ( to quickit.lisp ) is :
55,56c55,56 < ( format out " < a href=http://abstractnonsense.org:8000/rankdown?id=~A><img border=0 src=down.png ></a> < a href= \ " ~A\ " >~ A </a> ( score ~ A ) < br > " < ( article - id article ) ( article - url article ) ( article - description article ) ( article - score article ) ) ) ) ) --- > ( format out " < a href=http://abstractnonsense.org:8000/rankdown?from=~A&id=~A><img border=0 src=down.png ></a> < a href= \ " ~A\ " >~ A </a> ( score ~ A ) < br > " > ( article - score article ) ( article - id article ) ( article - url article ) ( article - description article ) ( article - score article ) ) ) ) )

I also moved Quickit from abstractnonsense.org to abstractnonsense.com ( actually the same machine ) because my dyndns entry for abstractnonsense.org mysteriously stopped working ... again , I did this without having to stop the process or lose any of the saved state .
New York State legislators defend the War Emergency Tenant Protection Act — also known as rent control — as a way of protecting tenants from war - related housing shortages .
The war referred to in the law is not the 2003 war in Iraq , however , or the Vietnam War ; it is World War II .
That is when rent control started in New York City .
Of course , war has very little to do with apartment shortages .
On the contrary , the shortage is created by rent control , the supposed solution .
Gotham is far from the only city to have embraced rent control .
Many others across the United States have succumbed to the blandishments of this legislative “ fix . ”
Rent control , like all other government - mandated price controls , is a law placing a maximum price , or a “ rent ceiling , ” on what landlords may charge tenants .
If it is to have any effect , the rent level must be set at a rate below that which would otherwise have prevailed .
( An enactment prohibiting apartment rents from exceeding , say , $ 100,000 per month would have no effect since no one would pay that amount in any case . )
But if rents are established at less than their equilibrium levels , the quantity demanded will necessarily exceed the amount supplied , and rent control will lead to a shortage of dwelling spaces .
In a competitive market and absent controls on prices , if the amount of a commodity or service demanded is larger than the amount supplied , prices rise to eliminate the shortage ( by both bringing forth new supply and by reducing the amount demanded ) .
But controls prevent rents from attaining market - clearing levels and shortages result .
With shortages in the controlled sector , this excess demand spills over onto the noncontrolled sector ( typically , new upper - bracket rental units or condominiums ) .
But this noncontrolled segment of the market is likely to be smaller than it would be without controls because property owners fear that controls may one day be placed on them .
The high demand in the noncontrolled segment along with the small quantity supplied , both caused by rent control , boost prices in that segment .
Paradoxically , then , even though rents may be lower in the controlled sector , they rise greatly for uncontrolled units and may be higher for rental housing as a whole .
As in the case of other price ceilings , rent control causes shortages , diminution in the quality of the product , and queues .
But rent control differs from other such schemes .
With price controls on gasoline , the waiting lines worked on a first - come - first - served basis .
With rent control , because the law places sitting tenants first in the queue , many of them benefit .
The Effects of Rent Control
Economists are virtually unanimous in concluding that rent controls are destructive .
In a 1990 poll of 464 economists published in the May 1992 issue of the American Economic Review , 93 percent of U.S. respondents agreed , either completely or with provisos , that “ a ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available . ”
Similarly , another study reported that more than 95 percent of the Canadian economists polled agreed with the statement .
The agreement cuts across the usual political spectrum , ranging all the way from Nobel Prize winners milton friedman and friedrich hayek on the “ right ” to their fellow Nobel laureate gunnar myrdal , an important architect of the Swedish Labor Party ’s welfare state , on the “ left . ”
Myrdal stated , “ Rent control has in certain Western countries constituted , maybe , the worst example of poor planning by governments lacking courage and vision . ”
His fellow Swedish economist ( and socialist ) Assar Lindbeck asserted , “ In many cases rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city — except for bombing . ”
That cities like New York have clearly not been destroyed by rent control is due to the fact that rent control has been relaxed over the years .
Rent stabilization , for example , which took the place of rent control for newer buildings , is less restrictive than the old rent control .
Also , the decades - long boom in the New York City housing market is not in rent - controlled or rent - stabilized units , but in condominiums and cooperative housing .
But these two forms of housing ownership grew important as a way of getting around rent control .
Economists have shown that rent control diverts new investment , which would otherwise have gone to rental housing , toward greener pastures — greener in terms of consumer need .
They have demonstrated that it leads to housing deterioration , fewer repairs , and less maintenance .
For example , Paul Niebanck found that 29 percent of rent - controlled housing in the United States was deteriorated , but only 8 percent of the uncontrolled units were in such a state of disrepair .
Joel Brenner and Herbert Franklin cited similar statistics for England and France .
The economic reasons are straightforward .
One effect of government oversight is to retard investment in residential rental units .
Imagine that you have five million dollars to invest and can place the funds in any industry you wish .
In most businesses , governments will place only limited controls and taxes on your enterprise .
But if you entrust your money to rental housing , you must pass one additional hurdle : the rent - control authority , with its hearings , red tape , and rent ceilings .
Under these conditions is it any wonder that you are less likely to build or purchase rental housing ?
This line of reasoning holds not just for you , but for everyone else as well .
As a result , the quantity of apartments for rent will be far smaller than otherwise .
And not so amazingly , the preceding analysis holds true not only for the case where rent controls are in place , but even where they are only threatened .
The mere anticipation of controls is enough to have a chilling effect on such investment .
Instead , everything else under the sun in the real estate market has been built : condominiums , office towers , hotels , warehouses , commercial space .
Why ?
Because such investments have never been subject to rent controls , and no one fears that they ever will be .
It is no accident that these facilities boast healthy vacancy rates and relatively slowly increasing rental rates , while residential space suffers from a virtual zero vacancy rate in the controlled sector and skyrocketing prices in the uncontrolled sector .
Although many rent - control ordinances specifically exempt new rental units from coverage , investors are too cautious ( perhaps too smart ) to put their faith in rental housing .
In numerous cases housing units supposedly exempt forever from controls were nevertheless brought under the provisions of this law due to some “ emergency ” or other .
New York City ’s government , for example , has three times broken its promise to exempt new or vacant units from control .
So prevalent is this practice of rent - control authorities that a new term has been invented to describe it : “ recapture . ”
Rent control has destroyed entire sections of sound housing in New York ’s South Bronx and has led to decay and abandonment throughout the entire five boroughs of the city .
Although hard statistics on abandonments are not available , William Tucker estimates that about 30,000 New York apartments were abandoned annually from 1972 to 1982 , a loss of almost a third of a million units in this eleven - year period .
Thanks to rent control , and to potential investors ’ all - too - rational fear that rent control will become even more stringent , no sensible investor will build rental housing unsubsidized by government .
Effects on Tenants
Existing rental units fare poorly under rent control .
Even with the best will in the world , the landlord sometimes cannot afford to pay his escalating fuel , labor , and materials bills , to say nothing of refinancing his mortgage , out of the rent increase he can legally charge .
And under rent controls he lacks the best will ; the incentive he had under free - market conditions to supply tenant services is severely reduced .
The sitting tenant is “ protected ” by rent control but , in many cases , receives no real rental bargain because of improper maintenance , poor repairs and painting , and grudging provision of services .
The enjoyment he can derive out of his dwelling space ultimately tends to be reduced to a level commensurate with his controlled rent .
This may take decades , though , and meanwhile he benefits from rent control .
In fact , many tenants , usually rich or middle - class ones who are politically connected or who were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time , can gain a lot from rent control .
Tenants in some of the nicest neighborhoods in New York City pay a scandalously small fraction of the market price of their apartments .
In the early 1980s , for example , former mayor Ed Koch paid $ 441.49 for an apartment then worth about $ 1,200.00 per month .
Some people in this fortunate position use their apartments like hotel rooms , visiting only a few times per year .
Then there is the “ old lady effect . ”
Consider the case of a two - parent , four - child family that has occupied a ten - room rental dwelling .
One by one the children grow up , marry , and move elsewhere .
The husband dies .
Now the lady is left with a gigantic apartment .
She uses only two or three of the rooms and , to save on heating and cleaning , closes off the remainder .
Without rent control she would move to a smaller accommodation .
But rent control makes that option unattractive .
Needless to say , these practices further exacerbate the housing crisis .
Repeal of rent control would free up thousands of such rooms very quickly , dampening the impetus toward vastly higher rents .
What determines whether or not a tenant benefits from rent control ?
If the building in which he lives is in a good neighborhood where rents would rise appreciably if rent control were repealed , then the landlord has an incentive to maintain the building against the prospect of that happy day .
This incentive is enhanced if there are many decontrolled units in the building ( due to “ vacancy decontrol ” when tenants move out ) or privately owned condominiums for which the landlord must provide adequate services .
Then the tenant who pays the scandalously low rent may “ free ride ” on his neighbors .
But in the more typical case the quality of housing services tends to reflect rental payments .
This , at least , is the situation that will prevail at equilibrium .
If government really had the best interests of tenants at heart and was for some reason determined to employ controls , it would do the very opposite of imposing rent restrictions : it would instead control the price of every other good and service available , apart from residential suites , in an attempt to divert resources out of all those other opportunities and into this one field .
But that , of course , would bring about full - scale socialism , the very system under which the Eastern Europeans suffered so grimly .
If the government wanted to help the poor and was for some reason constrained to keep rent controls , it would do better to tightly control rents on luxury unit rentals and to eliminate rent controls on more modest dwellings — the very opposite of the present practice .
Then , builders ’ incentives would be turned around .
Instead of erecting luxury dwellings , which are now exempt , they would be led , “ as if by an invisible hand , ” to create housing for the poor and middle classes .
Solutions
The negative consequences of rent legislation have become so massive and perverse that even many of its former supporters have spoken out against it .
Instead of urging a quick termination of controls , however , some pundits would only allow landlords to buy tenants out of their controlled dwellings .
That they propose such a solution is understandable .
Because tenants outnumber landlords and are usually convinced that rent control is in their best interests , they are likely to invest considerable political energy ( see Rent Seeking ) in maintaining rent control .
Having landlords “ buy off ” these opponents of reform , therefore , could be a politically effective way to end rent control .
But making property owners pay to escape a law that has victimized many of them for years is not an effective way to make them confident that rent controls will be absent in the future .
The surest way to encourage private investment is to signal investors that housing will be safe from rent control .
And the most effective way to do that is to eliminate the possibility of rent control with an amendment to the state constitution that forbids it .
Paradoxically , one of the best ways to help tenants is to protect the economic freedom of landlords .
Rent Control : It ’s Worse Than Bombing new delhi—A “ romantic conception of socialism ” … destroyed Vietnam ’s economy in the years after the Vietnam war , Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said Friday .
Addressing a crowded news conference in the Indian capital , Mr. Thach admitted that controls … had artificially encouraged demand and discouraged supply … .
House rents had … been kept low … so all the houses in Hanoi had fallen into disrepair , said Mr. Thach .
“ The Americans could n’t destroy Hanoi , but we have destroyed our city by very low rents .
We realized it was stupid and that we must change policy , ” he said .

Newswise —
The current warming trends in the Arctic may shove the Arctic system into a seasonally ice - free state not seen for more than one million years , according to a new report .
The melting is accelerating , and a team of researchers were unable to identify any natural processes that might slow the de-icing of the Arctic .
Such substantial additional melting of Arctic glaciers and ice sheets will raise sea level worldwide , flooding the coastal areas where many of the world 's people live .
Melting sea ice has already resulted in dramatic impacts for the indigenous people and animals in the Arctic , which includes parts of Alaska , Canada , Russia , Siberia , Scandinavia and Greenland .
" What really makes the Arctic different from the rest of the non-polar world is the permanent ice in the ground , in the ocean and on land , " said lead author University of Arizona geoscientist Jonathan T. Overpeck .
" We see all of that ice melting already , and we envision that it will melt back much more dramatically in the future as we move towards this more permanent ice - free state . "
The report by Overpeck and his colleagues is published in the Aug. 23 Eos , the weekly newspaper of the American Geophysical Union .
A complete list of authors and their affiliations is at the end of this release .
The report is the result of weeklong meeting of a team of interdisciplinary scientists who examined how the Arctic environment and climate interact and how that system would respond as global temperatures rise .
The workshop was organized by the NSF Arctic System Science Committee , which is chaired by Overpeck , director of the Institute for the Study of Planet Earth at The University of Arizona in Tucson .
The National Science Foundation funded the meeting .
The past climates in the Arctic include glacial periods , where sea ice coverage expanded and ice sheets extended into Northern America and Europe , and warmer interglacial periods during which the ice retreats , as it has during the past 10,000 years .
By studying natural data loggers such as ice cores and marine sediments , scientists have a good idea what the " natural envelope " for Arctic climate variations has been for the past million years , Overpeck said .
The team of scientists synthesized what is currently known about the Arctic and defined key components that make up the current system .
The scientists identified how the components interact , including feedback loops that involve multiple parts of the system .
" In the past , researchers have tended to look at individual components of the Arctic , " said Overpeck .
" What we did for the first time is really look at how all of those components work together . "
The team concluded that there were two major amplifying feedbacks in the Arctic system involving the interplay between sea and land ice , ocean circulation in the North Atlantic , and the amounts of precipitation and evaporation in the system .
Such feedback loops accelerate changes in the system , Overpeck said .
For example , the white surface of sea ice reflects radiation from the sun .
However , as sea ice melts , more solar radiation is absorbed by the dark ocean , which heats up and results in yet more sea ice melting .
While the scientists identified one feedback loop that could slow the changes , they did not see any natural mechanism that could stop the dramatic loss of ice .
" I think probably the biggest surprise of the meeting was that no one could envision any interaction between the components that would act naturally to stop the trajectory to the new system , " Overpeck said .
He added that the group investigated several possible braking mechanisms that had been previously suggested .
In addition to sea and land ice melting , Overpeck warned that permafrost — the permanently frozen layer of soil that underlies much of the Arctic — will melt and eventually disappear in some areas .
Such thawing could release additional greenhouse gases stored in the permafrost for thousands of years , which would amplify human - induced climate change .
Overpeck said humans could step on the brakes by reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" The trouble is we do n't really know where the threshold is beyond which these changes are inevitable and dangerous , " Overpeck said .

I 've been meaning to blog about Alexa for months .
As I have been tracking my clickstream with the AttentionTrust Firefox extension , I have come to realize that I use Alexa about as much as I use Google .
And as I thought about it , I realized that Alexa has become a critical tool for me as I try to understand what 's really happening on the Internet .
Whenever someone tells me about a web service , one of the first things I do is run an Alexa search on it , find out its traffic , what kind of people use it , etc .
Now I realize that Alexa 's utility to me is way larger than its utility to my daughter who generally does n't think of these services as an investment .
But I have continued to be amazed by the value that a free service like Alexa was providing to me and many others .
Well I never got around to blogging about Alexa , and now the secret is out .
Because Amazon ( which owns Alexa ) did something today with Alexa that is potentially game changing .
Alexa is making its index ( and the infrastructure behind its index ) available to anyone who wants to build a web service on top of it .
The most obvious application is search and that is where all the heat is in the blog world today .
Arrington comes up with the quote of the day ( as usual ) :
hopefully it will nudge some of the search players into realizing that they can be much more powerful by turning themselves into platforms rather than destinations
I go back to Mark Pincus ' rant on Google and GoogleBase where he said :
my take is google has chosen between two paths .
one which i thought they were on was to be a platform to enable great things on the web .
google could have powered everything with its search engine , ad infrastructure , massive crawling and computing power .
it could have been a democratizing force , enabling small services to flourish in being found and in serving them a platform on which to innovate .
The leaders always try to grab and consolidate market power .
The laggards are then forced to open things up .
Amazon is doing that today with it 's hidden jewel Alexa and I for one am thrilled to see it .
Mr. Greenfield , the Pali Capital analyst , says that these moves have potential  especially if MySpace can convince members to put clips from Fox movies , television programs and other youth - oriented " content " on their profile pages .
" I do n't know how big a business this can be , but it can clearly be a lot bigger than it is today , " he said .
" The question is : Can you take it to the next level by making a business that leverages all the consumers who are telling you what they want to do ? "
Another question is this :
Can the News Corporation achieve these goals if the executives in charge do n't agree on how to do so , or even on whether they want to ?
Mr. Levinsohn , for example , said he saw opportunity in the one million bands that have established profiles on MySpace ; he said MySpace could charge bands to promote concerts or to sell their songs directly through the site .
In an interview the next day , however , Mr. DeWolfe dismissed the idea .
" Music brings a lot of traffic into MySpace , " he said , " and it lets us sell very large sponsorships to those brands that want to reach consumers who are interested in music .
We never thought charging bands was a viable business model . "
Mr. Levinsohn brushed aside the discord , saying it was appropriate for the people running MySpace to be more concerned at this point about serving users than making money .
And , for now , Mr. DeWolfe and Mr. Anderson say they are happy working for the News Corporation and Mr. Murdoch , its 75 - year - old chairman and chief executive .
" Rupert Murdoch blew me away , " Mr. DeWolfe said .
" He really understands what youth is doing today . "
BY many accounts , the MySpace culture reflects the style of Mr. DeWolfe , who has a hard - nosed business approach under a laid - back exterior .
" Chris is a very strong personality , " said Geoff Yang , a partner in Redpoint Ventures , which invested in MySpace last year as part of an effort to separate it from Intermix ; the News Corporation 's acquisition of Intermix thwarted that effort .
" He will listen to a lot of ideas , make up his mind and be laser - focused to get a few of them done . "
Mr. DeWolfe , who focuses on business affairs , and Mr. Anderson , who designs features for the site , have deliberately kept MySpace rudimentary , with an almost homemade feeling , to give the most flexibility to users .
In spirit , the site reflects its Southern Californian home with all of its idiosyncratic performers , designers , demicelebrities and other cultural hustlers , many of whom the founders recruited to be early members .
Mr. DeWolfe , in particular , is a fan of Los Angeles nightlife and has become something of a public figure himself .
" Chris has become this living persona of MySpace , " said Mr. Brewer , who recalled a trip to Aspen , Colo. , with Mr. Anderson and Mr. DeWolfe last December .
" Chris is wearing an awesome leather jacket , some sort of designer shirt , with his hair all over the place .
He has this whole rock - star persona .
And you hear people going : ' Psst , psst .
That 's the MySpace guy . ' "
Important ourTunes info :
If ourTunes can see hosts , but the connection status says " Failed " , this is most likely because of the iTunes 7 .
Apple changed the authentication protocol used to connect to iTunes , so that ourTunes no longer works .
We 're working on this now , and hope to have a fix soon .
If ourTunes does n't see any hosts , make sure you 're not on a wireless network , that seems to give it some trouble .
If that does n't fix it , we 're sorry , we 're working on it .
You need to be on a network with other people who have iTunes sharing turned on for ourTunes to be at all useful
The search box is not enabled unless ourTunes sees at least one host
As for updates ... we 're swamped with work this quarter and probably wo n't be updating OT until mid-december ... this means passworded hosts are on hold for now ..
We 're also going to be really bad about responding to emails .. sorry , sorry
about responding to emails .. sorry , sorry
If you want to look at the ourTunes source , download the .jar and unzip it , either with the " jar " program that comes bundled with java , or rename it to a .zip and just use a standard unzip program .
All the source files are in there .
If you like it -- give us beer money , we 're broke college students
ourTunes has now hit over 3,000,000 downloads -- woo !
If you like it -- give us beer money , we 're broke college students if something 's broken , you can email us ( We 're going to be really bad about responding , though )

How will people remember 2013 ?
As the year of the government shutdown ?
The year the N.S.A. revealed that the enemy is us ?
The year Miley Cyrus absolutely , positively stopped playing an adorable child actress ?
In consumer tech , we may remember this as the year Bluetooth speakers finally outnumbered insects on the earth .
Every company and its brother has been cranking out compact , colorful , battery - powered wireless speakers .
And no wonder : these things really are awesome .
Every time some company offers a new tablet , laptop or phone , you can bet that it has a better , sharper , brighter screen — but what about the sound ?
It ’s stuck in 2004 : tinny and weak .
A Bluetooth speaker neatly remedies that enormous quality difference between audio and visual .
The Jawbone Jambox was one of the earliest hits .
It ’s a sharp - edged rectangular box , $ 150 , that comes in a choice of colors .
It pumps out surprisingly loud , clear sound — for its size , which is 6 by 1.6 by 2.8 inches .
Then came the Big Jambox , a shoebox - size $ 300 version with big enough sound for a backyard .
And now comes the Jambox Mini , at $ 180 .
I love this thing .
It ’s actually not all that mini ; in fact , it ’s about as long and tall as the original ( 6.1 by 2.3 inches ) — but it looks like someone sliced the original in half with a saber .

Perl One - Liner of the Month : The Mystery of the Red Worm
By Ben Okopnik
- " It 's just a little further along ... right through here , Frink . "
/var/log/ apache
" Ah , here we are - there 's ` / var / log / apache / access.log ' - and just in time from the looks of it .
The poor thing is up to 400MB and it's nearly filling up the partition , and it 's only been a few days since it was rolled over ! "
- " What happened here , Woomert ?
I just came in to tell you about the latest story in the newspapers , praising you to the sky for your solution to the Missing Databases Mystery [ 1 ] at the Bigrich Bank , and you dragged me off without a word .
Not that I mind , but ... "
- " I do tend to get a bit concentrated while on the job , do n't I ?
Oh well - there are worse things .
All right , here is what 's happening : the client , a small company that specializes in making horseshoe welding sprockets for accountants working in the napkin - fringing industry , has become suspicious of a few odd things happening with their web site .
For example , their response time often spikes right through the roof , and they 've been returning the ` Server busy ' message much too often as compared to normal operation .
There has n't been any huge jump in the amount of business they do - less , since the economy these days does n't permit too many luxuries like their product - so ... "
- " It sounds like a DoS ( Denial of Service ) attack , Woomert . "
Here , let 's test a few things .
First , though , lets make a couple of copies of this file where it wo n't cram things quite as badly ...
There , I 've put them both in ` / home / woomert '.
We do n't really want to lose any of the data if we should accidentally damage or destroy one file , do we ?
Now , let 's zero out the actual log and restart the server ... excellent .
Now - on to exploring the files .
Given that you suspect a DoS - I do , as well - what would you look for , Frink ? "
- " I 'm not sure , Woomert .
I think I 'd like to figure out the average hits per IP , and then maybe look at the sorted list of the same .
That would tell us if someone is really slamming this server and from where , do n't you think ? "
- " Why , Frink , that sounds like an excellent idea !
Yes , let 's take a look at the average :
perl - wlne ' / ^( \S+ ) /;$h{$1}++}{$a=@a=values%h;map{$b+=$_}@a;print$b/$a ' access.log
12.30830039525692
- " Hmm , interesting .
Taking into account that the number is going to be higher due to the very large DoS entries - we 're still assuming those , but it 's a fair bet - that 's not an unreasonable number .
Most people will probably examine a few models before making their decision to buy ; after all , it is a once - in - a - lifetime purchase .
In fact , this company led the rest of the pack in offering lifetime warranties ...
All right - now let 's look at that sorted list :
perl - wlne ' / ^( \S+ ) /;$ h { $ 1} ++}{ print" $ h{$ }\t $ " for sort{$h{ $ a}<=> $h{$b}}keys %h ' access.log

When he spoke , there was a confident note in his voice .

Woomert and Frink looked at the screen , at each other , and exchanged a high - five salute , with Frink adding his " double twist with finger snaps " variation .
- " You did indeed , Frink , It looks like a modified version of a common worm , Code Red .
The good news is that we 're not dealing with a particularly sophisticated attacker , though : a Code Red infection attempt , which is what this is , is not the same thing as a Code Red DoS , which is just a network slam of a specific IP - and it only works against legacy operating systems , certainly nothing as modern as Linux - which is what this site runs .
All these guys have going for them is bandwidth , and that 's not particularly bad - and once the client blocks those IPs and notifies the relevant ISPs , it wo n't be an issue at all .
In fact , there are analysis and response utilities that can track this sort of thing and do it automatically , and I 'll recommend them to the client .
Here - "
- " ... shall we ?
I have a Paglia e Fieno con Pollo e Funghi that should only take a few minutes to finish preparing , a tiramisu made to my own recipe for desert , and a really great ' 97 Rosso di Cerbaiona wine that should go well with it all .
My girlfriend , the lovely Priority Interrupt , is going to join us . "
- " Nonsense , Frink ; we 'd love your company . "
After dinner , Frink lounged in the big armchair and Priority curled up in Woomert 's lap and lit a huge Toscano cigar , which she used to produce beautuful double and sometimes triple rings of smoke .
At Woomert 's inquiring glance , she reached up and placed the cigar between his lips .
Frink grinned at the two of them across the room .
perl - wlne ' / ^( \S+ ) /;$h{$1}++}{$a=@a=values%h;map{$b+=$_}@a;print$b/$a ' access.log
/^( \S+ ) /

$ h{ $ 1} + +
At Woomert 's encouraging nod and smile , Frink went on .
%h
Next ... um .
Next , there 's a closing brace all by itself ... and I do n't understandand what it does - or even why the code works .
Should n't that fail with a syntax error ? "
" Normally , it would .
However - go ahead and pull up `` perldoc perlrun '' again , and take a look at the entry for ` - p ' :
# From ``perldoc perlrun ''
while ( <> ) {
... # your program goes here
} continue {
print or die " - p destination : $!
" ;
}
Frink concentrated on the code .
Suddenly , his face lit up .
END{}
All right , since we have that , the rest is n't too tough .
Let 's see :
$ a=@a=values % h ;
All right , you extract the list of values - all the counts - from the hash and set `$a ' to the number of values returned ; that 's what you get when you look at a list in a scalar context ( it 's a bit more complex than that , but that 's the part that 's important right now . )
Next , you sum up all those values -
map{$b+=$_}@a ;
print$b/ $a
you print out the ratio of that sum over the count of the elements - thus dividing the total hits by the number of IPs .
How 's that ? "
- " Thank you , thank you ...
I guess spending all that time studying under Woomert 's direction is starting to pay off - thanks , Woomert !
The rest of them are somewhat similar :
perl - wlne ' / ^( \S+ ) /;$ h { $ 1} ++}{ print" $ h{$ _}\t$_" for sort{$h{ $a}<=> $h{$b}}keys %h ' access.log
The first part we already know - do a frequency count of the IPs .
In the end block , however , you do something different ; we 'll parse it right to left , just as Woomert taught me :
sort{$h{$a}<=> $h{$ b}}keys%h
for ( values %h ) { ... }
sort
perldoc -f sort
$a
$ b
sort
print " $ h{ $ _}\t $ " for ...
for
$ _
$ h{$_}
Last but not least , we have this :
perl - lne ' /^( \S+ ) .*? " (.*? ) " /; length$h{$1}>length$2or$h{$ 1}=$2}{print" @a" while@a=each%h ' access.log
/^( \S+ ) .*? " (.*? ) " /
Woomert lazily extracted a laser pointer from his shirt pocket and pointed .
length$h {$ 1}>length $ 2or$h {$ 1}=$
2
@a
perldoc perllexwarn
$ 2
or
or
||
Can you do the rest ? "
- " Yes ; it looks fairly easy .
print " @a" while@a=each%h
I 've seen you do this before ... oh yes .
It 's a `` while each '' loop that retrieves a key - value pair from a hash ; you 're assigning them to an array and printing the array .
Since you 've interpolated it by using double quotes around the array name , you 'll get a space between the elements - which makes it nicely readable .
All together , this prints out our hash - in more - or - less random order , but we do n't really care since we just want to see what 's in it .
Right ? "
- " I ... I hope so , Woomert . "
Frink looked up , proud as can be .
" I believe so .
I 'll certainly do my best .
I 'll head off for home then , and leave you two alone .
Have a great night . "
- " You 've made Frink 's week , you know .
That 's quite a compliment . "

Perhaps one day , the world will be apprised of the brilliant , decisive , and above all courageous actions of the Great Detective and his assistant . "
[ 2 ] Woomert , as my correspondent noted , does not take credit for this particular Perl hack ; it was created by Abigail in
comp.lang.perl.misc and seems to have become an idiom , at least to a degree .
In fact , Abigail 's brilliant one - liners have been known to stump Woomert on occasion ...
Ben is a Contributing Editor for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang .
Ben was born in Moscow , Russia in 1962 .
He became interested in electricity at age six -- promptly demonstrating it by sticking a fork into a socket and starting a fire -- and has been falling down technological mineshafts ever since .
He has been working with computers since the Elder Days , when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit boards and programs had to fit into 4 k of memory .
He would gladly pay good money to any psychologist who can cure him of the resulting nightmares .
Ben 's subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen languages , network and database maintenance during the approach of a hurricane , and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines to technological journals .
Having recently completed a seven - year Atlantic / Caribbean cruise under sail , he is currently docked in Baltimore , MD , where he works as a technical instructor for Sun Microsystems .
Ben has been working with Linux since 1997 , and credits it with his complete loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest .
Four years ago , President Bush ordered Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet to prepare a National Intelligence Estimate to be used to " justify " to Congress the preemptive war against Iraq we now know he had already decided to launch .
Two years later , the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that " Most of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community ’s October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate  ‘ Iraq ’s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction ’  either overstated , or were not supported by , the underlying intelligence reporting . "
In particular , the assessment that Iraq “ is reconstituting its nuclear program ” was " not supported by the intelligence provided to the Committee . "
The Committee noted that prior to 1999 our intelligence community had been heavily dependent upon information obtained from United Nations inspectors .
True , in December 1998 , President Clinton had warned all UN inspectors to get out of Iraq or risk getting killed during Operation Desert Fox .
However , after Clinton quit bombing , International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors had been allowed back into Iraq ( in 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 ) to inspect all the remaining nuclear - related sites in Iraq  including Kuwaitha , where our " intelligence " had suggested the Iraqis might be doing something untoward  and found nothing untoward .
But Tenet ’s 2002 NIE did n’t even mention those IAEA inspections , much less the subsequent " null " reports the IAEA regularly made to the UN Security Council .
Why not ?
Well , obviously the Cheney Cabal did n’t want Congress to know  at least officially  that by 1994 all Saddam ’s nuclear programs had been verifiably destroyed and that he had made no attempt whatsoever to reconstitute them .
Inexplicably , the Senate Intelligence Committee did not even mention  much less decry  the failure of the intelligence community to base their 2002 NIE " assessments " of Saddam ’s nuclear program on those IAEA " null " reports .
There were , however , cries of anguish from those sent to Iraq on a fool ’s errand by Tenet : Never again produce an NIE that completely ignores the best intelligence , that of on - the - ground inspectors !
Last year , Dafna Linzer reported that the intelligence community had produced an NIE  still highly classified  about Iran .
" A major U.S. intelligence review has projected that Iran is about a decade away from manufacturing the key ingredient for a nuclear weapon , roughly doubling the previous estimate of five years , according to government sources with firsthand knowledge of the new analysis .
" The carefully hedged assessments , which represent consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies , contrast with forceful public statements by the White House .
Administration officials have asserted , but have not offered proof , that Tehran is moving determinedly toward a nuclear arsenal .
The new estimate could provide more time for diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear ambitions .
President Bush has said that he wants the crisis resolved diplomatically but that “ all options are on the table . ”
Linzer does n’t say whether the 2005 NIE on Iran ’s nuclear programs took into account at all  much less was largely based upon  the quarterly reports the on - the - ground IAEA inspectors had been making to the IAEA Board and to the Security Council .
And a year later , IAEA inspectors have yet to see any indication  much less evidence  that Iran has engaged in any activity involving the use of any amount of proscribed nuclear materials in furtherance of a military purpose .
Furthermore , if IAEA inspectors are allowed to continue safeguarding Iran ’s nuclear facilities , the Iranians will never succeed in producing any amount of weapons - grade enriched uranium , much less enough to make a nuclear weapon .
Nevertheless , the members of the Cheney Cabal continue to forcefully assert  without offering any proof whatsoever  that Iran has a nuclear weapons program that has already " reached a point of no return . "
Why ?
Apparently because we have pledged to not use nuclear weapons against those signatories to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons who do n’t already have nukes .
So , when Bush says " all options are on the table , " he ’s telling the Iranians that our no-nuking pledge wo n’t keep him from nuking them because he has it on authority 
God Almighty , apparently  that the Iranians have nukes .
Now comes Linzer to tell us the House Intelligence Committee has just issued a staff report [ . pdf ]  authored principally by Frederick Fleitz  that uses information contained in the IAEA " null " reports to come to conclusions diametrically opposed to those of the IAEA .
You may recall that Undersecretary Bolton and his chief of staff Fleitz were point - men in the largely successful attempts by the Cheney Cabal to cook the intelligence in the run-up to the preemptive attack on Iraq .
Looks like they ’re at it again .
How to use Subversion with Eclipse
Integrating is easy
A stock Eclipse installation has integrated support for CVS , a popular open source change - management system .
The abilities of CVS , and its limitations , are well known , but many groups have been investigating other version - control systems to provide better scaling , better support for merging changes and branching versions , and better support for binary file formats .
Subversion ( SVN ) is a popular replacement for CVS , offering improved performance ( courtesy of intelligent local caching and a database back end ) , easy and fast branching , and an answer to every one of the shortcomings that people often run into while using CVS .

Web site and install the CDT using the update manager ( using the update manager is described in the next section ) .
You 'll also need access to a Subversion repository .
If you need to set one up , you can find excellent documentation at the Subversion Web site .
For demonstration purposes , I 'll show you how to check out the Subclipse project and work with projects in a repository on my LAN .
Adding Subclipse to Eclipse
Subclipse is a project to add Subversion support to the Eclipse IDE .
We 'll use Eclipse 's update manager to add Subclipse to our Eclipse IDE .
From the Help menu in Eclipse , choose Software Updates >
Find and Install to open the update manager .
Figure 1 . The Eclipse update manager
In addition to using this to look for software updates , we can use the update manager to find and install new features , such as Subclipse .
Be sure that Search for new features to install is selected , then click Next to continue .
Eclipse displays the next update manager panel .
Figure 2 . Update manager sites
Since we 're after a specific feature , un-check the existing sites , then click New Remote Site to display the New Update Site dialog ( see Figure 3 ) .
We 'll use this to add the Subclipse update site to the list .
Figure 3 .
Adding a new update site
Enter whatever you want for the Name ( Subclipse is a good choice ) and enter the following for the URL : http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.0.x ( the current Subclipse update site ) .
Click OK to add the Subclipse update site to the list in the update manager .
Click Finish in the update manager window to begin searching for new features .
In this case , the new feature we 're after is Subclipse .
After a few moments , the update manager 's search is complete , and it displays the search results .
Figure 4 .
New features we can install
Check Subclipse ( you can click the disclosure triangle to see what exactly is included in this feature ) , then click Next to view the feature 's license terms .
Accept the terms , then click Next to review the features you 've chosen to install .
Click Finish to download and install Subclipse .
The update manager downloads the Subversion components .
Before installing anything , Eclipse will warn you that the features are n't digitally signed ( Figure 5 ) .
This is your last chance to cancel the installation .
Click Install
All to continue the installation .
Figure 5 . Subclipse is n't digitally signed
Once Subversion has been installed , Eclipse warns you that you might need to restart the IDE to activate the new features ( see Figure 6 ) .
Restart Eclipse , just in case .
Figure 6 . Restart Eclipse after installing new features
When Eclipse comes back up , Subclipse is installed and ready to go .
If you 're running Eclipse on Mac OS X or Linux® , you may need to install the JavaHL library , which is described in the Troubleshooting section of the Subclipse FAQ .
Do this before you continue trying to use Subclipse .
A quick test
It 's always nice to test a new feature once you 've finished the installation ; we 'll try checking out a copy of Subclipse from their Subversion repository to make sure it 's been properly installed .
From Eclipse 's
File menu , choose Import to display the import manager ( see Figure 7 ) .
Choose Checkout Projects from SVN , then click Next .
Figure 7 .
The import manager
On the Select / Create Location panel ( see Figure 8 ) , we need to create a new location ( since we do n't have any configured yet ) , so click Next to continue .
If the Next button is disabled , switch to the Use existing repository location option , then back to Create a new repository location to enable the Next button .
Figure 8 .
Creating a new repository location
In the next section ( see Figure 9 ) , add the repository URL ( http://subclipse.tigris.org/svn/subclipse/ ) to the Url field , then click Next .
After a moment , Eclipse prompts you for user ID and password .
If you do n't have an account on the Subclipse site , enter guest for the user ID and a space for the password , check the Save Password box , and click OK .
Figure 9 .
Add the repository URL
Eclipse displays the folders in the Subclipse repository ( see Figure 10 ) .
Expand the trunk and choose the subclipse folder , then click Finish to check out your own copy of the Subclipse project 's source code .
Since you have no idea what this is , choose Simple > Project when the New Project wizard prompts you .
Figure 10 .
Subclipse repository
Basic Subversion operations
At this point , we 've installed Subclipse successfully , which added support for Subversion servers to our Eclipse setup , and we 've tested Subclipse by downloading the current Subclipse source code from the repository .
Now we should look at doing something with our own code and our own Subversion repository .
Before I show you how things work with Subversion , I 'll tell you a little bit about my repository .
It 's hosted on a machine called dogma on port 8000 , and I 've created a new developerworks repository for code associated with my developerWorks articles .
I 'm going to put my projects directly in the root of the repository .
Other repositories often have folders named trunk , tags , and branches off the root , for development versions , tags , and branches , but I do n't expect to need to worry about tagging or branching the developerWorks article code .
I 've added two projects , forkWork and threadWork , from my first developerWorks article .
My Eclipse workspace ( see Figure 11 ) also contains three other projects from developerWorks articles ( getopt_demo , getopt_long_demo , and readdir_demo ) .
Figure 11 . My Eclipse C/C++ projects
Now we 're ready to get to work .
Adding a project to the repository
To add a new project to your Subversion repository , right - click the project ( in any of Eclipse 's project views or the Navigator view ) and choose Team > Share Project from the menu .
Eclipse displays the Share Project dialog .
Figure 12 .
The Share Project dialog
Select SVN from the list of repositories currently supported by your Eclipse , then click Next .
The next dialog ( see Figure 13 ) lets you choose an existing repository location , or you can create a new one .
Figure 13 .
Selecting a repository location
If your repository is already listed ( as you can see , I 've added mine ) , select it , and click Finish .
If your repository is n't listed , add it ( see A quick test for instructions ) and continue .
Eclipse creates a new directory in the repository with the same name as your project , and displays a list of all files and folders in the project .
Figure 14 .
Adding a project 's contents
Enter a suitable comment describing this project in the top field , then click Select All to check all of the files from the project .
Click OK to check in your project and transmit its current state to the Subversion repository .
Subversion 's commands and output are displayed in the Console view , usually found at the bottom of your Eclipse window , if you want to see exactly what Subclipse did with your project .
Updating a project
One of the key features of a version - control system is the ability for other developers to continue development and commit their changes whenever they 're ready .
To download these changes and integrate them with your local copies , you need to update the project .
Right - click on the project you want to update , then choose Team >
Update from the menu .
Eclipse retrieves any changes from the repository and attempts to merge them with your local copy .
Adding a file or directory
If you add a file to your project ( see Figure 15 ) , it 's not automatically part of version control -- you need to specifically add it to the repository .
In the screenshot , you can see that I 've added a ReadMe.txt file to the threadWork project .
Figure 15 .
Adding a new file
Right - click the new file , then choose Team > Add to Version Control .
That 's it !
The next time you commit your changes in this project to the repository , the new file will also be checked in .
Deleting a file or directory
If you 've added a file to the repository that 's no longer relevant to your project , you can easily delete it .
Right - click the file , then choose Delete .
No need for the Team menu , Subclipse flags the file for deletion automatically and removes it from your project .
The next time you commit your changes to the repository , the file is deleted .
Renaming a file or directory
To rename a file or directory under Subclipse 's control , right - click it , then choose Rename .
Type the item 's new name in the entry field and click Enter .
The file is renamed in the project , and the rename operation ( an Add for the new name , and a Delete for the old one ) is queued for your next commit .
In Figure 16 you can see the threadWork project after I 've renamed main.c to threadWork.c , but before I 've committed my change .
Note the little blue plus sign Subclipse has added to the " new " file to indicate that it 's scheduled for addition in the next commit .
Figure 16 .
Renaming a file is atomic , even though it's an add and a delete
Ignoring files
If your project generates files , or otherwise includes files that you do n't want to check in to the Subversion repository , you can tell Subclipse to ignore them .
Right - click the file or directory you want to exclude from version control , then choose Team >
Add to svn:ignore to display the Add to svn :ignore dialog .
Figure 17 .
Ignoring resources that do n't belong in version control
Click OK to add this specific file to the svn :ignore property for the project 's directory .
Choose Wildcard extension to ignore all files with the current file 's extension , or choose Custom pattern to add your own wild card to the ignore list .
These changes to the ignore list will be added to the repository the next time you commit your changes .
Committing your changes
Once you 're happy with your changes to the project , you 've made sure your code compiles , and you 've tested your changes , you should commit them to the Subversion repository .
This acts as a backup in case your workstation self - destructs , and it lets other developers update their local copies to include your changes .
Be sure to update your project ( see " Updating a project " ) before attempting to commit your changes .
Right - click the project and choose Team > Commit from the menu .
Eclipse displays the Commit dialog ( see Figure 18 ) , which summarizes your changes .
Figure 18 .
Committing your changes to the repository
If you look carefully , you 'll see a property change to the project 's directory ( I 've added to the svn : ignore property to keep certain files out of the repository ) and that main.c was deleted while threadWork.c was added .
That pair of changes actually represents one operation ( a file rename ) .
At this point , you can deselect resources if you want to keep them out of the repository .
This might be helpful if you 're partially finished work in one file , and do n't want to check in an incomplete change .
Enter a suitable comment in the top text field , then click OK to check in your changes to the repository .
Summary
The Subclipse project integrates support for the Subversion version - control system with Eclipse 's excellent team project management features , which only support CVS servers out of the box .
Using Eclipse 's update manager , it 's easy to add Subclipse to your Eclipse installation , which lets you use this superior ( in my opinion , at least ) version - control system directly from Eclipse .
While adding projects to a repository -- and managing your project 's resources once it's there -- can be daunting for folks unfamiliar with Subversion , the procedures for common operations are straightforward .
This article walked you through the everyday operations to help familiarize you with Subclipse .

The California - based non-profit organization Electronic Frontier Foundation , as well as the Attorney General of Texas , has filed a law suit against Sony Computer Entertainment of America for their controversial use of anti-piracy software .
The EFF claims that the digital rights management software on the CDs BMG Music ( a subsidiary of Sony ) produces acts as spyware , which the EFF claims is against Texas law .
The program , known as XCP , is said to install software on one 's system when they insert the CD into their computer for purposes such as adding to iTunes music software .
Sony currently rejects the idea of XCP technology being considered as spyware , however they have agreed to replace CDs with the software and to temporarily discontinue the installation of it on their CDs .
Among the controversy that Sony 's moves to counter piracy have raised is the accusation that their software leaves a machine more vulnerable to attacks across the Internet .
A trojan horse has already been found in the wild that utilizes one of the anti-piracy software 's functions .

Finding New Music Worth Listening To
7:54 PM Subscribe July 18 , 2005
How does everyone keep up with new music ?
Over the past year , blind luck and close reading of a few blogs turned me on to some music I 'm glad I did n't miss ( Bloc Party , Arcade Fire , LCD Soundsystem ) .
Work and other obligations prevent me from listening to KCRW , KEXP or some other " hip " radio stream all day , and I just do n't have the time to read through x-amount of MP3 blogs a day looking for the next exciting thing .
Pitchfork 's ' Best New Music ' feature is helpful , but I 'd like something more .
Ideally , I 'd like a podcast of non-podsafe ( i.e. , whatever 's new and good , signed or otherwise ) music or a single blogger who posts frequently and writes well .
I 'm not looking for a bootlegging outlet , just a reliable source for direction on what 's new and worth my time .

You have the right to remain silent .
So SHUT THE FUCK UP .
Those cops are completely serious when they say your statements can and will be used against you .
There ’s just no need to babble on like it ’s a drink and dial session .
They are just pretending to like you and be interested in you .
When you come to court , consider your dress .
If you ’re charged with a DUI , do n’t wear a Budweiser shirt .
If you have some miscellaneous drug charge , think twice about clothing with a marijuana leaf on it or a t - shirt with the “ UniBonger ” on it .
Long sleeves are very nice for covering tattoos and track marks .
Try not to be visibly drunk when you show up .
Consider bathing and brushing your teeth .
This is just as a courtesy to me who has to stand by you in court .
Smoking 5 generic cigarettes to cover up your bad breath is not the same as brushing .
Try not to cough and spit on my while you speak and further transmit your strep , flu , and hepatitis A through Z.I ’m a lawyer , not your fairy godmother .
I probably wo n’t find a loophole or technicality for you , so do n’t be pissed off .
I did n’t beat up your girlfriend , steal that car , rob that liquor store , sell that crystal meth , or rape that 13 year old .
By the time we meet , much of your fate has been sealed , so do n’t be too surprised by your limited options and that I ’m the one telling you about them .
Do n’t think you ’ll improve my interest in your case by yelling at me , telling me I ’m not doing anything for you , calling me a public pretender or complaining to my supervisor .
This does not inspire me , it makes me hate you and want to work with you even less .
It does not help if you leave me nine messages in 17 minutes .
Especially if you leave them all on Saturday night and early Sunday morning .
This just makes me want to stab you in the eye when we finally meet .
For the guys :
Do n’t think I ’m amused when you flirt or offer to “ do me . ”
You ca n’t successfully rob a convenience store , forge a signature , pawn stolen merchandise , get through a day without drinking , control your temper , or talk your way out of a routine traffic stop .
I figure your performance in other areas is just as spectacular , and the thought of your shriveled unwashed body near me makes me want to kill you and then myself .
For the girls : I know your life is rougher than mine and you have no resources .
I ’m not going to insult you by suggesting you leave your abusive pimp / boyfriend , that you stop taking meth , or that your stop stealing shit .
I do wish you ’d stop beating the crap out of your kids and leaving your needles out for them to play with because you are n’t allowing them to have a life that is any better than yours .
For the morons :
Your second grade teacher was right – neatness counts .
Just clean up !
When you rob the store , do n’t leave your wallet .
When you drive into the front of the bank , do n’t leave the front license plate .
When you rape / assault / rob a woman on the street , do n’t leave behind your cell phone .
After you abuse your girlfriend , do n’t leave a note saying that you ’re sorry .
If you are being chased by the cops and you have dope in your pocket – dump it .
These cops are not geniuses .
They are out of shape and want to go to Krispy Kreme and most of all go home .
They will not scour the woods or the streets for your 2 grams of meth .
But they will check your pockets , idiot .
2 grams is not worth six months of jail .
Do n’t be offended and say you were harassed because the security was following you all over the store .
Girl , you were wearing an electronic ankle bracelet with your mini skirt .
And you were stealing .
That ’s not harassment , that ’s good store security .
And those kids you churn out : how is it possible ?
You ’re out there breeding like feral cats .
What exactly is the attraction of having sex with other meth addicts ?
You are lacking in the most basic aspects of hygiene , deathly pale , greasy , grey - toothed , twitchy and covered with open sores .
How can you be having sex ?
You make my baby - whoring crack head clients look positively radiant by comparison .
" I did n't put it all the way in . "
Not a defense .
" All the money is gone now . "
Not a defense
" The bitch deserved it . "
Not a defense .
" But that dope was so stepped on , I barely got high . "
Not a defense .
" She did n't look thirteen . "
Possibly a defense ; it depends .
" She did n't look six . "
Never a defense , you just need to die .
For those rare clients that say thank - you , leave a voice mail , send a card or flowers , you are very welcome .
I keep them all , and they keep me going more than my pitiful COLA increase .
For the idiots who ask me how I sleep at night : I sleep just fine , thank you .
There 's nothing wrong with any of my clients that could not have been fixed with money or the presence of at least one caring adult in their lives .
But that window has closed , and that loss diminishes us all .

Any device with a remote consumes electricity when on standby
But do we know just how much power we are using when we switch things off or put them into standby mode ?
Energy management consultant John Field says : " Electronic devices like TV or video or stereos , anything which has a remote control , have to be live so you can switch on remotely .
" There is nothing to stop you switching it off physically , but if you are going to switch it off with the remote control , then something at the other end within the box has to be live .
" It has to have power and electronics operating , so there 's a bit of what 's called standby power . "
Ultimately , using your remote control can use more power than getting off your backside and pressing the buttons yourself .
Power consumption
Standby power can range between 10 and 15 watts , and occasionally beyond .
On its own , this is not much .
But if you get half a dozen devices on standby , it is the equivalent of a 60 watt bulb .
A PC is always using energy unless it is totally switched off
A laptop computer , for example , can be plugged into the mains via his meter which reads the voltage and wattage used .
The device is useful because the way the systems draw standby power can be difficult to monitor .
A commercial version is being put together by a group called DIY Kyoto .
Astonishing figures
All around the house we bleed power .
The modern home is permanently on standby , full of equipment that sits " half on " , waiting to spring immediately to life when we ask it to .
Figures from the Energy Saving Trust on standby power use in the UK home are astonishing :
Stereos on standby cost £ 290 m and produce 1.6 million tonnes of CO2
VCRs and DVD cost £ 194 m and produce 1.06 million tonnes of CO2
TVs on standby cost £ 88 m and produce 480,000 tonnes of CO2
It means that in one year , in the UK alone , our equipment on standby produces a total of 3.1 million tonnes of CO2 .
But there is a bigger culprit out there : the personal computer , as Scott Richards from power supply manufacturer Antec explains .
If you really want to be green with your PC , when you 're done using it turn it off
Scott Richards , power supply manufacturer
" And depending on what kind of mode you 're in that power can be anywhere between five watts to 60 and beyond .
" If a million PC users switched to a more efficient power supply , it would save almost the equivalent of 250 thousand litres of gasoline a day . "
By the end of 2004 there were 820 million PCs in use around the world , and by 2007 that will top a billion , according to the Computer Industry Almanac .
No matter how easy these devices make our lives there is little doubt that they are costing us and the planet dearly .
As Mr Richards says : " If you really want to be green with your PC , when you 're done using it turn it off . "
Google Patent : Organic Results Ranked by User Profiling
Google has filed for an organic search patent , termed Personalization of placed content ordering in search results , to serve organic search results based on user profiles .
Google has also applied for a similar behavioral targeting patent for its advertising network , but this seems to be a first from Google with plans to integrate user profiling into natural search ranking .
Such profiles are created by Google and gathered from previous queries , web navigation behavior via tracked links and possibly sites visited which serve Google ads , computers with Google Applications installed such as Desktop Search , Google Wi-fi Connection or Sidebar , and personal information which Google identifies which may be “ implicitly or explicitly provided by the user . ”
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
This new ranking system , which is a spin off of PageRank and the current Google ranking algorithm , could be referred to as Profile Rank .
What is the difference between this new ranking system and Google Personalized Search ?
Personalized Search was beta tested by Google users who have opted in to Google profile building while the new Profile Rank is based upon user profiles built by tracking a users web habits in and outside of Google Search , even if the user has not opted in to be served personalized results or is a registered Google Account member : Wide Spread Personalization to all users .
In the patent application Google explains that when a search engine generates search results in response to a search query , a listed site which satisfies the query is assigned a query score , QueryScore , in accordance with the search query .
This query score is then modulated by the site ’s PageRank , to generate a generic score , GenericScore , that is expressed as : GenericScore=QueryScore*PageRank .
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
However , Google states that the GenericScore system may not be relevant enough and proposes a more in depth Profile Rank ( PersonalizedScore ) :
This GenericScore may not appropriately reflect the site ’s importance to a particular user if the user ’s interests or preferences are dramatically different from that of the random surfer .
The relevance of a site to user can be accurately characterized by a set of profile ranks , based on the correlation between a sites content and the user ’s term - based profile , herein called the TermScore , the correlation between one or more categories associated with a site and user ’s category - based profile , herein called the CategoryScore , and the correlation between the URL and / or host of the site and user ’s link - based profile , herein called the LinkScore .
Therefore , the site may be assigned a personalized rank that is a function of both the document ’s generic score and the user profile scores .
This personalized score can be expressed as : PersonalizedScore=GenericScore*( TermScore+CategoryScore+LinkScore ) .
Google gives an example of a listing based upon user profiling mixed with information given by the user : a user may choose to offer personal information , including demographic and geographic information associated with the user , such as the user ’s age or age range , educational level or range , income level or range , language preferences , marital status , geographic location ( e.g. , the city , state and country in which the user resides , and possibly also including additional information such as street address , zip code , and telephone area code ) , cultural background or preferences , or any subset of these .
Compared with other types of personal information such as a user ’s favorite sports or movies that are often time varying , this personal information is more static and more difficult to infer from the user ’s search queries and search results , but may be crucial in correctly interpreting certain queries submitted by the user .
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
For example , if a user submits a query containing “ Japanese restaurant ” , it is very likely that he may be searching for a local Japanese restaurant for dinner .
Without knowing the user ’s geographical location , it is hard to order the search results so as to bring to the top those items that are most relevant to the user ’s true intention .
In certain cases , however , it is possible to infer this information .
For example , users often select results associated with a specific region corresponding to where they live .
What about shared machines ?
If the one computer is shared by various users with different web behavior , how is Google to define Profile Rank in its organic search results ?
Google has thought this though :
Sometimes , multiple users may share a machine , e.g. , in a public library .
These users may have different interests and preferences .
In one embodiment , a user may explicitly login to the service so the system knows his identity .
Alternatively , different users can be automatically recognized based on the items they access or other characteristics of their access patterns .
For example , different users may move the mouse in different ways , type differently , and use different applications and features of those applications .
Based on a corpus of events on a client and / or server , it is possible to create a model for identifying users , and for then using that identification to select an appropriate “ user ” profile .
In such circumstances , the “ user ” may actually be a group of people having somewhat similar computer usage patterns , interests and the like .

Users identified by the way they move a mouse or typing style ?
Amazing .
The patent , Personalization of placed content ordering in search results , is pretty detailed and deep .
I suggest running over it a couple of times , printing it out and breaking out the highlite marker from college because there is a lot to it and a handfull of clues as to the future of Google and its ranking system .
Supreme Court rejects Williams ' plea Schwarzenegger denies clemency for former gang leader RELATED QUICKVOTE Was California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger right not to grant clemency to killer Stanley Tookie Williams ?
Yes No or View Results YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Stanley Tookie Williams Crime , Law and Justice or or Create Your Own SACRAMENTO , California ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court refused to stay the execution Monday of convicted killer Stanley Tookie Williams , clearing the way for him to die by injection shortly after midnight .
The high court was the former gang leader 's last chance to avoid death by injection after California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger denied him clemency earlier Monday and a federal appeals court panel rejected a request to stay his execution .
Williams , who co-founded the Crips street gang in Los Angeles , is scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday ( 3:01 a.m. ET ) at San Quentin State Prison , near San Francisco .
Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson , who met with Williams earlier in the day , criticized Schwarzenegger for deciding not to spare Williams .
Jackson said Williams , who was convicted of killing four people in two 1979 robberies in Los Angeles , had earned clemency and that Schwarzenegger 's decision was about " making politicians look tough , but that does not make it right . "
Lora Owens , the stepmother of one of the men Williams was convicted of killing , said she felt " justice is going to be done tonight . "
" I had faith that when Governor Arnold looked at the facts of the case that he was going to decide not to do clemency , " said Owens , whose 26 - year - old stepson , Albert Owens , was shot to death in a February 1979 convenience store holdup in Los Angeles .
" I do n't like it being said it 's a political decision .
It was an evidence decision . "
A jury convicted Williams of killing Owens by shooting him twice in the back with a 12 - gauge shotgun while the victim was face down on the floor .
The jury also convicted him of shooting and killing an immigrant couple and their 41 - year - old daughter less than two weeks later while stealing less than $ 100 cash from their motel .
Both cases were handled in a single trial .
Williams was sentenced to death in 1981 .
Schwarzenegger announced his decision not to commute Williams ' sentence to life in prison without parole shortly after a three - judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , based in San Francisco , rejected an affidavit from the convict 's lawyers that suggested someone framed him .
California 's Supreme Court rejected an emergency request to stay the execution on Sunday .
In their appeal to the 9th Circuit , his attorneys pinned their hopes on the declaration of a new witness -- Gordon Bradbury von Ellerman -- a jail trusty detained with Williams in the Los Angeles County Jail from 1979 to 1980 .
In the affidavit , von Ellerman said he was the cellmate of another trusty , identified as George " Roger " Oglesby .
Von Ellerman said Los Angeles Sheriff 's Department personnel provided Oglesby with documents to aid him in testifying against Williams in return for reduced or dropped charges .
" I was personally aware that Los Angeles Sheriff 's Department personnel would often provide information to these inmates so that they could help frame defendants for crimes , " he said in the statement .
A statement from Schwarzenegger read : " The possible irregularities in Williams ' trial have been thoroughly and carefully reviewed by the courts , and there is no reason to disturb the judicial decisions that uphold the jury 's decisions that he is guilty of these four murders and should pay with his life . "
Williams , who would be 52 on December 29 , spent part of Monday with his attorneys and family members at San Quentin .
As Williams was being moved to a holding cell next to the death chamber Monday evening , his lead attorney , John Harris , said the convict was " at peace . "
But his lawyers have renewed their request for clemency to Schwarzenegger , citing the statements of three new witnesses Harris said could provide exculpatory evidence .
" He 's at peace , but we 're fighting , and he knows it , " Harris said .
A crowd of protesters had begun to gather outside the gates of San Quentin early Monday evening .
One demonstrator carried a sign that read , " Do n't kill in my name . "
While in prison , Williams became an anti-gang crusader , but he has consistently refused to take part in a debriefing with authorities to provide them potentially valuable information about the Crips gangs , said lead prosecutor John Monaghan .
While maintaining his innocence in the four murders , Williams has denounced gang violence and written children 's books with an anti-gang message , donating the proceeds to anti-gang community groups .
He said he was trying to prevent young people from making the choices he did .
Celebrities , teachers and anti-death penalty advocates have spoken on Williams ' behalf , but Schwarzenegger questioned the sincerity of Williams ' conversion to nonviolence .
" Stanley Williams insists he is innocent , and that he will not and should not apologize or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case , " the governor wrote .
" Without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings , there can be no redemption . "

Digital book readers are gaining popularity all the time , with Amazon , the major online book retailer , especially keen to push the technology through their own brand of digital book reader .
With the power of Amazon helping to drive it forward the number of digital book readers on the market is growing exponentially .
Despite this growth in popularity many people are unaware of what a digital book reader is , and how it can be used to enhance their own book reading experience .
So let us look into the fundamentals of this technology .
What is a Digital Book Reader ?
A digital book reader is , in essence , a small mobile computer that is able to travel with you wherever you go .
The very essence of it is the ability to travel easily , so they are lightweight and small – designed to be no more than book sized .
The technology is a natural progression from a hand - held PDA .
PDAs are mobile computers designed to help you organise your day and also supported the reading of certain documents .
Digital book readers have progressed that technology and taken the next logical step .
Rather than being an input machine the digital book reader is designed to be a display module ( with some limited input capabilities ) , allowing different formats of files to be shown as text .
These files can be saved to an internal hard drive or use external memory cards that are easily inserted .
These files , as the name suggests , are , in the main , digital books .
Simply put they are the same text as normal books but presented in a digital format for a digital book reader to display on its screen ( which takes up most of the front of the electronic device ) .
Other files can be read , depending on the device , including reports in files such as . txt or .pdf , which have interested many commercial services outside of publishing .
A Difference
It is not simply a case of these devices being mini-computers that let you read books .
While that is an accurate description it is also a simplistic one .
A lot of research and development has gone into these readers to ensure that the reading experience is a comfortable one .
It was discovered that using normal mobile technology to light and display text started hurting the eyes relatively quickly , making it uncomfortable and unlikely to catch on .
This has lead to the development of such technologies as ‘ electronic paper ’ and ‘ electronic ink ’ .
These are designed to allow the readers to be read for long periods ( e.g. while studying ) and still feel as natural and as easy to read as a book .
The change in lighting also makes such devices easy to read in sunlight , which laptops have traditionally struggled in .
Electronic books , also known as ebooks , are available in a number of different formats .
Originally the various hardware developers , such as Sony and Amazon , created proprietary formats so that ebooks bought for their hardware could not be used on other devices , effectively tying people and their ebook collections to the one hardware .
However as more hardware manufacturers have entered the market a general use format has emerged , ePUB .
Sony has changed it ’s recent offerings to include access to this format , as have most manufacturers ( with Amazon the main notable exception ) .
Digital book readers continue to advance as technology changes and improves , but with the expansion of the books available , and the emergence of a standard publishing technology , it looks more and more like the digital book reader is going to be here to stay .
Digital Book Reader Benefits
With the increased popularity of digital book readers comes increased scrutiny .
As it moves out from simply being a gadget that gadget lovers will get and into the mainstream so to must it be questioned for usability and value for money .
Why should you get a digital book reader ?
What benefits does it bring ?
The book has been our medium for reading for hundreds of years , huge collections exist and the book brings a value and feel all of it ’s own .
So for digital book readers to overcome this history and familiarity they are going to have to present some real benefits .
So what benefits can digital book readers bring to users that they do n’t get with the traditional book ?
The first is ease of transport .
Whilst a digital book reader takes up roughly the same size as a book it can in fact store thousands of books inside it ’s ( and any memory card ’s ) data banks .
This means that when you are travelling you do n’t need to pack half a suitcase worth of books , just the one book sized piece of equipment .
It can be of great benefit for online education .
Instantaneous downloads .
Books are hard copy , they need to be picked up from shops or delivered , which means you need to wait .
Electronic Books ( eBooks ) of digital book readers are available for an instantaneous download , meaning you can have what you want in your hands , ready to read as soon as you have bought it .
Storage space .
If you are an avid book reader it can be difficult to find space for all the books that you own .
Many such people end up having to give their books away .
Would n’t it be preferable to instead be able to store it on a tiny little device such as a memory card ?
That is what an eBook can bring .
No need for vast storage areas , or giving away books you may want to read again , just an easy to access and easy to store system that takes up next to no space .
Cost .
Whilst a digital book reader can be somewhat costly the massively reduce cost of ebooks vs traditional books mean that if you are buying books on a frequent , or even semi frequent , basis then you will be saving money .
Wear and tear .
Books traditionally suffer from degradation .
Folding of the pages , yellowing , water damage , tears and more are something that anyone who owns a book is aware of .
With an eBook though they will never suffer such problems as they are stored in digital format .
Whilst it is possible for the digital book reader to get damaged ( though they are sturdy items ) your ebook collection will still be unharmed , and can be transferred to a new book reader if needs be .
File support .
It is possible to read other documents on such readers , such as work reports or newspapers .
It can greatly increase the functionality of the digital book reader over that of a traditional book .
These are the main benefits that most people appreciate with digital book readers .
Other benefits exist and their importance from person to person can vary .
It should be noted that at this point the manufacturers and publishers are not pitching eBooks as something to take over completely from traditional books , just an additional interest that will benefit those that like to read .
New Brands
While Sony and Amazon Kindle are the two biggest names in the digital book reader market , there are a few companies that have developed their own offerings that are fast getting a strong following from users .
As the technology is still in early stages , it is likely we will see a number of ‘ new name ’ companies come and go .
But some will stay around thanks to the strength and popularity of their offerings .
Two of the major up and coming digital book reader companies are featured below , and should be strongly considered as alternatives to the established options .
Cool-er
Cool - er ebook readers are certainly eye catching .
They come in a range of 8 different colors , all of which are very bright and easily spotted .
As one of the latest of the digital book readers to be released the Cool - er has almost all the up - to - date specifications you would expect .
The Cool - er is roughly the same size as the Sony Reader , but is also roughly half the weight , making it far more friendly as a travel companion .
It comes with speakers to allow ebooks to be read to you ( and MP3′s to be played ) and has the good news that it supports the ePub format , fast becoming the industry standard for ebooks .

Palestinian casualties have been high in a spate of Israeli raids
John Dugard said Israel was largely to blame for turning Gaza into " a prison " and " throwing away the key " .
He also criticised Canada , Europe and the US for cutting funds to Palestinian Authority , run by the Hamas militant group which does not recognise Israel .
An Israeli official said the statement was unrealistic and over - simplified .
Mr Dugard , UN special rapporteur on Palestinian human rights , said three - quarters of Palestinians in Gaza now depended on food aid - a result , he added , of Israeli military raids , blockades and demolitions .
" I hope that my portrayal ... will trouble the consciences of those accustomed to turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the suffering of the Palestinian people , " Mr Dugard told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva .
Unpunished
The South African lawyer was appointed in 2001 .
Palestinian people are punished for having democratically elected a regime unacceptable to Israel , the US and the EU
John Dugard
The situation - in the wake of Israel 's response to the capture of a soldier by militants from Gaza during a cross - border raid - is worse than at any time during my mandate , Mr Dugard said .
More than 100 civilians have been killed in army raids and bombardments in the Gaza Strip .
" What Israel chooses to describe as collateral damage to the civilian population is in fact indiscriminate killing prohibited by international law , " he said .
UN special rapporteur John Dugard was sent on a fact - finding mission
" Israel violates international law as expounded by the Security Council and the International Court of Justice and goes unpunished , " he said .
" But the Palestinian people are punished for having democratically elected a regime unacceptable to Israel , the US and the EU .
" In effect , the Palestinian people have been subjected to economic sanctions - the first time an occupied people has been so treated , " he said .
Omissions
Mr Dugard 's brief to investigate Israeli human rights violations against Palestinians has led Israel and its US ally to condemn his reports as one - sided .
The US ambassador to the UN in Geneva cautioned against taking Mr Dugard 's view out of context and Israeli envoy Itzhak Levanon dismissed his findings .
" This report is characterised by errors of omission as well as distortions of both fact and law , " Mr Levanon said .
He said it ignored what he called the daily experience of Israelis facing Palestinian terrorism .
Mr Dugard is a South African national and won his reputation as a civil rights lawyer during the apartheid era in the 1980s .
About Freevo Freevo is an open source HTPC media centre .
It integrates PVR / DVR functionality along with music , video , gaming , home automation and more .
It is written in python and uses existing popular software such as mplayer , xine , vlc and skype .
Freevo also provides access to popular services such as YouTube , Flickr , Apple trailers , IMDB , Hulu Desktop and more through integrated plugins .
Primarily aimed at the Linux platform it is also possible to run on OSX and for the determined on Windows .
It can be controlled via keyboard and mouse , IR remote , network app or through it's web interface ( Android and IOS apps are planned ) .
Freevo can record and display TV from multiple sources ( analogue , DVB - C / T/S , set top box via composite with IR blaster ) .
You can pause or rewind live TV and schedule recordings via the on screen EPG or remotely via a web interface .
Update : Freevo.org shutting down
Now 6 years later , Freevo is more or less dead .
Kodi is so much more powerfull and Python 2.x is end - of - support .
Therefore , I will not renew the freevo.org domain .
I will update the code on github with my current mail address and copy the homepage to sf.net and github .
I still use some parts of the code and maybe , one day , some parts my get a new life .
As for me , I hope to update kaa.metadata to Python 3.x and create a thetvdb library out of kaa.webmetadata .
Good Bye and thanks to all people involved in the project Dischi Freevo in a dormant state I failed to get a release of Freevo 2 out .
I changed too much , a complete rewrite and some parts are also written three or four times .
My fault , I know -- an error made years ago and when noticed , it was too late to change it .
And since I started a new job four years ago my time working on Freevo got smaller and smaller every month .
Jason also is completely busy with his job .
I still say Freevo 2 is ready to use , but I will not release it .
I 'm not sure it works with the latest clutter or gstreamer , I only know it works for me .
It lacks many important features such as DVD playback ( I have a BluRay Player ) and TV recording .
I do not need it and I do n't have time to code it .
Besides that , XBMC has a much bigger community , UPnP is enough for many people ( even I use NAS plus BubbleUPnP plus TV sometimes ) and new development such as Chromecast will reduce Freevo 's usefulness even further .
I will continue to use Freevo 2 , I may even write an Android client for it ( after learning Python with Freevo which was useful for getting my current job , hacking Android is a good next step ) , but I see no real future for Freevo without a live community and more people hacking code .
If someone contributes something , I will add it .
If someone needs help to get Freevo 2 running , I will provide it .
Since we also lack someone maintaining the server we host and I do not want to pay for something we do n't need , I shut it down .
This means the SVN and the Wiki will be gone .
The code is already on github and will remain there .
A static backup of the 1.x Wiki is linked here ; the 2.0 WiKi is more outdated and wrong than correct and therefore , it is not visible here .
The mailing list on SF will continue and so will the mail server hosting freevo.org and all mail addresses will continue to be valid .
Maybe after some time someone resurrects Freevo .
I would love to pass the maintainership over to someone just as I took it over from Krister years ago .
Maybe someone takes the kaa - stuff and writes something new and better .
I 'm happy to assist and I think the same is true for Jason .
Maybe I will release something someday based on the current code .
It was a great time , I learned a lot and it was much fun .

1997 : Princess Diana dies in Paris crash
Diana , Princess of Wales , has died after a car crash in Paris .
She was taken to hospital in the early hours of Sunday morning where surgeons tried for two hours to save her life but she died at 0300 BST .
In a statement Buckingham Palace said the Queen and the Prince of Wales were " deeply shocked and distressed " .
Prince Charles broke the news of their mother 's death to Princes William and Harry at Balmoral Castle in Scotland where the royal family had been spending the summer .
The accident happened after the princess left the Ritz Hotel in the French capital with her companion , Dodi Al Fayed - son of Harrods owner , Mohammed Al Fayed .
Criminal investigation
Dodi Al Fayed and the vehicle 's driver were also killed in the collision in a tunnel under the Place de l'Alma in the centre of the city .
The princess ' Mercedes car was apparently being pursued at high speed by photographers on motorbikes when it hit a pillar and smashed into a wall .
Mr Al Fayed and the chauffeur died at the scene but the princess and her bodyguard were cut from the wreckage and rushed to hospital .
The French authorities have begun a criminal investigation and are questioning seven photographers .
Tributes to the princess have been pouring in from around the world .
Speaking from his home in South Africa , the princess ' brother , Lord Charles Spencer , said his sister had been " unique " .
While it was not the time for recriminations there was no doubt the press had played a part in her death , the earl added .
Hundreds of mourners have gathered at the princess ' London home , Kensington Palace and many have laid flowers at the gates .

What 's wrong with a file system ( and also what 's right )
Despite its unobtrusiveness , the file system on a Macintosh , Unix , or Windows machine is capable of storing any data that may be represented in digital form .
For example , suppose that you are storing a mailing list in a file system file .
If you accept the limitation that no e-mail address or person 's name can contain a newline character , you can store one entry per line .
Then you could decide that no e-mail address or name may contain a vertical bar .
That lets you separate e-mail address and name fields with the vertical bar character .
So far , everything is great .
As long as you are careful never to try storing a newline or vertical bar , you can keep your data in this " flat file . "
Searching can be slow and expensive , though .
What if you want to see if " philg@mit.edu " is on the mailing list ?
You computer must read through the entire file to check .
Let 's say that you write a program to process " insert new person " requests .
It works by appending a line to the flat file with the new information .
Suppose , however , that several users are simultaneously using your Web site .
Two of them ask to be added to the mailing list at exactly the same time .
Depending on how you wrote your program , the particular kind of file system that you have , and luck , you could get any of the following behaviors :
Both inserts succeed .
One of the inserts is lost .
Information from the two inserts is mixed together so that both are corrupted .
All the checking account balances are stored in one file , checking .
text , and all the savings balances are stored in another file , savings .
text .
A few days later , an unlucky combination of events occurs .
Joe User is transferring $ 10,000 from his savings to his checking account .
Judy
User is simultaneously depositing $ 5 into her savings account .
One of your Perl scripts successfully writes the checking account flat file with Joe 's new , $ 10,000 higher , balance .
It also writes the savings account file with Joe 's new , $ 10,000 lower , savings balance .
However , the script that is processing Judy 's deposit started at about the same time and began with the version of the savings file that had Joe 's original balance .
It eventually finishes and writes Judy 's $ 5 higher balance but also overwrites Joe 's new lower balance with the old high balance .
Where does that leave you ?
$ 10,000 poorer and wishing you had Concurrency Control .
After a few months of programming and reading operating systems theory books from the 1960s that deal with mutual exclusion , you 've solved your concurrency problems .
Congratulations .
However , let 's suppose that this is an Internet business circa 2003 and therefore you 're running it out of your mom's house with the server under the living room sofa .
You 're feeling sleepy so you heat up some coffee in the microwave and simultaneously toast a bagel in the toaster oven .
The circuit breaker trips .
You hear the sickening sound of disks spinning down .
You scramble to get your server back up and , glancing at the logs notice that Joe User was back transferring $ 25,000 from savings to checking .
What happened to Joe 's transaction ?
The good news for Joe is that your Perl script had just finished crediting his checking account with $ 25,000 .
The bad news for you is that it had n't really gotten started on debiting his savings account .
Maybe it is time to look at what the transaction processing experts have come up with over the last 50 years ...
What Do You Need for Transaction Processing ?
Data processing folks like to talk about the " ACID test " when deciding whether or not a database management system is adequate for handling transactions .
An adequate system has the following properties :
Atomicity Results of a transaction 's execution are either all committed or all rolled back .
All changes take effect , or none do .
That means , for Joe User 's money transfer , that both his savings and checking balances are adjusted or neither are .
Consistency
The database is transformed from one valid state to another valid state .
This defines a transaction as legal only if it obeys user - defined integrity constraints .
Illegal transactions are n't allowed and , if an integrity constraint can't be satisfied then the transaction is rolled back .
For example , suppose that you define a rule that , after a transfer of more than $ 10,000 out of the country , a row is added to an audit table so that you can prepare a legally required report for the IRS .
Perhaps for performance reasons that audit table is stored on a separate disk from the rest of the database .
If the audit table 's disk is off - line and can't be written , the transaction is aborted .
Isolation
The results of a transaction are invisible to other transactions until the transaction is complete .
For example , if you are running an accounting report at the same time that Joe is transferring money , the accounting report program will either see the balances before Joe transferred the money or after , but never the intermediate state where checking has been credited but savings not yet debited .
Durability
Once committed ( completed ) , the results of a transaction are permanent and survive future system and media failures .
If the airline reservation system computer gives you seat 22A and crashes a millisecond later , it wo n't have forgotten that you are sitting in 22A and also give it to someone else .
Furthermore , if a programmer spills coffee into a disk drive , it will be possible to install a new disk and recover the transactions up to the coffee spill , showing that you had seat 22A .
That does n't sound too tough to implement , does it ?
A " mere matter of programming " as our friend Jin likes to say .
Well , you still need indexing .
Finding Your Data ( and Fast )
Flat files work okay if they are very small .
A Perl script can read the whole file into memory in a split second and then look through it to pull out the information requested .
But suppose that your on - line bank grows to have 250,000 accounts .
A user types his account number into a Web page and asks for his most recent deposits .
You 've got a chronological financial transactions file with 25 million entries .
Crunch , crunch , crunch .
Your server laboriously works through all 25 million to find the ones with an account number that matches the user's .
While it is crunching , 25 other users come to the Web site and ask for the same information about their accounts .
You have two choices : buy a 1000 - processor supercomputer or build an index file .
If you build an index file that maps account numbers to sequential transaction numbers , your server wo n't have to search all 25 million records anymore .
However , you have to modify all of your programs that insert , update , or delete from the database so that they also keep the index current .
This works great until two years later when a brand new MBA arrives from Harvard .
She asks for " a report of all customers who have more than $ 5,000 in checking or live in Oklahoma and have withdrawn more than $ 100 from savings in the last 17 days . "
It turns out that you did n't anticipate this query so your indexing scheme does n't speed things up .
Your server has to grind through all the data over and over again .
Enter the Relational Database
" Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine ( the internal representation ) .
...
Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed .
Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query , update , and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information .
" Existing noninferential , formatted data systems provide users with tree - structured files or slightly more general network models of the data .
In Section 1 , inadequacies of these models are discussed .
A model based on n-ary relations , a normal form for data base relations , and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced .
In Section 2 , certain operations on relations ( other than logical inference ) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user 's model . "
Yes , that 's right , 1970 .
What you need to do is move your Web site into the ' 70s with one of these newfangled relational database management systems ( RDBMS ) .
Actually , as Codd notes in his paper , most of the problems we 've encountered so far in this chapter were solved in the 1960s by off - the - shelf mainframe software sold by IBM and the " seven dwarves " ( as IBM 's competitors were known ) .
By the early 1960s , businesses had gotten tired of losing important transactions and manually uncorrupting databases .
They began to think that their applications programmers should n't be implementing transactions and indexing on an ad hoc basis for each new project .
Companies began to buy database management software from computer vendors like IBM .
These products worked fairly well but resulted in brittle data models .
If you got your data representation correct the first time and your business needs never changed then a 1967 - style hierarchical database was great .
Unfortunately , if you put a system in place and subsequently needed new indices or a new data format then you might have to rewrite all of your application programs .
From an application programmer 's point of view , the biggest innovation in the relational database is that one uses a declarative query language , SQL ( an acronym for Structured Query Language and pronounced " ess- cue - el " or " sequel " ) .
Most computer languages are procedural .
The programmer tells the computer what to do , step by step , specifying a procedure .
In SQL , the programmer says " I want data that meet the following criteria " and the RDBMS query planner figures out how to get it .
There are two advantages to using a declarative language .
The first is that the queries no longer depend on the data representation .
The RDBMS is free to store data however it wants .
The second is increased software reliability .
It is much harder to have " a little bug " in an SQL query than in a procedural program .
Generally it either describes the data that you want and works all the time or it completely fails in an obvious way .
Another benefit of declarative languages is that less sophisticated users are able to write useful programs .
For example , many computing tasks that required professional programmers in the 1960s can be accomplished by non-technical people with spreadsheets .
In a spreadsheet , you do n't tell the computer how to work out the numbers or in what sequence .
You just declare " This cell will be 1.5 times the value of that other cell over there . "
RDBMSes can run very very slowly .
Depending on whether you are selling or buying computers , this may upset or delight you .
Suppose that the system takes 30 seconds to return the data you asked for in your query .
Does that mean you have a lot of data ?
That you need to add some indices ?
That the RDBMS query planner made some bad choices and needs some hints ?
Who knows ?
The RDBMS is an enormously complicated program that you did n't write and for which you do n't have the source code .
Each vendor has tracing and debugging tools that purport to help you , but the process is not simple .
Good luck figuring out a different SQL incantation that will return the same set of data in less time .
If you can't , call your hardware supplier and ask them to send you 16 more CPUs with maximum RAM .
Alternatively , you can keep running the non-relational software you used in the 1960s , which is what the airlines do for their reservations systems .
How Does This RDBMS Thing Work ?
In fact , this is all you need to know to be a Caveman Database Programmer : A relational database is a big spreadsheet that several people can update simultaneously .
How can multiple people use a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel at the same time ?
Would they take turns at the keyboard and mouse ?
Fight over the keyboard and mouse ?
Crowd their heads together in front of the display ?
We need to get rid of the mouse / keyboard / windows idea of interaction .
It does n't make sense when there are many simultaneous users .
Instead imagine that the database management system is sitting by itself in a dark closet .
Users write down their requests on strips of paper and slip them under the door .
A request might be " create a table " , " insert a row into a table " , " update an existing row in a table " , " give me a report of the information contained in all the rows in a table that meet the following criteria ... " .
If a request requires an answer , the database chews on the question for awhile , then pushes a paper report back out underneath the door .
Let 's examine how this works in greater detail .
Each table in the database is one spreadsheet .
You tell the RDBMS how many columns each row has .
For example , in our mailing list database , the table has two columns : name and e-mail .
Each entry in the database consists of one row in this table .
An RDBMS is more restrictive than a spreadsheet in that all the data in one column must be of the same type , e.g. , integer , decimal , character string , or date .
Another difference between a spreadsheet and an RDBMS is that the rows in an RDBMS are not ordered .
You can have a column named row_number and ask the RDBMS to return the rows ordered according to the data in this column , but the row numbering is not implicit as it would be with a spreadsheet program .
If you do define a row_number column or some other unique identifier for rows in a table , it becomes possible for a row in another table to refer to that row by including the value of the unique ID .
Here 's what some SQL looks like for the mailing list application :
create table mailing_list ( email varchar ( 100 ) not null primary key , name varchar ( 100 ) ) ;
mailing_list
email
not null
name
email
primary key
mailing_list
email
mailing_list
That is the joy and the agony of SQL .
Inserting two innocuous looking words can cost you a factor of 1000 in performance .
Then inserting a sentence ( to create the index ) can bring you back so that it is only a factor of two or three .
( Note that many RDBMS implementations , including Oracle , automatically define an index on a column that is constrained to be unique . )
Anyway , now that we 've executed the Data Definition Language " create table " statement , we can move on to Data Manipulation Language : an INSERT .
insert into mailing_list ( name , email ) values ( ' Philip Greenspun ' , 'philg@mit.edu ' ) ;
alter table mailing_list add ( phone_number varchar ( 20 ) ) ;

SQL > insert into phone_numbers values ( 'ogrady@fastbuck.com ' , ' work ' , '( 800 ) 555-1212 ' ) ; ORA - 02291 : integrity constraint ( SCOTT.SYS_C001080 ) violated - parent key not found
mailing_list
phone_numbers
mailing_list
insert into mailing_list ( name , email ) values ( ' Philip Greenspun ' , 'philg@mit.edu ' ) ; insert into mailing_list ( name , email ) values (' Michael O'' Grady ' , 'ogrady@fastbuck.com ' ) ; insert into phone_numbers values ( 'ogrady@fastbuck.com ' , ' work ' , '( 800 ) 555-1212 ' ) ; insert into phone_numbers values ( 'ogrady@fastbuck.com ' , 'home ' , '( 617 ) 495-6000 ' ) ; insert into phone_numbers values ( 'philg@mit.edu ' , 'work ' , '( 617 ) 253-8574 ' ) ; insert into phone_numbers values ( 'ogrady@fastbuck.com ' , ' beper ' , '( 617 ) 222-3456 ' ) ;
The first three INSERTs work fine , but what about the last one , where Mr. O'Grady misspelled " beeper " ?
ORA -02290 : check constraint ( SCOTT.SYS_C001079 ) violated
check ( number_type in ( ' work ' , 'home ' , ' cell ' , 'beeper ' ) )
Let 's say we want all of our data out .
Email , full name , phone numbers .
The most obvious query to try is a join .

As with DELETE , it is not a good idea to play around with UPDATE statements unless you have a WHERE clause at the end .
SQL the Hard Way
create table history ( sample_time date , -- when did the cookie have the value sample_value integer ) ; insert into history values ( to_date ( ' 1998-03-01 23:59:00 ' , 'YYYY -MM-DD HH24: MI:SS ' ) , 75000 ) ; insert into history values ( to_date ( ' 1998-03-02 23:59:00 ' , 'YYYY -MM-DD HH24: MI:SS ' ) , 76000 ) ; insert into history values ( to_date ( ' 1998-03-03 23:59:00 ' , 'YYYY -MM-DD HH24: MI:SS ' ) , 77000 ) ; insert into history values ( to_date ( ' 1998-03-04 23:59:00 ' , 'YYYY -MM-DD HH24: MI:SS ' ) , 78000 ) ; select * from history order by sample_time ; SAMPLE_TIM SAMPLE_VALUE
----------
------------
1998-03-01 75000 1998-03-02 76000 1998-03-03 77000 1998-03-04 78000
Note : the Oracle DATE data type is able to represent time down to one - second precision , sort of like an ANSI TIMESTAMP(0 ) ; in Oracle 9i and newer you 'd probably use the timestamp type .
Now that we are accumulating the data , it should be easy to write a report page , eh ?
It turns out to be very easy to extract the rows of a table in order , as in the last SELECT above .
However , it is impossible for a row to refer to " the last row in this SELECT " .
You could have write a C# , Java , PL / SQL , or VB procedure to walk through the rows in order , just setting things up on the first pass through the loop and then doing the appropriate subtraction for subsequent rows .
However , running into the arms of an imperative computer language is considered untasteful in the SQL world .
In SQL you start by thinking about what you want and working backward .
If the history table has N rows , we want an interval table with N - 1 rows .
Each row should have the start time , end time , time interval , and cookie interval .
Any time that you need information from two different rows in the database , the way to get it is with a JOIN .
Since there is only one underlying table , though , this will have to be a self - join :
SQL > select h1.sample_time , h2.sample_time from history h1 , history h2 ; SAMPLE_TIM SAMPLE_TIM
----------
----------
1998-03-04 1998-03-04 1998-03-01 1998-03-04 1998-03-02 1998-03-04 1998-03-03 1998-03-04 1998-03-04 1998-03-01 1998-03-01 1998-03-01 1998-03-02 1998-03-01 1998-03-03 1998-03-01 1998-03-04 1998-03-02 1998-03-01 1998-03-02 1998-03-02 1998-03-02 1998-03-03 1998-03-02 1998-03-04 1998-03-03 1998-03-01 1998-03-03 1998-03-02 1998-03-03 1998-03-03 1998-03-03 16 rows selected .
A note about syntax is in order here .
In an SQL FROM list , one can assign a correlation name to a table .
In this case , h1 and h2 are assigned to the two copies of history from which we are selecting .
Then we can refer to h1.sample_time and get " the sample_time column from the first copy of the history table . "
The main problem with this query , though , has nothing to do with syntax .
It is the fact that we have 13 rows too many .
Instead of N - 1 rows , we specified the Cartesian product and got NxN rows .
We 've successfully done a self - join and gotten all the pairings we need , but also all possible other pairings .
Now it is time to specify which of those pairings we want in our final report :
select h1.sample_time as s1 , h2.sample_time as s2 from history h1 , history h2 where h2.sample_time > h1.sample_time ; S1 S2 ----------
----------
1998-03-01 1998-03-04 1998-03-02 1998-03-04 1998-03-03 1998-03-04 1998-03-01 1998-03-02 1998-03-01 1998-03-03 1998-03-02 1998-03-03 6 rows selected .
select h1.sample_time as s1 , h2.sample_time as s2 from history h1 , history h2 where h2.sample_time = ( select min( h3.sample_time ) from history h3 where h3.sample_time > h1.sample_time ) order by h1.sample_time ; S1 S2 ----------
----------
1998-03-01 1998-03-02 1998-03-02 1998-03-03 1998-03-03 1998-03-04 3 rows selected .
select min( h3.sample_time ) from history h3 where h3.sample_time >
h1.sample_time
Given the correct row pairings , it is easy to add syntax to the SELECT list to subtract the times and cookie values .
select h1.sample_time as s1 , h2.sample_time as s2 , h2.sample_time - h1.sample_time as gap_time , h2.sample_value - h1.sample_value as gap_cookie from history h1 , history h2 where h2.sample_time = ( select min( h3.sample_time ) from history h3 where h3.sample_time > h1.sample_time ) order by h1.sample_time ; S1 S2 GAP_TIME GAP_COOKIE

Formulating SQL queries can be an art and most programmers need time and experience to get good at thinking declaratively .
Brave New World
Object systems contribute to software reliability and compactness by allowing programmers to factor their code into chunks that are used as widely as possible .
For example , suppose that you are building a catalog Web site to sell magazines , videos , books , and CDs .
It might be worth thinking about the data and functions that are common to all of these and encapsulating them in a product class .
At the product level , you 'd define characteristics such as product_id , short_name , and description .
Then you 'd define a magazine subclass that inherited all the behavior of product and added things like issues_per_year .
Programmers using modern computer languages like Smalltalk and Lisp have been doing this since the mid-1970s , but the idea has only recently caught on in the RDBMS world .
Here are some table definitions for the Illustra system , a derivative of the U.C. Berkeley Postgres research project :
create table products of new type product_t ( product_id integer not null primary key , short_name text not null , description text ) ;
products
create table magazines of new type magazine_t ( issues integer not null , foreign_postage decimal ( 7,2 ) , canadian_postage decimal ( 7,2 ) ) under products ; create table videos of new type video_t ( length_in_minutes integer ) under products ;
* insert into magazines ( product_id , short_name , description , issues ) values ( 0 , 'Dissentary ' , 'The result of merging Dissent and Commentary ' , 12 ) ; * insert into videos ( product_id , short_name , description , length_in_minutes ) values ( 1 , 'Sense and Sensibility ' , 'Chicks dig it ', 110 ) ; * select * from products ;
--------------------------------------------------- |product_id | short_name | description |
---------------------------------------------------
|1 | Sense and Sensibility | Chicks dig it | |0 | Dissentary | The result o*|
---------------------------------------------------
create function find_price ( product_t ) returns numeric with ( late ) as return 5.50 ;
create function find_price ( magazine_t ) returns numeric as return $ 1.issues * 1.50 ; create function find_price ( video_t ) returns numeric as return $ 1.length_in_minutes * 0.25 ;
* select short_name , find_price ( products ) from products ;
--------------------------------------- |short_name |find_price |
---------------------------------------
|Sense and Sensibility | 27.50 | | Dissentary | 18.00 |
---------------------------------------
create function order_code ( product_t ) returns text as return $ 1. product_id : : text || '- -' || trim ( leading from find_price ( $ 1 ) :: text ) || '--' || substring ( $ 1.short_name from 1 for 5 ) ; * select order_code ( products ) from products ;
----------------- |order_code |
-----------------
|1--27.50--Sense|
|0--18.00 -- Disse|
-----------------
find_price
order_code
This Brave New World sounds great in DBMS vendor brochures , but the actual experience is n't always wonderful .
Back in 1995 , we were using Illustra and built ourselves a beautiful table hierarchy more or less as described above .
Six months later we needed to add a column to the products table .
E.F .
Codd understood back in 1970 that data models had to grow as business needs change .
But the Illustra folks were so excited by their object extensions that they forgot .
The system could n't add a column to a table with dependent subclasses .
What should we do , we asked the support folks ?
" Dump the data out of all of your tables , drop all of them , rebuild them with the added column , then load all of your data back into your tables . "
Uh , thanks ...
Braver New World
After 20 years , the market for object database management systems is about $ 100 million a year , less than 1 percent the size of the relational database market .
Why the fizzle ?
Object databases bring back some of the bad features of 1960s pre-relational database management systems .
The programmer has to know a lot about the details of data storage .
If you know the identities of the objects you 're interested in , then the query is fast and simple .
But it turns out that most database users do n't care about object identities ; they care about object attributes .
Relational databases tend to be faster and better at producing aggregations based on attributes .
Keep in mind that if object databases ever did become popular , it would make using Java or C# as a page scripting language much more attractive .
Currently the fancy type systems of advanced computer languages are n't very useful for Internet application development .
The only things that can be stored persistently , i.e. , from page load to page load , in an RDBMS are numbers , dates , and strings .
In theory it is possible to write a complex Java program that does an SQL query , creates a huge collection of interlinked objects , serves a page to the user , then exits .
But why would you ?
That collection of interlinked objects must be thrown out as soon as the page is served and then built up again the next time that user requests a page , which could be 1 second later or 2 days later .
If on the other hand the objects created by a C# or Java program were efficiently made persistent it would make applying these big hammers to Web scripting a lot less ridiculous .
Choosing an RDBMS Vendor
Here are some factors that are important in choosing an RDBMS to sit behind a Web site :
cost / complexity to administer lock management system full - text indexing option maximum length of VARCHAR data type support
Cost / Complexity to Administer
Sloppy RDBMS administration is one of the most common causes of downtime at sophisticated sites .
If you are n't sure that you 'll have an experienced staff of database administrators to devote to your site , then you might want to consider whether an " Enterprise RDBMS " is really for you .
The Big Three RDBMSes are IBM's DB2 , Microsoft SQL Server , and Oracle .
All offer tremendous flexibility in configuration with an eye towards building 64 - CPU systems that process absurd numbers of simultaneous transactions .
All claim that their latest and greatest management tools make installing and administering the system is so easy a 10 - year - old could do it .
If these claims were true the local Starbucks would be clogged with unemployed database administrators .
Midget competition is provided by the open - source PostgreSQL , which can't be scaled up to the large sizes and performance of the commercial RDBMSes but is inherently fairly simple to install and maintain ( and it is free ! ) .
MySQL is popular among Linux users and because it has a SQL front - end it is often confused with an RDBMS .
In fact it does not provide the ACID transaction guarantees and therefore would more properly be lumped in with Microsoft Access and similar desktop tools .
Lock Management System
All database management systems handle concurrency problems with locks .
Before an executing statement can modify some data , it must grab a lock .
While this lock is held , no other simultaneously executing SQL statement can update the same data .
In order to prevent another user from reading half - updated data , while this lock is held , no simultaneously executing SQL statement can even read the data .
Readers must wait for writers to finish writing .
Writers must wait for readers to finish reading .
This kind of system , called pessimistic locking , is simple to implement , works great in the research lab , and can be proven correct mathematically .
The only problem with this approach is that it often does n't work in the real world of hurried developers and multiple simultaneous users .
What can happen is that an admin page on an ecommerce site , for example , contains a reporting query that takes an hour to run and touches all the rows in the users and orders tables .
While this query is running none of the users of the public pages can register or place orders .
With the Oracle RDBMS , readers never wait for writers and writers never wait for readers .
If a SELECT starts reading at 9:01 and encounters a row that was updated ( by another session ) at 9:02 , Oracle reaches into a rollback segment and digs up the pre-update value for the SELECT ( this preserves the Isolation requirement of the ACID test ) .
A transaction does not need to take locks unless it is modifying a table and , even then , only takes locks on the specific rows that are to be modified .
This is the kind of RDBMS locking architecture that you want for a Web site and , as of 2003 , it is provided only by Oracle and Postgres .
Full - text Indexing Option
select * from magazines where description like ' % dogs % ' ;
A full - text indexer builds a data structure ( the index ) on disk so that the RDBMS no longer has to scan the entire table to find rows containing a particular word or combination of words .
The software is smart enough to be able to think in terms of word stems rather than words .
So " running " and " run " or " dog " and " dogs " can be interchanged in queries .
Full - text indexers are also generally able to score a user - entered phrase against a database table of documents for relevance so that you can query for the most relevant matches .
Finally , the modern text search engines are very smart about how words relate .
So they might deliver a document that did not contain the word " dog " but did contain " Golden Retriever " .
This makes services like classified ads , discussion forums , etc. , much more useful to users .
Relational database management system vendors are gradually incorporating full - text indexing into their products .
Sadly , there is no standard for querying using this index .
Thus , if you figure out how to query Oracle Text for " rows relating to ' running ' or its synonyms " , the SQL syntax will not be useful for asking the same question of Microsoft SQL Server with its full - text indexing option .
Maximum Length of VARCHAR Data Type
In practice , current commercial systems are very bad at storing unexpectedly long data , e.g. , Oracle only lets you have 4,000 characters in a VARCHAR .
This is Okay if you 're building a corporate accounting system but bad for a public Web site .
You can't really be sure how long a user 's classified ad or bulletin board posting is going to be .
The SQL standard provides for a LONG data type to handle this kind of situation and modern database vendors often provide character large - objects ( CLOB ) .
These types theoretically allow you to store arbitrarily large data .
However , in practice there are so many restrictions on these columns that they are n't very useful .
For example , you can't use them in a SQL WHERE clause and thus the above " LIKE ' % dogs % ' " would be illegal .
You can't build a standard index on a LONG column .
You may also have a hard time getting strings into or out of LONG columns .
The Oracle SQL parser only accepts string literals up to 4,000 characters in length .
After that you have to use special C API calls .
Currently , PostgreSQL seems to be the leader in this area .
You can declare a column to be character varying or text and store a string up to about 1 GB in size .
Paying an RDBMS Vendor
This is the part that hurts .
The basic pricing strategy of database management system vendors is to hang the user up by his heels , see how much money falls out , take it all and then ask for another $ 50,000 for " support " .
Ideally , they 'd like to know how much your data are worth and how much profit you expect from making them available and then extract all of that profit from you .
In this respect , they behave like the classical price - discriminating profit - maximizing monopoly from Microeconomics 101 .
Classically an RDBMS license was priced per user .
Big insurance companies with 1000 claims processors would pay more than small companies with 5 .
The Web confused the RDBMS vendors .
On the one hand , the server was accessible to anyone anywhere in the world .
Thus , the fair arrangement would be a $ 64,000 per CPU unlimited user license .
On the other hand , not too many Web publishers actually had $ 64,000 per CPU lying around in their checking accounts .
So the RDBMS vendors would settle for selling a 5 - user or 8 - user license .
If you can't stomach the prices of commercial systems , take a long hard look at PostgreSQL .
Developing a credible threat to use PostgreSQL may result in some pricing flexibility from commercial RDBMS salesmen .
Performance
There are several ways to achieve high performance .
One is to buy a huge multi-processor computer with enough RAM to hold the entire data model at once .
Unfortunately , unless you are using PostgreSQL , your RDBMS vendor will probably give your bank account a reaming that it will not soon forget .
The license fee will be four times as much for a four - CPU machine as for a one - CPU machine .
Thus it might be best to try to get hold of the fastest possible single - CPU computer .
If you are processing a lot of transactions , all those CPUs bristling with RAM wo n't help you .
Your bottleneck will be disk spindle contention .
The solution to this is to chant " Oh what a friend I have in Seagate . "
Disks are slow .
Very slow .
Literally almost one million times slower than the computer .
Therefore the computer spends a lot of time waiting for the disk (s ) .
You can speed up SQL SELECTs simply by buying so much RAM that the entire database is in memory .
However , the Durability requirement in the ACID test for transactions means that some record of a transaction will have to be written to a medium that wo n't be erased in the event of a power failure .
If a disk can only do 100 seeks a second and you only have one disk , your RDBMS is going to be hard pressed to do more than about 100 updates a second .
The first thing you should do is mirror all of your disks .
If you do n't have the entire database in RAM , this speeds up SELECTs because the disk controller can read from whichever disk is closer to the desired track .
The opposite effect can be achieved if you use " RAID level 5 " where data is striped across multiple disks .
Then the RDBMS has to wait for five disks to seek before it can cough up a few rows .
Straight mirroring , or " RAID level 1 " , is what you want .
The next decision that you must make is " How many disks ? "
The Oracle9i DBA Handbook ( Loney 2001 ; Oracle Press ) recommends a 7x2 disk configuration as a minimum compromise for a machine doing nothing but database service .
Their solutions start at 9x2 disks and go up to 22x2 .
The idea is to keep files that might be written in parallel on separate disks so that one can do 2200 seeks / second instead of 100 .
Here 's Kevin Loney 's 17 - disk ( mirrored X2 ) solution for avoiding spindle contention :
Disk Contents 1
Oracle software 2 SYSTEM tablespace 3 RBS tablespace ( roll - back segment in case a transaction goes badly ) 4 DATA tablespace 5 INDEXES tablespace ( changing data requires changing indices ; this allows those changes to proceed in parallel ) 6 TEMP tablespace 7 TOOLS tablespace 8 Online Redo log 1 , Control file 1 ( these would be separated on a 22 - disk machine ) 9 Online Redo log 2 , Control file 2 10 Online Redo log 3 , Control file 3 11 Application Software 12 RBS_2 13 DATA_2 ( tables that tend to be grabbed in parallel with those in DATA ) 14 INDEXES_2 15 TEMP_USER 16 Archived redo log destination disk 17 Export dump file destination disk
[ Another area in which the commercial databases can be much faster than PostgreSQL is dealing with 50 simultaneous transactions from 50 different users .
In a naive RDBMS implementation these would be lined up in order , a log of transaction 1 would be written to disk and then the database user who requested it would be notified of success , transaction 2 would then be processed and , after another disk write , be declared a success .
Oracle , however , is smart enough to say " about 50 transactions came in at nearly the same moment so I 'll write one big huge block of info to disk and then get back to all 50 users informing them of the success of their transaction . "
Thus performance in theory could 50 times better with Oracle ( 1 disk write ) than with PostgreSQL ( 50 disk writes ) . ]
Do n't forget to back up
At noon , an ugly mob of users assembles outside your office , angered by your addition of a Flash animation splash page .
You send one of your graphic designers out to explain how " cool " it looked when run off a local disk in a demo to the vice - president .
The mob stones him to death and then burns your server farm to the ground .
You manage to pry your way out of the rubble with one of those indestructible HP Unix box keyboards .
You manage to get the HP disaster support people to let you use their machines for awhile and confidently load your backup tape .
To your horror , the RDBMS chokes up blood following the restore .
It turned out that there were linked data structures in foo.db and bar.db .
Half of the data structures ( the ones from foo.db ) are the " old pre-transaction version " and half are the " new post - transaction version " ( the ones from bar.db ) .
One transaction occurring during your backup has resulted in a complete loss of availability for all of your data .
Maybe you think that is n't the world 's most robust RDBMS design but there is nothing in the SQL standard or manufacturer 's documentation that says Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server can't work this way .
Full mirroring keeps you from going off - line due to media failure .
But you still need snapshots of your database in case someone gets a little excited with a DELETE FROM statement or in the situation described above .
There are two ways to back up a relational database : off - line and on - line .
For an off - line backup , you shut down the databases , thus preventing transactions from occurring .
Most vendors would prefer that you use their utility to make a dump file of your off - line database , but in practice it will suffice just to back up the Unix or Windows filesystem files .
Off - line backup is typically used by insurance companies and other big database users who only need to do transactions for eight hours a day .
Each RDBMS vendor has an advertised way of doing on - line backups .
It can be as simple as " call this function and we 'll grind away for a couple of hours building you a dump file that contains a consistent database but minus all the transactions that occurred after you called the function .
Here 's an Oracle example :
exp DBUSER / DBPASSWD file=/exportdest/foo.980210.dmp owner=DBUSER consistent=Y
What if your database is too large to be exported to a disk and can't be taken offline ?
Here 's a technique that is used on the Oracle installation at Boston Children 's Hospital :
Break the mirror .
Back up from the disks that are off - line as far as the database is concerned .
Reestablish the mirror .
The lessons here are several .
First , whatever your backup procedure , make sure you test it with periodic restores .
Second , remember that the backup and maintenance of an RDBMS is done by a full - time staffer at most companies , called " the dba " , short for " database administrator " .
If the software worked as advertised , you could expect a few days of pain during the install and then periodic recurring pain to keep current with improved features .
However , dba's earn their moderately lavish salaries .
No amount of marketing hype suffices to make a C program work as advertised .
That goes for an RDBMS just as much as for a word processor .
Coming to terms with bugs can be a full - time job at a large installation .
Most often this means finding workarounds since vendors are notoriously sluggish with fixes .
Another full - time job is hunting down users who are doing queries that are taking 1000 times longer than necessary because they forgot to build indices or do n't know SQL very well .
Children 's Hospital has three full - time dbas and they work hard .
Let 's close by quoting Perrin Harkins .
A participant in a discussion forum asked whether caching db queries in Unix files would speed up his Web server .
Here 's Perrin 's response :
" Modern databases use buffering in RAM to speed up access to often requested data .
You do n't have to do anything special to make this happen , except tune your database well ( which could take the rest of your life ) . "
Summary
You and your programmers will make mistakes implementing transaction processing systems .
You are better off focusing your energies on the application and leaving indexing , transactions , and concurrency to a database management system .
The most practical database management software for Web sites is a relational database management system with a full - text indexer .
If you can program a spreadsheet , you can program an RDBMS in SQL .
RDBMSes are slow .
Prepare to buy a big machine with a lot of disks .
RDBMSes , though much more reliable than most user - written transaction processing code , are not nearly as reliable as a basic Web server pulling static files out a file system .
Prepare to hire a half - or full - time database administrator if your database will grow to any significant size .

Reader 's Comments
It is unfortunate this page helps perpetuate myths and misinformation about databases .
For example :
It says there are RDBMSes in the market today .
There is only one , Alphora Dataphor .
All the others are SQL DBMSes , and SQL violates too many fundamentals of the relational model to be called a relational language .
Therefore , SQL DBMSes are n't RDBMSes .
As a consequence , it says RDBMSes are slow .
SQL DBMSes are slow , but RDBMSes need n't be , as the relational model defines that the physical model can be quite different than the logical model of the database .
Thus , one can keep a clean logical model yet implement all kinds of optimisations in the physical level .
That is what SQL optimisers try to do , but due to SQL complexity and confusion of the logical and physical model they fail .
-- Leandro Guimarães Faria Corcete Dutra , May 18 , 2004
I agree with the above poster in that the author is confusing SQL DBMS or a relational database .
However I can forgive the author for this because this is so common in the industry ( even if he is from MIT ) .
The slowness of most databases while inserting is because most database systems force the data to disk after each insert .
This is a safety ' feature ' not a performance ' bug ' and has nothing to do with performance .
Simply wrapping the entire load process in a trasaction should have fixed the problem .
The Author 's comments about PostgreSQL not being scalable is commercial systems are incorrect .
PostgreSQL implemented write - ahead - logging ( which is what he is talking about ) with version 7.2 in 2002 .
Also , PostgreSQL has MVCC which makes it very , very scabale ... some commerical implementations do not even have this , for example MS SQL server .

Phil is somewhat incorrect about vendors supporting row - level locking support .
MS has supported row - level locking since SQL Server 7.0 .
In practice , its transaction manager decides how granular a lock will be according to the parameters of the query .
If too many individual rows are going to be locked in a transaction ( according to some calculated " lock escalation threshold " ) , the entire table will be locked .

Brian Kruth StoryJust one year ago , David Ryan was an international banker with HSBC .
He had done stints in Bahrain , China , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Turkey , and London over the course of 17 years .
However , by the time Ryan had landed in New York City two and a half years ago , he says , " the buzz for me was gone . "
Exciting as a two - decade spin around the globe once was , Ryan says , his chosen profession was simply , " not as exciting as it had been . " Ryan entered into what he calls , " a pretty long period of reflection " regarding his career path and future .
Like many suffering from job ennui , Ryan was ready to do something new , the question was how to do it .
Having nursed a lifelong love of dogs , Ryan realized that he was interested in potentially moving in that direction but was unsure of how exactly he could turn his passion into a sustainable career .
Enter a two - year - old Portland ( Ore. ) - based company called Vocation Vacations , a business that gives people the opportunity to " test drive " their dream jobs .
Creating temporary but intense mentor / apprenticeship experiences , Vocation Vacations enlists professionals from a variety of fields -- everything from winemakers and makeup artists to architects and sword makers -- and pairs them with people who fantasize about leaving their day jobs and want spend a few days in a profession that they had previously thought beyond their reach .
Last April , Ryan signed up to do a two - and - a - half - day vocation working with a doggie day - care provider in Massachusetts .
The following month , he spent three days working with a dog trainer in Oregon .
Fairly quickly , Ryan figured out that he preferred training to day care and was confident that he could start his own business in the field .
Moreover , Ryan says the experience helped him to realize that he did n't have to abandon the skills he developed as a banker .
Rather , he says : " It became obvious to me that there were a lot of kennels and trainers that were very good with animals , but business was not their specialty .
"
In June , Ryan resigned from HSBC and enrolled in a dog- training school in Missouri for five months to get certified .
In January , he launched Beyond Dog Training in Rye , N. H. " It really sounds weird , " he says .
" But that two - to three - day experience has really been a lynchpin .
" Vocation Vacations was started by Brian Kurth in 2004 after he made the leap from unhappy employee to dream - job entrepreneur .
At the time , Kurth says he was burnt out working for Ameritech in Chicago and logging in three hour commutes .
" I did n't hate corporate life , or my job or my boss , " he says .
" But I hated the lifestyle .
I wanted to do something more fulfilling .
I was tired of going to dinner parties [ where ] people would talk about their exciting lives as architects or photographers and I worked at the phone company .
People 's heads hit their spaghetti plates when I told them .
Nobody cared , and neither did I .
" So in 2000 , Kurth quit his job .
In quick succession , he worked for a dot - com , got laid off when the economy imploded , and then sold his house and spent six months driving across the country , eventually settling in Portland .
That city did n't have much in the way of industry and was in the midst of a recession , so he ended up working on a vineyard doing product marketing and sales for a family winery .
Kurth found that there was something immeasurably rewarding about stepping outside of his routine and trying something new .
Inspired , he came up with the concept and business plan for Vocation Vacations .
The idea is relatively simple .
Participants pay anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand ( transportation , lodging , etc. , are n't included ) to experience life as , say , a chocolatier , a fashion designer , or a race - car driver .
The time spent immersed in their fantasy job allows them to get a 360 - degree perspective without the risk of quitting their own jobs or investing heavily in a new career .
Laura
Thomas says she 's " miserable " in her job as a business - operations developer for a government contractor in Alexandria , Va .
" My boss knows I 'm not happy , and he 's looking for something else [ for me at the company ] , but there is n't a lot of opportunity for growth .
"
Not quite ready to quit altogether , Thomas recently took a turn through Vocation Vacations , shadowing a hotel concierge and a hotel general manager for two days .
" It was really great .
I got to be completely immersed in the environment .
I got to see the good , the bad , and the ugly . "
And best of all , she says : " I really got to see it firsthand before taking the plunge and quitting my job .
" Kurth , something of a dream - job rainmaker , has created a niche industry built on the hopes and aspirations of people like Thomas .
Catering to the unhappily employed , Kurth has discovered an untapped market .
Indeed , according to a survey by the Conference Board , a management and marketplace information nonprofit agency based in New York , less than half of all Americans say they 're satisfied with their jobs .
Taken in 2002 , the survey reveals the highest level of discontent since they first conducted the study in 1995 -- with job satisfaction dropping from 60.9 % then to 47.2 % presently .
To date , Vocations Vacations has placed hundreds of people in the U.S. and Britain in occupations ranging from brewmaster and art - gallery director to music producer and cattle rancher .
" We 're on our way to thousands , " says Kurth .
The company has doubled the number of its available mentors to 500 , with another 40 to 50 new possibilities in the works in such fields as Broadway producer , meteorologist , and zookeeper .
Kurth attributes much of his success to listening to prospective clients and addressing their areas of interest with relevant mentors and programs .
Recently , there has been a growing demand and interest in marine biology , aquarium managers , and voiceovers .
However , Kurth says there 's a limit to the types of career vocations he will pursue .
For instance , he says he recently turned down an offer from a pornography producer who wanted to become a mentor .
Kurth himself is expanding his own dream .
He just signed a deal with Warner Books for a how - to vocational lifestyle book .
On April 27 , the Travel Channel is debuting a new series based on his " vocationers " called This Job 's a Trip , chronicling the vacationing adventures of his clients .
Kurth is also working on what he calls " ancillary products , " such as DVDs , T - shirts , and a possible magazine .
He says his expansion is all based on the " vacationing " lifestyle -- no longer daydreaming but living the dream .
Just ask David Ryan , who has had to hire additional trainers for his fast - growing business .
" I get a lot of broad smiles when I tell people that I went from a million - a- year banker to a dog guy , " he says .
No doubt he 's smiling back , all the way to the bank .
THE OPIATES OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES [ NASSIM TALEB :]
As a practitioner of science , I am opposed to teaching religious ideas in schools .
But , it seems to me somewhat misplaced energy — more of a fight for principles than for any bottom line .
As an empirical skeptic , I would like to introduce a dimension to the debates : relevance , consequence , and our ability to correct a situation — in other words the impact on our daily lives .
My portrait of the perfect fool of randomness is as follows : he does not believe in religion , providing entirely rational reasons for such disbelief .
He opposes scientific method to superstition and blind faith .
But alas , human skepticism appears to be quite domain - specific and relegated to the classroom .
Somehow the skepticism of my fool undergoes a severe atrophy outside of these intellectual debates :
1 ) He believes in the stock market because he is told to do so .
— automatically allocating a portion of his retirement money .
And he does not realize that the manager of his mutual fund does not fare better than chance — actually a bit worse , after the ( generous ) fees .
Nor does he realize that markets are far more random and far riskier that he is being made to believe by the high priests of the brokerage industry .
He disbelieves the bishops ( on grounds of scientific method ) , but replaces him with the security analyst .
He listens to the projections by security analysts and " experts " — not checking their past accuracy and track record .
Had he checked them he would have discovered that these are no better than random — often worse .
2 ) He believes in the government 's ability to " forecast " economic variables , oil prices , GNP growth , or inflation .
Economics provide very complicated equations — but our historical track record in predicting is pitiful .
It does not take long to verify these claims ; simple empiricism would suffice .
Yet we have confident forecasts of social security deficits by both sides ( democrats and republicans ) twenty and thirty years ahead !
This Scandal of Prediction ( which I capitalize ) is far more severe than religion , simply because it determines policy making .
Last time I checked no religious figure was consulted for long - term business and economic projections .
3 ) He believes in the " skills " of the chairmen of large corporations and pays them huge bonuses for their " performance " .
He forgets that theirs are the least observable contributions .
This skills attribution is flimsy at best — there is no account of the possible role of luck in his success .
4 ) His scientific integrity makes him reject religion but he believes the economist because " economic science " has the word " science " in it .
5 ) He believes in the news media providing an accurate representation of the risks in the world .
They do n't .
By what I call the narrative fallacy , the media distorts our mental map of the world by feeding us what can be made into a story that can be squeezed into our minds .
For instance ( preventable ) cancer , not terrorism remains the greatest danger .
The number of persons killed by hurricanes , while consequential , is dwarfed by that of the thousands of isolated daily victims dying in hospital beds .
These are not story - worthy , implying ; the absence of attention on the part of the press maps into disproportionately reduced resources allocated to their welfare .
The difference between actual , actuarially defined risks and the perception of dangers is enormous — and , sadly , growing with the globalization and the media , and our increased vulnerability to visual stimuli .
Now I am not arguing that one should ignore the side effects of religion — given the accounts of past intolerance .
But it was in these columns that Richard Dawkins , echoing the great Peter Medawar , recommended bright students to find something worthwhile " to be smart about " .
Likewise , I suggest exerting our skepticism " where it matters " .
Why ?
Because , alas , cognitively , our resource to doubt is rather limited .
We humans are naturally gullible — disbelieving requires an extraordinary expenditure of energy .
It is a limited resource .
I suggest ranking the skepticism by its consequences on our lives .
True , the dangers of organized religion used to be there — but they have been gradually replaced with considerably ruthless and unintrospective social - science ideology .
Religion gives many people solace .
On a personal note I have to admit that I feel more elevated in cathedrals than in stock markets — be it only on aesthetic grounds .
If I were going to be gullible about a subject , I would rather pick one that is the least harmful to my future — and one that is rewarding to my thirst for aesthetics .
It is high time to worry about the opiates of the middle class .

■パズルでめぐる奇妙な数学ワールド の第14章の『アコーディオンは「欠陥楽器」か！？』からのネタ。平面図形として三角形は「唯一」の安定した多角形なのだそうである。「安定」とは、辺の長さはそのままで形が変わらないということである。たとえば、長方形は辺の長さはそのままで異なる形になりうる（下図）。では立体ではどうか。辺の長さだけが不変でいいなら直方体は潰れるように形は変わりうることは容易にわかるが、面の形を不変とするならどうだろう。
ほ ぼ200年にわたって、数学者は多面体の安定性やら何やらに悩まされてきた。多面体とは有限個の面を持つもので、面のそれぞれは多角形で、辺を境界にして二つずつがつながっている。従来、三角形の面だけでつくられる多面体はすべて安定していると考えられてきたが、最近になってそれが間違いだとわかった。このあと紹介するように、どの面もほんのわずかでさえ曲げたりゆがめたりすることなく、形状を「自由」に変えられる多面体が存在する。
で、実際にこの多面体の展開図が紹介されていた。面同士が貫通して自由に動ける必要のあるもの（辺のみを針金が作れば実際に作れる）はラウル・プリカールが、面同士が貫通しないものはコネリーが発見した。紹介されてあるのは、クラウス・シュテッフェンが構造を単純化したもので、展開図のキャプションには「シュテッフェンによる形状が変わる多面体」とある。
展開図を見ただけでは、どのような立体になるのか想像がつかない。仕事柄、病院内に待機していなければならないが、特にすることがないという時間もあるわけで、深夜で他の先生方がほとんどいないときを見計らって作ってみた。まずは、展開図を拡大コピーして、厚紙に張り、きれいにハサミで切り取る。
切り取ったあとは、線に従って山折りと谷折りで折り目をつける。辺と辺を接着するのに、のりしろありとのりしろなしの２バージョンつくったが、のりしろなしのほうが仕上がりはきれいになった。どうせ糊ではつきが悪く、結局はセロハンテープを使うことになるので、はじめから全部セロハンテープでつくったほうがまし。できあがりは以下の写真の通り（のりしろなしバージョン）。
少しよがんでいるのはご愛嬌。動かしてみると、確かにペコペコ動く。作りが悪くてたわんでいるだけではないかという気もしなくもないが、まあ少なくとも感じはつかめた。実はこのような多面体は動かしても体積が不変であるそうな。『アコーディオンは「欠陥楽器」か！？』という章のタイトルはそのことに由来する。確かに、動かしてみると、離れる面と面の部分もあれば、近づく面と面の部分もあり、まあ多分体積は一定なんだろうなという気にさせる。面白いのはこの多面体を煙を満たし、形状を変えてみて煙が吐き出されないことを実験で確認した先生がいたこと。もちろん証明にはならないものの、数学の世界にも実験があるのだなあと感心した次第。
追記
別の角度から。凹部分がある。ただ、写真じゃたくさんあってもよく分からんと思う。
Over the last six months , Sprint has been trying to get bloggers ( like me ) to write about their new Power Vision Network by sending us free phones and letting us download music and movies and use the phones for free .
That ’s rather nice of them , but honestly , I have a really strong aversion to writing about things just because some PR person wanted me to .
Basically , there ’s no better way to make me not want to write about something than to ask me to write about it .
I accepted the free phone because , gosh , well , it ’s a free phone , but I decided that I simply would n’t write about it no matter how much I liked it .
As it turns out , I had the opposite problem .
The phone they sent me , an LG Fusic , is really quite awful , and the service , Power Vision , is tremendously misconceived and full of dumb features that do n’t work right and cost way too much .
So I ’m going to review the dang phone anyway , even though if anybody from Sprint is paying attention they ’re going to lose their lunch and some executive bonehead over there is going to go nuts and I sincerely hope that this does n’t put an end to the entire free - phones - for - bloggers boondoggle , because I ’d hate to get beaten up at Etech next year by all the other bloggers who would hate me for spoiling all the fun .
Now , on to the review .
I was pretty excited to try out this phone because I ’ve been longing for one that could double as a decent MP3 player .
Most days , I get to work via a combination of subway and walking , which takes about half an hour , and listening to podcasts makes the commute much more pleasant .
So I ’ve been carrying a phone ( a Motorola RAZR ) and an iPod ( Nano ) with me everywhere .
Merging the two into one device would be great .
When it finally arrived , the physical appearance of the phone was rather disappointing .
If you ’ve been spoiled by Motorola ’s latest phones , or the seamless , screwless , elegant iPod , the LG Fusic will strike you as butt - ugly .
Where a Motorola RAZR has a solid case made out of almost sensual matte - black steel that just feels great , the LG Fusic is made out of the cheapest kind of gray plastic , the same material you find on a $ 3 toy .
Where Motorola goes to great lengths to hide the screws , and minimize bumps and seams , the LG Fusic has dozens of ugly protuberances , gaps , holes , screws , seams , etc .
Worst of all , the LG Fusic has no less than three of those evil , flimsy , rubbery plug - caps that are connected to the phone by the thinnest of filaments .
You know , those stupid rubber plugs that you have to pull away to plug anything into the phone , and then they just dangle there like chicken wattles ( when they ’re not getting in the way of the thing you ’re trying to plug in ) for a couple of weeks until they finally tear off .
The phone is almost twice as thick as a RAZR .
It comes with a break - offable front plate which can be used to change the accent color of the very front of the phone .
Your choices are Barbie Pink , Barbie Green , Barbie Blue , and Black which would be the only stylish choice , if only it did n’t clash so badly with the rest of the phone .
( Believe me , it is hard to make black clash with anything , but LG did it . )
Overall this phone seriously looks like a Fisher Price toy , not a top - of - the - line cell phone .
OK , maybe you ’re not so vain that appearances are a big deal .
I tried to get over it .
I really did .
I promise I wo n’t talk about the style thing any more .
I opened the clamshell and turned on the phone .
The screen lit up instantly !
Wow , something about this phone is nice .
Oh , wait a minute .
What ’s going on there ?
The main screen shifts between pictures of Mount Fuji , the Eiffel Tower , etc .
That ’s charming .
But what ’s that bus ?
There ’s a cheezy little black and white child ’s drawing of a bus bouncing up and down in front of the cheezy tourist pictures .
Again with the Fisher Price Toy theme .
The first thing I try to do is find a better screen saver .
Everything looks like some kid ’s 6th grade BASIC graphics project .
Oooh , look , colored squares flying around .
Terrible clip art of a “ DJ ” .
One of the screen savers is called “ Funny . ”
You get a silhouette of a lizard climbing around on a pink background .
Bwa ha ha !
That is funny .
TO TWO YEAR OLDS .
OK , ok , I promised I ’d stop talking about style .
On to UI design .
The main menu was really , really confusing .
The first thing you see when you click on the Menu button is that you missed some alerts :
Although , it turns out , you did n’t , that ’s just the name of the menu item that comes up first .
You ca n’t see all the icons at once because someone had the bright idea of using a weird 3 - D perspective , and the currently selected icon comes zooming out in front , covering up some of the other icons .
All the unselected icons are shown in silhouette , so at first they just look like a background .
It took me quite a while to figure out just what the menu was and how to find things I wanted from the main menu .
But do n’t worry … there are random bits of sparkle that fly around on the screen .
That ’s the important part .
The random bits of sparkle , again , a 6th grader ’s BASIC graphics project .
Now , on to the whole reason I wanted this phone : the MP3 player .
There ’s no desktop integration , no ITunes integration , no feature for subscribing to Podcasts , nothing like that .
When you plug the phone into your computer using the supplied USB cable , it thinks you want to use the phone as a modem .
Yes , one day I might want to do that , that ’s true , but for now I just wanted to get MP3s onto the thing .
Somehow , somewhere , I managed to stumble on a menu that made the phone act like a USB hard drive .
Tada !
The phone pops up on my computer looking like a hard drive .
And then there was already a MUSIC folder there , and I could drag MP3 files in .
Yay !
I downloaded TWiT episode 69 manually and headed off to the subway to listen to it .
Wait … I need headphones .
Ahh , here they are .
Wait a minute .
The headphone cord is only about 8 inches long .
Am I supposed to hold the phone up to my chin to listen to music ?
Oh , I see , there are two cords .
You have to plug the headphone cord into the microphone cord and plug that into the phone .
Now it ’s long enough .
OK , it ’s awkward , but I can live with that .
To listen to the MP3s you ’ve downloaded :
Hit the MENU button Find the ON DEMAND menu item ( I demand to hear MP3s ! )
Nope , that ’s not what you wanted Hit BACK Nothing happens ( darn ! )
OK , try END
Do you want to exit this application ?
YES is already highlighted .
Click OK .
Huh ?
The application did n’t exit .
Click END again .
YES is already highlighted … oh… wait a minute !
Maybe NO is highlighted ?
There ’s no way to tell the difference .
There are two choices , one is white and one is blue , it ’s hard to see which is highlighted .
Fool around with the cursor keys until you ’re pretty sure that YES is highlighted .
This is confusing , because the two - item menu wraps around , so the up button moves down and the down button moves up , or vice versa .
Remove the battery and put it in again .
That should get you back to the main menu .
Media player ?
Is that what you want ?
Yeah , there ’s something in here called Music …
It has about 50 options .
What do they mean ?
SIRIUS hits ?
MUSIC CHOICE ?
SIRIUS MUSIC ?
Some of them are listed as My Channels and some are listed as Available Channels .
Which is which ?
The UI here is really getting confusing .
OK , none of those options lets you listen to MP3s .
It turns out there ’s something called MUSIC on the Main Menu .
Ahh , that brings up the happy “ booting Java ” screen which is so heartwarming .
Thank you Sun Microsystems for bringing programming language advertisements into consumer electronics .
The Java applet has two tabs , “ Store ” and “ Player . ”
Try buying a song .
It ’s $ 5 for 3 songs .
That ’s a ripoff , Sprint .
Apple already established that the fair price for one song is $ 0.99 .
OK , I just want to listen to Leo Laporte , dammit .
Maybe the Player tab ?
Gotta choose between “ All My Music ” and “ Create Playlist … ” .
W00t !
THERE ’S TWiT !
Click on it , and listen to TWiT .
All right .
TWiT is more than an hour long , and I only listened to half of the episode by the time I got home .
Luckily , there ’s a handy PAUSE button on the outside of the clamshell .
Unluckily , it does n’t work .
Pressing it once informs you that the buttons are locked , and you have to press and hold the pause button to unlock .
So you do that , and the key guard goes off , and you press the pause button again , and nothing happens , so you press it again , and finally you ’ve paused the music .
In the meantime , if , say , hypothetically , you were pausing because you live in a country where the police brutalize people , and a policeman was brutalizing you , and you wanted to stop the music so you could try to figure out what the policeman wanted and perhaps there was some way if you could just hear him that you could get him to stop beating you with a riot bat , you ’re already DEAD by the time you figure out how to make the pause button actually pause .
While the MP3 player is paused , the backlight on the external display just wo n’t go off .
So inadvertently , the phone almost completely runs down its battery overnight staying in “ Pause ” mode .
Why not turn the phone off overnight ?
Well , because then I ’d have to listen to the first half of TWiT all over again .
Ca n’t you fast forward ?
No .
Does n’t it remember where you ’re up to like an iPod ?
No .
Pause is your only hope .
The next morning , with a single bar of battery juice left , I got into the subway and resumed listening to the podcast , and I ’m a wise guy , so I decided to see what the battery looked like , and of course , the phone lost power , oops , lost my place in the Podcast .
Put back the battery .
Turn on the phone .
Go into the MP3 player again .
There ’s no signal , and , guess what ?
You ca n’t get into to the MP3 player unless you can establish a network connection to the Sprint Music Store .
Even to play your own MP3s !
OK , so this is an MP3 player that does n’t really work on the subway and wo n’t work on a plane , the two places I ’m most likely to listen to MP3s .
Not very appealing .
A little bit more exploring and I discovered that there ’s another entirely separate MP3 player on this device .
It ’s hard to find .
You have to go to Tools , then Memory Card , then to the Music folder , and another MP3 player starts up which you can use to listen to your MP3s .
For this player , you do n’t have to be on the network , so it works in the subway , but — get this — the minute you close the clamshell , the music stops !
I am literally not making this up .
There are two bad MP3 players on this device , neither one of which remembers where you ’re up to , neither one of which can be used on the subway with the phone folded in my pocket , neither one of which has a fast - forward feature .
I have literally never seen such a useless MP3 player .
OK , onward .
Yes , you can watch movies on this phone .
For example , for $ 5.95 a month , you can get something called mFLIX .
Until you pay the money , there ’s no way to find out what mFLIX is or what it is you ’re getting for your $ 5.95 .
I ’ll tell you what you get : a bunch of garbage film - student videos that nobody would ever vote up on YouTube , in a tiny blurry window that reminds you of QuickTime 1.0 ( “ look !
It ’s on a computer but it ’s moving ! ” ) .
That was disappointing .
I thought this thing was supposed to have full length movies somewhere .
Ah yes , how about “ MSpot Movies ? ”
It says I ’m going to get “ Full - length Hollywood movies . ”
Only $ 6.95 a month .
Yes .
Buy buy buy .
( Thankfully Uncle Sprint is paying for this ) .
Oh look … you can preview before you commit to spending !
Clicking Preview brings up a page that says PREVIEW with a “ Done ” button .
That ’s it .
OK , maybe they do n’t want me to preview .
Fine .
After you click Buy , you ’re thrown back to a main menu somewhere and then you have to remember what the hell you bought and go find it again .
Annoying UI , again .
OK , MSpot Movies .
A menu comes up with a bunch of folders :
Animaland
Classic Cartoons
Freestyle Motorcross
Nightmare In Blood
The Projectionist
Heart of a Champion
One Love
I do n’t understand .
Are these movie titles ?
Not movie titles I ’ve ever heard of .
Yep , it ’s true .
What you get for $ 7 / month is about 10 movies that seem to be in the public domain .
Literally nothing worth watching , least of all on a smudgy 1 5/8 ” ( diagonal ) , pixelated screen .
I did , actually , as a part of my sacred duty as a reviewer , try to watch a whole movie .
I could only stand about the first 1 /3rd of it , and the battery was dying , and the phone was getting too hot to hold .
I cannot imagine anybody finding any value in MSpot Movies .
If Sprint makes any money off of them , it ’s probably by mistake .
This service is literally as much of a scam as those X - Ray glasses they used to advertise in comic books to steal a few bucks from some little kids .
The only kind of content you might really want to watch on this device is the stuff you find on YouTube , or video podcasts like The Show with zefrank .
But that ’s not what Sprint gives you .
Instead they give you $ 7 / month , ripoff , non-previewable scammy garbage .
A long time ago , I was working on MSN 1.0 , and there was a long line of content providers working to make deals with Microsoft to put their content on the Microsoft Network , but in those days , it was n’t clear exactly who should be paying who , so hardly any deals got made .
In the meantime , the whole Web thing happened , where anybody could provide content without signing a deal with a Microsoft executive , and there was tons of content , and some of it was garbage , yes , but some of it was good , and we found the good stuff , and it floated to the top , and all was well , but Sprint does n’t get this .
They relish their ability to serve as the gatekeeper to what they hope will become a new medium , because the gatekeeper gets to charge tolls .
And it ’s 2006 , and I almost ca n’t believe I ’m writing this , because way back in 2000 I wrote almost exactly the same thing about WAP , and how cell phone companies keep failing to insert themselves as toll collectors because they ’re so darn clueless about how the Internet works , and about the value of many - to - many networks instead of broadcast networks .
And now suddenly someone at Sprint read some book by Scoble and then they read Malcolm Gladwell ’s theories of tipping points in the airport and Hey Presto !
Maybe we can make this work by finding the tipping point people !
You know , the bloggers !
And all the bloggers get free cell phones , and Sprint gets tons of publicity , but frankly all the publicity in the world is not going to help them foist on us a product that is utterly pathetic .
The phones they send us are so lame there is literally no area you can go into without being disappointed and shocked at just how shoddy everything is and how much it costs and what a rip off scam they ’re trying to run here with the music that costs too much and the movies that you do n’t want to watch on the screen that makes them unwatchable and you just KNOW that if you call to cancel the extra $ 7 / month , their customer service department is going to give you the phone menu runaround and then put you on hold for an hour and then you ’ll get some cancellation specialist with an incomprehensible accent who will spend 15 minutes trying to talk you out of canceling the useless service until you just give up and let them have the goddamned $ 7 a month .
No amount of pampering bloggers and calling them Ambassadors is going to get around the fact that you ’re sending us plastic junk phones that look like bath toys .
( Hey , does it float ? )
All the “ tipping point ” theories in the world wo n’t protect Sprint from the basic truth that the LG Fusic user interface could basically serve as an almost complete textbook for a semester - long course in user interface design , teaching students of usability exactly what NOT to do .
Wait a minute .
Wait just one minute .
Maybe I completely missed the point .
Maybe this phone is for four year olds !
It all makes sense now !
The nonsensical menus do n’t matter — four year olds ca n’t read !
The toy - like appearance — duh !
The ripoff movies — who cares , as long as the kids press BUY by mistake and the parents keep paying the bills !
Now I get it .
So really the only stupid thing that Sprint did is to send this phone to a bunch of know - it - all , hipster - wannabe , pretentious early - adopter engadget - reading 41 - year - old bloggers , with our pretentious black iPods and our sleek gun metal RAZRs and our MacBook Pros and our so - called “ Podcast ” listening habits , watching zefrank tell potty jokes about The Decider .
No no no no no .
This phone is for 4 year olds , albeit spoiled 4 year olds with rich parents .
They ’ll love the colors , the plastic , the impossible UI , they can watch the one 1936 movie that inadvertently fell into the public domain in class when the teacher is getting boring , and they sure as heck are n’t going on a subway with that thing .
Ohhhhhhhhh kay .
I gave the phone to a friend ’s 4 - year - old .
NEVER MIND !
Broadside was the code selected by the British army forces for the extensive operation carried out on June 29 , 1946 in the Land of Israel .
During the operation , which was named in Hebrew " Black Shabbat , " about 2,700 people were arrested , including some of the leaders of the Jewish community ( such as former Prime Minister Moshe Sharett , Rabbi Y. L. Fishman , former Ministers Dov Yosef and David Remez , and others ) , underground arms caches were uncovered and many weapons were confiscated .
Kibbutz Yagur suffered a particularly harsh blow .
Many of its members were arrested , the big defense weapon cache on its grounds was uncovered , and more than 300 rifles , 100 mortars , 78 pistols and a considerable amount of bullets were confiscated .

Painter Yaakov ( Yakush ) Zen from Kibbutz Ein Hahoresh was among the Hagana activists who were arrested in the raid .
In his painting album he perpetuated hard and colorful moments from the Latrun detention camp .
Some 60 years have passed , and the paintings are still alive , illustrating a story that caused a stir and a rebellion in the Jewish community .
A special event to mark the 60th anniversary of the Black Shabbat incidents will be held in Kibbutz Yagur on Thursday , June 29 .
The event , sponsored by the Association of Hagana Veterans , will begin at 3:30 p.m .
As part of the plan , a tour of the big weapons cache , the exhibition " community under siege , " a lecture by Dr. Mordechai Naor and a short film .

FOR years , Tom Wolfe has been lambasting America 's literary establishment for ignoring the best story around — their own country .
America positively pullulates with fantastic stories .
And yet its writers , ensconced in their Manhattan lofts and writer - in - residence residences , can't be bothered to look further than the ends of their noses .
“ At this weak , pale , tabescent moment in the history of American literature , ” Mr Wolfe wrote in one of his manifestos on behalf of literary realism , “ we need a battalion , a brigade , of Zolas to head out into this wild , bizarre , unpredictable , hog - stomping , Baroque country of ours and reclaim it as literary property . ”
Yet the trouble with turning yourself into an American Zola is that you immediately expose yourself to being trumped by reality .
The better sort of critics are forever lambasting Mr Wolfe for going over the top — for using cartoon characters to exaggerate the evils of modern society — but the truth is the opposite .
Mr Wolfe 's satire pales into insignificance compared with the hog - stomping reality that he tries to capture .
Take Mr Wolfe 's most recent novel , “ I Am Charlotte Simmons ” ( 2004 ) .
The book poked fun at the macho culture of an elite university that was closely modelled on the would - be Princeton of the South , Duke .
This fictional institution liked to think of itself as being at the cutting edge of political correctness , all unisex lavatories and gay - pride demos .
But in reality it was ruled by an elite caste of jocks — brainless bores who spent their lives drinking themselves senseless or wam - bam - thank - you - mamming with any co-ed they could get their hands on .
And none were more boorish and brainless than the lacrosse players .
Elaine Showalter , a retired Princeton professor , duly published a tut - tutting review accusing Mr Wolfe of missing the “ feminist revolution ” and engaging in the “ grossest of stereotypes ” .
Yet Mr Wolfe 's story is tame by comparison with recent events at the real Duke .
It seems that a month or so ago a group of — yes — lacrosse players hired a couple of strippers to entertain them of an evening .
Unfortunately , what might have been a routine night of booze and bawdiness ended in turmoil .
One of the strippers accused three lacrosse players of raping and assaulting her .
The players strenuously denied the charges , and subsequent DNA tests have turned up negative .
The event was heavily overladen with racial tension ; the lacrosse players were almost all white while the two strippers were black .
It also had a Baroque twist .
Two hours or so after the alleged rape , a partygoer sent an e-mail saying that he wanted to lure more strippers to his room in order to kill and skin them .
Or take Mr Wolfe 's last - but - one novel , “ A Man in Full ” ( 1998 ) .
The book opens with a lavish description of a quail hunt among the Georgia nouveaux riches .
Many reviewers found the satire as over the top as the prose style ( “ Quail !
The aristocrat of American wild game !
It was what the grouse and the pheasant were in England and Scotland and Europe — only better ! ” ) .
But it is impossible to read that scene today without finding it a bit tame .
Why did n't Mr Wolfe include a major Republican politician ?
Why did n't he get the politician to shoot an elderly lawyer in the face — and then try to hush the whole matter up ?
Or take his first novel , “ The Bonfire of the Vanities ” ( 1987 ) .
This has survived the reality test much better than the other two books .
But hardly a week goes by without somebody coming along and trying to outdo one of Bonfire 's characters .
“ Bonfire ” introduced the world to Peter Fallow , a tabloid journalist who had turned freeloading into a career .
Last week , the New York Daily News disclosed that Jared Paul Stern , a gossip columnist for the New York Post , recently solicited $ 220,000 from a billionaire investor , Ron Burkle , in return for a year 's “ protection ” against damaging items appearing in the paper 's Page Six column .
“ Bonfire ” also introduced the world to the Reverend Bacon , a black politician who uses any excuse to engage in agitprop and race - baiting .
Two weeks ago , Cynthia McKinney , a black congresswoman from Georgia , got into an altercation with a Capitol Hill police officer : he tried to stop her from entering the building because she did n't have the right ID and she allegedly responded by hitting him with a cell - phone .
Instead of apologising she organised an anti-racist rally at Howard University , complete with cameo appearances by Harry Belafonte and Danny Glover , to denounce the “ inappropriate touching and stopping of me — a female , black , progressive congresswoman . ”
The inadequacy of fiction
Mr Wolfe is not alone .
The best of the would - be Zolas to join Mr Wolfe in trying to reclaim America as “ literary property ” is Christopher Buckley , the son of William Buckley , the founder of the modern conservative movement and long - time chronicler of Washington , DC .
The younger Mr Buckley recently hit the literary equivalent of the jackpot .
Not only has Hollywood turned one of his novels , “ Thank You for Smoking ” into a film ; it comes out at a time when the Abramoff affair has focused everyone 's attention on the lobbying industry .
But it is hard not to watch the film without feeling let down .
It is amusing to see the hero labouring on behalf of the tobacco industry and lunching with his “ merchants of death ” , lobbyists from the alcohol and firearms industries .
But this is tame stuff compared with what Mr Abramoff got up to .
He not only bilked Indian tribes of tens of millions of dollars , but got evangelical Christians to help him in the bilking .
This is not a vote in favour of the sort of literary navel - gazing that Mr Wolfe condemned .
But it is a warning that it is almost impossible to outdo reality in a country as richly bizarre as the United States .
Perhaps writers should leave those unfinished novels locked up in the drawer — and content themselves instead with the humble craft of journalism .
The AJAX response : XML , HTML , or JSON ?
Since my last AJAX project I 've increasingly been wondering about the " ideal " output format for the AJAX response .
Once you 've succesfully fired an AJAX request , what sort of response should the server give ?
An XML document ?
An HTML snippet ?
A JSON string which is converted to a JavaScript object ?
Or something else ?
In this entry I 'd like to discuss the three formats , with examples , and ask you which format you 've used in your practical AJAX applications .
( This article has been translated into Spanish . )
When you receive an additional bit of data for your AJAX application , you should start up a script that incorporates this extra data into your single - page HTML interface .
Of course the form of the script heavily depends on the format of the data you 've received .
Should you search an XML document for specific nodes and copy their text to the HTML ?
Or did you receive an HTML snippet that should be added to the page " as is " ?
In my last project I received some data as XML documents and some as HTML snippets , and they needed different kinds of scripts to write the data to the page .
Both formats , and both kinds of scripts , have their advantages and disadvantages .
After I 'd finished the application I delved a bit deeper into JavaScript Object Notation , invented by Douglas Crockford and recently chosen as the default output format for most Yahoo services , and I think I like it , although I 've never yet used it .
I 'm left wondering : which format is the best ?
Which format do you think is best , or at least most useful in a practical AJAX environment ?
Example
As an example of the three formats , let 's take an AJAX - driven online bookstore .
We ask for the JavaScript books they have in store , and by a staggering coincidence they have exactly those three JavaScript books I keep lying around on my desk .
An AJAX request returns these three results , and you have to incorporate them in the HTML of your single - page interface .
I 'll give examples of all the three formats , and a simple script to show the results in a < div id =" writeroot " > .
XML documents
The first and most obvious choice for an output format is the XML document .
The original idea behind the XMLHTTP object was the importing of XML documents , so it 's no surprise that most of the attention went to XML and it 's still considered the default output format .
Example
The server returns this XML document :
< books > < book > < title > JavaScript , the Definitive Guide < / title > < publisher > O' Reilly </ publisher > < author > David Flanagan </ author > < cover src= " /images/cover_defguide.jpg " /> < blurb > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .</ blurb > </book > < book > < title > DOM
Scripting </ title > < publisher > Friends of Ed</ publisher > < author > Jeremy Keith </ author > < cover src= " /images/cover_domscripting.jpg " /> < blurb > Praesent et diam a ligula facilisis venenatis .</ blurb > </ book > < book > < title > DHTML
Utopia : Modern Web Design using JavaScript & DOM </ title > < publisher > Sitepoint </ publisher > < author > Stuart Langridge </ author > < cover src= " /images/cover_utopia.jpg " /> < blurb > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .</ blurb > </ book > </ books >
We need this script to show the results in our < div > .
function setDataXML ( req ) { var books = req.responseXML.getElementsByTagName(' book ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ;i< books.length ;i++ ) { var x = document.createElement ( ' div ' ) ; x.className = ' book ' ; var y = document.createElement ( 'h3 ' ) ; y.appendChild(document.createTextNode( getNodeValue( books [ i ] , ' title ' ) ) ) ; x.appendChild(y ) ; var z = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; z.className = ' moreInfo ' ; z.appendChild(document.createTextNode (' By ' + getNodeValue( books [ i ] , 'author ' ) + ' , ' + getNodeValue( books [ i ] , 'publisher ' ) ) ) ; x.appendChild(z ) ; var a = document.createElement ( 'img ' ) ; a.src = books[i].getElementsByTagName( ' cover ' ) [ 0].getAttribute('src ' ) ; x.appendChild(a ) ; var b = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; b.appendChild(document.createTextNode( getNodeValue( books [ i ] , 'blurb ' ) ) ) ; x.appendChild(b ) ; document.getElementById('writeroot').appendChild(x ) ; } } function getNodeValue ( obj , tag ) { return obj.getElementsByTagName(tag ) [0].firstChild.nodeValue ; }
Rather a lot of code , as you see .
Although the W3C DOM gives us full access to both the XML document from the server and the HTML document the data should be shown in , it does n't give us an elegant , simple way of extracting exactly that data we need : we have to delve into the XML document time and again .
It 's here that XSLT would come in handily , since this language is meant precisely to convert an XML document to another kind of XML , and since XHTML is XML , we can also use it to create Web page snippets .
I have n't studied XSL ( T ) since 1999 , though , and doubtless there are many minor compatibility issues that I 'd have to solve before getting a workable demo .
We 'll leave XSLT for another time .
Advantages
The most important advantage of XML is that it 's the most easily readable format for other humans .
A secondary advantage is that XML has been around for quite a while and that many developers are already accustomed to it .
Saying " I 'd like your server side script to return an XML document " wo n't cause raised eyebrows , while saying " I 'd like the script to return a JSON object " might .
Disadvantages
The JavaScript required to insert the data into the HTML page is quite verbose .
I wrote a little convenience function getNodeValue ( ) to get rid of the most verbose and boring part of the script : reading out the text in an XML tag .
Nonetheless the script wo n't ever win a beauty contest .
HTML snippets
The second , and maybe the most interesting , output format is an HTML snippet .
Note that I call it a snippet , since we do not receive a complete HTML page .
Instead , we get exactly that HTML that has to be inserted into our < div > .
Example
The server returns this HTML snippet :
< div class= " book " >
< h3 > JavaScript , the Definitive Guide </ h3 > < p class= " moreInfo " >
By David Flanagan , O'Reilly </ p> < img src= " /images/cover_defguide.jpg " /> < p > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
</ p> </div> < div class= " book " >
< h3>DOM Scripting </h3 > < p class= " moreInfo " >
By Jeremy Keith , Friends of Ed</ p> < img src= " /images/cover_domscripting.jpg " /> < p >Praesent et diam a ligula facilisis venenatis .
</ p> </div> < div class= " book " >
< h3>HTML Utopia : Modern Web Design using JavaScript & DOM </h3 > < p class= " moreInfo " >
By Stuart Langridge , Sitepoint </ p> < img src= " /images/cover_utopia.jpg " /> < p > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
</ p> </div>
The script is extremely simple : just put the responseText in the innerHTML of the correct object and you 're ready .
function setDataHTML ( req ) { document.getElementById(' writeroot') .innerHTML
= req.responseText ; }
Advantages
The script 's simplicity is the most important advantage of this method .
In addition , this format offers interesting accessibility options .
We could cleverly write the server side script to build a complete , accessible HTML page that can be shown to any device .
If the request happens to be made by an AJAX script , the server side script would discard all HTML except for the search results , or the AJAX script itself would search for the results .
It 's of course perfectly possible to create similar accessibility features when you 're working with XML or JSON , but the HTML snippet format is the easiest one for this job .
Disadvantages
If the HTML snippet contains forms , or if the receiving HTML element is a form , this method give horrific errors in Explorer .
In addition , HTML snippets may become quite complicated .
The example above is n't , but as soon as you want to use advanced CSS techniques that require more elements than strictly necessary , the snippet would have to contain extra < span > s or whichever elements you need .
Thus the server side script that generates the HTML may become quite complicated .
JSON
The third method is JSON , JavaScript Object Notation .
Personally I pronounce it as " Jason " , so that yet another ancient Greek hero enters modern JavaScript development .
( And please remember that Ajax 's father Telamon accompanied Jason as an Argonaut .
Jason was older , and on the whole more succesful , than Ajax )
The general idea is to deliver a bit of text ( a string , really ) which can be interpreted as a JavaScript object .
Once it has arrived , you use JavaScript 's eval ( ) method to convert the string into a real JavaScript object , which you then read out .
Example
The server returns this JSON string :
{ " books " : [ { " book " : { " title " : " JavaScript , the Definitive Guide " , " publisher " : " O' Reilly " , " author " : " David Flanagan " , " cover " : " /images/cover_defguide.jpg " , " blurb " : " Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit . " } } , { " book " : { " title " : " DOM Scripting " , " publisher " : " Friends of Ed " , " author " : " Jeremy Keith " , " cover " : " /images/cover_domscripting.jpg " , " blurb " : " Praesent et diam a ligula facilisis venenatis . " } } , { " book " : { " title " : " DHTML Utopia : Modern Web Design using JavaScript & DOM " , " publisher " : " Sitepoint " , " author " : " Stuart Langridge " , " cover " : " /images/cover_utopia.jpg " , " blurb " : " Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit . " } } ]}
The script looks rather a lot like the XML script .
It does the same things , it just reads out the data from another format .
Here , too , XSLT might come in handy .
function setDataJSON ( req ) { var data = eval ( ' (' + req.responseText + ' ) ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ;i< data.books.length ;i++ ) { var x = document.createElement ( ' div ' ) ; x.className = ' book ' ; var y = document.createElement ( 'h3 ' ) ; y.appendChild(document.createTextNode(data.books[i].book.title ) ) ; x.appendChild(y ) ; var z = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; z.className = ' moreInfo ' ; z.appendChild(document.createTextNode(' By ' + data.books[i].book.author + ' , ' + data.books[i].book.publisher ) ) ; x.appendChild(z ) ; var a = document.createElement ( 'img ' ) ; a.src = data.books[i].book.cover ; x.appendChild(a ) ; var b = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; b.appendChild(document.createTextNode(data.books[i].book.blurb ) ) ; x.appendChild(b ) ; document.getElementById('writeroot').appendChild(x ) ; } }
Advantages
The most important advantage is that JSON circumvents JavaScript 's same - source policy , if you import the JSON file as a new < script > tag .
See Simon Willison 's example for the gory details .
JavaScript does not allow you to access documents ( be they XML or HTML ) that come from another server .
However , if you import a JSON file as a script tag you circumvent this problem , and any JSON data can be imported into any website .
It depends on your business goals whether this is a Good or a Bad Thing , but right now it 's the only data format that allows unrestricted access .
A secondary advantage is that scripts for JSON data are slightly simpler and slightly more in line with the rest of the JavaScript language than scripts for XML data .
Disadvantages
The most important disadvantage of JSON is that the format is very hard to read for humans , and that , of course , every single comma , quote , and bracket should be in exactly the correct place .
While this is also true of XML , JSON 's welter of complicated - looking syntax , like the }}]} at the end of the data snippet , may frighten the newbies and make for complicated debugging .
Your choice ?
These are the three output formats you can use for getting AJAX data .
Although I 'd love to be able to say that one of them is " the best " , I think choosing the right format depends on the circumstances , and not on any theoretical musings .
Nonetheless , let 's take a stab at finding " the best " format .
I have four questions for you :
Can you think of another output format ?
Which output format did you use in a practical , commercial AJAX application ?
( Demos and the like do n't count )
Will you switch to another output format in the future ?
If so , which one and why ?
Can you think of other advantages or disadvantages of the three formats ?
My own answers are :
No .
Mainly XML documents , a few HTML snippets .
I 'm going to study JSON carefully and might switch to it for an unrestricted access application I have in mind .
Nonetheless
I feel that XML remains the best overall format for the time being , mainly because people are used to it .
I wrote down all advantages and disadvantages I could think of .
