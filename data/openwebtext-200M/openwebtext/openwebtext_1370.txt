Back in October , as health care financing options were being hotly debated and proposals changing on an almost daily basis , one of us noticed an editorial on health care reform in West Virginia ’s Martinsburg Journal .
We were struck by the extent of opposition to financing the reform package through a tax on high earners .
West Virginia is not heavily populated with high earners — it is one of the three states with the smallest percentage of residents with incomes of $ 500,000 or more — and it therefore would n’t be greatly burdened by a tax on high earners .
So it was somewhat surprising that a West Virginia newspaper would be so strongly opposed to this financing approach .
This led us to think more generally about the redistributive implications of reform vis -à - vis the states .
This is an issue that has n’t been examined much and has n’t played a major role in the political debate .
The voting in Congress has mostly followed party lines in the House and has completely followed party lines in the Senate .
Of course , there were some last - minute deals that resulted in benefits targeted to a couple of states , but this was the usual political wheeling and dealing , not an attempt to even out the health bill ’s benefits geographically .
It was only recently that , for what we believe is the first time , the potential geographic inequities were noted in the New York Times — officials from Arizona , California , New York , and Wisconsin were quoted as being concerned that their states would wind up subsidizing insurance coverage in other states .
In light of the lack of attention to state winners and losers , we decided to take a quick - and - dirty look at which states are likely to benefit most from the expansion of health care coverage and which are likely to bear the largest share of the costs under the two proposed financing mechanisms still on the table .
We were not trying to model or fully measure the costs or benefits of reform .
Rather , we used two very simple metrics — who pays and who gets the benefits — and we measured costs and benefits from the perspective of the state as a whole .
In other words , both benefits and costs were assumed to accrue to the state as an entity ; redistribution among residents within the state was ignored .
Benefits were measured in terms of the state ’s current proportion of uninsured residents , and costs were assessed by ranking the states to see which would be hardest hit by each of two financing mechanisms — a tax on high earners and a tax on high health insurance premiums .
Our measures were crude and were driven largely by what data were readily available at the state level .
Despite these limitations , the differences in impact reveal a consistent pattern suggesting that some states do much better under certain scenarios than others .
Of particular interest , the party affiliation of the senators from each state tends to stand in direct opposition to its status as a winner or loser state .
Determining Winners and Losers
Here 's how our categorization of states works — we classified states as “ High Benefit ” if the percentage of uninsured is above the national average and as “ Low Benefit ” if the rate is less than the national average .
We then classified states by whether they would be “ High Cost ” — the top half of the distribution — for each of the financing approaches .
As Exhibit 1 shows , the states most likely to “ win ” as a result of health care reform are Arkansas , Idaho , Kentucky , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Tennessee , and Utah .
All of these states have a relatively high number of uninsured and all are in the bottom half of states in terms of cost under both financing mechanisms .
States with a high proportion of uninsured residents also included Arizona , Florida , Nevada , Texas , and Wyoming , but those states are above average in terms of the costs they would bear under each financing option .
Among the states most likely to “ lose ” are Delaware , Nebraska , and New Hampshire as well as the District of Columbia .
Each of these states has a relatively lower - than - average proportion of uninsured residents , and each would fall in the “ High Cost ” category under either of the financing options .
There are four states — Alabama , Indiana , Michigan , and Rhode Island — that while also “ Low Benefit ” are “ Low Cost ” as well .
The winner - loser status of the remaining states depends on the financing mechanism used .
Under scenarios of taxing higher - income residents , six states ( Alaska , California , Colorado , Georgia , New Jersey , and Virginia ) would “ lose ” in terms of cost but would benefit in terms of expanded coverage .
Another nine states would be high - cost and low - benefit under either of the financing options .
With a tax on high - premium insurance policies , nine states would fare the worst ; these states would be both “ Low Benefit ” and “ High Cost ” under this scenario .
The Political Alignment of Winners and Losers among States
It ’s interesting to examine the distribution of states ’ winner - loser status relative to political alignment .
Support for reform has been restricted to Democrats , with only one Republican House member supporting reform and all Senate Republicans opposing .
When we examine the seven states most likely to be winners under reform , we see a combined split in their Senate delegations of twelve Republicans versus two Democrats .
The three states most likely to lose under health care reform are collectively represented by four Democrats and two Republicans .
When we add in the group that would be losers under the income - tax option , the split becomes even stronger , with these states being represented by eighteen Democrats and four Republicans .
The overall pattern therefore shows a curious alignment : States with the most to gain under health care reform are overwhelmingly represented by Republicans , while those states likely to do worse are much more likely to have Democratic senators .
The benefits of reform , as we measure them , are higher in “ red ” states .
This is not surprising .
Medicaid eligibility correlates with lack of insurance , which in turn is our measure of potential benefit , and conservative states are less likely to provide broad social - welfare benefits for the poor .
For any given state , increasing Medicaid eligibility would redistribute resources within , but the redistributive benefits to a state from health care reform are likely to come from outside the state : those who will pay the most toward expanding coverage may disproportionately live outside the state .
We have seen little to suggest that policymakers have considered these cross -state redistributions — in terms of either the number of uninsured in a state or the proportion of the state ’s residents bearing some of the cost — as a reason for supporting or opposing reform .
And the New York Times article we have mentioned seems to bear out the conclusion that legislators are largely oblivious to the issue of geographic equity .
The article noted five state officials who expressed concern about redistribution ; these officials come from states whose representation in the Senate is split 8 - 2 in favor of Democrats who support reform .
( It is also interesting that three of the officials come from states having lower - than - average coverage rates , which are not considered relative “ losers ” in our analysis . )
While the relative degree to which a state wins or loses under reform need not be the determining factor in developing a policy position , legislators should at least be cognizant of the relative advantages and disadvantages to their state under alternative financing scenarios .
The press has legitimately noted the deals demanded by Lieberman , Nelson , and Landrieu for their support .
It is more surprising , however , that most legislators have decided their position on reform without any consideration of the relative costs and benefits to their states .
The State Supreme Court struck down a law that sought to limit the amount of marijuana a medical patient can legally possess .
The court , in a unanimous decision , ruled that state lawmakers were wrong to change provisions of a voter - approved proposition in 1996 that allowed patients with a doctor ’s recommendation to possess an unspecified amount of marijuana .
The Legislature mandated in 2003 that each patient could have a maximum of 8 ounces of dried marijuana .
The Supreme Court said only voters could change amendments that they have added to the State Constitution through the initiative process .
In the wake of Citizens United , there 's a new kind of candidate on the block -- the corporate candidate .
Presenting Murray Hill , Inc. : candidate for U.S. Congress in Maryland and the first corporation ever to run for public office .
Murray Hill , Inc. is running for the GOP 's nomination in Maryland 's 8th CD , promising a historic campaign that " puts people second ... or even third . "
As Murray Hill , Inc. says :
We bought it .
We paid for it .
And we 're going to keep it .
As a corportation , Murray Hill , Inc. can self - finance .
Update : Questions are mounting over whether or not Samuel Alito will sit on Murray Hill , Inc. 's steering committee .
Asked whether he had encouraged the corporation to run for office , Alito frowned , shook his head like a pissed off six - year - old , and mouthed " not true . "
Acting legend Dennis Hopper is losing his battle with prostate cancer after the deadly disease spread to his bones , according to a British report .
The Easy Rider veteran revealed his struggle with the illness in October , after he was admitted to hospital suffering from " severe flu - like symptoms .
"
He immediately underwent treatment at the University of Southern California , but doctors admit hopes for the 73 year old are fading after the cancer spread , according to Britain 's News of the World newspaper .
According to the publication , medics have informed Hopper - who has battled the disease since 2002 - that his cancer is incurable and that he may be facing his final days .
Of all the world 's front rank cities , few have such a carefully manicured image as Melbourne .
It 's a forward - looking metropolis almost fixated with civic self - improvement , which has used eye - catching developments and high profile sporting events to maintain its global profile .
Much more than the sum of its parts , the city regularly features high up on those global liveability lists - and deservedly so .
The last time I was in Melbourne , the city was brimming with self - confidence and pride .
Tiger Woods was in town , happily endorsing a city and state which had paid millions to attract his services .
But just as Tiger 's gilt - edged reputation has taken a hammering in the months since - oddly , it was a snapshot of one of Tiger Woods ' alleged mistresses outside his Melbourne hotel that provided the American tabloids with their smoking gun - so has Melbourne 's as a blue - ribbon city .
Last weekend , an Indian graduate student , Nitin Garg , was stabbed to death in the city , and this weekend another Indian was set upon by a gang of youths who doused him in liquid and then set him alight .
The Victoria police has uncovered no evidence that either of these attacks was racially motivated .
Nonetheless , the Indian government has decided to issue a travel advisory to its citizens singling out Melbourne as a potential trouble - spot for street crime and violence .
Controversially , an Indian newspaper , the Mail Today , went further by publishing a cartoon which depicted a Victorian police officer in the white robes and conical helmet of the KKK .
It considers laughable the assertions from the police that there is no racist angle behind the attacks .
Unfortunately for Melbourne , the latest gruesome attacks follow a spate of muggings last year against Indian students in the city .
Of course , Sydney experienced something similar , but Melbourne became the main focal point for the Indian students ' angry protest campaign .
The irony is that a persuasive case could be made that Melbourne is
Australia 's most successfully multi-racial city .
It has a polyglot population , with residents from 140 nations living side by side .
By the mid-1970s , 20 % of the city 's population spoke a non-English first language , and for much of the past decade its mayoral figurehead was John So , a popular politician who was born in Hong Kong .
With justification , Melbourne can claim , as it does on its city website , to be ' the home , workplace and leisure centre of one of the world 's most harmonious and culturally diverse communities . '
And as its all - encompassing food culture attests , it has long been viewed as a melting pot rather than a pressure cooker .
In India especially , the reputational damage to the city will take a long time to repair .
And there 's been commercial fall - out , as well , to the Australia education sector , which , after coal and iron ore , is the country 's third most lucrative export .
This week , the Australian government released figures showing that student visa applications from India were 46 % down following last year 's attacks .
One India - based education agent has said the market is ' absolutely doomed . '
I have always looked upon Melbourne with great affection , and , after three years living in Delhi , also have a great passion for India .
After all , it was the country where I met my Australian wife .
So I can well understand why Australia 's second most populous city is feeling that it is being unfairly vilified because of the actions of a few thugs , whatever their motivations , and also appreciate why a middle - class Indian parent living in Delhi , Mumbai or Chennai would now harbour deep misgivings about paying for their son or daughter to study in the city which they have now come to associate with street crime and intolerance .
Besides Afghanistan and Iraq , there is perhaps no military policy that raises as much controversy within the public domain as “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell . ”
President Obama ’s pledge to end D.A.D.T. has generated discussion not only outside of the military but also within military circles .
A West Point graduate who is a friend of mine is being forced out of the Army because of his sexual orientation .
This soldier , who has deployed to Afghanistan and twice to Iraq , is heavily decorated .
Here are some thoughts he relayed to me :
I have always believed the armed services makes everyone in it better in some way , and that it is committed to taking care of every aspect of service members ’ health and improvement .
Ironically , in this area the D.A.D.T. policy actually has a detrimental impact on the psychological health of its service members , forcing paranoia about being found out , cover-ups of the truth and a forced level of disingenuousness in the name of unit cohesion .
When a soldier has been found to be homosexual , in an unfortunate number of cases the investigation leads to other service members covering up their own sexuality by claiming sexual relations were nonconsensual to evade being evicted from the service .
Statistics have shown that anyone who personally knows someone who is gay is more likely to support equal rights for them … .
This type of gift of understanding grows out of seeing the truth , as opposed to demonizing the gay minority from a distance .
Take away that distance , and those who are uncomfortable with gay people — usually without ever truly engaging them — may come to find the truth … that gay soldiers are committed Americans who may not share sexual orientation with all of their counterparts , but who share everything else that matters : a skill set required to do the job , a dedication to our country ’s values , and a willingness to give their lives if necessary to defend those values , and their brothers and sisters serving to their left and right .
My own feelings toward D.A.D.T. have changed drastically now that a close friend has been “ outed ” and is being kicked out of the Army .
I always felt that this individual — who has a stellar military record — was sure to achieve every imaginable success in terms of rank and position .
I know other soldiers felt the same .
Before this event I had no convictions one way or the other about D.A.D.T. ; it was a nonfactor in my life .
But seeing firsthand a capable soldier be forced out of the military when the Army struggles with retaining junior to mid-level officers seems to fly in the face of logic .
When competent professionals are being forced to leave the service because of their sexual orientation it is an enormous waste of government resources .
Taxpayers and the military reap little to no return on the investment that has been made them , especially if they have undergone specialized training such as language skills or flight school .
The common stereotype of the military is that it is a paleolithic organization a step behind on social movements .
This is a faulty notion .
For instance , the United States military integrated African - Americans well before American society as a whole .
Today the United States military is one of the most colorblind institutions in the entire world , and soldiers today do not think of one another in terms of race , gender or the religion they follow .
American society has changed since D.A.D.T. was instituted .
The majority of Americans have moved beyond debating whether it is socially acceptable for homosexuals to be open about their sexuality in the workplace .
Moreover , a majority of Americans now support allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military .
In a RAND study , sexual orientation was shown not to be a hindrance in civilian organizations most analogous to the military , such as police and fire departments .
Eliminating D.A.D.T. would have immediate practical benefits to the military .
It would stanch the number of service personnel members released from the military during a time of war .
( There have been roughly 12,500 service personnel released under D.A.D.T. )
It would also increase the pool of eligible able - bodied applicants .
Several Ivy League schools have sought to prevent military recruiters and Reserve Officers Training Corps from operating on their campuses because of D.A.D.T .
I wonder , if the military does end D.A.D.T. , will students in these schools join the military in larger numbers or was D.A.D.T. an easy cover for individuals who are simply opposed to military service ?
The main argument used against allowing homosexuals to serve in the military was that it would negatively affect unit cohesion .
If this were true , then perhaps it could be argued that there is a diminishing of military cohesion with our allies ( Great Britain , Canada , and Germany ) in Afghanistan and other missions around the world because of the fact that sexual orientation is not a barrier to serve in those militaries .
Another argument is that service members opposed to open homosexuality would leave the service in large numbers .
In response to this , the current Army Secretary John McHugh stated : “ Anytime you have a broad - based policy change , there are challenges to that …
The Army has a big history of taking on similar issues [ with ] predictions of doom and gloom that did not play out . ”
Although my sentiments on D.A.D.T. are not in line with the military ’s current policy , they are nonetheless in accordance with the commander in chief ’s stated policy .
There have also been other officers who have published their thoughts on why D.A.D.T. should be abolished , most notably an Air Force colonel whose essay on ending D.A.D.T. won the 2009 Secretary of Defense National Security Essay Competition ( PDF of the essay ) .
There are also many retired generals , most notably Gen. John M. Shalikashvili , the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who are for eliminating D.A.D.T .
With so much political debate centered on numerous issues ranging from health care , financial regulatory overhaul , campaign finance reform , and the wars overseas there may not be enough working days in Congress to deal with the issue of D.A.D.T .
Additionally , Congressman Ike Skelton , the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , has outright stated that he is against ending D.A.D.T .
As a result , President Obama will perhaps be reluctant about pushing to end D.A.D.T. too quickly , lest he follow in President Clinton ’s path of publicly proclaiming his intention to allow homosexuals to serve openly , but failing to do so .
Until D.A.D.T. is ended , the military will be doing its homosexual service members an injustice .
Perhaps the most eloquent remark made by advocates against D.A.D.T. was made by a Republican senator , Barry Goldwater , who said : “ You do n’t have to be straight to be in the military ; you just have to be able to shoot straight . ”

We welcome your comments .
So it appears that JWs are letting their freaky side come out on FB for everyone to see .
There was talk on the CA yesterday strongly warning all true lovers of Jehovah to delete their FB accounts .
The talk was solely about FB .
The speaker mentioned that JWs are associating with people that would not associate with in real life , often using the excuse that the person is a relative .
Many JWs are FB " friends " with persons that are DF'd or that have taken a stand against Jehovah and his organization .
He mentioned that JWs are posting inappropriate pictures of themselves in addition to joining " Watchtower " groups that are not sponored by the organization .
He repeated several times that the organization does not have a FB account nor does it have any approved groups on FB .
That many of such groups are actually created by apostates with the aim of having one began to doubt their faith .
Then he mentioned that all it takes is a crack in your faith and they can take you out of God 's organization into Satan 's organization .
Some use it to get a taste of the world but everything you need to know about the world , good and bad is in the bible , you do n't need FB for that .
Then he mentioned how many are involved in serious sins but do n't realize it because its all " online " .
Then he stated very deliberately that Facebook sex is not for true servants of Jehovah .
Then went on to explain that in some cases that chatting across FB sex groups were not enough for some and that some had went on to arrange secret rendevous and this was occuring among single , married , young , old and sadly even those in positions of responsibility within the congregation .
Mentioned how some say they are selective about who they approve to be their FB " friends " .
Speaker said no need to be selective if you simply delete your account .
Reminded everyone of the need to get and stay close to Jehovah 's organization and that you have all the friends you need in the worldwide brotherhood .
End of talk highlights
Highlights from a friend that has her CA this weekend .
Just last week we talked about how JWs toss out all the JW rules on FB .
Anyway she went on to say that later on people were simply sharing tips on how to set the privacy controls on a FB account .
So I 'm guessing they have no plans of giving up their FB sex .
This was given as the needs of the circuit so all CAs will not hear this talk ... unless your Circuit is into the dirty - dirty .
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti 
When the aid helicopters descend on the Pétionville Club golf course , once a playground for the wealthy and now a sprawling city of makeshift tents , the residents hurry toward them .
But to get there , they must climb a steep embankment to a landing zone on top of a hill where the 82nd Airborne Division distributes the food and water .
For Richard Domand , a homeless man in his 70s who was partially paralyzed by typhoid , it was too much .
He arrived in the morning but made it only halfway up the hill , where into the late afternoon he was lying on the ground next to his cane .
A woman had given him one of the two bottles of water she had gotten from the Americans , but he said he had gotten no food .
“ I can not make it up , ” he says .
Even as more aid flows into Haiti nearly a week after a devastating earthquake , the challenges faced by the 82nd Airborne in handing out food and water here illustrate the hurdles in distributing it across the city .
Roads are clogged with traffic and rubble .
Confusion is rampant .
Everywhere , people ask , “ Where do I go ? ”
When the Ottawa Senators drafted Jeff Costello in the fifth round ( 146 overall ) of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft , there was little fanfare .
He was preceded by more highly - touted draft picks , like Jared Cowen and Robin Lehner , and came just 14 selections before local product Corey Cowick was selected from the Ottawa 67s .
With the season he 's having so far on the USHL's Cedar Rapids RoughRiders , though , you 've got to think his ranking on the Senators ' depth chart may be rising rapidly .
In 32 GP so far this season , Costello 's put up 20G and 12A for 32P , good enough for 18th in the USHL scoring race .
He 's also +15 on the year ( tied for 11 in the USHL ) and , perhaps most tellingly , is third in the league with 101 PIM .
I had the opportunity to talk to Costello about his career so far and his thoughts on the Senators , and he said that physicality is a big part of his game , and ( judging by his PIM total ) he obviously walks the line .
" I think I ’d fall as a very physical forward that likes to bang the body around , " Costello said , " But at the same time , I have the ability to score .
Not necessarily pretty goals , but I can get those dirty , greasy goals that you have to have .
I like to lead by example , and really bring the physical part of the game and get a lot of that exposed out there . "
( Read more ... )
Costello's already within a point of matching his point total from last season , and says the confidence of being a sophomore player has made all the difference .
" It ’s pretty different coming in for a second year , you ’ve got a lot more confidence .
A major part of your first year is just adjusting to the league , getting yourself adjusted .
Right now , things are going pretty well , for me and for the team .
I ’m really excited for the remainder of the season . "
Although it 's difficult to project how his success so far in the USHL could translate to the professional ranks , whether in the AHL or the NHL , Costello sounds like the type of player Bryan Murray likes :
A physical force who 's not afraid of getting his nose dirty when driving the puck to the net .
Although he 's average in height at 5 ' 11 " , Costello weighs in at 202 lbs , similar in size to Ottawa 's Chris Neil - - and apparently similar in disposition .
In fact , because of his style and that of the Senators ' team Murray has assembled , Costello had a pretty good idea Ottawa was one of two teams he 'd likely be picked up by .
And he sounded excited by the fact that he 's a part of the Senators .
" From how certain teams talk to you , you can kind of tell [ who ’s interested ] , Costello said .
" And the style of play they have on the team , you can guess .
I figured it was between Ottawa and Philly , and Ottawa ended up selecting me , which was awesome ; being selected by a Canadian team , [ because there ’s ] a lot of pride in their hockey team up there . "
The USHL , a midwestern USA - based junior hockey league similar to the CHL ( although not as renowned ) , has produced a good number of notable prospects recently , including Senators 2008 second - round pick Patrick Wiercioch as well as Montreal Canadiens ' 2009 first - round pick Louis Leblanc and Washington Capitals prospect / American hero ( and , for a time , the most hated person in Canada ) John Carlson .
For Costello , it was an easy choice to take the USHL route .
" It ’s an unbelievable development league for players , " Costello explained .
" You get lots of exposure , the exposure is almost unmatched , I would say .
The competition is really good , too ; every team is good .
There are no cupcake games , so it develops you into a really good hockey player . "
This off - season , Costello got a taste of what hockey was like for pros in Ottawa at the development camp .
" It was awesome , they took the best care of us .
You get the opportunity to put faces [ of other prospects ] to names , you ’ve been talking to these guys a little bit .
It was a pretty cool experience , being in the arena , the locker room , it was a humbling experience , but at the same time it was really exciting .
One day you could be in this arena with your nameplate above the stall . "
For the time being , though , Costello 's still working with his teammates on the RoughRiders to maintain their success so far in the regular season -- they currently sit at second in the East Division with 40 points -- and to carry that forward into the playoffs .
He 's committed to attend Notre Dame University after this season , so is still a few years off from the professional ranks , but he almost certainly has n't disappointed Senators brass so far .
Here are the notes I used for the debate with Professor Alister McGrath on the 29th October .
I ended up only alluding to the second objection as I thought it too technical on the night .
Does the natural world point to God ?
it cannot have a physical probability
appear
“ The other main problem with intelligent design is that identity of the designer need bear no relation at all to the God of traditional monotheism .
The “ designing agency ” can be a committee of gods , for example .
The designer can be a natural being or beings , such as an evolved super - mind or super - civilization existing in a previous universe , or in another section of our universe , which made our universe using super - technology .
The designer can also be some sort of superdupercomputer simulating this universe .
So invoking a super - intellect …is fraught with problems . ”
Cosmic fine - tuning arguments - that God provides the best , or even a half - decent , explanation of the character the natural world in which we find ourselves - face FIVE main types of objection .
I am going to briefly outline all five .
But , I intend to rest my case on just the last two .
So the first three will just be sketched out , and are merely for your information only .
FIRST OBJECTION .
As Alister acknowledges in his book , the science on which fine - tuning arguments are based is by no means uncontroversial .
For example , some scientists believe there may well be a multiverse – a plethora of universes governed by a wide range of different physical laws .
If there is a multiverse , then it ’s not particularly unlikely that there should happen to exist a universe that has the Goldilocks property of being “ just right ” for life .
Even if there ’s only one universe , a number of scientists in any case question whether there is only a very narrow range of physical parameters within which life can plausibly emerge .
Physicists including Victor Stenger , Anthony Aguire , and Craig Hogan have studied those universes that result when six cosmological parameters are simultaneously varied by several orders of magnitude , and have found that stars , planets and life can plausibly emerge within many of them .
According to these physicists , then , it simply is not true that there is only a very narrow set of physical parameters within which life can plausibly arise .
But still , let ’s concede , for the sake of argument , that Alister is correct , and these physicists incorrect , about the science on which cosmic fine - tuning arguments are based .
SECOND OBJECTION .
Even if there is only a very narrow set of physical parameters within which life might plausibly emerge , it does n’t follow that the chances of the actual universe falling within these parameters is low .
In fact , several philosophers reject the suggestion that we can even assign such a chance to the physical universe .
Take Professor Hugh Mellor of Cambridge University , who is an acknowledged expert on probability theory .
According to Mellor , there are two kinds of probability : epistemic probability and physical probability ( or chance ) .
Epistemic probability is , roughly speaking , the likelihood of something ’s being true given the evidence .
Suppose I am looking at a roulette wheel on which I can see the ball has landed on slot 26 .
For me , the epistemic probability that the ball is in slot 26 very high – I have overwhelming evidence that ’s were it is because I can just see it there .
On the other hand , the physical probability of the ball being there – by which I mean the chance of the ball landing there given the laws of nature and a certain specification of the conditions under which the ball was thrown into the wheel - is pretty low : only about one in 37 .
Now when proponents of fine - tuning , such as Alister , insist the “ probability ” of the universe producing life is low , they clearly do not mean epistemic probability .
The epistemic probability of life is very high – we can see it all around us .
So the notion of probability proponents of fine - tuning are appealing to must , according to Mellor , be physical probability .
But then notice that if the physical universe is the only physical universe there is , The universe will onlyto have such a probability if we smuggle in a quasi- physical setting for its creation , supposing , for example , that the cosmological constants were fixed by something like the spin of a cosmic roulette wheel .
So , concludes Professor Mellor , the fine - tuning arguments are just confused .
Other philosophers , such as Neil Manson , Elliot Sober , and also Timothy and Lydia McGrew ( who incidentally , are religious ) concur with that conclusion , for other , independent reasons .
Still , let us also concede , for the sake of argument , that Alister is correct , and these various objectors are all mistaken .
Let ’s suppose we can talk meaningfully about the chances of the universe having a life - producing character .
THIRD OBJECTION .
Even if we concede that the probability of the universe having a life - producing character by chance is otherwise low , that still does not provide any significant support for the suggestion that some intelligence designed the universe that way , if either ( i ) the probability of such an intelligent being is itself very low ( as Richard Dawkins suggests ) , or ( ii ) if the very idea of such a being actually makes no sense ( as I am about to suggest ) .
Suppose I claim that there exists a special sort of chair – a chair that transcends physical reality , existing in a non-spatial , non-temporal way .
You would rightly be sceptical .
Not just because there is no evidence for such a chair , but because the idea of such a chair is nonsensical .
In order for something to be a chair , it must have arms , legs , a seat , and so on , and these are features that require spatial extension .
The idea of a non-spatial chair is just confused .
But is the idea of an intelligent cosmic designer any less confused ?
If this designer is the creator of space and time , then he exists , or existed , non-temporally .
But how can an intelligent agent exist non-temporally ?
The concept of an agent is the concept of someone or thing with beliefs and desires on which they might more or less rationally act .
But just as the concepts of chair arms and legs are essentially rooted in a spatial context , and make no sense when applied outside it , so the concepts of belief and desire are essentially rooted in a temporal context , and make no sense when applied outside it .
For example , beliefs and desires are psychological states , and as such necessarily have temporal duration .
They are held for periods of time .
The idea of a non-temporally held desire makes about as much sense as a non-spatially extended chair leg .
The concept of design is also essentially rooted in the temporal .
You draw up a design , and then you subsequently realize it – a temporally ordered sequence of events .
If the design does not precede the realization , then it was not designed at all .
So far as I can see , then , talk of some sort of super - agent or designer transcending time and space is just so much gibberish , like talk of a non-spatial chair .
We have taken a concept with which we are familiar – a chair , or an intelligent designer – and projected into a realm where its application no longer even makes sense .
That ’s not profundity .
That ’s meaningless twaddle .
But let ’s suppose that even this third class of objection – which includes both Dawkins ’s objection , and this objection concerning meaningless twaddle - and can be overcome .
Let ’s just sweep all three categories of objection to one side .
There still remain two more .
It is on these last two – the fourth and fifth objections - that I rest my argument that the natural world does not “ point to ” God .
FOURTH OBJECTION .
It is a huge leap from the conclusion that the universe is the product of an intelligence to the conclusion that this intelligence is the all - powerful and limitlessly benevolent God of love that Christians worship .
As the Templeton - prize - winning physicist Paul Davies points out at the end of his book The Goldilocks Enigma , even setting aside all the other difficulties , ( I quote ) Davies is correct , of course .
Alister ’s supposedly fine - tuned features , even if they did point towards a designer , no more “ point towards ” the existence of the Christian God than they point towards the universe being a computer - generated Matrix - type simulation , or the creation of an earlier super - civilization .
Which of course they do n’t really “ point to ” at all .
FIFTH OBJECTION .
I come now to my final , and most important , objection to the suggestion that the natural world points towards anything remotely like the Christian God .
It seems to me that , unlike the suggestions that the universe was designed by an earlier super - civilization , or superdupercomputer , the suggestion that the universe was designed by Alister ’s God is just straightforwardly empirically falsified .
There is abundant empirical evidence that , if even if the universe was designed , it was not designed by the particular deity Alister believes in .
I am talking of course about the evidential problem of evil .
Last week I watched an episode of the BBC TV series Life .
At the end of the programme , one of the cameramen was interviewed , and I was struck that he said that , after just a few weeks on the job , he was already considering of giving up wild - life photography because it was too emotionally harrowing – he was struggling to cope with the extraordinary degree of suffering the creatures he was filming were going through .
That kind of suffering – appalling suffering , on a vast , global scale – has been going on , not just for two weeks , but for many hundreds of millions of years , long , long before we humans made our very recent appearance .
And of course , we humans suffer too .
Consider a not uncommon occurrence [ EDITIED : I have removed this second example as touches on matter in which I have some personal involvement and do not want posted on the internet ) .
Perhaps the universe is the product of an intelligence .
I do n’t think that ’s likely , but even if it were , surely it is pretty obvious that the intelligence in question is not the Christian God of love – in all his limitlessly powerful and benevolent glory .
If you think that ’s not obvious , well , consider another possible cosmic designer – suppose there is just one god – a supremely powerful and evil being .
His cruelty and malice and know no bounds .
How likely is that ?
I am sure you will agree it is an absurd suggestion .
Why – because it is straightforwardly empirically falsified by the enormous amounts of good that there are in the universe .
Why would an evil God create love , laughter and rainbows ?
Why would he allow us to reduce suffering ?
In short , just as , if you believe in a good God , you face the problem of evil , so if you believe in an evil God , you face the problem of good .
Because of the problem of good , it is clearly absurd to suggest that the natural world points towards an evil God .
But then why is n’t it equally absurd to suggest that natural world points to a good God ?
Alister ’s position , it seems to me , is like that of someone who wanders into a concentration camp , notes the stoves designed to provide meals and warmth and the mattresses designed for sleeping on , and concludes that not only was this camp designed by an intelligence with some interest in sustaining human life , it actually “ points towards ” a wonderfully loving and benevolent designer
The truth is , not only does the available empirically evidence not point towards the camp having such a wonderfully benevolent designer , it actually points very firmly away from the camp being the creation of any such being .
Ditto the universe .
The move is part of a full - court press by the online payments giant on Web developers
PayPal will open an applications store this year where developers can offer their wares , the latest step in the company 's multi-pronged strategy to deepen its relationship with external programmers .
Developers have a big opportunity to offer applications for merchants and consumers that PayPal does n't have the interest or resources to build itself , a PayPal official said Tuesday .
" It could be an invoicing application for a merchant or a ' daily deals ' application for consumers , " said Osama Bedier , vice president of PayPal 's Platform Business Unit and Emerging Technologies .
Last year , eBay did a similar thing , turning its Selling Manager suite of merchant tools into an open repository and storefront for externally developed applications .
The app store plans are the latest step in PayPal 's aggressive strategy to lure external developers after the company opened its payments platform late last year .
" We have a huge emphasis on interacting with developers .
They 're our customers , along with consumers and merchants , " Bedier said during an interview at an outside café in Miami Beach 's Lincoln Road promenade .
He was in town to address a crowd of developers at the Future of Web Apps ( FOWA ) conference at the nearby Colony Theater .
PayPal will have a presence at more than 110 developer events this year , he said .
" We want to help these guys become successful .
It 's not just a matter of ' here are our tools , go use them . '
We have to be where they are and be active in the developer community , " he said .
" I want developers to think of PayPal first whenever they hear the word ' payments ' and I want to know what it will take to get there .
We 're willing to do it .
We 're willing to innovate and experiment on their behalf and hear their feedback , " he said .
For years , PayPal was content to have developers link its payment system with external Web sites for checkout functionality .
It no longer considers that good enough .
For starters , PayPal wants to expand beyond conventional online commerce .
At his FOWA talk later in the day , Bedier said e-commerce transactions make up only about 4 percent of U.S. retail spending .
With smartphones , PayPal sees a future in which its system can be used to pay at the grocery store , the cleaners , the gas station , and for things like rent and parking meters , he said .
" This is why this opportunity is so gigantic , " he said during his talk .
" There 's a lot of opportunity in breaking out of the shell of e-commerce . "
PayPal is doing a limited beta test of its Mobile Payments library , which is designed to let developers add payment functionality to iPhone applications .
The library will later be extended to other smartphone platforms .
During Bedier 's FOWA presentation , another PayPal official demonstrated how a PayPal button could be added to a Flickr account to let people purchase photo prints .
" We want the simplest way to make payments available on mobile applications , " Bedier told IDG News Service .
" We want , with a few lines of code and a few minutes , to let any developer put payments inside the app . "
" The wallet should live in the cloud , " he added .
" This stuff goes mainstream when we make it easy , simple , and solve the friction problem .
Entering credit card information into a mobile device is the worst user experience ever . "
PayPal has a sense of urgency about this , as it sees mobile payment transactions rising rapidly on its platform , even when users have to exit an application and access PayPal externally via a mobile browser .
Competitors of all stripes , from Google and Amazon.com to credit card companies and mobile carriers , are n't standing still either , as they see the opportunities in online payments .
Bedier acknowledged that prior to opening up its payments platform late last year , " we were n't innovating , we were n't changing the game , we were n't increasing the e-commerce pie " for itself and for external developers .
" By giving developers the raw tools we 've had internally , they can now extend us to other real - world use cases that have never been factored into e-commerce before , " he said .
" With mobile blurring the line between online and offline , these opportunities have become reality . "
Matt Bai recently penned a somewhat confused essay that attempts to argue that Obama is a bona fide progressive , but not really a populist ( which apparently for Bai comes down to little more than differences in tone ) .
Yet in this piece he inserts an intriguing aside .
A year into Obama 's presidency , it is no longer inconceivable , if still unlikely , that he could face a challenge within his own party in 2012 , especially if Democrats suffer sizable losses next November .
( When Howard Dean made a point of trying to scuttle health care reform altogether , was he simply trying to get a better bill , or was he setting himself up as a populist insurgent ? )
The tossaway quality of these lines makes them so interesting .
It 's as if this is what people are talking about .
Are they ?
I do n't really run in the same circles as writers from the New York Times Magazine , so I do n't have a clue .
Yet I did notice that Politico has a generally sympathetic entry on " The resurrection of Howard Dean . "
It also mentions a possible 2012 challenge of the President .
Just as you need two data points to have a trend , you need two MSM articles to have a meme !
So , it 's worth asking on this cold January day : could Howard Dean primary Barack Obama ?
Of course he could , but nobody should expect him to topple the President .
If Theodore Roosevelt could n't successfully primary Howard Taft in 1912 , what hope does any insurgent have , especially one who lost out to John Kerry ?
Now , the nomination battle has changed quite a bit in the 98 years since Teddy took on the Big Lub , but the following is most definitely true .
Incumbent presidents who were elected to office were often denied their party 's re-nomination in the 19th century ( the first loser being the drunk , incompetent Franklin Pierce in 1856 ) , but it is a very rare occurrence these days .
And by rare I mean it has n't happened in over a century .
The power of selecting the next nominee has generally fallen to the people - via the primaries and caucuses - but make no mistake : the party establishment still has a dominant role , and an incumbent President almost always has the establishment on his side .
That makes him near impossible to defeat - you have to go back to the corruption of the Gilded Age or the political breakdown of the antebellum years to find incumbents who could n't secure the support of the insiders whose jobs depend on the incumbent 's continued success .
That 's not to say Dean ( or somebody ) would n't try .
It 's just to say that if he has any sense in his head , his goal would n't be to become the 45th President .
When Pat Buchanan took on George H.W. Bush in 1992 , I doubt his purpose was actually to become the next President .
More likely , it was about making public the dissatisfaction a faction within the Republican Party was feeling by 1992 .
That points to what makes these primary contests so noteworthy : they are more a symptom of failure than a cause .
If a President can not lock down all the major parts of his own party , and instead must slug it out in a primary - it's a sign that he 's going to have trouble building a majority coalition in the fall .
Taft , Carter , and Bush all lost their general election contests after beating back big time challenges for the nomination .
So did Hubert Humphrey , LBJ 's stand - in in 1968 , after Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy launched insurgent candidacies for the White House .
This is probably why we 're seeing talk about Dean about the moment : many progressives are frustrated with the course of the Obama administration to date .
There are hairline fractures in the Obama coalition .
It 's improbable that progressives would ever seriously challenge its structural foundations .
They are also the most partisan Democrats , and thus would never aid the Republicans .
But if Obama should find his job approval ratings in Carter or Bush territory come mid-2011 , i.e. he 's doomed anyway , a progressive candidate like Dean could conceivably challenge him .
I 'd say the probability of Obama having to face a serious challenge from Howard Dean or anybody in 2012 are about as good as the probability that the Pittsburgh Pirates will have a winning season by then .
Put it in the 5 - 10 % range .

Looking back , ahead at federal taxing , spending
This tax calculator will give you a rough idea of your federal tax bill — and where your tax money went — from 1940 through 2010 .
Caveats :
The calculator is for a taxpayer who files individually , uses the standard deduction instead of itemizing , and has one exemption .
The calculator also figures your Social Security and Medicare taxes .
We 've adjusted all figures for inflation , using the consumer price index .
Results may be skewed for the very wealthy and the very poor .
Upper - income filers are more likely to have income subject to alternative minimum tax , but they are also more likely to have income from capital gains and dividends , which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income .
Lower - income filers can take advantage of the earned income tax credit , which can reduce the tax bill of a single filer .
Regarding how the federal government spends those tax dollars , we broke out each tax bill into the amount that would be allocated among the government 's broad spending categories .
As a note , the " other " category refers to spending on veterans benefits and services , commerce and housing credits , transportation , community and regional development , general government , administration of justice and allowances .
So , take some time to explore .
See how much your salary today was in 1940 dollars ; where tax money went back in the ' 60s , or how the effective tax rate ( that is , the percentage of your salary you pay in taxes ) changes as you make more or less money .

In the world of art , the authenticity of a work can make millions of dollars worth of difference .
Although it 's possible to detect recent frauds based on objective measures like chemicals in the paints , it often requires subjective judgements to determine the difference between the work of a true master having an off week and the product of one of that master 's students .
A paper that will appear in PNAS suggests that a technique borrowed from vision research may help take some of the subjectivity out of this sort of analysis .
The study of artwork through math and statistics is known as " stylometry , " and is a relatively recent development — similar methods have been used to analyze literature for much longer .
The new paper uses a technique called sparse coding , in which analysts break down works of art into tiny patches and represent them as a series mathematical functions .
By comparing the functions produced with authentic artwork to those from possible imitators , they can produce an objective measure of whether the piece in question is real or fake .
Sparse coding was originally developed for studying how neurons in the brain responded to visuals .
It works by breaking down an image — for simplicity 's sake , usually one in grayscale — into mathematical functions , pixel by pixel .
The images that are broken down are just small patches of whole works , not much more than a dozen pixels square .
In their experiments , the researchers used the works of Flemish artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder as guinea pigs .
Bruegel 's art often depicts pastoral scenes , an image type that sparse coding is very good at processing , and his work spawned many imitators in his time , making him an ideal subject .
First , the researchers took several known authentic Bruegel works , rendered them in grayscale , and processed them with sparse coding in tiny patches of 8x8 , 12x12 , and 16x16 pixels in different trials , making them into maps of math functions .
Once this was done , they processed patches from other drawings onto the authentic work , and looked at the probability of whether the new image 's functions mapped onto the original .
If the average probability peak for each pixel comparison was very sharp , the second image was more likely to be authentic ; if the peak was more spread out or less prominent , the second image was probably a fake .
For their trials , they broke eight authentic Bruegel works down into mathematical functions , and did pairwise comparisons of their patches with those of a second authentic work and those of a fake .
In seven of the eight cases , the method produced correct results ; that is , a second authentic work had a higher probability of mapping correctly to the first authentic work , while the fake did not map as well .
While the application of sparse coding is decidedly effective in this case , its usefulness is still somewhat limited .
It does not process all artistic styles equally well and , generally speaking , the process needs a good - sized body of consistent work from a single artist before it can compare possible imitations .
Sparse coding also does n't work as well when given paintings of different subject matter , and still is best at landscapes .
The authors acknowledge that sparse coding is far from a replacement for tools already in use , but conclude that , in certain situations , it has a pretty good eye , and can be a useful supplement .

Update at bottom : Stewart tells O’Reilly that it ’s a ‘ really bad idea ’ for him to run for president
O’Reilly ’s defense of Beck :
He ’s an ‘ everyman ’ who ‘ sits on a barstool ’ and ‘ spouts ’
Jon Stewart may be a comedian — his program is broadcast on Comedy Central , after all — yet his scathing satire of television ’s most peculiar “ news ” outlet is seemingly more relevant every day .
ADVERTISEMENT
Stewart ’s Wednesday night appearance on the self - titled “ fair and balanced ” Fox News , sitting for an interview with right wing pundit Bill O’Reilly , is a perfect example of why .
It really got interesting when O’Reilly confronted Stewart on his recent criticisms leveled at Fox News , causing Stewart to balk and sharpen his analysis .
“ Here ’s what Fox has done , through their cyclonic perpetual emotional machine that is 24 hours a day , 7 days a week :
They have taken reasonable concerns about this president and this economy and turned it into full - fledged panic attack about the next coming of Chairman Mao , ” he said , prodding O’Reilly .
“ Explain to me why that is the narrative of your network , ” Stewart deadpanned .
O’Reilly ’s response : “ That ’s the narrative of a couple of guys : A Republican , Sean Hannity , and , a guy , uh , uh … Glenn Beck , who is basically everyman ; I mean , basically . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Stewart seemed aghast at the answer .
“ Wh– What do you mean he ’s everyman ? ” he began .
“ What do you mean , he ’s everyman ?
Everyman ’s got a show ? ”
“ He ’s everyman , he sits on a barstool … ” O’Reilly muttered .
“ What are you talking about ? ” Stewart asked .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Well , he ’s talented , ” the host continued .
“ He ’s a very talented man , but where ’s everyman ? ” Stewart pressed .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It means that he does n’t shill for any party … He just spouts , ” O’Reilly said .
“ He spouts what he believes . ”
“ What ? ! ” an incredulous Stewart asked , mouth slightly open in amazement .
“ If you think that Beck shills for the Republican party , you ’re out of your mind ! ” O’Reilly insisted .

Quite the contrary , one would not be out of their mind to have assumed that Beck , a well known right - wing commentator , is somehow aiding the Republicans .
After all , his conspiracy laden rants often gain immediate traction within Republican leadership .
Additionally , Rush Limbaugh , arguably still the strongest voice in the Republican party and often criticized as the GOP ’s de-facto leader , once even boasted that his body of work had “ spawned ” Beck .
“ Glenn Beck to me is right on , daddy - o , ” he said during an NBC interview .
“ Glenn Beck is a result of my success . ”
Beck is also giving the keynote address at the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference , a move Politico characterized as part of his transition from mere commentary into “ partisan ” activism .
Fox News at large is filled with notable Republican figures , from paid contributors Sarah Palin and former Bush strategist Karl Rove to executive Roger Ailes , who once crafted a pivotal political ad for then Vice President George H.W. Bush in his race against Democrat Michael Dukakis .

On Thursday , Feb .

He suggested that by having right - wing staff members — or , “ traditional Americans , ” as he called them —
Fox News simply “ balances things out . ”

Because of their resulting financial problems they had to take on low - paying side jobs , which the suspects ” provided ” them . …
The full - face covering has inflamed passions in France A French parliamentary committee has recommended a partial ban on women wearing Islamic face veils .
The committee 's near 200 - page report has proposed a ban in hospitals , schools , government offices and on public transport .
It also recommends that anyone showing visible signs of " radical religious practice " should be refused residence cards and citizenship .
The interior ministry says just 1,900 women in France wear the full veils .
A law may follow , but MPs are divided over what to do

In its report , the committee said requiring women to cover their faces was against the French republican principles of secularism and equality .
" The wearing of the full veil is a challenge to our republic .
This is unacceptable .
We must condemn this excess , " the report said .
The commission called on parliament to adopt a formal resolution stating that the face veil was " contrary to the values of the republic " and proclaiming that " all of France is saying ' no ' to the full veil " .
Presenting the report to the French National Assembly , speaker Bernard Accoyer said the face veil had too many negative connotations .
" It is the symbol of the repression of women , and ... of extremist fundamentalism .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" This divisive approach is a denial of the equality between men and women and a rejection of co-existence side - by - side , without which our republic is nothing . "
The report is expected to be followed by the drafting of a bill and a parliamentary debate on the issue .
The BBC's Hugh Schofield , in Paris , says the reasoning behind the report is to make it as impractical as possible for women in face veils to go about their daily business .
There is also a fear that an outright ban would not only be difficult to implement but would be distasteful and could make France a target for terrorism , our correspondent says .
France has an estimated five million Muslims - the largest such population in Western Europe .
Months of debate
The report follows months of public debate , including President Nicolas Sarkozy 's intervention , saying all - encompassing veils were " not welcome in France " .
REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS
Parliament should pass a resolution denouncing full Muslim face veils
Ban the veil in all schools , hospitals , public transport and government offices
Bar foreign women from obtaining asylum or French citizenship if they insist on veiling their faces in state buildings
Take into account in asylum requests the coercion to wear the full veil as an indication of a wider context of persecution Create a national school of Islamic studies
The Islamic veil across Europe However , he did not explicitly call for a ban , saying " no - one should feel stigmatised " by any eventual law .
Opinion polls suggest a majority of French people support a full ban .
However , the parliamentary deputies have recommended that - for now - restrictions should be limited .
The committee suggests a ban inside public buildings , with those who defy the ban denied whatever services are on offer there - for example state benefits .
There are several types of headscarves and veils for Muslim women - those that cover the face being the niqab and the burka .
In France , the niqab is the version most commonly worn .
The niqab usually leaves the eyes clear .
It is worn with an accompanying headscarf and sometimes a separate eye veil .
The burka covers the entire face and body with just a mesh screen to see through .

The issue has divided France 's political parties .
The Socialist opposition has come out officially against a ban , saying it would be difficult to enforce .
It says it is opposed to full veils in principle , but some members have expressed fears about any ruling that could stigmatise Muslim women .
Meanwhile , the head of Mr Sarkozy 's right - wing UMP party has already presented a bill in parliament supporting a full ban on grounds of security .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama averaged 57 % job approval during his first year in office .
Compared with the first - year averages of other presidents elected to office since World War II , Obama 's average ranks on the low end , tied with Ronald Reagan's , but better than Bill Clinton 's historical low of 49 % .
" More recently , Obama 's job approval ratings have hovered around 50 % , averaging 51 % for his fourth quarter in office . "
When Obama took office , his initial approval ratings were among the highest Gallup has measured for a new president , and better than the early ratings for the more recent presidents .
However , his public support dropped , with a sharp , nine - point decline in his approval rating from his second to his third quarter in office , marking one of the largest quarterly declines in Gallup polling history .
More recently , Obama 's job approval ratings have hovered around 50 % , averaging 51 % for his fourth quarter in office .
Obama 's 51 % fourth - quarter average ties Clinton 's and Reagan 's averages as the historical low fourth - quarter ratings for elected presidents .
George W. Bush had the highest fourth - quarter average as a result of the rally in public support for government leaders after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Harry Truman ( 50 % ) and Gerald Ford ( 48 % ) -- who were not elected to their first terms in office -- had slightly lower fourth - quarter averages than did Obama , Clinton , and Reagan .
Several factors likely contribute to Obama 's recent slump .
Although U.S. consumers are more likely now than before Obama took office to say the economy is " getting better , " they continue to give a dour assessment of current economic conditions and are still more likely to say the economy is getting worse than getting better .
Obama 's approval rating for handling the economy has declined over the course of the year and reached a new low of 40 % in the most recent USA Today / Gallup poll .
Poor economies may also have kept down Reagan 's and Clinton 's first - year ratings .
The decline in Obama 's ratings seemed to accelerate when healthcare reform became the top domestic legislative priority in the late summer , and some members of Congress faced a backlash from angry participants at town - hall meetings to discuss the issue .
The plan has struggled to gain majority public support , and Americans today give Obama a rather anemic 37 % approval rating for handling healthcare .
Obama 's attempts to improve the economy and expand health coverage have raised concerns among Americans about the dramatic increase in government spending and the federal budget deficit , and about the expansion of government power more generally .
Survey Methods
Results are based on more than 40,000 aggregated telephone interviews with national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted between Oct. 20 , 2009 and Jan. 19 , 2010 , as part of Gallup Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones and cellular phones .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Just a few days short of its official debut at retail stores , BioWare 's Mass Effect 2 has become widely available on file - sharing networks .
The leak has resulted in massive piracy as more than 300,000 gamers have either downloaded or are in the process of downloading a copy of the highly anticipated game via BitTorrent .
Last Thursday , both the PC and Xbox360 versions of the upcoming Mass Effect 2 game leaked to BitTorrent , which did n’t go unnoticed by the masses .
The game is scheduled to be sold in stores starting Tuesday in North America and Friday throughout Europe , but many curious customers could n’t wait until then and have downloaded an unauthorized copy instead .
At the time of writing , tens of thousands of people are downloading the game , which is more than 14 gigabytes worth of data for the PC version and over 13 gigabytes for the Xbox360 version .
According to the latest statistics gathered by TorrentFreak , more than 300,000 people started downloading the files in the past days .
All purchased copies of Mass Effect 2 , developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts , will come with a ‘ Cerberus ’ Network Card .
The card is required to download in - game items and new missions that will become available when the game is officially released , but it ’s possible to play the game just fine without it .
According to reports from many downloaders , the game lives up to its expectations .
Hundreds of people have reported their successful completion of the game already , in playing times ranging from 10 hours to well over 30 hours .
Although the ‘ Cerberus ’ Network Card might not prevent people from grabbing an early copy of the game on BitTorrent , it might help to convert illegal downloaders who like the game into buying customers , if it ’s not hacked or cracked itself .
Whether Mass Effect 2 will come close to the massive popularity of Modern Warfare 2 among BitTorrent users is doubtful , but the game will certainly make an appearance in the 2010 most pirated games list later this year .
This is quite a common requirement to be able to add a custom checkbox control in an iPhone app .
In the Interface builder -> Tools -> library there is no CheckBox control while other controls like Label and Text Field are there .
Here is how I implemented it .
I would be interested in hearing about how others went about doing it .
You can use the UIButton control to make a CheckBox .
In your project , in the resources folder add the images e.g. the ones attached with in this post “ checkbox - selected.png ” and “ checkbox.png ” .
Define the members as follows in “ CheckBoxViewController . h ”
@interface CheckBoxViewController : UIViewController { BOOL checkboxSelected ; UIButton * checkBox ; UILabel * checkBoxLabel ; }
Uncomment the viewDidLoad in “ CheckBoxViewController.m ” and use the following code .
- ( void)viewDidLoad { [ super viewDidLoad ] ; checkBox = [ [ UIButton alloc ] initWithFrame : CGRectMake( 60 , 100 , 16 , 16 ) ] ; checkBox.contentVerticalAlignment = UIControlContentVerticalAlignmentCenter ; checkBox.contentHorizontalAlignment = UIControlContentHorizontalAlignmentCenter ; // Image for normal state UIImage * newNormalImage = [ UIImage imageNamed :@" checkbox.png " ] ; [ checkBox setBackgroundImage:newNormalImage forState:UIControlStateNormal ] ; // Image for highlighted state UIImage * newHighlighted Image = [ UIImage imageNamed : @" checkbox-selected.png " ] ; [ checkBox setBackgroundImage:newHighlightedImage forState:UIControlStateHighlighted ] ; // Image for selected state UIImage * newSelectedImage = [ UIImage imageNamed : @" checkbox-selected.png " ] ; [ checkBox setBackgroundImage:newSelectedImage forState:UIControlStateSelected ] ; [ checkBox addTarget: self action:@selector(checkBoxSelect:)forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside ] ; checkBox.adjustsImageWhenHighlighted = YES ; [ checkBox setBackgroundColor :[ UIC olor clearColor ] ] ; [ [ self view ] addSubview:checkBox ] ; checkBoxLabel = [ [ UILabel alloc ] initWithFrame : CGRectMake( 100 , 90 , 200 , 40 ) ] ; [ checkBoxLabel setText : @" Check Box " ] ; [ checkBox setBackgroundColor : [ [ self view ] backgroundColor ] ] ; [ [ self view ] addSubview:checkBoxLabel ] ; }
And add the following action method
-( void ) checkBoxSelect :( id ) sender { if ( checkboxSelected == 0 ) { [ checkBox setSelected : YES ] ; [ checkBoxLabel setText : @" Check Box - Selected " ] ; checkboxSelected = 1 ; } else { [ checkBox setSelected : NO ] ; [ checkBoxLabel setText : @" Check Box " ] ; checkboxSelected = 0 ; } }
Build and Run the application , this will work as checkbox control .

China has delivered the world 's most spectacular economic growth story in history .
Whatever your political beliefs , the Chinese have lifted millions out of poverty , more than any aid organization in such a short period of time .
China also remains a fascinating nation with one of the richest cultural heritages in the world .
Yet the government has massively distorted the nation 's economic system over the last few decades , leading to fourteen dangerous Chinese excesses , each of which is only sustainable by inflating the others !
Watch how each domino falls into the next one .

Romney , who is good - looking , wealthy and blessed with a lovely family , is , unsurprisingly , not actually very angry .
He would like to be president and run the country like a business , but he is not the kind of guy who is in mourning for the Articles of Confederation .
Romney ’s most dramatic recent moment came when he was attacked by a fellow passenger on a flight home from the Olympics in Vancouver .
A spokesman said Romney , who was not injured , was “ physically assaulted ” when he asked a man to raise his seat to an upright position before takeoff .
Perhaps the assailant mistook Romney for a flight attendant .
The attacker was taken off the plane but not charged , and Romney ’s spokesman said there was no indication he recognized his victim .
But maybe he did .
Perhaps he was an irritable Democrat .
Or maybe he was an animal lover , still seething over the fact that Romney once drove his family to Canada for a vacation with their Irish setter , Seamus , strapped to the roof of the car .
But let ’s agree right here and now that this is a bad idea .
Not the dog on the roof .
Although that , too , is really , really undesirable .
But I was thinking of the attack .
I digress .
About the Conservative Political Action Conference .
Some of the tenthers ’ favorite stars were too busy to show up .
Sarah Palin  whose husband once flirted with the Alaska secessionists  declined .
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas  who cuddled up to the Texas secession movement in 2008  is home running for re-election and wowing the crowd at a Tenth Amendment Town Hall .
His strongest challenger for the Republican nomination appears to be a woman who told Glenn Beck that she had an open mind about whether there was any American government involvement in the 9/11 attack .
The news media , as Beck said to Katie Couric , is “ a sound - bite world  a really nasty place to live . ”
I would like to think that this is just because we happen to be at a moment in history when the country has a huge number of TV , radio and Internet outlets fighting to be loud enough and shrill enough to get noticed .
That ’s what things were like with newspapers at the end of the 19th century , and I cannot tell you what Grover Cleveland went through .
But if that ’s the explanation , this , too , shall pass .
Like the Articles of Confederation .
Electronic Frontiers Australia today announced that over 500 web Australian sites will be " blacked out " on Australia day in protest against the Rudd government 's mandatory Internet filtering plan .
Included among them are the Australian Greens , an Internet service provider , media outlets , and hundreds of other Australian businesses and organisations .
" This policy has caused considerable anxiety amongst Australian Internet users , " said EFA Vice - Chair Colin Jacobs .
" The idea that the Government will be inserting itself in every Internet connection in the country is a tough one to swallow , especially without a workable policy goal behind it . "
The " Great Australian Internet Blackout " was the brainchild of activist Jeff Waugh , and is endorsed and supported by EFA .
For a week starting on Australia Day , participating web sites will appear to turn black and will display a one - time message to visitors explaining the Government 's plan and offering them more information before allowing visitors to continue as normal .
The plan , which will see all Australian Internet connections subject to a Government - controlled blacklist of banned sites , will apply to all Australian Internet connections within 12 months of the legislation being passed .
Although originally touted as a " cyber- safety " policy , the resulting filter will not filter out all material unsuitable for children , instead targeting a select list of " refused classification " material , which would includes content dealing with crime , drugs and certain types of adult material .
Greens Communications spokesman Senator Scott Ludlam , in deciding to support the campaign , said " The Government 's plan will not protect children , will do nothing to crack down on criminal activity online , and sets a dangerous precedent of centralised net censorship . "
Concerns with the list include its broad scope , it 's secret nature , and the inability of Australian businesses to know if and when they have been placed on the list .
" One of our main concerns is how the list might expand in the future , " said Jacobs .
" It 's hard to imagine this and all future governments responding to special interests , electoral pressure and the news cycle only with restraint forevermore . "
The Internet Blackout on Australia Day marks an escalation of opposition to the plan , which will continue throughout the year .
" Our goal is to ensure the Australian public know what they 're in for , " said Peter Black , EFA 's campaign manager .
" It 's important that such a major and expensive policy gets the public scrutiny it deserves . "

Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
Her braids , dusty from the rubble around her , poked out from the small opening where she lay crying in pain , her right leg pinned under a heavy piece of metal .
A group of men worked throughout the day to free this 11 - year - old girl -- one of scores trapped beneath buildings that collapsed in Tuesday 's 7.0 - magnitude quake .
Lacking proper supplies to cut through the metal crushing the child 's leg , the men briefly considered amputating it .
Finally , just after sunset Thursday , a miracle of sorts : an electric saw and a small generator .
Within a couple of hours , the girl was freed and rushed to a first aid station .
Her leg was so badly wounded , her family was taking her to a more sophisticated hospital some three hours outside of Port - au - Prince .
Many rescuers have clawed their way to survivors pinned beneath buildings two days after the devastating earthquake .
In the absence of heavy machinery to clear the debris , residents used their hands and brawn to lift large slabs of concrete .
Some trapped victims punched out bricks themselves and tried to squeeze through cracks in the fallen structures .
Atop the mound of debris that once was a five - story building of great prominence , U.S. rescue workers Thursday pulled out a man in a deep green uniform .
Tarmo Joveer , an Estonian security officer for the United Nations , free from the enclosure , stood up and raised his fist .
He had been trapped beneath the rubble of his workplace for two days following the quake that shook the city and toppled the U.N. headquarters around him .
He said he had never lost hope .
He was one of scores of U.N. workers feared trapped inside the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping and civilian assistance mission , U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said Thursday .
As many as 150 staff members were still missing after the 7.0 - magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti Tuesday afternoon , devastating it 's capital .
The " small miracle , " as Ban described it , is one of many throughout the disaster area as rescuers and residents scramble to free entrapped survivors .
The Fairfax County , Virginia , Urban Search and Rescue Team saved Joveer , who was fed water through a rubber pipe when they discovered he was trapped beneath four meters of rubble , according to Ban .
After Joveer emerged , he walked away , brushing the dust out of his hair with his hand and hugging those around him .
" It was not good , " is all he could say to describe his experience under the rubble .
He also said he did not think there was anyone else alive .
Joveer was later taken to an Argentinean hospital , Ban said .
Joveer said during the earthquake he lost his footing , fell and suffered some pain .
He did not talk further about any injuries he may have sustained .
It took about five hours to rescue Joveer , Fairfax rescue member Sam Gray said , adding that the disaster was the worst he 'd seen .
" Obviously , it was pretty nice to find somebody that we were able to help , " Gray said .
" Unfortunately , we could n't get to everybody but we 're going to keep trying and keep working while we 're here .
This is the first of many people that we 're going to help over the next couple of weeks . "
Earlier Thursday , residents conducted their own mission and spent three hours digging out Philip Jean Renol from his home .
He suffered a broken leg and two broken arms .
At a school house , a group of men had been working since Wednesday to dig out a man from beneath what was left of the five - story building .
They worked in assembly - line fashion with some tapping away with chisels and one operating a blow torch to melt away parts of the concrete debris crushing the victim .
With his right shoulder pinned and his hand trapped , his screams could be heard as the men desperately labored to free him .
Finally , he emerged from beneath the destroyed school alive when two men lifted his concrete - dusted body Thursday .
From inside the school other voices were heard .
Children and teachers are believed to be trapped inside .
Throughout the day , ongoing rescue attempts were taking place all over Port - au - Prince , many with outcomes as yet unknown .
A search - and - rescue crew of American , Chilean and French members found a woman trapped at the Hotel Montana in Petionville , just outside Port - au - Prince .
Officer David Barlow of the Fairfax team told CNN the crew was trying to reach the woman from two different points .
The victim , who was a guest at the hotel , was stuck in the bar area of the five - story hotel that had collapsed into a 30 - foot - tall pile .
France has expressed concern for the approximately 200 French tourists who were staying at the Hotel Montana .
Three French girls trapped in rubble had only one French firefighter digging for them , reflective of a severe need for rescue workers and equipment .
In another location in Port - au - Prince , two people were pulled from the ruins of the Caribbean Market by the Icelandic International Search and Rescue Team , Iceland 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced .
But another woman , Nadia , was still entombed inside the four - level market place .
She has not had water for almost 48 hours and has told rescuers she feels tired .
Rescuers said they had yet to devise a plan to extract her safely .
Near the presidential palace , residents dug for hours Wednesday to rescue a 13 - year - old girl named Bea .
A wild cheer erupted as she was pulled out alive .
But nearby lay the bodies of four of her family members .
Haitians and rescuers are rushing in the hope that more survivors can be pulled out alive from beneath the multitude of wreckage sites , but some have accepted that some will perish waiting for help .
" Honestly , it 's an incredible amount of devastation and an incredible amount of people that will probably lose their lives here , " Gray said .
" The hardest part is to know how many people that are n't going to be saved . "

These pictures from mink farms were taken during the summer and autumn of 2018 at four Finnish fur farms .
Two of the farms were in Närpiö , one in Korsnäsissä and one in Alajärvi .
Besides these mink farms , the investigators also visited two fox and raccoon dog farms .
One mink farm was visited three times , in June , August and October .
Some of the farms have been named as “ top quality ” farms by the fur farmer ’s association and they have won prizes and recognition from the industry .
The conditions for animals on these farms were the same as on any other farm .
The images prove that problems like cannibalism and stereotypical behaviour are present even on the “ best ” and highest ranking fur farms .
Cannibalism at mink farms is most common during the breeding season in early spring , when the young are 1 – 2 months old .
According to the fur farmers association , up to 5 % of the young mink die due to cannibalism .
These investigations took place in late summer and autumn , which means that it was not the “ cannibalism season ” .
Bart Stupak and Ben Nelson have chosen to open a can of worms as each , in the Senate and the House , have pushed to include a ban on private abortion insurance coverage in health care reform efforts .
In opposition , some are saying ( President Obama included ) we should maintain the " status qou " in regards to health coverage of abortion care - a prohibiton on the use of federal funds for abortion services .
But here 's the thing .
This " status quo " was never something the majority of health advocates and reproductive rights supporters were comfortable with to begin with ( to put it mildly ) .
The " status quo " is the result of the Hyde Amendment , passed by Congress in 1976 which resulted in low income women - those women without health insurance or the means to pay for an abortion out - of - pocket - being denied access to legal , safe abortion .
Way back when Barack Obama was running for the Presidency ( remember that ? ) his staff actually told RH Reality Check , in our candidate questionnaire , that he opposed the Hyde Amendment :
" He believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor woman 's decision whether to carry to term or to terminate her pregnancy and selectively withhold benefits because she seeks to exercise her right of reproductive choice in a manner the government disfavors . "
Time may forget but the internet never does .
Before the Hyde Amendment went into effect , Medicaid paid for one - third of all abortions .
After Hyde ?
Women on Medicaid , women in the miltary , disabled women using disability insurance and women receiving care through the Indian Health Services were effectively shut out of abortion services - legal abortion became a privilege rather than a right for these women .
While this current fight over the trampling of women 's rights within health care reform legislation has been long and difficult , it has afforded us a perfect opportunity to invest more energy in our fight to overturn the Hyde Amendment .
We do n't want to ensure the status quo in regards to public and private coverage of abortion care .
We want to ensure equity , parity and justice .
In fact , Frances Kissling says that the answer to the Stupak Amendment IS to overturn the Hyde Amendment .
Kissling writes ( of the passage of the Stupak Amendment ) ,
If nothing else happens as a result of this defeat , complete and total dedication to overturning Hyde must be the centerpiece , indeed the single objective of our movement .
And now the Center for Reproductive Rights ( CRR ) is leading the charge with a new video featuring Illdoctrine .
com 's Jay Smooth and some of your favorite bloggers ( including RH Reality Check 's rockin ' writers Sarah Seltzer , Amanda Marcotte and Heather Corinna ) on why Congress should n't be able to single out abortion in this health care discussion and why the Hyde Amendment should be overturned .
Smooth asks , " Why does this one crowd get to pick and choose on this one thing ? ! "
In other words , says CRR , some in Congress have decided abortion should n't be funded by the federal government but guess what ?
I do n't want our federal funds going to crisis pregnancy centers or abstinence only until marriage programs as HIV and pregnancy prevention " tools " or an inflated military .

The Truth
January 15 , 2010
“ They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security , deserve neither liberty or security . ”
- Benjamin Franklin
It is now official .
A majority of Americans are willing to give up liberty in order to be safer from terrorism .
A stunning new McClatchy - Ipsos poll has found that 51 percent of Americans agree with this statement : “ it is necessary to give up some civil liberties in order to make the country safe from terrorism . ”
Only 36 percent of those polled agreed with this statement : “ some of the government ’s proposals will go too far in restricting the public ’s civil liberties . ”
So are Americans really this stupid ?
Have they really been brainwashed into willingly giving up their essential liberties just so they can feel a little safer ?
Maybe they have .
After all , a new USA TODAY / Gallup poll says that 78 percent of Americans approve of the new full body scanners that the U.S. government wants to install in all U.S. airports .
[ efoods ]
So almost 4 out of 5 Americans are perfectly fine with letting airport security officials gawk at their naked bodies just so they can feel a bit safer from terrorists .
How sick is that ?
The truth is that when Americans allow themselves to become so wimpy and so fearful that they are willing to throw many of their most important freedoms out the window , those responsible for the terror scares have won .
In fact , Amerika ( formerly America ) is very quickly becoming a brutal police state where privacy is a thing of the past and where free speech and alternative points of view are openly repressed .
For example , in a 2008 academic paper President Barack Obama ’s appointee to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs advocated “ cognitive infiltration ” of groups that advocate “ conspiracy theories ” .
Infiltration of groups with alternative viewpoints that the government does n’t like ?
Do we live in East Germany ?
Apparently we do .
Americans do not care about their freedoms and liberties anymore , so now they are being taken away .
And apparently the message of the most recent polls is that Americans are perfectly fine with that .

( CNN ) -- Advocates for sex workers in South Africa have warned that this summer 's World Cup could be a public health disaster .
With up to half a million football fans expected to visit South Africa for the World Cup , and up to half of South Africa 's prostitutes carrying the HIV virus , there have been calls for the country to decriminalize prostitution to help tackle the spread of HIV .
Eric Harper , director of the Cape Town - based Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Taskforce ( SWEAT ) , told CNN that the World Cup would inevitably lead to a demand for sex workers .
" And where there 's demand there will be a supply , " Harper told CNN .
" It could be a potential recipe for disaster both for the clients and the sex workers , " he added .
Harper told CNN that while there are no accurate figures for the number of sex workers in South Africa , his organization believes there are 3,000 in Cape Town alone .
The UN estimates that in South Africa 5.7 million people are HIV positive , more than in any other country .
A 2005 University of Michigan study found that 46 percent of female sex workers in Johannesburg had HIV .
Those figures , coupled with the expected influx of visitors for the World Cup , are causing concern for some South Africans .
Harper said HIV is just one of the dangers faced by South Africa 's sex workers .
As well as the risk of contracting other STIs , there is the chance of unwanted pregnancies and the ever - present threat of violence and rape .
Prostitution is illegal in South Africa , but the law is currently being reviewed as part of a larger assessment of all sexual offenses .
Harper believes decriminalizing prostitution can help control the spread of HIV .
" Throughout the world people have acknowledged that if you want to reduce HIV you need to be able to engage the population and address human rights concerns , " he told CNN .
" One of the key messages is that decriminalization is a way of accessing sex workers . "
Harper argued that criminalization drives prostitution underground .
He said that removing the threat of prosecution would make it easier to provide sex workers with condoms and make it easier for sex workers to turn down clients who refuse to use condoms .
Any possible change to the legal status of prostitution remains some way off , with South Africa 's Law Reform Commission expected to make its recommendations to the Minister of Justice in 2011 .
Meanwhile , Harper would like to see prostitution decriminalized at least for the duration of the World Cup .
It 's an idea that was also put forward in 2007 by police commissioner Jackie Selebi , now suspended on corruption charges .
But Dellene Clark , of the Law Reform Commission , told CNN that the government was not considering a temporary amnesty and that it would be " nigh on impossible " to rush the legislation through parliament in time for the tournament .
Julian Seedat of the South African National AIDS Council , which advises the government on HIV and AIDS , is also expecting an increase in prostitution during the World Cup , but he is more optimistic about the health implications .
" I do n't think the World Cup will necessarily bring an increased risk of the spread of HIV , " he told CNN .
" Over the years there has been an incredible amount of education and awareness work done among sex workers .
Years ago the high - risk groups were thought to be homosexuals and sex workers , but there has been such a focus on education for these groups that their behavior has really changed .
It 's quite the norm for a commercial sex worker to have a bag full of condoms . "
Seedat said all public health centers in South Africa offer free voluntary counseling and HIV testing , and that organizations like SWEAT had helped educate sex workers about the importance of using condoms and being tested if they have practiced unsafe sex .
" People in the sex work sector make sure that they 're protected , that they 're tested and that they know their [ HIV ] status , " he said .
Harper said most sex workers do practice safe sex , but many clients do n't want to use a condom .
He added that as long as prostitution remains illegal , protecting sex workers and their clients during the World Cup would be problematic .
He told CNN , " We have to make condoms freely available and we have to make it possible for sex workers to report human rights violations like child prostitution and people trafficking . "
A movement is growing quietly , steadily , and with great speed .
In basements , attics , garages , and living rooms , amateurs and professionals alike are moving steadily towards disparate though unified goals .
They come home from work or school and transform into biologists : do - it - yourself biologists , to be exact .
DIYbiology ( “ DIYbio ” ) is a homegrown synthesis of software , hardware , and wetware .
In the tradition of homebrew computing and in the spirit of the Make space ( best typified by o‘ Reilly ‘s Make Magazine ) , these DIYers hack much more than software and electronics .
These biohackers build their own laboratory equipment , write their own code ( computer and genetic ) and design their own biological systems .
They engineer tissue , purify proteins , extract nucleic acids and alter the genome itself .
Whereas typical laboratory experiments can run from tens - of - thousands to millions of dollars , many DIYers knowledge of these fields is so complete that the best among them design and conduct their own experiments at stunningly low costs .
With adequate knowledge and ingenuity , DIYbiologists can build equipment and run experiments on a hobbyist ‘s budget .
As the movement evolves , cooperatives are also springing up where hobbyists are pooling resources and creating “ hacker spaces ” and clubs to further reduce costs , share knowledge and boost morale .
This movement , still embryonic , could become a monster — a proper rival to industry , government , and academic labs .
The expertise needed to make serious breakthroughs on a regular basis at home has n‘t yet reached a critical mass , but there are good reasons to believe that this day will soon come .
Software
DIYbio software has been around for a long time .
Folding@home , which came out of Professor vinjay Pande ‘s group at Stanford Chemistry Department in 2000 , is designed to perform computationally intensive simulations of protein folding and other molecular dynamics .
FAH , as it ‘s known , is now considered the most powerful distributed computing cluster in the world .
Open source software for bioinformatics , computational neuroscience , and computational biology is plentiful and continues to grow .
On their own time , students , professors , entrepreneurs , and curious amateurs contribute to open source work that captures their interests .
BioPerl and BioPython have hundreds of contributors and tens of thousands of users .
Programs like GENESIS and NEURON have been downloaded by computational neuroscientists for over twenty years .
The software part is easy .
The FOSS / OSS machine is well established , and has been successful for a long time .
As the shift to open source software continues , computational biology will become even more accessible , and even more powerful .
( Red Hat has recently asked the US Supreme Court to bar all software patents , submitting an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in the “ Bilski case . ” See Resources . )
Hardware
Biological research is expensive .
Microscopes , pipetmen , PCR machines , polyacrylamide gels , synthesizers — basics for any molecular biology lab — run from hundreds to thousands of dollars apiece .
Traditional experiments cost hundreds - of - thousands to millions of dollars to conduct .
How can the hobbyist afford this equipment ?
Unless “ Joe ( or Jill ) the DIYBiologist ” is extremely wealthy , they can‘t .
So instead of purchasing brand new equipment , DIYers like to find good deals at auction sites like eBay or Dovebid , refurbish discarded equipment from labs or biotech companies , or — more and more frequently — build it themselves .
Hardware hacking has a rich history , filled with geek heroes , and these skills are being turned towards the creation of biotech equipment .
On the bleeding edge of it all , some DIYbiologists are applying their skills to h+ technologies .
SENS researchers John Schloendorn , Tim Webb , and Kent Kemmish are conducting life - extension research for the SENS Foundation , building equipment for longevity research , saving thousands of dollars doing it themselves .
Stem cell extraction and manipulation , DIY prosthetics , DIY neural prosthetics , sensory enhancements , immune system testing , general tweaking of whatever system strikes the hobbyist ‘s fancy .
The DIY SENS lab is headed by PhD candidate John Schloendorn .
John is a last - year PhD student at Arizona State University .
He volunteers full time for the SENS Foundation .
Entering his lab was a mind - blowing experience .
The ceilings were high , the lab itself was spacious and well - lit .
It smelled of sawdust , the product of constructing the furniture on site .
The equipment was handmade , but brilliantly so .
Elegance and function were clear priorities .
When a panel could be replaced with a tinted membrane , it was .
When metal could be replaced by sanded wood , it was .
The on - site laser was modified from a tattoo - removal system .
Costs were down , but the technical skill involved in manufacturing was top notch .
In addition to his own experiments , Schloendorn is building an incubator ( no pun intended ) for DIYbio engineers who work on fighting death .
Schloendorn tells me that working by ourselves might only take us so far , but thinks it ‘s a great place to start ( many successful discoveries and businesses were founded in someone ‘s garage ) .
He believes that being a DIYer does n‘t mean you must “ go it alone , ” but can include cooperation and teamwork .
He cautions that since time and effort are limited , DIYers must choose carefully what they ‘re going to work on and do that which is most important for them .
His personal priority is to solve parts of the aging question , and he ‘d obviously like many other DIYers to take up this challenge .
“ I wanted to make a dent in the suffering and death caused by aging .
It seemed like the SENS people were the smartest , most resourceful and best organized among those ambitious enough .
Of course , there are also DIYers with no ambitions to save the world , who are content to ‘ make yogurt glow ‘ in the basement for their own personal satisfaction . ”
The DIYbio community has a high - traffic mailing list , where projects are discussed , designs shared , and questions asked or answered .
The community has worked on dozens of DIY designs : gel electrophoresis techniques , PCR machines , alternative dyes and gels , light microscopes , and DNA extraction techniques .
All of them focus on enabling cheap and effective science .
Wetware
The most popular conception of wetware is the genome — the language of life , the ultimate hackable code .
Genetic engineering and ( more recently ) synthetic biology are the hallmarks of this effort .
Synthetic biology takes genetic engineering and builds it into a scalable engineering framework .
It is the synthesis of complex , biologically - based ( or inspired ) systems that display functions that do not exist in nature .
In synthetic biology , genetic code is abstracted into chunks , colloquially known as biological “ parts . ”
These parts allow us to build increasingly complex systems : putting several parts together creates a “ device ” that is regulated by start codons , stop codons , restriction sites , and similar coding regions known as “ features . ”
( Visit MIT ‘s Standard Registry of Biological Parts for more detailed information , and tutorials on how to make your own biological part . )
These parts are primarily designed by undergraduates competing in the International Genetically Engineered Machine ( iGEM ) competition , the largest student synthetic biology symposium .
At the beginning of the summer , student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
Working at their own schools over the summer , they use these parts , and new parts of their own design , to build biological systems and operate them in living cells .
Randy Rettberg , director of the iGEM competition , says that iGEM is addressing the question : “ Can simple biological systems be built from standard , interchangeable parts and operated in living cells ?
Or is biology just too complicated to be engineered in this way ? ”
The broader goals of iGEM include enabling the systematic engineering of biology , promoting the open and transparent development of tools for engineering biology , and helping to construct a society that can productively apply biological technology .
If this sounds suspiciously like a front for DIYbio , that ‘s probably because it is .
In addition to attracting the brightest young minds to the critical field of molecular biology , many of the founders of iGEM , including Drew Endy at Stanford , Tom Knight at MIT , and DIYbio - rep Mac Cowell are heavily involved in or supportive of the DIYbio community .
The recent introduction of iGEM teams unaffiliated with universities ( “ DIYgem ” ) is a step towards an inclusive community , allowing anyone with the brain and the drive to participate at the level of academics .
So many seeking , Around lampposts of today , Change is on the wind .

Mainstream science is increasingly friendly to DIYbio .
DIYbiologist Jason Bobe works on George Church ‘s Personal Genome Project ( PGP ) , which shares and supports DIYbio ‘s drive to make human genome data available for anyone to use .
How to get involved
Join the DIYbio mailing list ( see Resources ) .
Anyone can join and it ‘s the best way to begin your involvement with DIYbio .
You ‘ll want to check out their DIYbio forums , which are growing rapidly .
You can also find a local group there and connect with like - minded DIYers .
Have a look around the DIYbio.org site , which lists some of the current projects :
BioWeatherMaps : “ Self - Assembly Required ”
Flash mobs meet consumer - generated science in the new DIYbio initiative Flashlabs , where they ‘ll be pulling - off a new large - scale collaborative science project annually for amateurs and enthusiasts worldwide .
Case in point — the BioWeatherMap initiative is a " global , grassroots , distributed environmental sensing effort aimed at answering some very basic questions about the geographic and temporal distribution patterns of microbial life . "
SKDB : “ Apt - Get for Real Stuff ( Hardware ) ”
Skdb is a free and open source hardware package management system .
The idea is to let the user “ make ” a project by using all of the packaged hardware out on the web , so that the wheel is n‘t reinvented every time a new project is started .
The package includes milling machines , gel boxes , semiconductor manufacturing processes , fabratories , robot armies , wetlab protocols … everything .
At the moment , they ‘re working on OpenCASCADE integration .
Package maintainers from the DIYbio and open manufacturing communities assist others in bringing in projects into the system .
Smartlab : “ Taking the Work out of Benchwork ”
Project Smartlab is aiming to build hardware to augment the benchtop science experience .
This includes automatic data logging instruments with painless electronic lab book integration , video streaming with “ instant replay ” features for those “ did - I - just - pipette - that - into - the - wrong - tube ” moments , and interactive protocol libraries that guide new scientists and the scientifically enthusiastic alike through tricky protocols .
The Pearl Gel Box : “ A Built - In Transilluminator and Casting Box for $ 199 ! ”
Want to get a jump start in DIYbio ?
The gel electrophoresis box is a basic tool for any DIYbiologist — and they ‘re making kits so you can build your own .
The Pearl Gel Box is cutting edge , open - source , and cheap .
The participants in this project have created a professional grade gel box , available fully assembled or as free design documents .
Plus , they want you to design new features like a built - in light filter or a mount for your digital cam .
This is a mere glimpse into the vast undertaking that is DIYbio .
Most DIYers work independently on projects that have significant personal meaning .
Tyson Anderson , a specialist in the US Army , was struck by the lack of technological infrastructure during his time in Afghanistan .
Anderson , a transhumanist as well as a DIYbiologist , was trying to discuss the implications of the Singularity with the friends he had made there .
He realized it was difficult to conceive of a technological paradise in a world with limited electricity .
He looked to DIYbio to make a difference , and is now engineering bioluminescent yeast to construct sugar - powered lamps for his friends in Afghanistan .
Because there is much overlap between the DIYbio and transhumanist communities , it ‘s not surprising that many emerging projects focus on both .
DIY - SENS is only the tip of the iceberg .
DIYh + is a fusion of DIYbio and h+ , coordinating projects that allow willing individuals to experiment with practical human enhancement .
Example projects include supplement / exercise regimens , DIY - tDCS , DIY - EEG , and the personal harvesting of stem cells .
From the group description : “ This group is a friendly cross between DIYbio and Open Source Medicine , with a dash of the ImmInst ( Immortality Institute ) forums [ see Resources ] .
It ‘s the slightly edgier half of OSM .
The community , ideally , should strive to foster an open and safe way for responsible adults to learn about do - it - yourself human enhancement .
We do not believe in limiting the use of medical technology to therapy . ”
It ‘s not just enhancement technology that can benefit from DIYbiology .
As the popular distrust of doctors grows , people will want to understand and monitor their own body .
Likewise , as personalized medicine becomes a reality , we will probably see a rise in the number of hobbyists who treat their own bodies as machines to be worked on — like a radio or a car — branching out from personalized genomics to things like DIY stem cell extraction and manipulation , DIY prosthetics , DIY neural prosthetics and sensory enhancements ( infrared vision , anyone ? ) , immune system testing , and general tweaking of whatever system strikes the hobbyist ‘s fancy .
This hacker ‘s paradise has not yet come to pass , but it is , perhaps , our exciting future .
The road to true DIYbiology will not be easy .
It ‘s not a magic bullet .
It will probably not produce the next Bill Gates , at least not for a long time .
Biology is hard , messy , and failure is more common than success .
The knowledge required takes time and effort to acquire , and even then , so - called textbook knowledge is being revised almost daily .
Many are attracted by the glamour of it all .
They ‘re drawn to the romance of being a wetware hacker — the existential thrill of tweaking life itself .
They tend to become quickly disappointed by the slow , tedious , difficult path they face .
Hobbyist biology is still in its infancy , and it will take a great deal of work before it reaches its potential .
Few are more skeptical than DIYbiologists themselves .
But many see no choice .
Squabbles over sponsorship , intellectual property , and cumbersome regulations often prevent progress along more conventional lines .
An anonymous DIYbiologist puts it this way : “ universities charge far more than the experiments really cost , and bureaucratic rules constantly retard real progress . ”
Questions of IP and ownership can hamstring innovation in industry , while concerns for national security prevent real information sharing in government science .
Large , unwieldy bureaucracies and regulatory agencies find it difficult to keep pace with the breakneck speed of technological progress .
Thought - monopolies make it unwise to promote new ideas while waiting for tenure , despite the fact that many central dogmas of biology change .
Individuals willing to intelligently circumvent convention may find themselves stumbling into uncharted areas of biology where they may make new discoveries .
Indeed , it is only in the last century that biology has become an unreachable part of the academic - corporate - government machine .
History ‘s naturalists , from Darwin to Mendel , are the true fathers of DIYbiology .
They shared the spirit of discovery and scientific ingenuity and the drive to “ figure it out yourself . ”
No one told Isaac Newton to discover the laws of classical mechanics , and you can bet he was never given calculus homework .
Einstein ‘s life would have been respectable if he had n‘t spent a silent decade questioning the nature of spacetime .
They were driven by the simple need to know , and they would not be stopped by the incidental truth that no one had figured it out before .
DIYbiology is perhaps a reemergence of this basic curiosity , applied to the study of life .
As technologyl advances , let us study the workings of the cell the same way Newton may have studied the effects of gravity .
Who would n‘t want to know ?
Who can resist a peek at the mechanisms of our own existence ?
DIYbio may be young , but it is a symptom of our species ‘ unbreakable curiosity .
We will know these secrets too , someday .
“ For me , chemistry represented an indefinite cloud of future potentialities which enveloped my life to come in black volutes torn by fiery flashes , like those which had hidden Mount Sinai .
Like Moses , from that cloud I expected my law , the principle of order in me , around me , and in the world .
I would watch the buds swell in spring , the mica glint in the granite , my own hands , and I would say to myself : I will understand this , too , I will understand everything . ” — Primo Levi
Without a lab supervisor to guide them , DIYbiologists must take a carefully disciplined ( and perhaps more genuine ) approach to science .
DIYbio has the potential to revive a noble tradition of pure scientific curiosity , with a modern , engineering twist .
If you want to get something done , some day it really will be possible to do it yourself .

Kate Burrows was flying from Guernsey back home to the Isle of Man in her PA30 , a Comanche Twin , when she noticed problems with her right engine .
She shut down the engine and , as she was still some 38 miles from the Isle of Man , she decided to divert to Blackpool .
A few minutes later , her left engine lost power .
She contacted the distress centre and they recommended she continue to Blackpool but she realised she was n’t going to make it .
Another pilot heard the conversation and reported it on PPRuNe .
GA Aircraft Ditching Irish Sea
Heard this unfold on D&D when overflying – Female pilot reporting double engine failure and unable to make destination at that time reported to be 18 miles away .
She sound relatively calm and composed under the circumstances , reporting that she was visual with some oil rigs and would circle around them ……. and “ possibly land on one ” !!
However I am delighted that she made it , job well done – even if it was n’t the planned outcome !
Kate Burrows signed up to the forums as ManxLadyBird and gave a first hand account of her experience :
I did indeed ditch in the Irish sea .
I was about 38 miles from IOM when my right prop had a runaway , it was overspeeding in excess of 2800 rpm and I could not stabilise it .
The MP was low as well so I did not have much to play with .
I felt it was uncontrollable and shut it down .
The PA30 can fly perfectly well on one engine so I descended to 4000 ft to get out of the cloud layers and diverted to Blackpool .
About 6 minutes into my diversion my left engine lost power .
My MP was down to 17 inches .
I did all the checks changed fuel tanks , cross feed , electrics , boost pumps etc .
No go .
D & D wanted me to try for Blackpool 18 miles away but I would not have reached there .
I was near the oil rigs so elected to land in the vicinity .
I spotted the support ship and ditched near it .
I got out and had to hold onto the life raft .
There were no steps on the life raft and no way to pull myself in .
The oil rig helicopter was hovering nearby to spot me whilst the support vessel rescue craft picked me up .
Once on the ship I was checked out and the RAF Seaking from RAF Valley winched me up and took me to Blackpool .
I was checked out at the Hospital there and ok to fly home on Manx2. com ’s aircraft .
All the emergency services and the police were fantastic and could n’t have been more helpful .
Lots of things were in my favour .
In my training as a commercial pilot it was instilled ‘ fly the aircraft ’ .
Sort out the problem and then make a decision and stick to it .
This is what I did .
My husband insisted on me flying in an immersion suit .
Thanks to him , it helped .
The weather was benign but cold .
The sea had slight swell .
If the wind had been greater than the 15 or so knots the waves would have been bigger and it might have been different .
The ship was there and were alerted so I was only in the water for about 5 minutes .
Was there anything I would have done differently , no I do n’t think so .
I did everything I could think of the get my engines back but once I had made the decision I followed it through .
Even having 2 engines does n’t always guarantee getting there but someone was looking over my shoulder on Wednesday and I am here to have Christmas with my family .
The PA30 hit the water at approximately 90 mpg .
The pilot ’s description of the final moments of the flight were published in the Isle of Man Today :
‘ I opened the door of the cockpit prior to touching down .
I did n’t really have time to think about it — I just got into emergency mode .
I said a few Anglo Saxon words to the effect “ oh dear , I ’m going to get wet ” .
‘ I landed tail heavy so it took all the force of the approach .
The tail took the brunt , the cockpit bellyflopped and the door flew open .
An oil rig helicopter hovered about 100 ft away .
‘ I climbed on to the wing and made for my life raft but I could n’t get in it — I was hanging on to the side .
The tail of the aircraft was at 90 degrees to the fuselage .
‘ I was only in the water for four to five minutes when the fast response craft from the support vessel came to pick me up . ’
She rang and told her husband : ‘ I ’ve broken the aeroplane and my finger nail .
He replied : ‘ Why ca n’t you just break cars like other people ! ’
Meanwhile , back at the PPRuNe forums , ManxLadyBird gave a detailed description of how she felt as this was happening .
GA Aircraft Ditching Irish Sea :
If you remember back to your very first landing you did as a student pilot , not even a solo , but your first .
You thought you were going far too fast and ooooh ‘ eck its gonna hurt , but you flared and the wheels touch down and all was calm ….
well the first part is true and the second part is n’t .
I was lucky because I had my undercarriage folded away so I had a relatively smooth underside .
But you feel you are coming in far too fast , but you cannot slow down , certainly in a Comanche as if you go much below 80 knots she will fall out of the sky , so you come in fast , the lower to the water you get you tend to lose a bit of elevator authority or so it felt , you feel like you want to stretch the glide but that wo n’t work either .
At the last couple of feet you haul on the elevator and touch down tail hard so it takes all the force of the landing and bleeds the speed off .
It makes a hell of a bang , and if I knew what hitting a brick wall was like I would say it was like hitting a brick wall .
It was hard .
The main fuselage then belly flops on the water .
You should already have opened the door and latched it open on the way down so when the frame distorts your door is already open .
On the way down you have opened the door , you should then tighten your straps and put your feet on the floor .
If they are on the pedals they could slip past and get trapped .
What are you going to do with the pedals anyway ?
I also held onto the controls as a way of bracing myself .
I think because of hitting the tail hard and my bracing I prevented myself taking the full force of the ditching and therefore prevented whiplash .
I had also made sure my props were feathered so the water did not catch them and help water loop me .
All my safety equipment was in easy grab reach .
I told the D&D people exactly where I was ( but they knew that ) and what I was going to do and they worked the rescue round me .
They wanted me to glide 18 miles but I knew I had about 10 miles glide so I had to make the plan and execute it .
The other thing to remember is that your time frames all go to pot .
What you think is 5 minutes could be 30 seconds or 10 minutes .
I do know however that I ditched at 1223 , like a good pilot I looked at my watch on landing !!
It ’s always good to reflect on accidents with a positive outcome .
I found it fascinating to read a first - hand account of the sequence of events and how Kate Burrows dealt with the situation .
I can only hope that I am as level - headed and organised if I end up in a distress situation .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Tidal forces parallel to a segment of the San Andreas Fault in central California may be causing non-volcanic tremors that could help predict earthquakes , researchers said on Wednesday .

Low - level tremors have long been associated with volcanoes , because they often warn of impending eruptions .
A study published in the journal Nature says these tremors beneath the San Andreas Fault could provide similar clues about earthquakes .
The researchers say the faint tug of the sun and the moon on the fault causes tremors well below the level where earthquakes occur .
The finding suggests that rock far underground is lubricated with pressurized water , allowing the rock to slip easily and weakening the fault .
“ If you could go down there and push the rock with your hand you would cause a tremor , ” said researcher Amanda Thomas of the University of California , Berkeley .
Thomas and colleagues analyzed nearly 2,000 tremors detected over eight years in the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault .
They also looked at micro-earthquakes in the same area and calculated the stresses produced by the Earth and ocean tides .
The study says they found a strong correlation between non-volcanic tremor activity and extremely small , tidal stresses parallel to the San Andreas Fault .
Thomas says studying tremors could help seismologists better understand and , perhaps , predict earthquake activity .
“ They ’re looking at tremor as kind of an indicator of large earthquakes as tremors signal the buildup of strain below the fault zone , ” Thomas said .
“ So we might be able to use tremor to tell us something about when the next large earthquake will happen . ”

Former Louisiana congressman William Jefferson was sentenced Friday to 13 years in prison following his conviction in a corruption case that featured a freezer full of suspected bribe money stuffed into boxes of veggie burgers .
A federal judge in Alexandria , Va. , handed down the sentence to Mr. Jefferson , a 62 - year - old Democrat ousted by voters last year .
He had been convicted by a jury of bribery , money laundering and racketeering in schemes that prosecutors said he devised to enrich himself and his family .

This remarkable recording of ice - sheets cracking on a frozen lake sounds just like a Star Wars blaster fight .
Andreas Bick , a Berlin sound designer / composer , made the recording and explains , on his Silent Listening blog : " In my experience , thin ice is especially interesting for acoustic phenomena ; it is more elastic and sounds are propagated better across the surface .
Snowfall , on the other hand , has a muffling effect and the sound can only travel to a limited extent .
The ice sheet acts as a huge membrane across which the cracking and popping sounds spread .
Underwater microphones proved especially well - suited for these recordings : in a small hole drilled close beneath the surface of the water , the sounds emitted by the body of ice carry particularly well . "

So , how was your day yesterday ?
Let me tell you about mine .
( Be warned , it ’s a long story . )
It started well enough .
Finding myself in my minimalist sometime - kitchen with a few bottles of Guinness Extra Stout and Saint Patrick ’s Day on the horizon , I thought I would try a bread that made an appearance in last week ’s YeastSpotting : Mary ’s ( One Perfect Bite ) Rye Bread with Guinness Stout and Fennel Seeds .
I mix it up ( with a couple of adaptations ) ; so far so good .
I must say the aroma of the dough catches my attention , and I know this is going to be one mighty bread .
I decide to go with two larger loaves rather than Mary ’s three , and here ’s where things start getting interesting .
In this kitchen we have no brotforms , no bannetons ; in fact , we have no baskets of any kind except a couple of plastic chip baskets that are way too small for these two - pound loaves .
But we do have a couche ; let ’s see , here it is .
Uh-oh :
The mice have been here , apparently .
And let ’s just say I cleaned the couche up a bit before the photo .
Normally I do n’t wash it , but I think I will make an exception in this case .
Before I use it again .
Moving on to Proofing Plan B :
The medium glass mixing bowl , and the colander , both lined with ( rodent - free ) linen , should do the trick nicely ( and colorfully ) .
While the boules are proofing , I make ( as in mix , roll , and cut ) some pasta I will eat for dinner .
( Why this is an important piece of the story will become clear . )
Forty - five minutes before I estimate they ’ll be done proofing , I preheat the oven to 450 F .
At least I think it ’s 450 ; the display on my range is shot , so I have to set it by counting the number of times I press the “ + ” button , each time increasing the temperature by five degrees .
Sometimes I lose count , but I ’m pretty sure I set it to 450 .
Give or take .
( I like to think that learning to live with uncertainty and lack of visual feedback has made me a stronger person . )
Now this point would also be a good time to put the one of the loaves in the refrigerator for retarding , since I can only bake one loaf at a time .
But I do n’t remember to do that until I put the first loaf in the oven .
So already I ’m prepared for this second loaf to be overproofed , since it will continue to proof some once it ’s in the fridge .
I put the first loaf in the oven , covered with homemade cloche , for 10 minutes .
Remove the cloche , and it ’s looking good !
Turn the oven down to 425 ( I think ) by pressing the “ - ” button five times , set the timer for 30 minutes .
Time to cook the pasta .
I set a pot of water on to boil and go work on the crossword puzzle .
After 20 minutes , the most incredible aroma of fennel and Guinness and rye is filling the house .
I go to check the bread .
Switch on the oven light … nothing .
Drat , the bulb must be burned out .
I open the door and peek inside .
The loaf is brown , but not done yet .
And hey , what ’s with this pasta water ?
It ’s hot but not boiling yet .
There must be something wrong with that burner ; let ’s try another one .
Now back to the puzzle .
When the timer goes off ten minutes later , what the hell ?
The loaf is nowhere near done .
And double what the hell ?
My water is less hot than before .
Is this range even operational ?
Uh , well now that I take the time to tune in and analyze the situation , I see that , no , it is not .
Circuit breaker time .
The circuit switch is clearly labeled “ Range . ”
After a couple more rounds of range - crashing and circuit - resetting , I realize that label should read “ Range and Under - Cabinet Lights . ”
What , the oven , burners , and lights ca n’t all be on at the same time ?
For five years , I have somehow missed this fact ?
OK , so lights OFF , oven ON ( what temperature at this point , God only knows ) , burner ON .
I bake the loaf for some amount of time until it seems done , and truthfully it does n’t seem to have suffered much for being jerked around so much .
It looks and smells great ( see top photo ) .
Meanwhile , the pasta is cooking .
Time to drain it , but where ’s the colander ?
It ’s in the refrigerator of course , holding that second loaf of rye bread with Guinness Stout and fennel seeds .
Damn , I need that colander , and I shall have it .
Now if I had any brains I would transfer the loaf into the ( now free ) bowl I used for the first loaf , and put it immediately back into the refrigerator .
But I think we have established by now that I do not , in fact , have any brains .
So I just take that linen - cradled dough out of its colander - cum - banneton and set it on the counter .
Which by itself wo n’t be too bad if I remember to put it back in the colander and back in the fridge once I ’m done draining the pasta .
Well , that ’s a big IF .
Dinner is good .
The pasta is delicious .
I am just going to rest my eyes for a few minutes before I clean up …
Apparently I was more sleepy than I thought , and it was good to get some rest .
Oh and look , that second loaf got a rest too , right here on the counter where I left it , uh … can it really be almost two hours ago ?
It ’s not really a ball of dough any longer , more like a deflated mini- basketball .
Should I just toss it ?
I decide to schlep it back into the colander , back into the fridge , and deal with it in the morning .
So this morning , after deflating it even more with the scoring , I bake it , and damned if this is n’t what I get .
The second of two loaves that refuse to die :
And just to let you know , Mary was kidding when she said the flavors in this bread are strong .
They ’re not strong , they are Herculean .
Finally we come to my adaptation of the recipe .
I know the directions get a little fuzzy at the end there .
Just do whatever , I ’m sure the bread will land on its feet .
Now please excuse me , I have to go call the electrician .

Method :
With U.S. President Barack Obama 's announcement of his strategy in Afghanistan , the U.S. - jihadist war has entered a new phase .
With its allies , the United States has decided to increase its focus on the Afghan war while continuing to withdraw from Iraq .
Along with focusing on Afghanistan , it follows that there will be increased Western attention on Pakistan .
Meanwhile , the question of what to do with Iran remains open , and is in turn linked to U.S. - Israeli relations .
The region from the Mediterranean to the Hindu Kush remains in a war or near - war status .
In a fundamental sense , U.S. strategy has not shifted under Obama : The United States remains in a spoiling - attack state .
As we have discussed , the primary U.S. interest in this region is twofold .
The first aspect is to prevent the organization of further major terrorist attacks on the United States .
The second is to prevent al Qaeda and other radical Islamist groups from taking control of any significant countries .
U.S. operations in this region mainly consist of spoiling attacks aimed at frustrating the jihadists ' plans rather than at imposing Washington 's will in the region .
The United States lacks the resources to impose its will , and ultimately does n't need to .
Rather , it needs to wreck its adversaries ' plans .
In both Afghanistan and Iraq , the primary American approach consists of this tack .
That is the nature of spoiling attacks .
Obama has thus continued the Bush administration 's approach to the war , though he has shifted some details .
The Jihadist Viewpoint
It is therefore time to consider the war from the jihadist point of view .
This is a difficult task given that the jihadists do not constitute a single , organized force with a command structure and staff that could express that view .
It is compounded by the fact that al Qaeda prime , our term for the original al Qaeda that ordered and organized the attacks on 9/11 and in Madrid and London , is now largely shattered .
While bearing this in mind , it must be remembered that this fragmentation is both a strategic necessity and a weapon of war for jihadists .
The United States can strike the center of gravity of any jihadist force .
It naturally cannot strike what does n't exist , so the jihadist movement has been organized to deny the United States that center of gravity , or command structure which , if destroyed , would leave the movement wrecked .
Thus , even were Osama bin Laden killed or captured , the jihadist movement is set up to continue .
So although we cannot speak of a jihadist viewpoint in the sense that we can speak of an American viewpoint , we can ask this question :
If we were a jihadist fighter at the end of 2009 , what would the world look like to us , what would we want to achieve and what might we do to try to achieve that ?
We must bear in mind that al Qaeda began the war with a core strategic intent , namely , to spark revolutions in the Sunni Muslim world by overthrowing existing regimes and replacing them with jihadist regimes .
This was part of the jihadist group 's long - term strategy to recreate a multinational Islamist empire united under al Qaeda 's interpretation of Shariah .
The means toward this end involved demonstrating to the Muslim masses that their regimes were complicit with the leading Christian power , i.e. , the United States , and that only American backing kept these Sunni regimes in power .
By striking the United States on Sept. 11 , al Qaeda wanted to demonstrate that the United States was far more vulnerable than believed , by extension demonstrating that U.S. client regimes were not as powerful as they appeared .
This was meant to give the Islamic masses a sense that uprisings against Muslim regimes not dedicated to Shariah could succeed .
In their view , any American military response - an inevitability after 9/11 - would further incite the Muslim masses rather than intimidate them .
The last eight years of war have ultimately been disappointing to the jihadists , however .
Rather than a massive uprising in the Muslim world , not a single regime has been replaced with a jihadist regime .
The primary reason has been that Muslim regimes allied with the United States decided they had more to fear from the jihadists than from the Americans , and chose to use their intelligence and political power to attack and suppress the jihadists .
In other words , rather than trigger an uprising , the jihadists generated a strengthened anti-jihadist response from existing Muslim states .
The spoiling attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as in other countries in the Horn of Africa and North Africa , generated some support for the jihadists , but that support has since diminished and the spoiling attacks have disrupted these countries sufficiently to make them unsuitable as bases of operation for anything more than local attacks .
In other words , the attacks tied the jihadists up in local conflicts , diverting them from operations against the United States and Europe .
Under this intense pressure , the jihadist movement has fragmented , though it continues to exist .
Incapable of decisive action at the moment , it has goals beyond surviving as a fragmented entity , albeit with some fairly substantial fragments .
And it is caught on the horns of a strategic dilemma .
Operationally , jihadists continue to be engaged against the United States .
In Afghanistan , the jihadist movement is relying on the Taliban to tie down and weaken American forces .
In Iraq , the remnants of the jihadist movement are doing what they can to shatter the U.S. - sponsored coalition government in Baghdad and further tie down American forces by attacking Shiites and key members of the Sunni community .
Outside these two theaters , the jihadists are working to attack existing Muslim governments collaborating with the United States - particularly Pakistan - but with periodic attacks striking other Muslim states .
These attacks represent the fragmentation of the jihadists .
Their ability to project power is limited .
By default , they have accordingly adopted a strategy of localism , in which their primary intent is to strike existing governments while simultaneously tying down American forces in a hopeless attempt to stabilize the situation .
The strategic dilemma is this :
The United States is engaged in a spoiling action with the primary aim of creating conditions in which jihadists are bottled up fighting indigenous forces rather than being free to plan attacks on the United States or systematically try to pull down existing regimes .
And the current jihadist strategy plays directly into American hands .
First , the attacks recruit Muslim regimes into deploying their intelligence and security forces against the jihadists , which is precisely what the United States wants .
Secondly , it shifts jihadist strength away from transnational actions to local actions , which is also what the United States wants .
These local attacks , which kill mostly Muslims , also serve to alienate many Muslims from the jihadists .
The jihadists are currently playing directly into U.S. hands because , rhetoric aside , the United States cannot regard instability in the Islamic world as a problem .
Let 's be more precise on this :
An ideal outcome for the United States would be the creation of stable , pro-American regimes in the region eager and able to attack and destroy jihadist networks .
There are some regimes in the region like this , such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
The probability of creating such stable , eager and capable regimes in places like Iraq or Afghanistan is unlikely in the extreme .
The second - best outcome for the United States involves a conflict in which the primary forces battling - and neutralizing - each other are Muslim , with the American forces in a secondary role .
This has been achieved to some extent in Iraq .
Obama 's goal is to create a situation in Afghanistan in which Afghan government forces engage Taliban forces with little or no U.S. involvement .
Meanwhile , in Pakistan the Americans would like to see an effective effort by Islamabad to suppress jihadists throughout Pakistan .
If they cannot get suppression , the United States will settle for a long internal conflict that would tie down the jihadists .
A Self - Defeating Strategy
The jihadists are engaged in a self - defeating strategy when they spread out and act locally .
The one goal they must have , and the one outcome the United States fears , is the creation of stable jihadist regimes .
The strategy of locally focused terrorism has proved ineffective .
It not only fails to mobilize the Islamic masses , it creates substantial coalitions seeking to suppress the jihadists .
The jihadist attack on the United States has failed .
The presence of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan has reshaped the behavior of regional governments .
Fear of instability generated by the war has generated counteractions by regional governments .
Contrary to what the jihadists expected or hoped for , there was no mass uprising and therefore no counter to anti-jihadist actions by regimes seeking to placate the United States .
The original fear , that the U.S. presence in Iraq and Afghanistan would generate massive hostility , was not wrong .
But the hostility did not strengthen the jihadists , and instead generated anti-jihadist actions by governments .
From the jihadist point of view , it would seem essential to get the U.S. military out of the region and to relax anti-jihadist actions by regional security forces .
Continued sporadic and ineffective action by jihadists achieves nothing and generates forces with which they can't cope .
If the United States withdrew , and existing tensions within countries like Egypt , Saudi Arabia or Pakistan were allowed to mature undisturbed , new opportunities might present themselves .
Most significantly , the withdrawal of U.S. troops would strengthen Iran .
The jihadists are no friends of Shiite Iran , and neither are Iran 's neighbors .
In looking for a tool for political mobilization in the Gulf region or in Afghanistan absent a U.S. presence , the Iranian threat would best serve the jihadists .
The Iranian threat combined with the weakness of regional Muslim powers would allow the jihadists to join a religious and nationalist opposition to Tehran .
The ability to join religion and nationalism would turn the local focus from something that takes the jihadists away from regime change to something that might take them toward it .
The single most powerful motivator for an American withdrawal would be a period of open quiescence .
An openly stated consensus for standing down , in particular because of a diminished terrorist threat , would facilitate something the Obama administration wants most of all : a U.S. withdrawal from the region .
Providing the Americans with a justification for leaving would open the door for new possibilities .
The jihadists played a hand on 9/11 that they hoped would prove a full house .
It turned into a bust .
When that happens , you fold your hand and play a new one .
And there is always a hand being dealt so long as you have some chips left .
The challenge here is that the jihadists have created a situation in which they have defined their own credibility in terms of their ability to carry out terrorist attacks , however poorly executed or counterproductive they have become .
Al Qaeda prime 's endless calls for action have become the strategic foundation for the jihadists : Action has become an end in itself .
The manner in which the jihadists have survived as a series of barely connected pods of individuals scattered across continents has denied the United States a center of gravity to strike .
It has also turned the jihadists from a semi- organized force into one incapable of defining strategic shifts .
The jihadists ' strategic dilemma is that they have lost the 2001 - 2008 phase of the war but are not defeated .
To begin to recoup , they must shift their strategy .
But they lack the means for doing so because of what they have had to do to survive .
At the same time , there are other processes in play .
The Taliban , which has even more reason to want the United States out of Afghanistan , might shift to an anti-jihadist strategy :
It could liquidate al Qaeda , return to power in Afghanistan and then reconsider its strategy later .
So , too , in other areas .
From the U.S. point of view , an open retreat by the jihadists would provide short - term relief but long - term problems .
The moment when the enemy sues for peace is the moment when the pressure should be increased rather than decreased .
But direct U.S. interests in the region are so minimal that a more distant terrorist threat will be handled in a more distant future .
As the jihadists are too fragmented to take strategic positions , U.S. pressure will continue in any event .
Oddly enough , as much as the United States is uncomfortable in the position it is in , the jihadists are in a much worse position .
We ’re less than a week into the new year and Jack White has already dropped a few surprises on our plate .
The Third Man Records team , aka the A - Team of Rock ( as I like to call them ) , just sent us the most exciting email of the day ( sorry , Mom ) .
Jack
White ’s next round of releases include 7 ” vinyl / digital singles from Wanda “ Queen of Rockabilly ” Jackson , with whom White ’s also working on a full - length album , and The Black Belles , a mysterious all - female rock group shown in the photo above .
Jackson ’s Jack White - produced 7 ” will hold a cover of Amy Winehouse ’s “ You Know I ’m No Good ” on one side and a version of “ Shakin ’ All Over , ” by 1960s British rock band Johnny and the Pirates , on the flip side .
The Black Belles , however , are releasing their first two original songs , “ What Can I Do ” and “ Lies . ” Both singles are set for an iTunes and physical release on January 26 .
Not a bad little early ‘ 10 surprise , no ?
Oh , they ’re not done yet : the Dead Weather ’s recording sessions last month must ’ve gone fairly well , as the first studio takes of two new songs , “ No Horse ( Take One ) ” and “ Jawbreaker ( Take One ) , ” which are being prepped for the follow - up to their debut , Horehound , are coming out as an exclusive 7 ” to members of their subscription service , The Vault .
Most of the toys were imported from China and Taiwan Many of the plastic toys sold in India may contain chemicals harmful to children , an environmental group says in a report .
The Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE ) studied a sample of Indian toys and found that all of them contained high levels of phthalates .
Phthalates are chemicals used to soften plastic and the group says India has no regulations to control their use .
The use of these chemicals in Europe and the US is strictly regulated .
' Most vulnerable '
The CSE studied a sample of toys sold in India and found that all of them contained high levels of phthalates , Sunita Narayan , director of CSE told a press conference in Delhi .
Nearly half of them exceeded the internationally accepted safe limit , she said .
Most of the toys were imported from China , Taiwan and many were produced in India .
The study points out that the youngest children are the most vulnerable because they tend to put toys in their mouth .
While India has set voluntary standards covering the safety of toys , there are no binding regulations .
" I think that is really the concern here in India , that we run away from regulating industry and it is our government , not the Chinese government .
Chinese government is responsible for China , Indian government is responsible to us , " Ms Narayan is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying .
The study says a ban on the import of toys not meeting the voluntary standards is due to expire later this month .
The CSE called on the Indian government to impose mandatory standards on all plastic toys as quickly as possible .

The allegations in the Luzerne County , Pa. , judicial scandal are ugly enough :
In exchange for kickbacks from private detention centers , former county judges Michael T. Conahan and and Mark A. Ciavarella sent hundreds of juveniles off to the centers , sometimes for rather lengthy stays .
Click here , here , here , here and here for previous LB posts on the scandal .
But we recently got wind of an allegation tucked into a civil complaint concerning Ciavarella that 's really not for the faint of heart .
According ...
Detoxing to purge the excesses of the festive season is one of the ways many of us kick - start the new year .
And there are a myriad of diet plans , spa breaks , health and beauty products marketed with a detox label to pick from as we attempt to atone for our over - indulgence .
The term is used to promote everything from foot patches to shampoo .
Products and plans range in price from , say , a few pounds for a detox drink or a fiver for body wash , to thousands of pounds for a spa break designed to flush away the toxins .
For example , you might choose Gillian Mckeith 's 24 - hour detox , which is on sale at amazon.co.uk for £ 19.99 .
This contains a range of " detoxing " ingredients , from papaya to carrots and silica .
It claims that you will " experience the feeling of being lighter , fitter and gain new energy " – with results in one day .
Alternatively , you may opt for a luxury spa break , such as the Ultimate Detox at New Park Manor in the New Forest .
It offers a 10 - day programme that combines a range of activities , including talks on nutrition , daily meditation and treatments .
This would set a couple back a hefty £ 2,485 if they chose to stay in a forest room .
However , while the benefits of a relaxing new year break are not to be underestimated , the British Dietetic Association ( BDA ) , which represents 6,000 UK dieticians , says there is no " potion or lotion " to " magically " rid the body of chemicals .
" You are buying into a marketing myth if you choose , say , a three - day detox kit , " says Catherine Collins , a dietician and spokesperson for the BDA .
" These detox products often take a convoluted approach to getting rid of toxins and try to blind people with science – and can be very expensive . "
Left to its own devices the skin , kidneys , liver and lymphatic system combine to make the body capable of getting rid of most toxins it takes in .
But if you want to help optimise your body 's health , there are plenty of ways to detox without stretching your purse - strings .
" Small and simple changes to your lifestyle are the obvious long - term solution – and this does n't cost a thing , " says Sian Porter , a dietician based in East Haddon , Northamptonshire .
By eating fresh fruit and vegetables and drinking six to eight glasses of tap water , you 'll give your body a boost .
" Alter the proportions of the food on your plate by piling on more fruit and vegetable , " says Collins .
To help in a quest for a balanced diet , the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) has an example " eatwell plate " that can be used as a guideline .
And avoiding sugar , caffeine , alcohol and processed foods is not only good for our body , but should help cut the cost of your supermarket shop .
Also , buying bottled water is unnecessary , according to Collins , unless you prefer the taste .
" And organic food is no different nutritionally – although people buy organic for a number of reasons . "
If your usual supermarket is one of the more expensive chains , trade down a brand .
This way , you can save all year round , and budget stores such as Lidl still have plenty of fresh produce to pick from .
" Also , a can of fruit may only cost about 35 p and that counts towards your daily fruit intake , " says Porter .
Use leftovers from the festive season to make healthy and nutritious soups , smoothies and juices .
Once you 've run out of this , you can buy frozen fruit and vegetables cheaply and make healthy smoothies for breakfast using a blender – these still contain the nutrients your body needs .
In fact , freezing can help preserve nutrients in food picked at the peak of their freshness .
Collins adds that monitoring your eating habits is an essential part of a long - term healthy detox plan .
" Check your habits and rituals for any signs of mindless eating – one way to learn to control your food intake is to set aside one day a week when you consciously eat less . "
You can take a quiz to see if you tend to eat more than you need at mindlesseating .org .
Finally , one of the best ways to re-energise and detox the body is to get exercise .
" Doing anything that gets the heart beating faster will help your body shift toxins , " says Porter .
" Ideally , you want to be breathless rather than speechless for the best effect . "
Going for a brisk walk or a run is free – and the fresh air will help clear out your system .

Burning fossil fuel accounted for 94.2 % of carbon dioxide emissions in 2006 .
Emissions are measured in teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalents : Total carbon dioxide emissions 5,983.1 Fossil fuel combustion 5,637.9 >
Electricity generation 2,328.2 > Transportation 1,856.0 > Industrial 862.2 > Residential 326.5 > Commercial 210.1 Source : Environmental Protection Agency
The latest step by the government to regulate carbon dioxide emissions saddles industry with uncertainty and potentially higher costs , industry groups said Monday after the Environmental Protection Agency declared carbon dioxide a health hazard .
The EPA 's decision paves the way for new regulations on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and factories even if Congress does n't pass legislation to do so .
EPA RULING : Regulation of greenhouse gases approved
If nothing changes , the EPA , sometime next year , could require big carbon emitters – such as power plants , steel mills , cement makers and others – to put the best available equipment on new and modified plants to curb emissions .
Industry groups say EPA regulation would eventually drive up energy costs , lead to lost jobs and delays in project permits and construction .
More immediately , " This adds more uncertainty and could impact how companies make decisions , " says Keith McCoy , vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers .
Instead of EPA regulation , industry wants Congress to pass climate change legislation to limit carbon emissions – a stance also taken by the EPA and the White House .
Such efforts are underway in the House and Senate .
That way , emission cuts could be made more strategically and " soften the impact on consumers , " says Dan Riedinger of the Edison Electric Institute , a power industry trade group .
He says energy costs will " go up more under EPA regulation . "
As a result of EPA regulation , U.S. companies could also face higher operating costs than foreign competitors , says Larry Kavanagh of the American Iron and Steel Institute .
The institute wants legislation crafted to help U.S. companies stay competitive – while still cutting emissions – via trade measures , rebates and other incentives .
Congress could override EPA 's regulations or retain them .
Either way , the " train is moving down the tracks " to regulate emissions , says David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council , an advocacy group .
He says that 's key " to rebuilding the economy along clean - energy lines . "
The EPA 's decision is expected to face legal challenges .
Shortly after the announcement , the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a public interest group , said it would file a lawsuit to overturn the EPA 's finding on the grounds that EPA ignored scientific issues around global climate modeling .
The carbon dioxide decision comes seven months after the Obama administration set national rules to improve auto fuel efficiency nearly 40 % by 2016 , which would reduce tailpipe emissions .
Given a Supreme Court ruling , the EPA 's finding on carbon dioxide is needed before it can regulate carbon dioxide emissions from autos , factories and power plants .

Along the way , about $ 1 billion in underwriting fees has been siphoned off by investment bankers , a fee bonanza for one of the best - paid professions predominantly transferred from superannuation investors .
But the widespread disaster if this cash had not been found is difficult to imagine .
Breached loan covenants .
Collapses .
More panic .
And the same pile of money points to a robust path forward for the Australian market , in sharp contrast to the parlous debt - burdened state of many corporations on the British and American markets .
Reasons for the unexpectedly upbeat position corporate Australia now finds itself in are twofold – and both are more than a little perverse .
First , Australia 's wave of 9 per cent of wages paid as superannuation cash , which continues to slosh into funds every week in fair weather or foul , helped save the captains of industry .
In effect , the workers ' paradise of compulsory superannuation built by the ACTU and the Keating Labor government provided the mother of all bail - out funds for an over - geared , over - risky corporate sector .
( The business lobby should think about that next time it makes a submission opposing an increase in workers ' wages . )
Second – and here 's the real perversity – the super - smooth investment bankers who were the handmaidens of all that corporate overreaching turned out to be pretty handy when the crunch came .
This handiness is shown in the annual East Coles Investment Banking survey of more than 100 Australian corporates on their views on their investment bankers , which the Herald publishes exclusively today .
It shows 79 per cent of companies felt their investment bankers had added value to their business in the past five years .
One respondent answered the question in the following way : “ For 4 years NO .
For last year YES . ”
In their survey responses , companies showed almost slavish gratitude to an industry that has been rightly blamed for being at the heart of the global meltdown in the first place .
In the surveys , companies rated UBS the best overall investment bank , followed by Macquarie and Goldman Sachs JBWere .
And while the capital raisings happened with a degree of bastardry towards Australia 's retail shareholders , the alternative of no capital raising at all may have been much , much worse .
“ You were in a market where you do n't know when you come in whether it 's going to be up 6 per cent or down seven , ” says Guy Fowler , investment banking co-head of UBS .
“ You can't hang around , if the company says it wants to raise a billion dollars . ”
Peter Hunt , the executive chairman of the advisory firm Caliburn , says he is not surprised investment banks proved so efficient in the capital raisings , with self - interest a primary motivator .
“ You can criticise investment banks for a whole host of reasons for what happened in the broader financial crisis , ” he says .
“ But they are full of determined , hungry , focused individuals and they are looking for positions in the markets where they can make money for their companies .
Capital raising was where they could make a lot of money for their companies . ”
Add it up .
Take an underwriting fee of a conservative 1.5 per cent on $ US61 billion and you get $ US915 million in fees .
At the top end of town there is little hiding the significance with which the banking community views the importance of the worker - inspired superannuation fund money .
Kevin Skelton , the managing director of Merrill Lynch , has little doubt Australia 's superannuation money was a shock absorber for Australia 's markets .
“ Why is it you are able to raise capital very quickly in Australia ?
It 's because – we all understand this – the superannuation and savings market in Australia is mature , it 's well established , so there is sufficient market money within funds to put to work in the equity markets , ” he says .
“ I think that was an important element for Australia in the context of the GFC .
It was absolutely an absorber of shock because unless a number of these companies [ recapitalised ] they were either going to go bankrupt or run into serious trouble . ”
UBS 's Fowler is similarly clear about where the money was coming from .
“ If you look at all of the capital raisings we have done in the past 18 months , up until six months ago the vast majority of support was from Australian institutions who still had the benefit of money flowing in from the superannuation levy , ” he said .
And the benefits have been lucrative for the investment bankers , including UBS , which has led the charge of recapitalisations .
“ This market has been the leader in terms of recapitalising its corporates , ” says Fowler .
“ Up until about June this year Australia , which normally accounts for about 4 or 5 per cent of capital raised in the world , was about 25 per cent of capital raised in the world .
So this market aggressively recapitalised itself . ”
Superannuation money being put to work to save the market does not surprise the Industry Funds Management chairman , Garry Weaven , regarded as an architect of Australia 's superannuation industry .
But he does question whether some companies should have been saved : " It 's an irony that some people who engineered the debt - funding in their balance sheets tend to be highly paid and overpaid . "
And not all were saved .
Caliburn 's
Hunt notes : “ It was a shock absorber for companies that institutions regarded as worth saving . ”
Investment bankers spoken to for this article do not take a backward step about the structure of the capital raisings or their impact on retail shareholders .
Commentators have pointed out many of the structures during the recapitalisations seriously disadvantaged retail shareholders .
Capital raisings , including the $ 2.35 billion collected by Asciano in June , have been criticised for being a transfer of wealth from retail shareholders to institutional investors .
The criticisms arise because many of the raisings were not offered to all shareholders equally , but were quarantined to large institutional shareholders at a large discount .
In the case of Asciano , shares were offered at $ 1.10 , or 40 per cent below the previous market price of $ 1.83 .
For bankers , dealing with only large shareholders has the benefit of speed – a rights offer in Europe or the US can take six to eight weeks .
The “ accelerated ” nature of the placements also allows companies to sidestep an Australian Stock Exchange rule that issuing more than 15 per cent of existing shares in a 12 - month period requires shareholder approval .
Because shares in accelerated placements are fully underwritten , they are able to be counted as existing shares , which effectively raises the 15 per cent cap necessary for shareholder approval .
Critics argue this has allowed not only dilution – when more shares are made available at the same price – but actual value transfer because the shares have been offered at a discount .
The structuring of some of the equity raisings and how this was used to benefit big shareholders also came in for attention .
UBS rejects as " unequivocally incorrect " and " malicious " suggestions its winning of the mandate to handle Asciano 's capital raising was linked to its deal to provide a loan to the debt - laden port operator 's managing director , Mark Rowsthorn .
Rowsthorn entered an arrangement with UBS in which he sold 40 million shares at $ 1.25 each and then took out a " collar " loan over his remaining 36.2 million securities .
The deal allowed Rowsthorn to buy his full allotment of 76.2 million securities under the group 's one - for - one entitlement offer priced at the lower price of $ 1.10 a security .
As the market has become saner , there are steps back to more equal treatment of all shareholders , most notably in a recent $ 375 million raising by CSR .
Investment bankers argue the structures suited the urgency of the times .
“ We found that especially when the markets were very dislocated and very volatile , being able to go to market and saying this deal is going to happen , it is going to happen at this price , it is done , is pretty valuable , ” says Fowler .
“ You know , a bit of leadership in terms of pricing .
There are other examples in other firms where you put a company into a trading halt for five days while people ran around to try to find a price .
We never had a situation like that . ”
A case example was a lengthy five - month market suspension for Transpacific Industries as it sought a complex recapitalisation .
Hunt says the practical implications of the volatility meant speed became an important factor .
“ The fact that you could do an institutional sell - down in a day as opposed to going through the lengthy normal rights offering was very important , ” he says .
“ If you think about what happened , banks pulled back .
Even when they were n't pulling back they were n't giving companies confidence they would refinance them .
That ability to tap the equity market was extraordinarily important . ”
Skelton provides a practical example , the $ 750 million recapitalisation of the mining services company Boart Longyear .
“ They were looking towards a refinancing , which was six to eight months away , " he says .
“ The banks were very nervous .
We worked with the company . . . we helped negotiate with the banks to keep them comfortable while we sorted out an equity solution .
“ We were able to raise equity for Boart Longyear in a very difficult market . . . and pay down all the debt .
“ It 's a classic situation of going from a near - death experience to being a well - capitalised company that is now set up to grow and run its business appropriately . ”
The country 's top bankers say the superannuation money has not only stabilised the market through recapitalisations this year , the continued flow will be central to their operations for the coming year .
Bankers point to Bureau of Statistics figures for superannuation fund asset allocations showing cash allocations remaining significantly higher than long - term averages .
The figures show cash allocations began to fall in the September quarter and equity allocations rose .
Just as the pension fund money was made available by fund managers to recapitalise the Australian sharemarket , there is optimism cash allocations naturally switching back to equities will provide even further liquidity .
Bankers see this as a precursor to giving companies confidence to engage in merger and acquisition activity .
Indeed , the East Coles survey showed 56 per cent of respondents said they would or would possibly raise capital again next year .
" What we 're seeing is that there 's still a significant amount of cash that is on the sidelines which would naturally be in the equities market , " says Amelia Hill , an executive director who works on UBS 's equity capital markets team .
Bankers will use the liquidity flow to encourage corporates to consider opportunities for acquisitions and to persuade privately held companies to consider an IPO .
Tony O'Sullivan , from Palladio Partners , says : " I think we 're definitely moving from a market where most of the new equity investment has been around balance sheet repair , to one where further equity issues will be around m&a [ mergers and acquisitions ] . "
The head of investment banking at RBS , Nick Rowe , the top - ranked banker in the East Coles survey , says infrastructure and power privatisations from the NSW and Queensland Governments will likely attract pension fund money .
" They are quite large pools of assets and they are very much into the long - dated pension fund liability side of things whether it be generation assets , or toll roads or ports that people actually quite like , " he says .
Hill says the market for IPOs will be tough given most opportunities for next year involve private equity exits .
" The most recent experience is institutional investor scepticism as to those opportunities . "
But Skelton takes a differing view , highlighting 20 potential IPOs identified by Merrills and anywhere between $ 7 billion and $ 15 billion in NSW and Queensland government assets possibly coming to market .
Companies widely touted to list next year include Rebel Sport ( being lead managed by Merrills ) ; Ascendia Retail ; the local arm of Bilfinger Berger and logistics business Loscam .
After a year in which business lives and reputations were firmly on the line , the symbiotic relationship between banks and corporates survived and blossomed .
The fact the risk - taking of banks in general and investment banks in particular helped get us into this fix in the first place received only muted airplay in the East Coles survey .
Respondents were asked if banks that helped during the financial crisis would be rewarded with a stronger and more enduring relationships .
One replied : " Are you kidding ?
Which ones of the Big Four assisted during the GFC ?
I must have missed that part . "
But by far the greatest sentiment was on the lines of : " Yes , absolutely .
Those that did n't support their customers will pay a hefty price when financial markets return to ' normal ' . "
Fowler reflects on the reality of the situation bankers and corporates faced .
“ This last year we have found ourselves working with management or boards who for circumstances sometimes out of their control have found themselves in very stressful situations .
So a company has breached its covenants , its share price has fallen rapidly and that 's stressful , and you have been given the challenge to find the solution , " he says .
“ That said , when you get to the other end and the clients are happy – that 's pretty rewarding for everyone . ”

As fun as it is to poke fun at Harold Ford — and there ’s plenty to poke fun at — his candidacy is seriously dangerous .
He is basically running as the candidate of the deracinated overclass , people who are n’t from anywhere but want to run things everywhere .
Over at the Daily Beast , Peter Beinart explains :
The American system has its problems , to be sure .
It encourages provincialism , a focus on the local rather than national interest .
But it also produces a certain rough - hewn populism .
Voters expect you to know and care about the places they live , even if those places are n’t glamorous or globally significant .
And they expect you to be able to relate the things you believe to the place you ’re from .
Harold Ford Jr. is taking a blowtorch to all that .
He knows nothing about New York .
What he knows about is the American overclass , a large chunk of which happens to reside in the Empire State .
His campaign is the brainchild , in large measure , of rich donors who went searching for someone to run against interim Senator Kirsten Gillibrand .
His economic agenda consists of defending Washington ’s bailout of Wall Street , proposing a large corporate tax cut , and opposing caps on executive pay .
“ I ’m a capitalist , ” Ford explained , in justifying his position on executive pay .
“ I believe that people take risk , and there are rewards if they do well ; they should lose if they do n’t . ”
This from a man reportedly earning close to $ 1 million a year from an investment bank bailed out at taxpayer expense .
Ford ’s candidacy is a dystopic vision of the political future , a future in which the American overclass dispatches its young into the provinces armed with so much money that it does n’t matter that they know nothing about the place they ’re supposed to represent .
Let ’s hope that Ford ’s candidacy fails spectacularly .
New York needs representation in the United States Senate ; the Regency Hotel does not .
Actually , you should go read the entire Beinart piece at the Daily Beast , which is quite funny .
One of the great things about Clojure is how it can make Java programming easier and less verbose .
Take Swing .
It takes a ton of code to render even a simple GUI .
Most tutorials do n’t even tackle it without an IDE like NetBeans .
But we ’ve got something Java lacks : macros !
In this post , I ’ll build a simple counter application , using Clojure macros to make the code shorter and simpler .
Our app has two components : a label showing the current value of the counter , and a button to increment the counter .
Here ’s the basic structure :
( import '( javax.swing JLabel JButton JPanel JFrame ) ) ( defn counter - app [ ] ( let [ label ( JLabel . " Counter : 0 " ) button ( JButton .
" Add 1 " ) panel ( JPanel . ) frame ( JFrame .
" Counter App " ) ] ( . setOpaque panel true ) ( .add panel label ) ( .add panel button ) ( .setContentPane frame panel ) ( .setSize frame 300 100 ) ( .setVisible frame true ) ) )
You can run counter - app at the REPL and see the resulting GUI layout , although the button does n’t do anything yet .
The annoying thing about this code is the imperative style Swing forces on us : construct local variables and hammer at them with method calls .
Fortunately , Clojure has a handy built - in macro for just this kind of situation : doto .
The doto macro takes a body of expressions .
It evaluates the first expression and saves it in a temporary variable , and then inserts that variable as the first argument in each of the following expressions .
Finally , doto returns the value of the temporary variable .
An example will make more sense :
;;
This code : ( doto ( make - thing ) ( foo 1 2 ) ( bar 3 4 ) ) ;;
Expands to this : ( let [x ( make - thing ) ] ( foo x 1 2 ) ( bar x 3 4 ) x )
The object created on the first line gets threaded through each of the following expressions and returned at the end .
We can use this to clean up our counter - app code :
( defn counter - app [ ] ( let [ label ( JLabel . " Counter : 0 " ) button ( JButton .
" Add 1 " ) panel ( doto ( JPanel . ) ( .setOpaque true ) ( .add label ) ( .add button ) ) ] ( doto ( JFrame . " Counter App " ) ( .setContentPane panel ) ( .setSize 300 100 ) ( .setVisible true ) ) ) )
Notice that we have eliminated one local variable ( frame ) entirely .
Furthermore , all the expressions dealing with the JPanel are neatly grouped together .
For this to work out neatly , the order of definitions is important .
We start at the inner-most components , JLabel and JButton , and move outward to the containing window .
Moving on !
In my last post , I showed you how to proxy ActionListener to handle events like button clicks .
Rather than typing out the proxy code each time , let ’s make a macro :
( defmacro on - action [ component event & body ] `( . ~component addActionListener ( proxy [ java.awt.event.ActionListener ] [ ] ( actionPerformed [ ~event ] ~ @body ) ) ) )
The on-action macro’s first argument is any component ( such as JButton ) that has an addActionListener method .
The body of the macro is the code that will be executed when the ActionListener is triggered .
The event argument is just a symbol ; it will be bound to the ActionEvent that triggered the listener .
( We could have used a fixed symbol like “ this ” , but that would be bad macro design . )
With this macro , the definition of our JButton can look like this :
( doto ( JButton .
" Add 1 " ) ( on-action event ; ; ... code to run when button is clicked ... ) )
We ’re almost done !
We just need a place to store the current value of the counter .
Since we ’re not worried about synchronization at this point , we can use an atom :
;; Initialize the counter ( let [ counter ( atom 0 ) ] ;; ... later on ... ;;
Update the counter : ( swap ! counter inc ) )
Bringing it all together , our final app looks like this :
( defn counter - app [ ] ( let [ counter ( atom 0 ) label ( JLabel .
" Counter : 0 " ) button ( doto ( JButton .
" Add 1 " ) ( on-action evnt ; ; evnt is not used ( .set Text label ( str " Counter : " ( swap ! counter in c ) ) ) ) ) panel ( doto ( JPanel. ) ( .setOpaque true ) ( .add label ) ( .add button ) ) ] ( doto ( JFrame . " Counter App " ) ( .setContentPane panel ) ( .setSize 300 100 ) ( .setVisible true ) ) ) )
Run counter - app at the REPL and you have a working GUI application .
Not bad for about 50 lines !

If you 're going to have to entirely ignore your kids and family when you 're working at home , you might as well head into the office .
Career columnist and Wall Street Journal writer Alexandra Levit offered up six tips for working parents to spend more time parenting .
They were aimed at anyone with a job , but freelancers certainly have an easier time of shifting their schedules back and ahead , taking web meetings instead of traveling for in - person summits , and involving their children in their work .

Why freelance on the side instead of full time ?
The taxes are a lot more simple , the income a bit more stable , and , best of all , your day - to - day job provides you with countless opportunities to meet and greet future clients and referral helpers .
That 's assuming your side gig is kosher with your boss , of course , but if you want to test the waters of selling yourself on the freelance market , do it without quitting your job .

8 . Use discounts to get paid on time
Advertisement
Becoming your own Accounts Payable department is new to most freelancers , and not very fun .
If you run into clients who are hesitant to pay on time , or leave you on the hook waiting for their next order , try offering a discount or repeat business incentives , as suggested by Web Worker Daily .
Give clients a 5 percent discount if they pay within , say , 24 or 48 hours of invoice shipment , or whatever you consider prompt — the cash value is almost certainly worth the time you 'll spend tracking it down and worrying .
If clients make you wait forever for their next order , offer a coupon or discount after receiving payment on a gig , giving them a small bit off if they place another order within a certain time frame .
It 's easy for small businesses to lose track of freelance people , but they tend to pay attention to dollars and cents .

7 . Track your work and generate invoices simultaneously

The web is full of freelancers and contractors , and many of them have created better systems for tracking time and sending bills .
There are too many free or " freemium " services to try and compile into one list , but , hey , let 's throw out a few .
MakeSomeTime is simple , CurdBee handles everything up to the Google Checkout / PayPal payment screen for clients , FreshBooks covers a lot of different aspects of billing , Toggl is a great second - by - second live tracker , and BlinkSale has been generating crisp - looking invoices for years .
Any of them are worth checking out , and probably fit the bill better than a gigundo spreadsheet .

Besides having to learn the basics of contracts and work rules , freelancers should try to grab the basics of selling and regulating resalable ( and different ) stock work , as well as know how to stand their ground on copyright , fair use , and Creative Commons .
It is , in short , not enough to simply create cool things — you have to know how to shepherd them through the cloudy worlds of commerce and the web these days .

Not every contract will rely on hourly rates , but you 'd best be prepared to offer a price if someone asks .
The general advice is to aim slightly higher than you figure you should really charge , because you will always , always aim low when you 're determining the time and administrative costs of getting the job done .

BARTOW , Fla. , Dec. 17 ( UPI ) --
A judge in Polk County , Fla. , said Thursday that DNA evidence freed a 54 - year - old man after he spent 35 years in prison for a rape he did not commit .
The St. Petersburg ( Fla . )
Times said Judge James Yancey officially freed James Bain from prison in light of the new evidence , drawing an emotional response from the man 's family members .

" I have n't seen him since he was 16 , " Bain 's brother - in - law , Jessie Atmore , said .
" It 's been a long , long time . "
" I 'm so happy , do n't know what to do , " Bain 's mother , Sarah Reed , said in a phone conversation with her daughter , Janie , the newspaper reported .
Bain was convicted at the age of 19 of raping a 9 - year - old boy in Lake Wales , Fla. , in 1974 .
The Times said after Bain 's multiple requests for DNA testing in the closed case , one of the motions was approved in July and ensuing tests showed DNA evidence did not match Bain 's DNA .

Here 's a new angle on the jobs crisis facing people with Ph.D.'s .
The economics blogger Mike Mandel was curious about the role that various credentials play in the U.S. economy .
Sorting through some statistics on college degrees , he was surprised to learn that fully 35 percent of college graduates have a degree beyond the B.A. , up from 32.7 percent in 1999 .
" That seems pretty good , does n't it ? " he writes .
" More and more of our college grads are getting advanced degrees , which is exactly what we would want to help foster innovation . "
The growth is at the masters ( and professional ) level , however : the proportion of workers with Ph.D's is on a slight downward curve , dipping under 4.5 percent in 2007 and still dropping .
That 's does n't represent an exodus , but perhaps people should flee the Ph.D. path , given another figure Mandel uncovered .
While the inflation - adusted earnings of workers with bachelor 's or masters degrees have increased very slightly since 1999 - - a rise of one percent or less -- the story was quite different for the doctorate .
Employees with Ph.D. 's can expect to earn 10 percent less , in real dollars , than they would have a decade ago .
" Yowza , " Mandel writes .
Gaming the Auction House is no doubt the most profitable way to earn gold in World of Warcraft .
Best of all , it does n't involve any grinding and does n't get as repeatitive as MMORPGs usually do in the long run .
Insteads you get the excitement of taking risks and playing with your gold like it was gambling .
Making money in the Auction House is all about your personal skills and having the right tools .
Thanks to many helpful AddOns it does n't take that much of your time .
You 'll need to do stuff on the Auction House constantly but you necessarily do n't need to spend too many hours at a time on it .
This guide teaches everything from getting started with the Auctioneer AddOn to some very advanced strategies that some people are using right now to make hundreds of gold per day .
Starting Out
1. Install Auctioneer AddOn - Must have
Auctioneer AddOn automatizes the process of finding great deals for you .
It does in few minutes what would take you hours to do manually .
This AddOn is a must for anyone planning to earn serious gold in the AH .
Auctioneer
2. Install CT Mail AddOn - Must have
CT Mail will simply make your mailbox usage quicker .
It enables you to mail up to 21 items at one click of a button and also move multiple items at once from your mailbox to your bags .
3. Create a level 1 " mule " Character
You certainly do n't want to play the Auction House with your main character .
That would be a huge waste of because you can have an alternate character live in the Auction House city insteads doing nothing but bidding , selling and carrying tons of items .
When your main character finds loot , you can mail it to your alternate character and save a slot in your bags .
4 . Get to the closest city with an Auction House
Alliance Auction Houses are at Ironforge , Stormwind and Darnassus .
Horde Auction Houses are at Undercity , Orgrimmar and Thunder Bluff .
Starting points for most races are near cities so you should n't have much trouble getting your level 1 toon to the closest city .
How It Works
5. Do A Scan
When first starting out , you should do multiple scans per day .
After a few days and 10 + scans your Auctioneer has enough information to start giving accurate price estimations .
After that you should try to do scans as often as possible .
The more you scan , the more deals you 'll find .
The important thing here is to not not rush to buying items after a couple of scans just because Auctioneer says that you will make a big profit .
Remember that Auctioneer is probably way off on its price estimations at this point .
Just open the auction window and click Scan the button :
6. Find Some Good Deals
After doing scans for a few days Auctioneer should have a good enough grasp on historical average prices for the most common items .
You can now start searching the Auction House for items with the biggest profit potential .
Use the Search Auctions tab :
Auctioneer search options :
At first you should concentrate on finding items with a small absolute profit ( Minimum Profit ) but a high relative profit ( Minimum Percent Less ) .
This enables you to quickly earn some gold that you can spend on higher profit auctions .
Always search for Buyouts first , then for Bids .
This is because your gold gets ' locked ' in the auction for a while when you bid and that gold is out of your budget for making instant profit with Buyout auctions .
Always set Maximum Time Left to Short or Medium when searching for Bids ( not Buyouts ) .
Otherwise you 'll end up bidding on auctions with as much time as 24 hour left .
Search for high Minimum Percent Less first .
This is pretty obvious .
You want to make maximum profit so always prefer to put your money on as high margin auctions as possible .
For example you could search for 90 % Minimum Percent Less and move on to 80 % , 50 % , etc until you 've spent all of your current cash .
Grow the Minimum Profit by time while you get richer .
First you have to set the Minimum Profit to something like 50 silver because those are the only items you can afford .
Then you should grow that over time to 1 gold , 2 gold , 5 gold and so forth as you get a bigger budget .
7 . Pick up and relist the items
When you are just starting out you might want to relist your items immediately after buying them to grow your gold reserves as quickly as possible .
Later when you deal with tons of items it might be wiser to empty your mailbox only once per day .
This enables you to better stay on track with all the items you 're dealing with .
8. Stay on the city and do scans as often as you can
Auctioneer bases it 's estimations on historical information from your past scans so the accuracy of price estimation for an item completely depends on how many times the item has been up for bidding in the Auction House when ever you have scanned .
This means that more you scan , the more deals you 'll find and the more money you 'll make .
It 's as simple as that .
Remember that you can do what ever you want while scanning .
Take a shower , eat , exercise or alt +tab to your desktop and surf the web .
Advanced Strategies
1. Beginner strategies
When you 're just starting out it 's naturally better to concentrate on low level items and keep your profit per item low .
World of Warcraft charges higher listing fees for items that high level / rare items and you definedly do n't want to put your too much gold to put on listing fees at this point .
It 's a good idea to put additional weight on buying enchants because those items have no listing fees at all .
2 . When to scan and bid ?
Scan as often as possible .
You can run the scan while doing daily tasks elsewhere .
Remember that every scan is an opportunity to find great deals before someone else does .
The most important time to scan at is late Sunday or Monday morning when people are selling the loot they found during weekend .
Also scan on late Tuesdays before the server goes down for maintenance .
3. Timing and pricing right
Try to sell your stuff on Sundays .
That 's when people have the most time to play so it 's natural that people do msot of their shopping on Sundays too .
Always use 24 hour auctions .
This is how you get the most bang for your buck .
24 hour auctions give you the biggest visibility and the listing fee is n't that much higher .
Always set a buyout price .
There is just no reason to sell without a buyout price .
Gamers expect things to happen instantly and winning an auction is no exception .
Use a low minimum bid even when your buyout price is higher than your competitor's .
This is because the Auction Window is sorted by minimum bid price , not by buyout price and this way you can get to the top .
Use the 9.99 pricing format over an exact 10.00 .
There is a reason why real world stores do so and you should use it too .
This type of pricing makes your auction look cheaper and it also signals that you carefully set a competitive price instead of just throwing an overpriced ballpark figure out there .
4 . Be careful with uncommon items
Auctioneer often gets it 's price estimations horribly wrong with less common items .
A major reason for this is that there are people who constantly overprice their auctions either by accident or purposely .
For less common items this may have a really heave effect on price estimations .
You should n't blindly trust Auctioneer on what ever it says or you 'll end up paying expensive listing fees for items that never sell for the price Auctioneer thinks they do .
Be especially careful with high level blue and epic items have very expensive listing fees .
5 . Watch the trade channels
You should keep an eye on the trade channels for people trying to sell items you 're familiar with .
Make them an offer that 's something like 50 % of the going price and if you 're lucky you might do a nice profit .
You can also go to buy stuff ' straight from the source ' on the zone where you know something is being farmed / gathered and then mail it to the AH to be sold for profit .
6. Monopolize niche markets
Trying to monopolize a market in the Auction House is maybe the most exciting and most risky business move you can make in WoW .
When doing this you should first identify a group of items that there is a constant demand but limited supply for .
Then you decide on a price point to list your items for and commit to buy all competing auctions below that price point out of the market .
Lastly you can relist your competitors ' items at your own price and if everything goes well you 'll own the market and sell at your own price .
Doing this requires some effort but once you learn to do it right , it can be very profitable .
7. Limit your spendings
Once you start getting richer you need to start putting gold in reserve insteads of spending it on low profit auctions .
This is very important because otherwise you could lose a huge deal just because you just spent all your gold on something that makes only a 10 % profit .
Researchers have for the first time found a connection between exposure to certain chemicals and insulin resistance , according to a study published in the online edition of Environmental Health Perspectives .
A group of European scientists examined whether exposure to persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) contributed to insulin resistance , which has been increasing around the world .
More than 25 percent of U.S. adults suffer from metabolic conditions stemming from insulin resistance that include fatigue , obesity and difficulty regulating blood levels of fat and sugar .
Researchers fed rats a high - fat diet of either crude or refined fish oil from farmed Atlantic salmon over 28 days .
The crude fish oil contained average levels of POPs that people are exposed to through fish consumption , while the refined oil contained none .
Both had equal fat levels .
They found that rats exposed to the crude fish oil developed belly fat and could not regulate fat properly .
They had higher levels of cholesterol and several fatty acids in their livers .
Those exposed to the refined fish oil experienced none of those symptoms .
Researchers said the findings provide " compelling evidence " of a causal relationship between POP exposure common in the food chain and insulin resistance , and highlight the need to understand the interactions of POPs and fat - containing foods such as fish , dairy products and meat .
How to deal with POPs is particularly challenging because they persist in the environment for long periods and can build up in animals ' tissues .
The 2001 Stockholm Convention , which the United States has ratified but not signed , lists and bans numerous POPs from manufacture and use .
The researchers say their evidence reinforces the need to have international agreements aimed at limiting the release of POPs into the environment in an effort to protect public health .

OKLAHOMA CITY , Dec. 19 ( UPI ) --
An Oklahoma judge has ruled to keep retain a restraining order on a state law that would require doctors to publicly reveal information on abortion patients .
Abortion - rights attorneys had asked Oklahoma County District Judge Daniel Owens to block the law from taking effect , and on Friday he moved to put a hold on the measure until a Feb. 19 hearing , CNN reported .

The U.S. broadcaster said the law demands doctors fill out a 10 - page questionnaire for every abortion performed , in which the physician is to collect information from patients about age , marital status , race and years of education .
The Oklahoma Department of Health would set up a Web site up by March to publish results of the completed questionnaires .
" Nosy neighbors with some effort could identify or , even worse , misidentify these women who answer these questions , " former state Rep. Wanda Jo Stapleton told CNN .
" There are details in those questions about rape , incest , abuse , relationship problems and emotional health .
I think women can be identified . "
" We 're not trying to embarrass anybody , hurt anybody or make anybody 's identities known .
That 's not the purpose of the legislation , " said the bill 's author , Republican State Sen .

The FIFA logo .
FIFA , the world governing body for association football , yesterday announced it was setting up a working group to conduct an inquiry into the introduction of assistant referees and technology into the world game , in the wake of the reactions to the controversial handball committed by French captain Thierry Henry during the 18 November France vs Republic of Ireland qualifying play - off game for the 2010 World Cup .
Yesterday , at the request of FIFA President Sepp Blatter , FIFA held an emergency meeting of its 24 member Executive Committee in Cape Town , to look into various issues which had recently affected the world game , including the Henry handball .
After the meeting , FIFA announced it will set up an inquiry to investigate the introduction of goal line technology and the global experimentation of using additional referee 's assistants to officiate during a match , already being trialled in Europe .
FIFA did not however take the widely expected action of announcing there would be extra assistants in place for the upcoming 2010 World Cup , stating this was " too soon " to be made possible .
Blatter also re-iterated his long - standing opposition to the adoption of video refereeing used in many other sports .
Blatter confirmed yesterday that Thierry Henry would be investigated by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee .
Blatter also apologised to the FAI for his handling of their request to become the 33rd team at the 2010 World Cup .
Henry handball incident
There was a worldwide reaction after the Henry handball incident , which was missed by the referee Martin Hansson , with FIFA coming under pressure to make changes to avoid such a recurrence .
Henry 's illegal handball had led to the decisive goal being scored in the game by William Gallas , which saw France qualify for the World Cup ahead of the Republic of Ireland .
The Irish football federation ( " FAI " ) first called on FIFA and the French for a replay , but this was rejected by FIFA .
They later requested to be allowed to be given an extra place at the World Cup .
Yesterday , Blatter appealed to all players and officials that would be appearing in the upcoming 2010 World Cup to observe the principles of fair play .
Henry had been criticised for admitting the handball after the game , but not informing the referee at the time .
Refereeing working group

( Image missing from Commons : image ; Sepp Blatter in 2007
Blatter said of the crisis in refereeing in the world game that :
The committee was of the opinion that we are at a crossroads : where shall we go with refereeing in the future ?
The game at the highest level is so tense that it is impossible for one referee and his assistants to see everything ... The executive committee came to the decision that the referee is not any longer consistent with the quality and the speed of the game , and the interest of television and 32 cameras as we will have in the World Cup
To address these issues , FIFA announced they were going to set up a committee of inquiry to " look at technology or additional persons " .
Blatter confirmed the inquiry would involve a cross section of FIFA personnel , involving the referee , football , technical and medical committees .
On the subject of assistant referees , FIFA said :
... the Executive Committee expressed its support for the current experiment of including two additional referees behind the goal lines .
However , the committee stressed that it would be too soon to implement this new system at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa
Blatter said FIFA was not ignoring the ongoing trials of extra assistant referees , which would continue in the Europa League into the 2010 knock - out stages , but the executive was of the opinion that with these trials only occurring on one continent , any experiment should " be carried out globally " before being adopted in a World Cup , and that the six months remaining until the 2010 World Cup starts was too short a time to prove any such system .
The 2010 tournament , to be held in June and July , would instead remain with the normal FIFA appointed officiating team consisting of four officials led by the match referee .
On the issue of what types of technology might be investigated , Blatter confirmed that two companies looking at goal - line technology were due to report to the rule - making International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) in March .
According to AFP , the meeting also ' ruled out ' the adoption of the type of video refereeing as used in rugby , cricket and tennis . ' , while Blatter stated such a system would ' damage the flow ' of the game and " take away talking points " .
Investigation of Henry
Thierry Henry in 2008 , in his club colours of FC Barcelona of Spain
FIFA confirmed the FIFA Disciplinary Committee would " examine the case of Thierry Henry related to the play - off match " .
Blatter said :
I have not said that Thierry Henry will be punished , I have said that Thierry Henry will be examined by the disciplinary committee of FIFA " , but he added " it was a blatant unfair playing and was shown all around the world , but I do n't know what the outcome will be , let them make the decision .
Fair play must be maintained in our game
No timetable was given for when the Disciplinary Committee , headed by Swiss lawyer Marcel Mathier , might make their decision on Henry .
According to the Associated Press , the committee has the ' authority to impose a one - match suspension on Henry , which would take effect at the start of the World Cup in June . '
According to the BBC , there was no certainty that Henry would even be banned if found guilty .
Apology to the FAI
After FIFA rejected an Irish request for a replay of the game , the FAI had asked Sepp Blatter to privately raise the issue at the FIFA meeting of whether the Irish could be entered into the 2010 World Cup as a 33rd team .
According to the BBC , the FAI ' knew all along that there was very little chance of their request being granted but had decided to make it anyway on principle ' .
The FAI withdrew it before the meeting , after Blatter made their request public during his opening address of the Soccerex conference in Johannesburg on 29 November .
Blatter yesterday apologised to the FAI for how he had handled their request , saying :
In this connection I would like to express my regrets - my regrets to a wrong interpretation of what I have said in the Soccerex .
I have only announced they have asked it , but the presence in the Soccerex they do n't took it very , I would say , seriously .
So I regret what I have created and especially towards the Irish Football Association , I am sorry about these headlines going around the world .
Contrary I have nothing against the Irish , they were very sporting people when they came to FIFA and it is a pity that it has been now communicated in this way .
Sorry again . "

ISLAMABAD : Pakistan , which is experiencing " Mumbai - like attacks almost every other day " , cannot guarantee there will not be a repeat of the 26/11 strikes in India , Premier Yousuf Raza Gilani has told the US .
( Watch Video )
" Pakistan is itself facing Mumbai - like attacks almost every other day and when we cannot protect our own citizens , how can we guarantee that there would n't be any more terrorist hits in India , " Gilani was quoted by a source in the media here as having told visiting US secretary of defence Robert Gates on Thursday .
Gilani said the best safeguard against such incidents is delinking the bilateral peace process from action against terrorism .
The Dawn newspaper reported that the Pakistan prime minister told Gates about steps taken against militant groups , saying they had been outlawed and their network disrupted .
In an apparent reference to Jamaat - ud - Dawah chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed , accused by India of masterminding the Mumbai attacks , Gilani said his government could not prosecute anyone without evidence .
He also sought " even-handedness " by the US in its dealings with Pakistan and India , the daily reported .
An official statement issued by the prime minister 's office said Pakistan - India relations had figured in Gilani 's discussions with Gates but did not say whether the premier had said Islamabad could not guarantee there would not be more Mumbai - like attacks .
The statement quoted Gilani as saying that " Pakistan is committed to peace in the region and , in this context , his government is making sincere efforts to resume the composite dialogue process with India . "
While in India , Gates had warned that Pakistan - based militants with links to al - Qaida were planning strikes in India with the hope that retaliation would lead to a new conflict between the two countries .
Gates also said that New Delhi might not show restraint as it had after the Mumbai attacks in 2008 .
According to the official statement , Gilani " regretted that the response from ( India ) has not been encouraging . "
" The relations between India and Pakistan should not become hostage to the activities of terrorists which ( are ) the common enemy .
For lasting peace in the region , both countries should resolve the core issues , including Kashmir and water dispute , " he said .
India put the composite dialogue with Pakistan on hold in the wake of the Mumbai attacks .
It has linked the resumption of the peace process to Pakistan taking action against the perpetrators of the terrorist assault .
Though JuD chief Saeed was placed under house arrest shortly after the Mumbai attacks in 2008 , he was freed on the orders of the Lahore High Court last year .
The government is yet to challenge his release in the supreme court despite a pledge to do so .
Contrary to Gilani 's statements during his meeting with Gates , the Pakistan government has not issued any formal notification banning the JuD , which has been declared a front for the outlawed LeT by the UN Security Council .
Pete Carroll has turned in his resignation to USC , the Los Angeles Daily News reported , apparently clearing the way for him to be named the new head coach of the Seattle Seahawks .

But in my testing , even Google ’s bundled toolbar installations provides some modicum of notice before installing .
And users who want to disable such transmissions can always turn them off – or so I thought until I recently retested .
In this article , I provide evidence calling into question the ability of users to disable Google Toolbar transmissions .
I begin by reviewing the contents of Google ’s " Enhanced Features " transmissions .
I then offer screenshot and video proof showing that even when users specifically instruct that the Google Toolbar be “ disable[d ] ” , and even when the Google Toolbar seems to be disabled ( e.g. , because it disappears from view ) , Google Toolbar continues tracking users ’ browsing .
I then revisit how Google Toolbar ’s Enhanced Features get turned on in the first place – noting the striking ease of activating Enhanced Features , and the remarkable absence of a button or option to disable Enhanced Features once they are turned on .
I criticize the fact that Google ’s disclosures have worsened over time , and I conclude by identifying changes necessary to fulfill users ’ expectations and protect users ’ privacy .
" Enhanced Features " Transmissions Track Page - Views and Search Terms
Certain Google Toolbar features require transmitting to Google servers the full URLs users browse .
For example , to tell users the PageRank of the pages they browse , the Google Toolbar must send Google servers the URL of each such page .
Google Toolbar ’s “ Related Sites ” and “ Sidewiki ” ( user comments ) features also require similar transmissions .
With a network monitor , I confirmed that these transmissions include the full URLs users visit – including domain names , directories , filenames , URL parameters , and search terms .
For example , I observed the transmission below when I searched Yahoo ( green highlighting ) for " laptops " ( yellow ) .
GET / search?client=navclient-auto&swwk=358&iqrn=zuk&orig=0gs08&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&querytime=kV&querytimec=kV &features=Rank:SW:&q=info:http%3a%2f%2frds.yahoo.com%2f_ylt%3dA0oGkl32p1tLT2EB8ohXNyoA%2fSIG%3d18045klhr%2f

Screenshots – Google Toolbar Continues Tracking Browsing Even When Users " Disable " the Toolbar via Its " X " Button
Consistent with modern browser plug - in standards , the current Google Toolbar features an “ X ” button to disable the toolbar :
I clicked the “ X ” and received a confirmation window :
I chose the top option and pressed OK .
The Google Toolbar disappeared from view , indicating that it was disabled for this window , just as I had requested .
Within the same window , I requested the Whitehouse.gov site :
Although I had asked that the Google Toolbar be " disable [d ] … for this window " and although the Google Toolbar disappeared from view , my network monitor revealed that Google Toolbar continued to transmit my browsing to its toolbarqueries .
google.com server :
See also a screen - capture video memorializing these transmissions .
These Nonconsensual Transmissions Affect Important , Routine Scenarios ( added 1/26/10 , 12:15 pm )
In a statement to Search Engine Land , Google argued that the problems I reported are " only an issue until a user restarts the browser . "
I emphatically disagree .
Consider the nonconsensual transmission detailed in the preceding section : A user presses " x " , is asked " When do you want to disable Google Toolbar and its features ? " , and chooses the default option , to " Disable Google Toolbar only for this window . "
The entire purpose of this option is to take effect immediately .
Indeed , it would be nonsense for this option to take effect only upon a browser restart :
Once the user restarts the browser , the " for this window " disabling is supposed to end , and transmissions are supposed to resume .
So Google Toolbar transmits web browsing before the restart , and after the restart too .
I stand by my conclusion : The " Disable Google Toolbar only for this window " option does n’t work at all :
It does not actually disable Google Toolbar for the specified window , not immediately and not upon a restart .
Crucially , these nonconsensual transmissions target users who are specifically concerned about privacy .
A user who requests that Google Toolbar be disabled for the current window is exactly seeking to do something sensitive , confidential , or embarrassing , or in any event something he does not wish to record in Google ’s logs .
This privacy - conscious user deserves extra privacy protection .
Yet Google nonetheless records his browsing .
Google fails this user — specifically and unambiguously promising to immediately stop tracking when the user so instructs , but in fact continuing tracking unabated .
Google Toolbar Continues Tracking Browsing Even When Users " Disable " the Toolbar via " Manage Add - Ons "
Internet Explorer 8 includes a Manage Add - Ons screen to disable unwanted add - ons .
On a PC with Google Toolbar , I activated Manage Add - Ons , clicked the Google Toolbar entry , and chose Disable .
I accepted all defaults and closed the dialog box .
Again I requested the whitehouse.gov site .
Again my network monitor revealed that Google Toolbar continued to transmit my browsing to its toolbarqueries .
google.com server .
Indeed , as I requested various pages on the whitehouse.gov site , Google Toolbar transmitted the full URLs of those pages , as shown in the second and third circles below .
See also a screen - capture video memorializing these transmissions .
In a further test , performed January 23 , I reconfirmed the observations detailed here .
In that test , I demonstrated that even checking the " Google Toolbar Notifier BHO " box and disabling that component does not impede these Google Toolbar transmissions .
I also specififically confirmed that these continuing Google Toolbar transmissions track users ’ searches at competing search engines .
See screen - capture video .
In my tests , in this Manage Add - Ons scenario , Google Toolbar transmissions cease upon the next browser restart .
But no on - screen message alerts the user to the need for a browser - restart for changes to take effect , so the user has no reason to think a restart is required .
Google Toolbar Continues Tracking Browsing When Users " Disable " the Toolbar via Right Click ( added 1/26/10 11:00 pm )
Danny Sullivan asked me whether Google Toolbar continues Enhanced Features transmissions if users hide Google Toolbar via IE ’s right - click menu .
In a further test , I confirmed that Google Toolbar transmissions continue in these circumstances .
Below are the four key screenshots : 1 ) I right - click in empty toolbar space , and I uncheck Google Toolbar .
2 ) I check the final checkbox and choose Disable .
3 ) Google Toolbar disappears from view and appears to be disabled .
I browse the web .
4 ) I confirm that Google Toolbar ’s transmissions nonetheless continue .

Users May Easily or Accidentally Activate “ Enhanced Features ” Transmissions
Google Toolbar invites users to activate Enhanced Features with a single click , the default .
Also , notice self - contradictory statements ( transmitting ‘ site ’ names versus full ‘ URL ’ adresses ) .
The above - described transmissions occur only if a user runs Google Toolbar in its “ Enhanced Features ” mode .
But it is strikingly easy for a user to stumble into this mode .
For one , the standard Google Toolbar installation encourages users to activate Enhanced Features via a “ bubble ” message shown at the conclusion of installation .
See the screenshot at right .
This bubble presents a forceful request for users to activate Sidewiki :
The feature is described as “ enhanced ” and “ helpful ” , and Google chooses to tout it with a prominence that indicates Google views the feature as important .
Moreover , the accept button features bold type plus a jumbo size ( more than twice as large as the button to decline ) .
And the accept button has the focus – so merely pressing Space or Enter ( easy to do accidentally ) serves to activate Enhanced Features without any further confirmation .
I credit that the bubble mentions the important privacy consequence of enabling Enhanced Features : “ For enhanced features to work , Toolbar has to tell us what site you ’re visiting by sending Google the URL . ”
But this disclosure falls importantly short .
For one , Enhanced Features transmits not just “ sites ” but specific full URLs , including directories , filenames , URL parameters , and search keywords .
Indeed , Google ’s bubble statement is internally - inconsistent – indicating transmissions of “ sites ” and “ URLs ” as if those are the same thing , when in fact the latter is far more intrusive than the former , and the latter is accurate .
The bubble also falls short in its presentation of Google Toolbar ’s Privacy Policy .
If a user clicks the Privacy Policy hyperlink , the user receives the image shown in the left image below .
Notice that the Privacy Policy loads in an unusual window with no browser chrome – no Edit - Find option to let a user search for words of particular interest , no Edit - Select All and Edit - Copy option to let a user copy text to another program for further review , no Save or Print options to let a user preserve the file .
Had Google used a standard browser window , all these features would have been available , but by designing this nonstandard window , Google creates all these limitations .
The substance of the document is also inapt .
For one , “ Enhanced Toolbar Features ” receive no mention whatsoever until the fifth on - screen page ( right image below ) .
Even there , the first bullet describes transmission of “ the addresses [ of ] the sites ” users visit – again falsely indicating transmission of mere domain names , not full URLs .
The second bullet mentions transmission of “ URL[s ] ” but says such transmission occurs “ [ w ] hen you use Sidewiki to write , edit , or rate an entry . ”
Taken together , these two bullets falsely indicate that URLs are transmitted only when users interact with Sidewiki , and that only sites are transmitted otherwise , when in fact URLs are transmitted whenever Enhanced Features are turned on .
Clicking the ‘ Privacy Policy ’ link yields this display .
Note the lack of browser chrome — no options to search text , copy to the clipboard , save , or print .
Note also the absence of any on - screen mention of the special privacy concerns presented by Enhanced Features .
The first discussion of Enhanced Features appears five pages down .
Furthermore , the text falsely indicates that ordinary transmission covers mere domain names , not full URLs .
The text says " URL[s ] " are transmitted " when you use Sidewiki " and indicates that URLs are not transmitted otherwise .
Certain bundled installations make it even easier for users to get Google Toolbar unrequested , and to end up with Enhanced Features too .
With dozens of Google Toolbar partners , using varying installation tactics , a full review of their practices is beyond the scope of this article .
But they provide significant additional cause for concern .
Enhanced Features : Easy to Enable , Hard to Turn Off
The preceding sections shows that users can enable Google Toolbar ’s Enhanced Features with a single click on a prominent , oversized button .
But disabling Enhanced Features is much harder .
Consider a user who changes her mind about Enhanced Features but wishes to keep Google Toolbar in its basic mode .
How exactly can she do so ?
Browsing the Google Toolbar ’s entire Options screen , I found no option to disable Enhanced Features .
Indeed , Enhanced Features are easily enabled with a single click , during installation ( as shown above ) or thereafter .
But disabling Enhanced Features seems to require uninstalling Google Toolbar altogether , and in any event disabling Enhanced Features certainly lacks any comparably - quick command .
I ’m reminded of The Eagles ’ Hotel California : " you can check out anytime you like , but you can never leave . "
And of course , as discussed above , a user who chooses the X button or Manage Add - Ons , will naturally believe the Google Toolbar is disabled , when in fact it continues transmissions unabated .
Google Toolbar Disclosures Have Worsened Over Time
Google Toolbar ’s historic installer provided superior notice
I first wrote about Google Toolbar ’s installation and privacy disclosures in my March 2004 FTC comments on spyware and adware .
In that document , I praised Google ’s then - current toolbar installation sequence , which featured the impressive screen shown at right .
I praised this screen with the following discussion :
I consider this disclosure particularly laudable because it features the following characteristics :
It discusses privacy concerns on a screen dedicated to this topic , separate from unrelated information and separate from information that may be of lesser concern to users .
It uses color and layout to signal the importance of the information presented .
It uses plain language , simple sentences , and brief paragraphs .
It offers the user an opportunity to opt out of the transmission of sensitive information , without losing any more functionality than necessary ( given design constraints ) , and without suffering penalties of any kind ( e.g. forfeiture of use of some unrelated software ) .
As a result of these characteristics , users viewing this screen have the opportunity to make a meaningful , informed choice as to whether or not to enable the Enhanced Features of the Google Toolbar .
I stand by that praise .
But six years later , Google Toolbar ’s installation sequence is inferior in every way :
Now , initial Enhanced Features privacy disclosures appear not in their own screen , but in a bubble pitching another feature ( Sidewiki ) .
Previously , format ( all - caps , top - of - page ) , color ( red ) and language ( " … not the usual yada yada " ) alerted users to the seriousness of the decision at hand .
Now , Google presents Enhanced Features as a default with an oversized button , bold type , and acceptance via a single keystroke .
Previously , neither option was a default , and both options were presented with equal prominence .
Now , privacy statements are imprecise and internally - inconsistent , muddling the concepts of site and URL .
Previous disclosures were clear in explaining that acceptance entails " sending us [ Google ] the URL " of each page a user visits .
The current feature name , " Enhanced Features , " is less forthright than the prior " Advanced Features " label .
The name " Advanced Features " appropriately indicated that the feature is not appropriate for all users ( but is intended for , e.g. , " advanced " users ) .
In contrast , the current " Enhanced Features " name suggests that the feature is an " enhancement " suitable for everyone .
Google ’s Undisclosed Taskbar Button
Google ’s installer added this ‘ Google ’ button to my Taskbar without notice or consent .
The Google Toolbar also added a “ Google ” button to my Taskbar , immediately adjacent to the Start button .
The Toolbar installer added this button without any disclosure whatsoever in the installation sequence – not on the toolbar .
google.com web page , not in the installer EXE , not anywhere else .
An in - Taskbar button is not consistent with ordinary functions users reasonably expect when they seek and install a “ toolbar . ”
Because this function arrives on a user ’s computer without notice and without consent , it is an improper intrusion .
What Google Should Do
Google ’s first step is simple : Fix the Toolbar so that X and Manage Add - Ons in fact do what they promise .
When a user disables Google Toolbar , all Enhanced Features transmissions need to stop , immediately and without exception .
This change must be deployed to all Google Toolbar users straightaway .
Google also needs to clean up the results of its nonconsensual data collection .
In particular , Google has collected browsing data from users who specifically declined to allow such data to be collected .
In some instances this data may be private , sensitive , or embarrassing : Savvy users would naturally choose to disable Google Toolbar before their most sensitive searches .
Google ordinarily does n’t let users delete their records as stored on Google servers .
But these records never should have been sent to Google in the first place .
So Google should find a way to let concerned users request that Google fully and irreversibly delete their entire Toolbar histories .
Even when Google fixes these nonconsensual transmissions , larger problems remain .
The current Toolbar installation sequence suffers inconsistent statements of privacy consequences , with poor presentation of the full Toolbar Privacy Statement .
Toolbar adds a button to users ’ Taskbar unrequested .
And as my videos show , once Google puts its code on a user ’s computer , there ’s nothing to stop Google from tracking users even after users specifically decline .
I ’ve run Google Toolbar for nearly a decade , but this week I uninstalled Google Toolbar from all my PCs .
I encourage others to do the same .

Cass Sunstein , president Obama ’s appointee to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs , and the man who outlined a plan for the government to infiltrate “ conspiracy groups ” in order to undermine them , is in direct line for a promotion to Supreme Court Justice .
Sunstein , already in an advanced position of power in the White House as Regulatory czar , has already called for strict restrictions on gun ownership , an internet “ Fairness Doctrine ” , and an effective ban on free speech where dissenting opinions to those of the government are expressed .
Suntein ’s name was on various shortlists to replace Justice David Souter last year following his retirement , and prior to the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor .
Sunstein ’s name was also touted for the Supreme Court before Obama even took office in November 2008 .
His close personal relationship with Obama should set alarm bells ringing for anyone who values the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , particularly as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , now aged 75 , is likely to take retirement soon following illness , and with Justice John Paul Stevens now aged 90 .
Sunstein and Obama go way back from their faculty days at the University of Chicago law school and are firm friends .
Sunstein worked as an advisor to Obama during his presidential campaign and was drafted into the White House soon after Obama won the election .
As Obama ’s “ Information Czar ” , Sunstein effectively interprets the law for the Executive .
Sunstein operates in a similar , but much more elevated , role to that of former Justice Department lawyer John Yoo , who infamously re-interpreted the law to legally sanction torture under the Bush Administration .
As we highlighted in our article yesterday , Sunstein has outlined plans for the government to infiltrate “ conspiracy groups ” , including the 9/11 Truth Movement , in order to undermine them via postings on chat rooms and social networks , as well as real meetings .
Sunstein has effectively penned the blueprint for a Cointelpro “ provocateur ” style program to silence what have become the government ’s most vociferous and influential critics .
The specifics of the plans must be read in full in order to gauge their extreme nature and the threat Sunstein poses to the freedom in America .
On page 14 of Sunstein ’s January 2008 white paper entitled “ Conspiracy Theories , ” he proposed that “ under imaginable conditions ” the government “ might ban conspiracy theorizing ” and could “ impose some kind of tax , financial or otherwise , on those who disseminate such theories . ”
[ efoods ]
In effect , Obama ’s information czar wants to tax or ban outright , as in make illegal , opinions and ideas that the government does n’t approve of .
Sunstein ’s definition of a “ conspiracy theorist ” encompasses those who question manmade global warming and , most bizarrely , anyone who believes that sunlight is healthy for their bodies .
Presumably if Sunstein had been in power in the latter middle ages he would have attempted to tax and then ban the work of Galileo Galilei for subscribing to the theory that the Earth was not the centre of the universe and that it actually revolved around the Sun .
When he ’s not going after those evil sunlight lovers , Sunstein advocates Internet censorship via enforced and regulated links in news pieces to opposing opinions .
Sunstein himself later retracted that proposal , explaining that it would be “ too difficult to regulate [ the Internet ] in a way that would respond to those concerns ” , and admitting that it was “ almost certainly unconstitutional . ”
Sunstein has also called for the re-writing of the First Amendment , and has even proposed a mandatory celebration of tax day in America .
His views on the Second Amendment have also raised serious concerns .
In his book “ Radicals in Robes , ” he wrote : “ [ A ] lmost all gun control legislation is constitutionally fine . ”
Sunstein is on record attacking the Second Amendment .
Watch in the following clip as he says “ The Supreme Court has never suggested that the Second Amendment protects the individual right to have guns . ”
Given his extreme actions and stated intentions , Cass Sunstein should be forced out of office and barred from practicing law with immediate effect .
If president Obama has his way , however , we may very soon see his good buddy Sunstein elevated to the highest judicial position in the country .
Watch Alex Jones and Prisonplanet.com editor Paul Joseph Watson break down the threat posed by Obama ’s possible next Supreme Court nominee :

With the rumors swirling that Michelle Obama is a big fan of former FDA Commissioner David Kessler ’s new book The End of Overeating , it seems reasonable to check in on the science behind an “ addiction model ” for salty , sweet , and fatty processed food ( an assertion at the core of the book ) .
As it happens , a group of researchers from the independent , not - for - profit Scripps Research Institute has just released a new peer - reviewed study on the subject .
The conclusion : the brain responds to junk food the same way it does to heroin :
Junk food elicits addictive behavior in rats similar to the behaviors of rats addicted to heroin , a new study finds .
Pleasure centers in the brains of rats addicted to high - fat , high - calorie diets became less responsive as the binging wore on , making the rats consume more and more food .
The results , presented October 20 at the Society for Neuroscience ’s annual meeting , may help explain the changes in the brain that lead people to overeat .
“ This is the most complete evidence to date that suggests obesity and drug addiction have common neurobiological underpinnings , ” says study coauthor Paul Johnson of the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter , Fla .
Johnson offered one group of rats a broad range of processed food , from bacon and cheesecake to Ho Hos while another received a “ high - nutrient , low - calorie chow . ”
There was an immediate difference :
Rats that ate the junk food soon developed compulsive eating habits and became obese .
“ They ’re taking in twice the amount of calories as the control rats , ” says Johnson ’s coauthor Paul Kenny , also of Scripps .
The researchers also tested the responsiveness of the animals ’ pleasure centers :
After just five days on the junk food diet , rats showed “ profound reductions ” in the sensitivity of their brains ’ pleasure centers , suggesting that the animals quickly became habituated to the food .
As a result , the rats ate more food to get the same amount of pleasure .
Just as heroin addicts require more and more of the drug to feel good , rats needed more and more of the junk food .
“ They lose control , ” Kenny says .
“ This is the hallmark of addiction . ”
And here ’s where things get ugly .
The rats wanted their junk food fix so badly , they were willing to tolerate electric shocks if that ’s what it meant to keep eating the stuff .
To see how strong the drive to eat junk food was , the researchers exposed the rats to a foot shock when they ate the high - fat food .
Rats that had not been constantly exposed to the junk food quickly stopped eating .
But the foot shock did n’t faze rats accustomed to the junk food — they continued to eat , even though they knew the shock was coming .
“ What we have are these core features of addiction , and these animals are hitting each one of these features , ” Kenny says .
Because a study like this is n’t complete without a sinister postscript , I give you this :
Scientists are interested in determining the long - term effect of altering the reward system .
“ We might not see it when we look at the animal , ” says obesity expert Ralph DiLeone of Yale University School of Medicine .
“ They might be a normal weight , but how they respond to food in the future may be permanently altered . ”
Eating junk food for a while could leave your brain ’s response to food “ permanently altered ” ?
How .
Nice .
Kinda puts industry calls for preserving consumer “ choice ” regarding the foods we eat into perspective , does n’t it ?
When it ’s an addiction , choice is the last thing we have .
Besides giving ammunition to those wanting to restrict access to these foods for children ( well , for anyone really ) , this study certainly ensures that I will never look at a Ho Ho the same way again .

Well , it ’s super official now that we are never gonna see this stuff on YouTube .
Maybe someone could just put together a bunch of stills of Chauncey , the lawyer guys and etc. , to the tune of “ I Was Married ” and throw it up on YouTube so that if I google “ Shane & Carmen ” “ Prop 8 Trial ” I ’ll end up stuck in someone ’s masturbatory opus to an event I was hoping to see ACTED OUT not IN PICTURES that ’s why I am on YouTube duh .
Oh where was I , YES THE TRIAL !
Firstly , Dustin Lance Black , who wrote that movie MILK , has some feelings at the Huffington Post , where he says that We Cannot Wait .
Also per ushe , big up to Prop 8 Trial Tracker , who are keeping track of this shit so we can keep track of this shit .
And also to bobster1985 from flickr , ’ cause sometimes we steal queer vintage photos from his incredible , incredible , super - fantastic collection .
Last Time on “ Judgment Daze ” : On January 12th , the h8ers got demolished by Nancy Cott and her historical wisdom , who gave the run-down on the herstory of marriage and how the point is not to make babies , Sarah Palin , and how marriage has a history of racism .
Yalie genius Chauncey took the stand to look at how Prop 8 is part of a historical trend demonizing gays & lesbians .
We took a moment to reflect on Anita Bryant .
We felt overall hopeful at the end .
DAY THREE : January 13th , 2010
PART ONE – In Which the H8er Tries to Prove That Everyone Went Crazy Five Years Ago , Homos Are Just a Fad Like Slap Bracelets , Except Different ‘ Cause Everyone Loves Us Now , We ’re Fine Or Something .
So the questioning of Mr. Chauncey , history professor extraordinaire , resumed first thing in the morning .
The h8ers began by trying to show that public opinion about gay people has changed rapidly since 2004 , which means I guess that Prop 8 is now borne out of love for homos instead of documented intolerance of them ?
They also tried to establish that gay people are SO HIP RIGHT NOW in pop culture , etc .
I mean , you saw Queer Eye , right ?
Who needs rights when you have Shane ?
As Paul Hogarth , our fearless liveblog leader of the day , puts it : “ Based on the line of questioning , they ’re clearly trying to show how “ radical ” treating same - sex couples equally [ is ] — that it ’s a recent phenomenon .
It ’s a bit surreal listening to it , because anyone must ask — why is quick change towards acceptance bad thing ? ”
Or an excuse to delay rights ?
PUMP THE BRAKES .
Thompson then asks Chauncey about changing public perceptions at Yale , where he works .
Chauncey : “ I would hardly call Yale a bellwether of public opinion in the United States . ”
Thompson : “ Thank heavens . ”
I think Thompson is saying that ’ cause of all the liberalism over there at Yale .
Just recently I went there and saw a play about Andy Warhol and Valerie Solanis and there was a lot of drugs , homosexuals , tight pants and etc .
Very bad for children , and New Haven may seem safe but DON ’T WALK ALONE AT NIGHT .
Also , current contender for Why Are They Allowed To Ask That This Shit Is Crazy award of the day : “ It is true that Americans believe that homosexuals are more likely to get AIDS than heterosexuals , correct ? ”
Ok ok ok now shit gets real .
As quoted directly from Hogarth ’s liveblog : “ Now Thompson is getting absurd .
He is asking Chauncey a whole line of questioning about how many religious groups and churches support marriage equality , that they are evolving .
“ Also , Thompson tries to prove this by showing a video clip of Rick Warren .
Um , what .
Thompson is trying to collapse the whole really fantastic line of reasoning and relevant history that Chauncey put together yesterday – basically , he is trying to prove that life is not really that hard for queermos , and that we are getting our boyshorts all in a twist about this “ discrimination ” thing .
Good luck with that one , friend .
Then we start talking about how few homophobic pieces of legislation California has in relation to other states , and do n’t a lot of people move to California because they want to be in a less hostile place , and did you know that a lot of California ’s best friends are gay ?
Defo no anti-gay animus here .
Does anyone else feel like this is turning into one of those completely absurd episodes of CSI where you can say whatever you want in the courtroom ?
“ CSI Brown , did you find that your GAMBLING PROBLEM interfered with your ability to take these blood samples properly ? ”
No , ok I ’ll stop now .
Oh so Exhibit C : What It ’s Like in California :
We also talk about civil unions for a while , and Thompson points out the radical queer groups that reject marriage as an institution altogether – trying to prove that there are reasons to oppose gay marriage besides homophobia .
This should be a moot point b/c even if these people do n’t think marriage is what our community is fighting for , we highly doubt they would vote Yes on DOMA .
It ’s just an insane line of reasoning .
Mostly this part is really uncomfortable because it kind of feels like airing all our community ’s quarrels and divisions in front of Maggie Gallagher while she sits there and takes notes – these are delicate subjects that mean a lot to a lot of people , and it ’s frustrating to watch some lawyer who does n’t understand any of them talk about them so glibly .
But Chauncey handles it really well !
“ The right to marry evolved and became a more widespread and deeply held goal of the gay and lesbian community . ”
In other news , Thompson is still being an asshole .
Part Two : In Which the h8ers Wanna Be Victims
Thompson wants to tell everyone about how all of his cronies got beat up for supporting Prop 8 .
In lieu of a big fiesta where all us gay people can share all of our photos from all the times we ’ve gotten beat up for supporting our own right to exist or spend time outdoors around other humans , the Judge gives a Hell - to - the - NO on that one .
Because really who has time for that kind of slide show .
Although I would like if perhaps we could take a Laramie Project lunch break .
No ?
Okay .
h8er : Is n’t it true that some hostility to the LGBT community comes from these attacks on Yes on 8 supporters ?
Chauncey :
It seems unlikely on the face of it .
You would have to bring a compelling case to me .
[ translation : ARE YOU F*CKING KIDDING ME ? ]
Part Three : Enter The Mormons
We get to watch a nice movie about Mormons who were horrified that their children were learning about gay people in the schools instead of learning about all the fun stuff Joseph Smith wrote in his book , like that dark skin is a curse from G-d , American Indians are a lost tribe of Israel , the Garden of Eden is in Missouri , G -d lives on a star called Kolab , caffeine is evil , Mormon underwear protects you from Satan , and that Christianity is American .
Here ’s a look at the PSA under consideration :
h8er : Should n’t parents who disapprove of gay marriage request that their kids not have to learn it ?
Chauncey : Well — what about if parents disapprove of blacks and whites being together ?
Should parents be able to prevent their kids from reading about that in public schools ?
Gay marriage is a fact of life in Massachusetts .
If parents have a problem with that , they can send their kids to private school .
THAT ’S RIGHT , you tell ’em Chauncey .
We could n’t see this ourselves , but are told that Thompson looked visibly uncomfortable at this point , and WE BELIEVE IT .
Now the ball is back in our court so we are just gonna knock off a few slam dunks real quick here .
Stewart : Does Prop 8 say anything about when sex ed takes place ?
What parents can teach their kids ?
What parents can object to in what ’s in the schools ?
Chauncey : Yes .
Stewart :
Are there fairy tales ( childrens books ) of men and women falling in love ?
Chauncey : Yes , of course .
Stewart :
Are heterosexual weddings considered an “ adult issue ” that children are not exposed to ?
Chauncey : No , children are present and even play a role in heterosexual marriages .
Next , the dream team of Stewart and Chauncey give a really solid 10 - minute intro to Gay History 101 , they could teach a seminar on this , freshmen would love it .
Cliff ’s Notes :
The first historical evidence of recognizing homosexuality ( in the West , I guess ? ) was in Puritan New England , and y’all know some of those feminist activists in the 1860s were fingerblasting .
We talk about the priorities of the early gay rights movement in the 60s and 70s – mostly stopping police raids , fundamental protections against discrimination , and the right to come out without compromising your safety .
Getting the medical establishment to stop describing us as sick and deranged , etc .
Also , to bring it all back together , we ’re not letting the race comparison go – Stewart has Chauncey confirm that there were black civil rights activists who opposed desegregation ( like Malcolm X ) to debunk the notion that just because some queers do n’t view marriage as a priority does n’t mean it ’s not ethically necessary or morally right .
A lot of important stuff established in just a few questions !
Go team !
Part 4 : The Media is the Message
Ok , remember when we watched Yes on 8 TV spots yesterday to prove that they are part of a longstanding and established tradition of anti-gay stereotypes and sentiment ?
Today that gets a little more interesting .
Stewart wants to talk about Mr. Tam , an official proponent of Proposition 8 , and examine the information about it that he disseminated publicly as an example .
You may remember that Mr. Tam was supposed to come to court to support this sh*t , but decided not to b/c he said he was gonna get beat up .
That ’s good , now he can understand how gay teenagers all across the country are afraid to be honest with their parents or go to school .
Thompson objects very strenuously to this , but since apparently he made Chauncey answer questions about Carrie Prejean earlier , it ’s allowed ?
That ’s cool .
So anyways , Chauncey reads to us from a flyer of Mr. Tam ’s which “ talks about the right to marry leading to prostitution and having sex with children .
And gay marriage is a product of San Francisco government run by homosexuals . ”
Other fun facts from Mr. Tam :
“ Part of the gay agenda is legalizing sex with children . ”
The education curriculum in Alameda County will “ brainwash ” children into supporting gay marriage .
“ Every child will grow up thinking they can marry John or Jane . ”
“ Children would benefit the most ” if Prop 8 passes , because the children would then have “ both sexes ” as parents , and kids adopted by gay couples ( which will happen if Prop 8 fails ) do not have “ two genders ” as parents . ”
So , aside from being hilarious / horrifying , there ’s something really important happening here .
In keeping with the central point of this case , that Prop 8 passed purely out of anti-gay “ animus , ” Stewart is proving that a )
Yes on 8 intentionally circulated media material that promoted and perpetuated this “ animus , ” and b ) that none of it is true .
After establishing everything above , she asks Chauncey if , “ based on your knowledge of history , has there been a gay agenda ? ”
He says that it ’s only been used as a term to fuel anti-gay measures .
Next , she has him talk about the intentional erasure of gay history – which is terrible in and of itself , but also ensures that there ’s a big empty space that crazy people can fill with lies like this .
It ’s a really big deal that these things are actually being said in court !
Remember watching the Yes on 8 ads , and after you were done bleeding from the eyes , asking yourself why someone could n’t take them to court for blatantly making sh*t up ?
Well , someone just did .
No one can guarantee it will work , but they are doing a great f*cking job trying to prove that circulating hateful misinformation about gays for your own political ends is morally , ethically , and legally wrong – or at the very least , that they make for unsound laws .
It ’s about time .
Part 5 : IN WHICH OUR RELATIONSHIPS ARE VALIDATED
Now we are going to bring out a new person , she ’s a lady named Letishia Pelplau ; a social psychologist from UCLA who ’s done research work on same - sex couples since the 1970’s .
That ’s a long time , I bet she knew all the Angels in America .
Letishia Peplau says she is an expert on four issues : ( a ) marriage brings important benefits , ( b ) relationships between same - sex and heterosexual couples are similar , ( c ) gay couples who can marry have the same benefits , ( d ) gay marriage will not harm heterosexual marriage .
BAM .
[ UPDATE ] 1:57 PM : The US Supreme Court just ruled — no cameras .
It was a 5 - 4 decision .
www.scotusblog.com.
Sorry !
Anyways , back to Peplau : she ’s talking about marriage as a social institution , and talks about how the statistics say it benefits those people who get to participate in it .
And then she brings out the studies comparing gay relationships to straight ones – guess what y’all , they ’re pretty similar !
“ Yes , there ’s a stereotype is that same - sex relationships are inferior and less stable .
But there ’s no foundation for it . ”
She says that a position paper adopted by the American Psychological Association confirms that “ satisfaction , stability and commitment is relatively the same between gay and straight . ”
Oh !
Now Stewart asks her about the commonly held belief that gay relationships do n’t last as long , and Peplau says that while there ’s no evidence that it ’s true , if it was , it could be due to the fact that we ’re denied the stabilizing effect of marriage .
Swish !
Nothing but net , girl !
She also confirms that there ’s been no change in divorce rates in Massachusetts since gay marriage passed , and notes that couples there “ say they [ feel ] “ less worried ” about legal problems . ”
YEAH I GUESS MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE TRUE .
Also , contender for Most Satisfying Quote of The Day , courtesy of Peplau : “ I have a hard time believing that a straight couple is going to say , “ Gertrude , we ’ve been together for 30 years .
But now we have to throw in the towel because Adam and Stewart down the street are getting married . ”
PART SIX : Peplau cross-examination
And now it gets really frustrating !
The very first thing is the cross-examining attorney getting all uppity and asking if it ’s true that most of the studies Peplau quotes have been based on straight marriage and not large sample sizes of gay marriages .
MAYBE IF YOU F*CKING LEGALIZED IT , YOU HEARTLESS WITCH , we could do a study !!!!
Seriously , was that actually just a mean joke ?
Asking why we can’t find thousands of gay married couples to survey ?
Also , it only gets worse from here !
Get ready !
“ Let ’s talk about gay men … Would you agree that the practice of monogamy in gay male relationships is different than in heterosexual relationships ? ”
Yes .
Yes .
This is really where we ’re going with this .
This is really what someone ’s law degree is going towards .
Trying to get someone to admit in a court of law that gay men are all sashaying sluts in fake leather pants who just want to do cocaine and bang each other til the sun comes up .
Okay then , let ’s do this .
Cross -examining attorney quotes a 25 - year - old study that says “ sexual exclusivity ” may be “ more the exception than the rule ” in gay male relationships .
That sexual affairs can be a “ complement ” to a steady relationships . ”
This was probably conducted by someone who got burned by Brian Kinney and anyhow listen , lady , I bet 25 years ago sexual exclusivity was more the exception than the rule for you too , who knows what you were like in college .
The h8er pressures Peplau to admit it ’s “ a fact that less gay men believe that monogamy is important , ” and then tries to get her to calculate the number of gay couples in Belgium in her head , which is dumb and confusing .
Mostly this is all just horribly offensive , not just to gay men ( although it definitely , definitely is offensive to them ) but also to anyone with a brain .
The defense attorney is n’t really even trying to prove anything , she ’s just taking an opportunity to repeat out loud stereotypes about gay men as AIDS - ridden whores so that everyone in the courtroom has that in their head instead of , you know , love .
Or marriage .
Or human rights .
[ An official statement from our fearless leader and CEO of Ideas Riese : “ I CAN ’T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING . ” ]
But hey , you know what ?
Cross -examination can’t last forever .
And it ’s not all bad , because we got THIS :
Peplau : “ There ’s no doubt that civil unions have been beneficial to same - sex couples .
But they are not equivalent to marriage .
And if you ’re not allowed to be in the most highly regarded institution in the country , civil unions are not going to be the same .
We all know the impact that stigma and second - class has on people , and on relationships .
It seems to me that being prevented by the government from being married — is similar to other stigmas we have seen . ”
Also , THIS :
M : We know that 40 % of the respondents in the survey said they got married because of “ society ’s visibility ” of gay relationships .
P : Well , they were asked to pick a whole series of choices ( and could do more than one . ) 93 % chose “ love . ”
PART SEVEN : The Sun Sets on H8
“ It ’s 4:09 p.m. , and the Court has adjourned for the day .
What did we learn this afternoon ?
That when faced with overwhelming evidence on the value of marriage , the stability that married couples bring , that same - sex couples are just as capable of loving each other — that the opposition will sink to start scapegoating gay men , bringing out all the worst stereotypes that we ’re promiscuous and spread diseases .
It does n’t matter that they cherry - pick studies that are 25 years old , when practically no one was talking about domestic partnerships — let alone gay marriage .
If there was more proof that the motivation behind Prop 8 is animus , the defense proved that once again during their cross-examination . ”

Summary of Findings
Americans tracked the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Haiti more closely than any other major news last week , but also kept a close watch on two intertwined stories : the fate of health care legislation in Washington and the outcome of last week ’s special election for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts .
Nearly half ( 47 % ) say they followed news about Haiti more closely than any other story .
Almost two - in - ten ( 18 % ) say they followed news about the debate over health care reform most closely , while 14 % say they most closely followed news about Republican Scott Brown ’s win in the race for the late Democrat Ted Kennedy ’s U.S. Senate seat .
The public ’s take on the chances that health care legislation will be enacted this year shifted dramatically after Brown ’s Jan. 19 victory , which will end the Democrats ’ effective control of 60 Senate seats and their ability to stop Republican filibusters .
About two - thirds ( 67 % ) now say they do not think a health care reform bill will be passed into law this year , while 27 % say they think it will , according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey conducted Jan. 22 - 25 among 1,010 adults nationwide by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
This is a reversal from the previous week ’s News Interest Index survey when 57 % said they thought legislation would pass this year , while 33 % said it would not .
The Haiti earthquake and the Massachusetts election also received the most news coverage last week , according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism .
The earthquake aftermath accounted for 27 % of the newshole , while Brown ’s win – and its potential impact on President Obama ’s agenda – made up 21 % of coverage .
Specific coverage of the health care debate made up just 5 % of the newshole .
While Democrats focused overwhelmingly on the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake ( 66 % say it was the story they followed most closely ) , Republicans were more likely to divide their attention among the week ’s top stories .
More than a third ( 35 % ) say they followed news about the earthquake more closely than any other story , but close to a quarter ( 23 % ) say they followed the Massachusetts election most closely .
Just 6 % of Democrats say they followed the election for Kennedy ’s seat more closely than any other story .
Among independents , 42 % say they followed Haiti news most closely , and 13 % say they followed the Massachusetts vote most closely .
Attention to the Massachusetts special election was not confined to the Northeast .
Roughly equal numbers say they followed the election very closely in the Northeast ( 39 % ) and the West ( 40 % ) , little different from the percentages of those who say they followed it very closely in the Midwest ( 35 % ) and the South ( 33 % ) .
Men and women were equally interested in the vote ( 37 % vs. 35 % very closely ) .
And , in another sign that the public saw the election as significant , almost two - thirds ( 64 % ) say the media gave the heavily - reported story about the right amount of coverage .
Prospects for Health Care Legislation Dim
The percentage of Americans who say they think health care legislation will pass this year ( 27 % ) is at its lowest point since the question was first asked in early October 2009 .
The week of Oct. 9 - 12 , the public was divided : 45 % thought legislation would pass within the next year ; 46 % thought it would not .
While two - thirds ( 67 % ) now say they do not think legislation will be enacted this year , that view is even greater among those who say they followed the special election in Massachusetts very closely .
Among that group , 78 % say they do not think legislation will pass this year ; 17 % think it will .
Among those following the health care debate very closely , a comparable 73 % now say they do not think legislation will pass ; 23 % say they think it will .
That is a reversal from just one week earlier , when 63 % of those following the debate very closely said they thought legislation would pass and 33 % thought it would not .
The expectation that health care legislation will pass in the next year is down sharply among all partisan groups .
Currently just 17 % of Republicans say legislation will pass , down from 47 % one week earlier .
Among independents , the percentage dropped to 22 % from 59 % and among Democrats it dropped from 64 % to 42 % .
Nevertheless , Democrats remain most likely to say legislation will be enacted .
Among the 79 % who know that the Republican won the special election , seven - in - ten ( 72 % ) say they do not think legislation will pass , while 22 % think it will .
Among the 21 % who do not know that the GOP candidate won what had been Ted Kennedy ’s seat , about half ( 49 % ) say they do not think legislation will be enacted this year .
Too Much Coverage of Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien
About seven - in - ten Americans ( 69 % ) say the press devoted too much coverage to Conan O’Brien ’s departure from The Tonight Show and Jay Leno ’s return to that show .
O’Brien hosted the show for the last time on Friday , Jan. 22 .
About one - in - five ( 21 % ) say the media devoted the right amount of coverage to this story .
Far fewer people say any other story received too much coverage last week .
About seven - in - ten ( 71 % ) say the earthquake and relief efforts in Haiti have gotten the right amount of coverage ; 19 % say they have gotten too much coverage .
Almost two - thirds ( 64 % ) say the Massachusetts election got the right amount of coverage , while 16 % say it got too much .
About as many ( 15 % ) say the race received too little coverage .
A plurality ( 49 % ) says the Supreme Court ’s decision overturning campaign finance laws on corporations and unions paying for ads about political candidates was under -covered .
Just 8 % say this decision , which was announced on Thursday , Jan. 21 , got too much media attention .
Close to four - in - ten ( 38 % ) say the media gave too little coverage to the country ’s economic conditions .
A matching percentage ( 38 % ) says the same about the debate over health care reform .
As Obama prepares to deliver his State of the Union address , more than half of Americans ( 55 % ) say their opinion of him has not changed in recent weeks , but one third ( 33 % ) say their opinion of Obama has grown less favorable recently .
Just 8 % say their opinion of the president has improved .
This is the most negative balance of opinion since Obama became president .
These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index , an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
The index , building on the Center ’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories , examines news interest as it relates to the news media ’s coverage .
The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , which monitors the news reported by major newspaper , television , radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis .
In the most recent week , data relating to news coverage were collected from Jan. 18 - 24 , 2010 , and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected Jan. 22 - 25 , 2010 , from a nationally representative sample of 1,010 adults .
About the News Interest Index
The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public ’s interest in and reaction to major news events .
This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , an ongoing content analysis of the news .
The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media : newspapers , network television , cable television , radio and the internet .
Each week ( from Monday through Sunday ) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week .
The News Interest Index survey collects data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week .
Results for the weekly surveys are based on landline telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults , 18 years of age or older , conducted under the direction of ORC ( Opinion Research Corporation ) .
For results based on the total sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 4 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls , and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error .

Jan. 17 , 2010  -- President Obama probably never thought he'd be in Massachusetts on Sunday night .
But with Republican Scott Brown showing unexpected strength two days before the special election for Ted Kennedy 's senate seat , Obama made a last - minute trip to Boston to headline a rally for Democrat Martha Coakley .
A crowd of more than 1,000 at Northeastern University heard the president say , " I need you ! "
Even before Obama scheduled his trip , however , campaign lawyers in both political parties had begun quietly cramming for the colossal legal battle that could ensue should Brown pull off a stunning upset in one of the nation 's bluest states .
Republican lawyers fear that if Brown wins , Democrats will use stall tactics to delay certification of his victory till after the U.S. Senate casts its final vote on President Obama 's healthcare bill .
That 's because right now the interim senator appointed after Kennedy 's death , Paul Kirk , could deliver President Obama the key 60th vote on the hotly contested health insurance reform plan .
" Both sides are going to be ready for a fight , " said one election lawyer involved in the preparations , who discussed the effort on the condition he not be named .
Brian McNiff , a spokesman for Secretary of the Commonwealth William Francis Galvin , who is in charge of elections in Massachusetts , said attorneys in his office have been fielding a lot of calls from the two sides in recent days .
With so much riding on this vote , the White House and its GOP opponents have propelled the special election onto center stage .
Both Republicans and Democrats have poured money into a race that Coakley once led in polls by as many as 30 points .
During his briefing Friday , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the election will be " a referendum on whose side you are on " in the healthcare battle .
The Democrats ' chief concern is being prepared to try and hold the seat if the outcome is close .
Recounts are much easier to mount if the margin of victory is less than half of one percent , according to state election rules .
Democrats are likely to be well prepared --- the lawyer for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is Marc Elias , who oversaw the Minnesota recount that led to Sen .
Al Franken 's victory .
When reached at his office , Elias declined to talk about any preparations .
Should Brown prevail by a sizeable margin , Democrats could still slow the process enough to prevent him from being seated in time for a healthcare vote , election law experts said .
Brown would have to be both certified the winner and formally seated in the Senate before he would be eligible to cast a vote .
Both steps are overseen by Democrats .
C ertification can only come when each of the state 's 351 towns and cities have completed their ballot counts , forwarded the results to Secretary of the Commonwealth Galvin -- an elected Democrat -- who then submits them to the governor and the Governor 's Counsel for a final review and signature .
Under the rules , the process can be held up for 10 days while local election officials wait for ballots coming in from troops overseas .
Then the ballots go to the Governor 's Counsel , which meets once - a - week , on Wednesdays .
And no rules dictate how quickly the governor must follow through with a signature before returning the paperwork to Galvin .
McNiff , Galvin 's spokesman , said he does not expect any change in the process , regardless of the election 's outcome .
" There 's never been a question here of holding on to this material , " McNiff said .
" It 's done as soon as they get the results . "
If there is delay , one campaign lawyer researching the matter said they can go to court to try and force a certification .
Even after the certification is complete , it will be up to the Senate leadership to seat the eventual winner .
When asked whether the Republicans would have any reason to fear a delay , Jim Manley , a spokesman for Majority Leader Harry Reid , D. - Nev. , said he does n't engage in hypotheticals .
But he said he did not expect any deviation from the usual process .
" When the certification papers come to the Senate and the vice president is available , the winner will be seated , " Manley said .
Republican strategists say there would be no need to wait for the vice president .
The statute says the oath may also be administered by the Senate 's presiding officer or the assistant secretary .
If there were a delay in the Senate , one Republican lawyer reviewing the matter said , the Democrats would have to weigh the potential for a political backlash .
" If Massachusetts certifies someone and the senate says they 're not going to seat them , that 's a political call , " the lawyer said .

I explained some of the troubles with Perl 5's UNIVERSAL in Is It , Can It , Does It , and Robust Perl 5 OO .
More — and subtler — problems lurk .
A common antipattern in Perl 5 APIs is to allow spectacular flexibility in argument passing .
It 's too common to see functions which take some kind of reference and manually switch based on the argument type .
( Some APIs do need this flexibility , such as a pretty printer for nested data structures or a serializer .
Even so , languages with support for multiple dispatch or pattern matching of the non-regex kind provide much cleaner , simpler , and more correct code .
I take advantage of this feature all of the time in Perl 6 . )
An example might be :
sub my_awesome_api_does_everything { my $ arg = shift ; given ( ref ( $arg ) ) { when ' ARRAY ' { ... } when ' SCALAR ' { ... } when ' HASH ' { ... } } }
That can be messy , and better API design can ameliorate that in many cases .
OO fans may already have looked up Replace Conditional with Polymorphism to post in the little comment box , but that occasionally runs into the " is it a primitive or an object " conundrum that multi-paradigm languages provide .
Yes , you can make my_awesome_api_does_everything ( ) into a method on a data type , but unless you 've steadfastly avoided primitive obsession in your code , you 'll have circumstances where you want to pass in a simple data structure instead of an object and vice versa .
The so - called solution of extension methods on base types has its own problems .
Globals are tricky , even if they 're namespaced methods : anything you could possibly want gets crammed into poor Array , potentially multiple and conflicting times .
( If you turn your head the right direction , it 's obvious that only a PHP programmer could have created Ruby on Rails ; there but for namespaces and some degree of encapsulation .... )
The real problem is that you have to manage all of that complexity somewhere .
In the absence of a sane API which refuses to handle that complexity ( usually the best solution ) and language features which hide that complexity for you ( and have plenty of experience from plenty of real programs and a copious test suite to ensure that correctness ) , you will get it wrong in myriad , subtle , conflicting ways .
For example , consider a bog - standard blessed hash Perl 5 object .
If you pass it into my_awesome_api_does_everything ( ) , what happens ?
What should happen ?
You can argue that the switch statement needs another case to handle the object .
You can also argue that the HASH approach should suffice .
Yet accessing the object as a hash breaks encapsulation .
Adding another case makes the code a little bit less maintainable ( the combinations increase , adding to the complexity of this code , to say nothing of the additional documentation and testing requirements ) .
On the other side , the more genericity and polymorphism you can support in your APIs , the less the coupling of your program in general and the better the reuse possibilities .
The ultimate goal of maintaining a system is to be able to delete code while adding features and removing bugs .
Net negative SLOC production is wonderful .
You want to avoid unnecessary data conversions to use the API , but you also want to maintain safety and correctness .
You do n't want to rule out useful behavior , but you want to enforce consistency .
ref ( ) is almost never the answer here , but at least it 's not actively misleading like the code people often use instead , when they realize that ref ( ) does n't answer the interesting question .
When the right answer for the API is to poke in the reference as if it were a hash , you often see this bad code :
if ( UNIVERSAL ::isa ( $ ref , ' HASH ' ) ) { ... } # buggy ; do not use
The reason this is wrong is subtler than you may thing ; part of the answer is in my previous article .
I 'll explain why in the next installment .
Mexico City , Mexico ( CNN ) -- Teodoro " El Teo " Garcia Simental , one of Mexico 's most wanted drug traffickers , was arrested Tuesday , Mexican and U.S. authorities said .
The capture of the high - level drug trafficker comes on the heels of successful military operations against another cartel last month .
Mexican federal police , assisted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , made the arrest in the city of La Paz , Mexico , the capital of the state of Baja California Sur , DEA spokesman Michael Sanders said .
Garcia Simental was a top lieutenant of the Tijuana cartel until he defected to the rival Sinaloa cartel after a power struggle .
" He is one the most notorious drug lords and was on a list of the Top 24 drug traffickers in all of Mexico " said another DEA official , who asked not to be identified because officials were still gathering preliminary information .
Authorities presented Garcia Simental , together with another man captured in the raid , Diego Raymundo Gutierrez Gomez , to the media in Mexico City on Tuesday .
Garcia Simental is accused of more than 300 murders , most of them since he split from the Tijuana - based Arellano - Felix organization in April 2008 , Federal Police Section Chief Ramon Eduardo Pequeno said .
One of his jobs for the Arellano - Felix cartel was disposing of bodies , Pequeno said .
Garcia Simental is accused of disposing of 300 body parts by dipping them in acid , Pequeno said .
Once he split from the Arellano - Felix cartel , Garcia Simental continued to operate a drug trafficking organization in Tijuana with the help of rival cartels .
The Sinaloa cartel and the Michoacan , Mexico - based La Familia cartel supplied Garcia Simental 's group with drugs , which he would smuggle into the United States , Pequeno said .
This splintering of the Tijuana cartel was a cause of much of the violence seen in the border city since 2008 , he said .
Tuesday 's arrest was the result of more than five months of intelligence operations , Pequeno said .
There was a reward of up to 30 million pesos ( U.S. $ 2.4 million ) for Garcia Simental 's capture .
CNN Justice Producer Terry Frieden in Washington contributed to this report .
Gamers can't really be called " courageous " for their pretend exploits in pretend wars with pretend characters , but if we could award at least one man for his out - and - out brass balls , it would be whoever the guy in this video is .
He can't seem to spell worth a crap , but he can certainly take out snipers in the most humiliating way possible .
Witness the thorough shame , captured on video for our twisted pleasure .
You wish you could be half this cool in a videogame , but you never will be .
You 're just not uncool enough in real life to get this good .

Video : West Virginia , southward discourse
by Jeremy Hooper
The following interview is one of the most epic FAILs of a marriage " debate " we have ever seen on any sort of television .
For starters :
The interviewer , Bray Cary , begins the piece ( and what a piece it is ) by comparing same - sex marriages to those which might exist between " a pig and a cow " or " a man and his brother . "
No , we 're not kidding .
And we all know that once the pigs fly out of a mouth , one knows that objectivity is going to fly right out the window .
Which is exactly what happens in the clip , with Cary showing an obvious hostility throughout the segment .
But beyond that :
The two men who are defending marriage bias , the aforementioned Cary and the West Virginia Policy Council 's Jeremiah Dys , seem to operate under the flawed idea that West Virginia should be controlled by mob rule rather than fair representation .
There is not even a minor consideration given to protecting minority rights .
Or when they do address rights at all , it 's as if West Virginia 's LGBT people are peasants waiting outside their village doors for whatever scraps of crusty bread the local heterosexuals might pull out of their pockets ( extra bonus if we get some lint too ! )
Yes , their thoughts do trip up the ACLU 's Seth DiStefano at points .
But that 's likely because he is so outnumbered and realizes that nothing he says is going to matter anyway that he can't help but stop and ponder how he can mind any kind of productivity out of this pugnacious forum !
TV itself is nerve - wracking .
Living out the kind of TV that you'd be screaming at if you were at home in your PJs in a whole other beast !
Here , have a look for yourself :
Marriage Debate [ WOWK TV 13 ]
Thoroughly flawed from the beginning to the " Why should I not be able to marry my sister ?... It 's the same exact thing . " ( 9:32 mark )
But wait , there 's more !
For the West Virginia Family Policy Council ( a Focus on the Family affiliate ) has taken this clip and made it even worse , if you can believe it :
Ooh , scary music !
What , was the pig grunt button broken or something ?
OY !
What a truly disturbing effort all around .
Your thoughts
My answers as a prelaw major Answer to question 1
Well , the answer to that is multi facited first we live in a constitutional republic .
This means that we live with a legislature , executive , and judiciary .
The most important of these branches is the judiciary .
This is because the court determines the constitutionality of laws this right of the court to review the constitutionality of laws s set forth in Marbury v. Maddison .
So even though the legislature / people may enact laws if these laws violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment the are not only unethical they are Anti-West Virginian and Anti-American .

The Perry - v-Schwarzenegger trial has provided the perfect primer for all of us in answering some of Cary 's questions .
Is this a government of the people ?
Certainly .
And , the people long ago passed the 14th Amendment stipulating that all citizens are to be granted equal privileges free of government impediments to life , liberty , and property .
If good citizens of the U.S. want to change that , then the place to begin is proposing an amendment which would repeal the 14th ( just like the 18th kicked off Prohibition , until the 21st repealed it ) .
Posted by : Bose | Jan 27 , 2010 10:02:58 PM
Actually , I 'd say the first thing to do is to have a higher court actually acknowledge equal protection rights and implement them ... THEN the " good citizens " can go about proposing an amendment .
As it stands , they do n't really technically need one , since not every American is viewed as equal under the law currently .

My head could explode .
" Why can't I not be able to marry my sister ?
It 's the same exact thing . "
Because STUPID :
The point of marriage is to create a NEW primary kinship between the non related and non married .
The state respects your blood kinship and confers all the benefits of inheritance and so on to it .
In other words , you do n't NEED to marry your sister and the bigger question is : do you really want to ?
So how is a same gender couple who meet the non married , non kin criteria AT ALL the same thing ?!
Anybody that even ASKS that question will peg themselves as dumb as a turd from jump .
Have none of these turd wads noticed that even with the advent of legal marriage in Western countries like Spain and Canada , and in states like MA for YEARS now , there have BEEN no political interests in incestuous or under age marriages ?
So apparently their assertions that such interests MUST follow same sex marriage , are a load of cr*p .
And have you noticed that even though there are archaic laws still on the books in states like KS that a girl under the age of 14 can marry ( and indeed a convicted pedophile exploited that law to marry a girl he got pregnant at age 12 ) , Mags and Brian are n't pushing to have THOSE laws changed and the age of consent raised to 18 in every state ?
I 'd have more respect for them if they were an advocate group that worked on those age consent laws .
But of course , we know why they do n't .

West Virginia is such a great place ; it was my home away from home growing up .
Take the people there and keep their utilitarian attitude and rugged persona , inject some tolerant principles , and you 'd have Heaven on Earth .

What a perfect name for the moderator : Bray .
I wonder if his middle name is Bleet .

homosexuals have equal rights to marry just as heterosexuals do but , becuase marriage is between a man and a woman .
To be a true marriage they would have to put aside their deviant desires that would take them out of the sanctaty of a marriage to to ingage in .
So to lie and call it equailty is so gay .

ACLU guy is cute , but he 's not making the strongest , simplest arguments .

Evan : I attribute much of it to TV nerves .
These appearances can be nerve - racking in the best of circumstances .
When coupled with such an obviously hostile set of circumstances , it 's even worse .

This interview does not surprise me .
My significant other worked for this ignorant man , and I say this lightly , and witnessed him ruin a very profitable TV station .
Bray thinks that one day he is going to be a candidate for Governor in WV , he is in denial and that will NEVER happen , even though he thinks " God .... Massive Coal " will be supporting him .
Best way to get rid of this CRAZY , out - of - control freak that made his fortune from NASCAR is to write to the local sponsors that use WV Media ( Commercial ads ) and ask them not to advertise / use WV Media , it will further the crunch on his pocket book ... just like his wife did when she divorced his crazy ass and took him to the cleaners .
Bray , if you happen to read this , one question for you ...
" Do you honestly think just because you have the money on paper ... makes you smart ? "
You continue to prove how ignorant you really are .... read the papers .. read voice of the people in the Charleston Gazette ( which I may add refused to even entertain an offer from you to buy their business ) , or how about sitting back and watching yourself on tape ?
Lastly , Bray ... are you trying to tell us you wanted to marry your sister ?
Is that the point you were making ....?.

I wish someone would call these people out on the notion that they are trying to protect " historical marriage " that has been around for thousands of years .
Marriage has undergone a number of changes throughout history .
Women used to be basically slaves , polygamy was the norm , and people of different races were not allowed to marry and yet we outgrew those prejudices .
Secondly , history is not just confined to white European history or the Bible .

Children in Science Fiction
The following is a transcription of a panel about children in science fiction held at ConFuse 93 .
The transcription was done by Tommy Persson .
To make the text more readable it was edited by Tommy Persson in some respects .
Hopefully , not too many errors were introduced in this process .
Panel participants were Carina Bj�rklind ( CB , moderator ) , Nancy Kress ( NK ) , Mary Stanton ( MS ) and Jan Wallenius ( JW ) .
CB : We are going to talk about children in science fiction or rather the lack of children .
It is usually very hard to find children in science fiction books and as Nancy has phrased it , they are usually treated as furnitures with diaper .
You talked about that in an interview in Locus .
Could you say something ?
NK : Okay , by the age forty , ninety percent of American women will have had a child .
I do n't know what the statistics is in Sweden but it 's probably not that much different .
And yet , to read science fiction , you get the impression that the entire race is not reproducing itself .
Everything interesting that is being done in science fiction and fantasy is inevitably being done by people who are unencumbered by children .
And as all of you who are parents know , having a child is an inconvenient thing .
Just as you are about to track the villain the child wakes up and you have to nurse it .
You can't leave town because �...
Even in fantasy the same thing comes up in real life .
Here you are , you are off and you are slaying barbarians or dragons or whatever and the truth is that you got to stay home and do your farming because your daughter is going to need a dowry next month or she will never be able to marry anybody decent and she will have to be a serf for the rest of her life .
And when you look at science fiction and fantasy you would think that the race is not reproducing itself .
Look at some of the important books of the last say ten or twenty years .
Consider for instance Neuromancer by William Gibson , a remarkably influential science fiction book that pretty much launched the whole cyberpunk movement .
Not only has it no children to speak of , you can't even imagine children in this world .
The world is an underworld , it is a down and dirty underworld .
It has got a lot of criminal activity , people are moving very fast , they are busy laundering money through several capitals of the world , they are busy stealing software from each other and plugging things in and out of their brain .
There is a lot of activity and nobody wants to interrupt it because the baby has got diarrhea .
My objection to this is that real life includes children and real life is more complicated than science fiction makes it in terms of family structures and finding places to put� ...
When was the last time you saw a starship with a day care center ?
And yet you can't really assume that all these people , going around space , on a five year mission , where no man has ever gone before are going to be completely child free for the whole time .
I object to this and the reason that I object has to do with an assumption about what science fiction should be doing .
My assumption , that I am making about science fiction is that it should be a real literature and what a real literature does , whether it is set in the past , the future , an alternate reality , a fantasy reality or whatever , is show us ourselves , show us human beings and all of our complexity , all of our messiness , all of our dreams , all of our mixed motivations , all of our total irrationality at some times and incompetent rationality at others .
It shows us ourself and it gives us models to live by .
I do n't necessarily mean utopian models .
Neuromancer is a good book , yet nobody wants to go slipping away becoming Case , the hero of that book .
But it shows us a world that is at least as complex , at least as real , at least as contradictory as our own and that means it should include the complexity and the contradictions , and the mixed emotions , and the mixed motivations , and the accommodations that people 's lives have to make for the presence of children .
CB : In your books you actually put in children and usually relationships between mother and daughter and things like that .
But how is it with you Mary ?
You are also a writer , have you put in this aspect ?
MS : Just for the sake of argument I 'll take the opposite side of the fence here and argue that not only science fiction , which I have written in the past , but mysteries , which is what I am now writing as my main field of interest , and other types of genre literature are written to challenge the reader and make him think about new ideas but also as a matter of escape .
I would pass it , just for the sake of the argument : why would you want to read about the complexities of diapers and diarrhea when what you would like to do is lose yourself in a universe where these kinds of things have been set aside for a higher adventure and a higher purpose ?
Not that having children and bringing them up is n't a higher purpose .
Why do you need children ?
Why do you need children 's presence in any kind of fiction ?
NK : Because I do n't think science fiction is an escape or should be an escape .
I think that it is more important than that .
Television is an escape .
Look at how bad it 's gotten , at least in the United States , and it 's getting worse .
Nobody looks at television or at least sitcoms and dramas because they think that they are going to learn something important about the way the world functions .
If you want to escape have TV .
Literature is too important for that to happen and I do consider science fiction to be literature .
And again , I repeat , we need a model of the way the world works .
This does n't mean there have to be kids in every single book , but I am talking about the genre as a whole .
We do n't reflect the reality of the human situation which is that ninety percent of people will have children and children are a tremendous commitment of resources .
All of you parents out there , you know how much time and energy and money and planning goes into kids .
And any world that lets us escape into the possibility where that does not exist for everybody all the time is falsifying it and I do n't think that is much of a useful escape or even much of an interesting escape .
MS : Well , lets define the term escape then .
Nancy has two children and I have three and I really sympathize with the demand of time that children make on you and it seems to me -- I kind of hesitate to say this -- that real work in the sense of making new scientific discoveries , even real adventure , even real business , does n't include children .
There is much of the real world where the raising of children has to be shut into a particular segment of the population .
Traditionally women and servants have been the ones to raise children .
And it seems to me that while you are talking about integrating children into the real world of literature , that integration does n't seem to exist in our existing world .
CB : What do you say about that Jan ?
You are a scientist and you are a father as well .
Do you recognise children in science fiction more after you became a father ?
JW : Well , I actually have n't thought about it but when you asked me to join this panel my first recollection was Aldous Huxleys Brave New World where children are grown in bottles .
Some authors have treated the subject this way .
They have got rid of the child problem by arranging for the society to take care of the children .
They are grown in machines or they are born grown up or something like that .
NK : Let me say about that , that I think that is valid .
How a society treats its children is an important component of what that society is like .
In Brave New World where the children are being grown in bottles and then raised in �...
That says something about a society .
How a society chooses to address the raising of its children is something important about a society and that is another reason for including it in a book .
Let me answer what Mary said .
It is true that business and scientific discoveries and international espionage do not of themselves include children .
Probably , IBM and Xerox and Mitsubishi have not got kids scampering through the halls in their headquarters .
Probably , international spies and terrorists are not logging their children along while they are doing what it is they have to do .
And I will agree with you , and especially in a short story or a novelette or a novella where you are focusing on one aspect of the world ( that is what makes it a short story ) .
There you 've selected and rearranged the world into a convenient pattern for the story and leaving out something as important as how the society handle children is certainly valid for that .
But a novel is something else again .
One of the functions of a science fiction novel is to give us an overview of the whole society , whatever it is , of that novel .
And an important part of this society is how it raises its children which are essentially the future .
Politicians are always saying that our children are our future and it is the truth , they are .
And how a society treats children as a whole says something very important .
Those scenes in Brave New World of decanting and the bottles going down the line as they are treated mechanically are a very important part of it .
And in some of the best science fiction novels , or what I consider to be the best ones , of the last twenty - five years the question of how the society as a whole treat children ( not necessarily the individual characters in the book , they may be childless , some people are ) is an important component in the whole thing .
For instance look at Ursula�K. LeGuins The Dispossessed .
Possibly one of the finest science fiction novels ever written .
She spends a lot of time explaining how the planet Anarres has integrated child raising into the rest of its social structure .
Children live in their own separate dorms or creches , they go to school and they learn many different things , any facet of the society .
It is not a formal academic rigid program and they work as apprentices in various different things .
So they find a niche for themselves as they move on and they became adapt in this work .
And this says something about the fact that work in Anarres is undifferentiated , that everybody does pretty much a little bit of everything except those jobs that require highly differentiated skills like music and physics where you have to study for years .
And because children are integrated in all of the wide spectrum of jobs it reflects the integration of the whole society into a wide spectrum of jobs , where you might make soap one day and lay pipes the next day and go out to do some farming the next day , unlike our society which is highly specialized .
And it is an important component and the same is true of many good novels .
I do n't think you can leave it out in a novel .
CB : I think it reflects the society and science fiction is supposed to maybe predict the future .
Audience ( Calle Dybedahl ) :
Two years ago Stableford likened science fiction to a moral laboratory .
A place where the author can experiment and research moral choices and ethics in situations which does not occur in normal society .
I think that is a reason why children normally do n't show up because if an author is experimenting with the morality of something that does not concern children , his book will not contain children .
And most authors are men which traditionally , in our culture , does not have very much contact with children so they will naturally choose areas where there are no children , to write about .
NK : I like the phrase '' a moral laboratory ' ' .
I like that a lot .
But I also think it carries some implications .
Morality implies that you are looking at something larger than just what you are doing right there .
For instance , it is possible to look at say genocide , say invent a virus that is capable of wiping out an entire country 's worth of population .
It is possible to look at it only scientifically saying I engineered the virus to do this and I engineered the virus to do that .
If I am going to look at it morally though I have to look at all aspects of what that virus is going to do and all consequences .
The idea of fiction as a moral laboratory , seems to me , only reinforces the fact that you need children , because children do represent a society 's future and surely any aspect of any moral issue is its consequences on the future .
And frankly , I think that if the majority of writers in science fiction that are men , and in the United States about sixty - five percent of SFWA are male , are leaving out children in this grand moral design because they have not had much contact with them themselves , then I do n't think that it is a strength .
I think it is weakness .
I think it is an indictment not only of science fiction but also of the way children are raised and the way work is differentiated in effect that fathers are not sufficiently involved .
I do n't want to make blanket statements because I know some very involved fathers , but it is the system that isolates men from there children .
CB : But is n't there a problem if the men write science fiction about technology and the female authors write science fiction which involves emotion and children and all this ?
Then we preserve the traditional pattern that men take care of all the technical stuff .
MS : First of all I think I would take issue with the distinction -- perhaps it 's a real one as science fiction is evolving -- with men simply addressing the technological scientific breakthrough issues and women looking at the more intuitive side of things .
I think that Nancy 's own work is an example of scientific and technological forecasting being integrated with the intuitive character driven novels as opposed to plot driven novels .
The writer in me really says wait , it is n't that there are gender specific ways of addressing fictional tasks .
On the other hand , Carina , you are probably stating a reality which is that in the United States science fiction in the thirties and forties was written predominantly by men who had as their task intellectual and scientific issues .
And I can't think of one story up until Nancy began writing in the early eighties , except for Ursula K. LeGuin who predated her , where the author addressed full universal human issues integrating science , technology and family into one thing .
What you are expressing is a reality which I hope is a reality of the past .
CB : Me too .
NK : My guest of honor speech tomorrow night is on women in American science fiction and I am going to touch on some of these issues so I do not want to say too much on those issues right now .
But let me back up a little to something you said before .
I think another reason ( I just feel like I am fighting alone here ) that I think it is important to include depiction of how children are handled in a society in science fiction novels
is because I think science fiction should be character driven .
What I mean by that is that I think the people in science fiction , whether they are male or female , should be as fully realised as complete real human beings , as characters in mainstream writing or as any of you are , characters in real life .
For example , a person has a child and he is a man who only goes home and sees his children very briefly a few times a week , just think of an extreme case , the 1950 American male who leaves completely the raising of the children to his wife and sees them perhaps at dinner and a maybe a few hours on Saturday and has very little to do with them until they are grown up at which point he realises that he never knew his children and regrets it bitterly .
Even in that case a large portion of energy , his financial resources , his planning will be for his children .
He will plan to send them to university , he will plan how they are going to have a career , he will plan on what it is that he can do for them , he will be spending a large portion of his income on raising them and all of this will change his thinking .
I do n't mean that every character in every science fiction novel has to be a mother or a father .
I know a lot of people who do n't have children .
For writers especially , the percentage is much higher than it is for the normal American population .
I would say fully half of the writers I know are childless by choice .
So I am not saying that every person in a novel has to be a parent but when no important characters in the novel are parents , then what you have done is you have falsified the human condition and you have missed the chance to develop a really full characterization of the society and of the people , because when we become parents we change as all of you who have children know .
Over time you find that you are thinking for two people or three people or four people and not just for yourself , and that changes the way you look at the world , it changes the way you look at the future .
And to leave that out of all the major characters in a science fiction novel is not to reproduce human reality in a way that is as fully , as rich , as it can be and as it needs to be .
Just because science fiction is about science or adventure or whatever , which it is , I am not denying that , does not excuse writers from using it as a moral laboratory which means that you have to include all of the important aspects of being human and certainly parenthood is one those .
Audience ( Holger Eliasson ) :
Why stop at children , why not create perfect description of a future society ?
Why not include environmental issues ?
Why not include law ?
Crime ?
NK : A really good science fiction novel will include those things .
It will be done by implication .
The environmental issues will be there because we will see people moving around the planet and you can't not put the environmental issues in .
For instance , can they breathe or do they have to put on an oxygen mask when they go outside .
Is there enough food or is it severely rationed .
Those are all environmental issues and they will be there .
Is it a highly technological culture or are there plants .
And if there are n't any plants , how are the animals eating and how are the people eating ?
You can't not include environmental issues .
You can't not include law because for one thing you have to imply whether or not people are breaking the law .
Even the simplest adventure novel has got to include that .
Is what these people are doing legal or are they likely to take heat for it ?
You got to by implication include these things .
That does n't mean you stop the story dead for paragraphs of explanation because if you do , you are probably dead as a writer .
But it is there by implication .
Law , how people go to the bathroom -- you may not actually see anybody doing this and in fact I 'd rather not .
How is waste handled and what technological level is there ?
I remember one of the most interesting and telling little details in 2001 , the movie , which I saw when it came out in 1969 , and was blown away with .
This guy goes into a low gravity toilet and there is a long list of explanations , because when you think about it you realise this is going to be tough without gravity .
It was just a little detail but it added a richness .
CB : A good example , which you mentioned in the interview , is Bruce Sterling 's Islands in the Net .
What you said was that before he became a father there were no children in his books .
But after he became a father this changed .
In Islands in the Net they are tossing this baby all around .
NK : Yes , I like Islands in the Net very much .
I like almost anything Bruce writes , but particularly Islands in the Net for this reason .
The couple which gets involved in international espionage does have a baby along for the first third of the book .
And it is very inconvenient .
They are touring an enormous former battleship which has been converted into a floating food station .
It is using algae and other food from the sea , and converting them into something that is edible for human beings .
And they tour this food station , and while they do this they got the baby in its infancy and it has to be changed , and they got to take turns carrying it , and there was n't enough diapers brought along , and one thing and another .
It lended a level of realism , and then one of them has to go to Africa on a really dangerous mission and the question comes up : which one ?
Somebody has to go back to Texas with the baby and somebody has to go ahead and go to Africa .
They can't go together because nobody in there right mind would lug a baby along on an international terrorist mission .
So it is a real decision and there are real consequences .
It 's the woman Laura who goes on the mission and when she comes back , considerably later than she expected , a matter of years , her daughter who is no longer an infant does n't know her , does n't recognise her , and in fact has been raised by her husband who has grown away from her and her mother and has become somebody different then Laura would have raised her herself .
And it 's heartbreaking , it 's the most heartbreaking scene in the book , and it's also a very real scene , and it lends a depth to the scientific part and the adventure part that a lot of other books like Neuromancer completely lack .
I think Islands in the Net is a much better book .
It did n't get the attention , it 's not flashy like Gibson 's Neuromancer , but I think it 's a much better book , probably for that reason .
Of course you are certainly free to disagree with me .
MS : I think your question really raises something that perhaps we should just comment on .
In current fiction which is set in the present , such as mystery or horror or mainstream fiction , there is a whole lot of assumptions that you can make about the society that you know the reader is going to understand .
Among those things are : what is the legal system , how are the ecological issues handled and how are children handled ?
When you are reading fiction not concerning the future then there seem to me that the mark of a high quality novel is that all of those things have been taken into consideration , in the novelist mind if nowhere else .
We are not talking about having a large proportion of science fiction containing scenes containing children .
Just that a science fiction novel of the future in addition to considering what 's the law and all these things that make a real universe also includes how you talk about the kids and what you do with the kids , because nobody can create a universe without children , it is n't a real universe .
CB : I think an illustrative example is Aliens where there is a child which Ripley has to save .
In the original film , before they cut it , in the beginning we see the base where the marines go , but we see it bustling with life .
People are working there and there are lots of children because there are families there .
You see small kids on three - wheeled bicycles and they are in the computer room and someone comes in and say : '' you ca n't have the children here ' ' , and that is just marvelous .
Here are really happy families and then they find this crashed space ship with the monster in it and the next scene is when Ripley is contacted because they have lost contact with the base .
The film as shown in the cinema starts with Ripley returning and she is contacted because they have lost contact with the base .
And then this child turns up from nowhere because they arrived at an empty base .
There are no people there and because we never saw this base bustling with life we did n't get the shock effect that you get when you see the un-cut version .
It was n't so important with children and all this so they just cut it out .
NK : I think it is changing though .
Look at the two Star Treks .
In the original Star Trek with Captain Kirk and Mr Spock there were almost never any children and there certainly were n't any on the Enterprise .
They went around doing their thing around the galaxy .
You hardly ever saw a child unless it was on a planet where they happened to put in .
The current Star Trek series Deep Space Nine -- it has just started on television this past season -- is a Star Trek show and it has that Star Trek look and that Star Trek feel although there are different characters .
It takes place on a space station which once belonged to aliens who have abandoned it .
The federation is taking it over and the person who is in charge of running it is Captain Benjamin Ciscoe .
A lot of alien races come here to re-fuel and then they pass on so it is sort of a crossways of the galaxy .
The commander of the space station , Captain Benjamin Ciscoe , has a son eleven year old .
His wife is dead and he is raising this son himself on the space station .
There are other children on the space station too .
As a result there is a school and there is day care arrangements and although this is in the background it makes the Deep Space Nine feel more like a future the human race might eventually have than the original Star Trek .
It is true that the Enterprise in the original Star Trek was a military ship and you do n't generally have children running around a military ship .
However it's also true that we do n't assign our military to one ship without getting them off for five years , without them coming back to their families for five solid years .
It seems to me that if you have people out there for five solid years , people are going to get married , children are going to be born and families are going to be formed .
None of that was happening on the Enterprise .
On Deep Space Nine it is .
And I think that it is a better show for that .
So I think it is starting to change .
Hallelujah !
Audience :
In the American series V , the solution was that there were two children born .
One was defective or dead and the other was alive .
It was a girl with some paranormal powers and that was , I think , a very unusual solution to the series so I wonder if you think it was a difficult way to solve the problem or� ...
How do you think about that as a writer ?
You have to solve the problem that you have sex between different races , that must work , and you have this idea of having a child born that ended the series so my idea was that it was not a very easy way �...
NK : I did n't see V .
I saw the first few couple of episodes and I did n't like it .
So you have to ask Mary because she saw it .
Audience :
Do you think there was a lot of argument before they come up with this solution ?
MS : Did you think it was a cheap solution an easy solution ?
I thought it was a good one .
Audience : No , I think it was a quite complicated way to end .
MS : This baby was the merging of the two races and I thought that �...
Audience :
There were two babies .
One was defective in some way .
The other one was a girl and she sort of saved the whole Earth .
MS : That is sort of a Christian theme in the sense that there is a child that shall solve the conflict and bring the races forward together .
I thought it was a good conclusion .
I do n't think that that is using children in quite the way that we have been discussing up until now because up until now we have been discussing the lack of children in the creation of science fiction novels as being a vulnerability .
It is n't a real world until you consider the children .
But this seems to me as an example where like the biblical phrase '' and the little child shall lead them ' ' .
This was , a little child shall lead them to a better , happier resolution of this conflict .
I liked this series very much because I like that kind of adventure science fiction and I saw it all the way through .
A friend of ours wrote the novelisation and I bought it and read it and liked it very much .
I though it was good , I thought it was a worthwhile resolution , and I thought it was a good use of the child .
I do n't like to see science fiction novels where children are held in threat because I think that is a cheap and easy way to get the readers ' interest .
But that is a third issue altogether , where you have some innocent kid who is being held in jeopardy just to keep the action going .
I think that is tacky .
Well , did I answer your question ?
Audience : Yes .
MS : I frequently do n't .
CB : We mentioned earlier that men have n't much to do traditionally with the children so male authors may have a tendency to just ignore children in their writing .
But actually , there have been a lot of novels and short stories which have touched on the theme in Brave New World where they try to get rid of the replication .
Either they try to produce children without a woman in an artificial womb or you try to clone people or something .
That is another question of course .
That seems to have been one way of trying to deal with this , we do n't want children and how could we get rid of the process altogether ?
As a technical problem .
NK : I think that is a legitimate use of science fiction though .
If it is a moral laboratory it is also a laboratory for the limits of science .
Things we can't do yet but we probably will be able to do eventually .
If we can do these things , how will we use them in terms of reproduction , is certainly a valid approach for science fiction to take .
One of my favourite science fiction novels is Kate Wilhelm 's Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang which is about cloning and in this version most of the population of the United States has been wiped out .
Of what is left , a lot of the population is sterile .
They expect that eventually the entire population will be sterile .
To ensure that the race does n't die out , they are trying to develop cloning so babies can be cloned from existing people .
And they do do this .
They develop cloning and it goes through I think six or seven generations where they will clone three or four of you and then from each of those they will clone three or four .
But what happens is , as she develops the novel , something is lost .
Without the mixing up of the genes you do n't get the regrouping that leads to individuality and without the high level of individuality that human beings have you loose originality and creativity and diversity .
And by the time they are in their seventh or eighth generation they have a real problem .
I wont give it away because I want you to read the book because it is wonderful .
And that is a valid approach , that is scientist cautionary tale .
If we do this , if we depart from what is normal for human beings , disaster lies ahead .
That 's one message science fiction has .
I think the opposite when I write .
These kinds of things are inevitable and it may be that there are better ways to reproduce and improve the race than we currently are using and maybe there is not .
But whether they are better or not , they are on their way so we might as well accept them .
For instance , genetic engineering .
My novel Beggars in Spain just came out a few months ago in the United States from Avon .
The novella version came out three years ago , and the novel version takes the story through another two or three generations .
The premise here is that in the future it is possible , using in vitro fertilisation , to choose the genes for your children for some characteristics .
Not everything of course because the human gene obviously is very complicated but you can choose some appearance characteristics .
If you for instance want your child to be tall and have blue eyes and red hair , this is easily arranged .
You can have a predisposition towards musical ability , you can't guarantee the child to be musical but a predisposition towards it can be arranged .
If you want a high IQ -- this is genetically controlled , at least largely genetically controlled -- it can be put into the genes .
What comes out in the novel is that a new genetic modification has just been developed which is that people do n't have to sleep at all , ever .
There are some evolutionary theories that say that sleep may in fact not be necessary to the human brain .
We may sleep because it is a holdover from a time when it kept us safe , when there were a lot of predators around and to be able to be out of the way during the nocturnal hour , s when most of those predators were roaming , was an advantage to us .
And the reason that we dream is that it would n't be an evolutionary advantage to go in too deep a sleep because when a predator comes up and starts gnawing your arm off you want to be able to be awake and notice this so that you can stop it .
So we dream so that the brain can be bombarded from the limbic system and from the brain stem .
It bombards the cortex to keep us only lightly asleep so that if you are attacked you will wake up .
That means that the whole thing can be eliminated without causing any real damage .
One theory says you sleep because a chemical accumulates in your brain that forces you to sleep .
If you do n't , and sleep deprivation experiments show this , sleep for a long enough time you start to have psychotic episodes .
But it could be that this is because of accumulation of a certain kind of neural transmitters in the brain that we have n't yet identified .
So if you genetically engineer people so this does n't happen , they never have to sleep .
Now what happens to my people who never have to sleep ?
First of all they gain an extra third of life , an extra eight hours over all the rest of us .
Secondly they have a boost in intelligence because -- this is my theory now remember , I can do it anyway I want -- they are not having their brain stems bombarded for eight hours by irrelevant messages while they are dreaming .
So this as a side effect turns out to boost intelligence .
There are other side effects too .
But what happens essentially is that you create a race of genetically superior people , not quite super - men but they certainly are genetically superior to us norms and the next generation gets even more so and the one after that even more so .
And you can see this is going to cause trouble , and it does , because for one thing it is a very expensive genetic modification , so the only people that can have it built - in in vitro are those who have enough money or enough connections with the scientific establishment in order to do it .
And since these children are already advantaged by having parents who have got some money and some connections you eventually end up with a gap between the haves and the have nots which the United States is already suffering from at a tremendous amount .
And you end up with political unrest and you end up with all kinds of social consequences .
The reason I told you the whole plot of my novel is not because I think you should all read it , although of course I do think you should all read it , it is because children are used in this novel not because they are cute and not because they are important , although they are important to a society , but because when you are writing about the projection into the future , children are often the way you get there whether it 's through cloning or genetic modification or whatever .
And so I think that is another legitimate use of children in science fiction .
It is the next generation that has to deal with this or the one after that or the one after that .
How will they do it ?
CB : I think it is very important that authors address these questions because even today it is possible to discover inherited diseases and I know that in some countries they dispose of female foetuses and things like that .
I think in the future it 's very possible that it will be hard to get insurance and things like that if you have an inherited disease .
And we might have the opposite problem that only the rich are able to produce children if they have a disease in their family .
It 's very hard to know what will be possible in the future with genetic engineering because we do n't know where the limits are yet .
I think it is very good that authors explore this as you have done .
NK : Twenty years ago , twenty - five years ago , Larry Niven said , maybe it is as much as thirty years ago , he said to -- not to the science fiction audience which already knew it -- the audience of the larger world press : there is an organ bank in your future , there will be a time when we can transplant kidneys and hearts and livers and you will have to decide who gets them and who does n't .
And of course the mainstream medical community said : oh , that is just science fiction , that is just those crazy guys out there .
And now of course this is a genuine issue .
Who gets organs , can you buy them , can you afford them , how are they allocated , who gets them and who does n't ?
In the United States not that long ago a two year old child was dying of a liver disease and needed a liver transplant .
Her father had a lot of media connections and he went on the television and said that his child was going to die if he did n't get a liver for her and the donor came this way through and the child lived .
But the father of another two year old , who does not have that kind of media access , cannot do that .
Niven said that thirty years ago .
I say to you , twenty years from know or twenty - five or thirty years there is genetic engineering .
It is in your future , it is there , and there will have to be some laws , and some vote of preferences and some decisions made at some point .
It will be a issue in your lifetime .
Audience ( Jessica Santesson ) :
Some days when my daughter is having a bad day , screaming a lot , all day through , being really bad , I can't help thinking about Edgar Rice Burroughs and his books about John Carter .
I mean it is quite a practical having children at Mars where they have eggs where they grove them and they come out all grown up .
NK : Gregory Benford wrote a very amusing and wickedly satiric short story called '' Freeze Frame ' ' in which he has a sort of cupboard or closet which is in stasis .
Time does not pass in a stasis .
And he has this yuppie couple who both has careers .
They are very busy and they have a high powered social life and they have a child .
And when it turns out that neither of them has time for the child they just put him in stasis for a while .
And it turns out they are ready to retire and they realize the kid is only two years old .
They are seventy and they have a two year old because they spent their entire time and never had time for him .
And it is a wicked satire , I mean the importance or this case the non-importance of children to this particular lifestyle .
CB : Arthur C. Clarke has written a book that in Swedish is called Delfin�n ( Dolphin Island ) where you have a child that is raised more or less by a computer and there are no grownups around .
You get the impression that there are grownups but you never meet any of them which is also a very strange situation .
We have only a few minutes left if you want to make any more comments or a round up ?
NK : Any more question from the audience in the last few minutes ?
Comments ?
Audience :
Do you think it is changing ?
Are there more children in quality science fiction now then there were ten years ago ?
NK : Yes , I really really do .
I think it is changing a lot .
I think the influx of women into the field , which again is something I am going to talk about in my guest of honor speech , has made a tremendous difference .
Again I am speaking of American science fiction which is the only one I can really talk about .
I think that the women 's movement in the United States , despite all the yelling and screaming and shouting at it's cause , has also raised everybody 's consciousness so that even male writers are beginning to put a lot more attention to procreated issues in there books .
And yes , I do think it is changing .
Things like Alien and Aliens , what this comes down to is a battle between two women at the end , the alien woman and the human woman , for their children .
She is protecting her eggs , which just happens to be ripening in human beings , sort of disgusting , and the human is trying to protect this child that she has adopted .
And you have two strong women fighting it out to the death .
You never would have seen that in science fiction twenty or forty years ago when male writers where handling it .
I think it is definitely changing , and I think it is a change for the good and not only because I happen to be a woman but because I think we can have depiction as I 've said of real societies that way .
CB : We have to finish here .
NK : Thank you .
You have been a good audience .
U.S. officials believe that as many as three dozen Americans who converted to Islam while in prison in the United States have traveled to Yemen over the last year , possibly to be trained by Al Qaeda , according to a Senate report .
The findings have alarmed U.S. counter - terrorism officials , who think that Al Qaeda has expanded its recruitment efforts in Yemen “ to attract nontraditional followers ” capable of carrying out more ambitious operations .
The report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee underscores the growing anxiety in the United States about the Al Qaeda offshoot , Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , which has claimed responsibility for orchestrating the suspected attempted suicide bombing of a U.S. jetliner bound for Detroit from Amsterdam on Christmas Day .
“ The Christmas Day plot was a nearly catastrophic illustration of a significant new threat from a network previously regarded as a regional danger , rather than an international one , ” the report concluded .
It warns of “ growing evidence of attempts by Al Qaeda to recruit American residents and citizens in Yemen , Somalia and within the United States . ”
The report was released in advance of a hearing that the committee is scheduled to conduct today on Al Qaeda ’s resurgence in Yemen .
“ As many as 36 American ex-convicts arrived in Yemen in the past year , ostensibly to study Arabic , ” the document said .
Some of those Americans “ had disappeared and are suspected of having gone to Al Qaeda training camps in ungoverned portions of the impoverished country . ”
The estimate was attributed to interviews that committee staff members conducted with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials in Yemen and other countries in the Middle East in December .
Fears about the Americans in Yemen are portrayed as part of a larger pattern of U.S. citizens or residents being drawn overseas to organizations with ties to Al Qaeda , raising concerns that they may be able to reenter the United States more easily than foreigners after undergoing terrorist training .
The document refers to “ two dozen Americans of Somali origin who disappeared in recent months ” from St. Paul , Minn. , and are widely suspected of fighting alongside Shabab , a militant group in Somalia linked to Al Qaeda .
In addition to ex-convicts , the report makes mention of as many as a dozen other U.S. citizens who have traveled to Yemen after marrying Muslim women and converting to Islam .
U.S. intelligence officials declined to comment on the report , which did not identify its sources by name or agency .
CIA - operated Predator aircraft have carried out strikes on Al Qaeda targets in Yemen in recent weeks .
The Senate panel conducted the interviews before the Christmas Day jetliner incident , which was thwarted when fellow passengers subdued the suspect after explosives he allegedly had smuggled on board in his underwear failed to detonate .
The 23 - year - old suspect , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Michigan on charges of attempted murder and the attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction .
U.S. counter - terrorism officials have expressed concern that Abdulmutallab , who is the son of a prominent Nigerian banker and had a visa to enter the United States , represents the vanguard of an evolving threat .
Abdulmutallab ’s ability to penetrate U.S. defenses and nearly pull off a devastating attack exposed serious failures in the U.S. intelligence community ’s ability to share and make adequate use of clues about such plots .
Among them were a warning that Abdulmutallab ’s father delivered to CIA officials in Nigeria about his son ’s growing radicalism , as well as the interception of Al Qaeda communications in Yemen indicating that a Nigerian was being employed in a terrorist plot .
The White House released a report on the intelligence breakdowns last week .
John Brennan , President Obama ’s top counter - terrorism advisor , acknowledged that until the alleged attempted Christmas Day attack , U.S. analysts did not see Al Qaeda ’s franchise in Yemen as capable of carrying out an overseas plot .
The Senate report makes clear that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has recovered from being on the verge of collapse several years ago to represent a potent new threat .
The network in Yemen is led by Nasir Wahayshi , a former aide to Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and one of 23 Al Qaeda fighters who escaped from a Yemeni prison in 2006 .
The deputy of the group is Said Shihri , a Saudi citizen released from the U.S. - run prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in November 2007 .

So today Sarah Palin delivers some great news :
She 's becoming the TV star she 's apparently always wanted to be and sparing us ( for the moment , at least ) the worry that she might run for national office .
She 's much better suited to TV , where glamour is everything and intellect is of little consequence .
Besides , going to Fox means she can proselytize all she wants ( as did former anchor Brit Hume most recently ) and need not let minor things such as the facts get in the way of a good story or , for that matter , a good sound bite .
According to the Los Angeles Times :
Palin will appear as a commentator on programs across the network , joining a lineup of pundits that includes fellow conservatives Karl Rove , Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee .
She will also help host a recurring series that profiles everyday Americans .
Profiles of " everyday Americans " ?
Like the ones who shop at Henri Bendel and Neiman Marcus and who are able to lavish more than $ 150,000 on outfits that will last a few months ?
Yes , dear , those type of average Americans .
The Huffington Post reported last November :
For weeks , the McCain - Palin campaign has dealt with the fallout from the disclosure that the Republican National Committee was billed for $ 150,000 in wardrobe purchases for the Palin family - - a discovery that was widely ridiculed and undercut Palin 's hockey mom appeal .
Several McCain aides said they had recently discovered that Palin 's traveling staff had used personal credit cards to spend as much as $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 on additional wardrobe items for Palin .

Weekly , our digital magazine .
In 1998 , at the Edinburgh Film Festival , I was happily watching the documentary Let It Come Down : The Life of Paul Bowles , when the weirdest thing happened to me .
While the 87 - year - old author was being interviewed in his apartment in Tangier , I had a strange feeling of deja vu .
An African mask on the wall triggered the sense that I had been in that apartment before .
Was that possible ?
Maybe I had seen a photo of it somewhere .
I had come to the film without any pre-conceived notions , nor did I know much about Bowles , merely that he had written The Sheltering Sky , a book I had not read .
I had seen Bernardo Bertolucci 's film adaptation of it , which I had not much liked .
That was the sum of my knowledge of Bowles .
The more the documentary continued , the more I became convinced that I had been in Bowles 's apartment in Tangier and not just seen photos of it .
It was too potent a sensation .
While I watched the film , I struggled to understand why I had this certitude .
Gradually , some images started to emerge from my unconscious mind , and then the whole story came flooding back .
I had what I can only call a flashback to an incident that had taken place more than four decades earlier .
When I was 17 years old , a friend of mine , known as Frog , and I had decided to take a year off between school and university to travel around Europe very cheaply , hitch - hiking , staying in youth hostels and getting odd jobs where we could .
We had managed to hitch rides down through Spain and had crossed on the ferry from Gibraltar to Tangier .
On our first night , after getting a room in a run- down hotel , we sat at an outdoor cafe nursing glasses of beer .
After a while , two middle - aged men sat down at the table next to us .
I immediately recognised one of them as Richard Wattis , a supporting actor in dozens of British films and TV shows , mostly playing officious civil servants .
I caught myself staring at him .
He smiled at me , and introduced himself as Dickie and his friend as Monty .
They offered to buy us more beer and asked if we would like something to eat .
As we had been living mostly on bread for the week , we accepted gladly .
After our meal , and a couple more beers , Dickie and Monty asked if we would like to visit the famous author Paul Bowles , of whom neither of us had heard .
We could hardly refuse .
Now rather tipsy , we followed our newfound friends through endless back streets , then climbed some winding stairs .
Dickie rang the bell of an apartment .
A young Moroccan dressed in a djellaba opened the door .
There were a few other young men lounging on sofas and a strange smell in the air .
My friend and I were introduced to a tall , thin man in his late 40s .
He was sitting in a cane chair and smoking a pipe .
An African mask was on the wall above him .
Ignoring Frog , whose looks had engendered his nickname , he asked me some questions and seemed to take an unusual amount of interest in my naive answers .
Then he offered us some peculiar - looking cigarettes .
Though neither of us smoked , it would have been impolite to refuse .
I took a few puffs , not knowing then that the cigarettes must have been kif , as hashish is known in Morocco .
The next thing I knew was that I woke up in a bed wearing a djellaba with nothing underneath .
I looked around and saw Frog , fully dressed , dozing in a chair .
My clothes were at the foot of the bed .
It was early morning .
I remember feeling more confused than shocked .
I just knew I had to get dressed and out of there as fast as possible .
I woke Frog and we made our way quietly out of the bedroom .
There did n't seem to be anyone around .
Luckily , the front door was open .
We ran out into the street and tried to find our way back to our hotel .
I had no recollection of what had happened between my taking the kif and waking up .
I asked Frog if he knew , but he did n't , having fallen asleep after smoking the kif .
I still wonder what took place during those few hours after I blacked out .
Who had undressed me and put me in a djellaba , and why ?
Had I been abused ?
I think I would have known if I had .
All I felt on waking up was a rather nasty headache .
It was curious , however , that I had eliminated the episode from my conscious mind until it had been aroused by the documentary more than 40 years later .
I had heard about repressed and recovered memory , but had always been rather skeptical about it .
There was another peculiar side - effect .
Ever since the memory came back , I struggle to remember Bowles 's name .
Incidentally , I 've since read everything I could by him in the vain hope that I would appear somewhere in his writings where the mystery would be solved .
Bowles 's best writing drew me into an exotic , perverse , nihilistic world in which one of the dominant themes was the destruction of innocence .
What impressed me and disturbed me most was his second novel , Let It Come Down ( 1952 ) , set almost entirely in Tangier among the louche ex-pat community .
It ends with the main character , Nelson Dyar , a soulless American high on hashish , hammering a nail into the ear of his sleeping Arab friend .
( Fully ) Document your DataMapper models with YARD
Any release quality software has to provide documentation , for the future maintainers and other developers .
Traditionally , Ruby projects would use RDoc and add custom documentation blurbs to their classes , methods , attributes and constants .
Unfortunately , there ’s a major limitation to RDoc , I ca n’t be extended to recognize new meta- programming method calls .
This rigidness of RDoc really shows up when you need to document ORM backed projects , such as one containing DataMapper models .
DataMapper allows one to define the properties and relations between models using handy class - methods :
class MyModel include DataMapper :: Resource #
The primary key of the model property : id , Serial #
The name of the model property : name , String #
The many authors contributing to the model has n , : authors #
The user that owns the model belongs_to : user end
RDoc will not recognize property , has or belongs_to .
Nor will RDoc know that property adds a class - method and instance reader / writer methods with the given name to the model .
Documentation fail .
Enter YARD
YARD is a documentation generation tool for the Ruby programming language .
It enables the user to generate consistent , usable documentation that can be exported to a number of formats very easily , and also supports extending for custom Ruby constructs such as custom class level definitions .
http://github.com/lsegal/yard
YARD organizes most of it's parsing logic into multiple handlers ; essentially classes that inherit YARD :: Handlers : : Ruby : : Base and define a process method .
YARD also supports a plugin system , by loading any RubyGems installed on the system that are prefixed with yard - or yard_ .
Using these two features of YARD , one can easily create a YARD plugin gem containing custom handlers , which YARD can automatically load and use .
yard-dm
yard - dm is a YARD plugin for parsing DataMapper model syntax .
The plugin can handle the following statements :
property :name , Type
has n , : things
has 1 , : thing
has 0..n , : things
has 1..n , : things
has 2..5 , : things
belongs_to : stuff
Install It
$ sudo gem install yard -dm
Use It
$ cd dm - project / $ yardoc
It 's that easy .
Next time you need complete documentation on your DataMapper backed project , just install YARD and yard - dm .
I ’ve enjoyed comic books and the characters since I was young , but for a long time , it was more from a distance .
I ’d admire them in a bookstore , peruse a boyfriend ’s long box or , on occasion , borrow a trade .
But I did n’t collect and follow comics myself — that is , until I met the Birds : Babs , Dinah , Helena and Zinda , as written by Gail Simone and drawn by Ed Benes , hold a sacred place in my heart .
I had just started a new job a few years ago when the topic of comic books somehow came up with the IT guy who was setting up my computer .
He asked if I was into them , and I was all , “ Sure . Kinda . ”
I told him I was really into Wonder Woman and chicks who kick ass .
He said he had something for me , and the next day , there was a stack of Birds of Prey trade paperbacks on my desk .
I opened the first one that following Saturday morning , and I could n’t put them down .
I was so enthralled that I read until my eyes could n’t focus , and I developed a monumental headache .
I kept on reading .
It is because of those very books that I go to my LCS every Wednesday ; spend countless hours reading comics ; search the Internet for comic book news and art ; display a Black Canary Ame Comi figurine on my office shelf ; spend lunches with other comic book fiends , talking for hours on our favorite stories ; and now have a blog to talk about it all .
Birds of Prey was the catalyst .
Honestly , no other book or set of characters has done for me what BoP did .
I ’d liken it to the first hit from a crack pipe .
Gail ’s writing and Ed ’s art made me itch .
From then on , I was hooked , searching desperately for that same high that I got from the Birds .
Some series have come close : Identity Crisis , Secret Six , Rucka ’s run on Wonder Woman , Fables , and Detective Comics with my darling Kate .
While they all gave me a great fangirl buzz , they did n’t satisfy me quite as much as Dinah kicking ass in her fishnets , Babs taking down a group of men from her wheelchair , Lady Shiva struggling with morality as Jade Canary , and Lady Blackhawk punctuating the action with her hilarious one - liners .
When Gail moved on to other projects , I was terribly disappointed .
Especially when DC married off Dinah to Ollie , and essentially ruined what Gail had done with her character .
( And can someone please tell me what happened to Sin? Anyone ? )
In new hands , the book floundered , then got canned .
Many , many times I ’ve wished for DC to bring the Birds back , with Gail driving .
It seems my wish has been granted :
The dream team of Simone / Benes is back !
And I am so fucking happy I want to cry .
South Yorkshire firefighters strike against threats of mass dismissal
By Simon Whelan
22 January 2010
The Fire Brigade Union ( FBU ) has been forced to call a fresh series of strikes after its members voted to reject a compromise on shift patterns the union leadership had accepted in order to end a previous stoppage .
Management of the South Yorkshire Fire Rescue Authority ( SYFRA ) has responded by reasserting its original demands — imposing new shift patterns — and threatening to sack anyone who fails to accept them .
The SYFRA not only want to alter working times for firefighters , but also to change the start and finish times of shifts , rest breaks and work routines .
South Yorkshire firefighters are to strike for a total of ten days .
The FBU announced a 48 - hour stoppage last week , giving SYFRA management until 4 pm on January 18 to withdraw their threat to sack firefighters who refuse to sign the new contracts .
When SYFRA maintained their threat against the 744 strong workforce , the FBU was forced to announce a further eight days of stoppages .
The first stoppage is due to begin on Sunday January 24 at 9 am , and finish at 9 am on January 25 .
In the meantime , without an agreement the eight day strikes will run from 9 am January 27 until 9 pm February 4 .
Rank and file firefighters understand that if they accept the new shift patterns , this will be followed by more fundamental cuts and changes .
Nationally the Labour government is imposing large budget cuts on the Fire and Rescue Service and South Yorkshire will have to impose its share .
The planned £ 200 million in cuts come on top of similar savings made between 2004 and 2008 and will guarantee job cuts .
In November last year , the FBU leadership stitched up a hasty deal with the SYFRA , the exact terms of which were not made public .
With just a couple of hours to go before South Yorkshire firefighters were due to walk out on strike , the leadership suspended the action , then abandoned it altogether when they claimed they had an agreement with the SYFRA .
At the time the FBU leadership said that a long term deal over changes in shift hours could be agreed .
The FBU offered a change from four consecutive 12 hour shifts to two 10 - hour days , followed by two 14 - hour night time shifts .
This was accepted by management .
With a national postal workers strike underway , and South Yorkshire bus drivers and others locally also on strike , the FBU was anxious to prevent its members making common cause with other sections .
Now , with the workforce having rejected the proposed deal , the previous ballot in favour of action remains “ live ” and no further ballot is required .
However , anti-union laws dictate the FBU must still give seven days notice to take strike action .
The dispute has now been running for 18 months and firefighters have previously walked out seven times , enraging management .
Mark Smitherman , the chief fire officer in South Yorkshire , threatened firefighters .
“ Considering all the job losses and pay cuts being implemented elsewhere across South Yorkshire and the UK , I would urge the FBU to get into the real world , ” he declared .
The SYFRA has already sacked one firefighter who allegedly made abusive comments about strike breakers on a social networking website .
The as yet unnamed worker was fired for gross misconduct for breaching the SYFRA Social Media Policy .
“ There has been a firefighter fired because of the comments he has made on Facebook , ” the FBU ’s Graham Wilkinson told the local press .
“ He thought it was a private conversation between him and friends .
He made the comments using his mobile phone and thought his privacy was set to friends only .
Somebody has printed it off the computer and showed it to management and they ’ve decided to discipline him over it .
We see this as management harassing and intimidating firefighters purely because of the strike action . ”
Six other firefighters also face disciplinary action for comments made on the Facebook website .
The critical issue remains the building of a socialist political strategy .
Unless workers organise their strike independently and break from the FBU ’s stranglehold , the union will once again come to a settlement detrimental to its members .
The FBU leadership has repeatedly stated that it is not in principle opposed to cuts in the fire service , only to those which are not “ cost effective ” .
Amid outrage in the country over the brutalisation and gangrape of a young woman in Uttar Pradesh 's Hathras , another similar case has been reported from the state .
A little more than 500 km from Hathras , a 22 - year - old Dalit woman died after gang - rape and severe beating last evening , when the attention of the country was focused on the events in Delhi as the police tried to take away the Hathras woman 's body from Safdarjung hospital .
This morning , Media Matters called attention to a questionable graphic from last Friday ’s Fox & Friends , and several media sites latched on to what appeared to be an error .
However , the network sees it another way .
TVNewser simply added up numbers in their headline : “ 59 % + 35 % + 26 % = 120 % ” while Huffington Post noted “ Fox News ’ Fuzzy Math . ”
And later , Media Matters sent an open letter to Fox News senior vice president Michael Clemente , who had recently put Fox staffers on notice after a few mistakes that there was now a policy of “ zero tolerance for on - screen errors . ”
“ The erroneous percentages Fox & Friends showed in its graphic added up to 120 percent ( even without the 15 percent who responded that they were n’t sure ) . , ” wrote Ari Rabin - Havt , Media Matters ’ vice president of communications and research .
“ More importantly , Fox News ' presentation of the data made it seem as though 94 percent of Americans think it's at least " somewhat likely " that climate scientists falsify their research data . ”
Here 's the breakdown : Fox 's " somewhat likely " number of 59 percent in the graphic includes the Rasmussen categories of " somewhat likely " ( 24 ) and " very likely ' ( 35 ) .
But then the " very likely " category gets a spot of its own underneath .
So its understandable why a viewer would look at the numbers stacked up like this on - screen and assume that " 94 percent of American 's think it 's at least ' somewhat likely ' that climate scientists falsify their research data . "
But Lauren Petterson , executive producer of Fox & Friends , told POLITICO that she sees no error in the graphic .
And for that reason , there will be no reprimand of staff under the “ zero tolerance " policy .
“ We were just talking about three interesting pieces of information from Rasmussen , ” Petterson said .
“ We did n’t put on the screen that it added up to 100 percent . ”
Indeed , here ’s the paragraph from Rasmussen ’s article that Fox was referring to with the graphic :
Fifty - nine percent ( 59 % ) of Americans say it ’s at least somewhat likely that some scientists have falsified research data to support their own theories and beliefs about global warming .
Thirty - five percent ( 35 % ) say it ’s Very Likely .
Just 26 % say it ’s not very or not at all likely that some scientists falsified data .
While Petterson maintains that Fox & Friends did n’t err in displaying the information from Rasmussen , she acknowledges that the presentation was n't perfect .
“ The mistake I do see is we could have been a little clearer here , ” she said .
UPDATE : Media Matters ' Rabin - Havt responds to POLITICO :
" Lauren Petterson clearly did not watch the segment in question .
Host Steve Doocy agreed with Media Matters ’ interpretation seeing as he attempted to add up these numbers as they appeared on air and said “ so you get 90 – you got a lot of people . ”
On Fox News , percentages do n't add up to 100 and , apparently , " zero tolerance " means unless we get caught . "
Looking back at the clip via TVEyes , Doocy did mention the number 90 , which was followed by some joking about whether the number could move closer to 100 percent .

New York ( CNN ) -- Danny DeVito is n't shy about showing his feet to the world .
The actor / director has made a hobby of snapping pictures of his " Troll Foot " and tweeting them .
Or , for anyone who is not well versed in Twitter :
He posts the foot photos online for all to see .
" Troll Foot , " or " TF " as it is known , is becoming a catalyst to catalogue DeVito 's journeys , and it 's clearly an enjoyable endeavor for the funnyman .
There are pictures of his " Troll Foot " being licked by a kitten , traveling through Italy , in the Empire State Building 's shadow , and -- in one shot -- even draped in a slice of prosciutto .
Does DeVito ever get pedicures ?
" No , I never get pedicures , " he replied , tweeting his latest foot shot taken on Anderson Cooper 's desk .
Troll Foot , said DeVito , " was born out of an impulse for me to have a secret identity .
That impulse lasted a second .
Obvious history . "
But TF is making history , one small step at a time , because millions of DeVito fans are also enamored by his foot .
No doubt that fan base began a long time ago when DeVito started acting .
He may be best known for his memorable portrayal of Louie De Palma , the caged dispatcher on the network television series " Taxi . "
He 's also starred in the films " Romancing the Stone , " " Ruthless People " ( in which he delivered a particularly hilarious line to a wrong number ) and " Batman Returns . "
DeVito and his wife , actress Rhea Perlman , can also take credit for " Pulp Fiction " and " Garden State , " which came out of their production company Jersey Films .
Along with publicly playing footsie , DeVito has also been playing Frank Reynolds on the FX network program " It 's Always Sunny In Philadelphia " since 2006 .
( The casts of " Sunny " and the Fox show " Family Guy " recently teamed up for a benefit to raise money for Haiti . )
DeVito 's proud of " Sunny's " outrageous comedy , and his role in it .
" If you look at the Christmas DVD of ' It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia ' ... I 'm naked in that show , " DeVito proudly shared .
" Where do you get that , that ... " he 's asked , haltingly .
" Abandon ? " DeVito offered .
It 's all about comfort , he said .
" You have to be secure with yourself . "
Which is why Troll Foot , and the man it belongs to , is n't done leaving an imprint .
One day after a sheriff 's detention officer reported to sheriff 's custody to serve a disputed sentence , nearly 20 of his colleagues called in sick for work at the Maricopa County Superior Court buildings in downtown Phoenix .
The courts were further unsettled when someone called in a bomb threat targeting public defenders Wednesday morning that led to the evacuations of the buildings for about three hours .
The absent deputies and detention officers disrupted hearings for hundreds of inmates who did n't make it to court , and the evacuation effectively scratched much of the morning calendar .
Neither the bomb threat nor the high absentee rate among sheriff 's personnel were related to Superior Court Judge Gary Donahoe 's order to lock up Officer Adam Stoddard for removing documents from a public defender 's file during a court hearing , according to Sheriff Joe Arpaio , deputies and detention officers .
Arpaio said he encourages sick employees to stay home .
But the anger toward Donahoe was palpable throughout the day , with Arpaio 's troops citing the sheriff 's ongoing disputes with court officials as the cause of Stoddard 's problems .
" I do have a political prisoner in jail who happens to be my detention officer , " Arpaio said .
At least one deputy , Sean Pearce , a representative from the Deputies Law Enforcement Association , thought the high number of absences Wednesday showed how sheriff 's personnel felt about Stoddard 's situation .
" I think it sends out a message that this officer has integrity . . .
Why should he apologize for doing his job ? "
Pearce asked .
There are typically 120 to 144 deputies and detention officers working in the courts , said Deputy Chief Dave Trombi .
The busiest times are in the morning , and Wednesday morning 's absences raised enough of a red flag to scramble additional resources , he said , adding that the average number of absences varies .
Criminal Court Administrator Bob James said that 140 defendants and one in -custody witness were not delivered to court because of the sick calls .
Many will spend another day in jail at a cost of $ 73 per inmate .
James also expressed concern for the jurors , who cost the court an average of $ 25 per day , witnesses and victims who had come to attend the hearings .
" Sentencing provides closure for everyone , and most importantly for victims , " he said .
But to many Sheriff 's Office employees , Stoddard is the victim .
Last month , Donahoe found Stoddard in contempt of court for taking documents from a public defender 's file during an October sentencing hearing and gave Stoddard an ultimatum :
Make a public apology by Monday or report to custody on Tuesday .
Stoddard said Monday he could n't apologize because he was n't in the wrong when he seized the documents , written by an inmate with the words " going to " " steal " and " money " grouped together .
A group of more than 150 detention officers and deputies held a news conference Wednesday to support Stoddard and show their displeasure with Donahoe .
" Officer Stoddard was in the courtroom doing his job , " Officer Luis Altamirano said .
" For doing his job he was being ordered to publicly humiliate himself and say things he did not believe . "
The officers were acting on their own volition and on free time or off days from work , according to a sheriff 's spokesman .
None of the assembled men and women said they had called in sick .
Tom Liddy , the attorney appointed as Stoddard 's defense by the County Attorney 's Office , said Stoddard had spent the night in jail , though he was not officially booked into custody because of a paperwork mix -up .
Liddy said Stoddard 's case had implications for other officers .
" Everybody 's going to be hesitant to act on security concerns , " he said .
Donahoe 's order requires that Stoddard stay in custody until he 's purged himself of his contempt .
Liddy said he plans to appeal .
As for what Thursday could hold , Trombi said he was prepared for anything .
" I do n't know what to expect ( Thursday ) , " he said .
" Because we certainly did n't expect this today . "

In a cozy booth at Mobile World Congress we found Rod Ullens , Co-founder and CEO of Voxbone , a VoIP carrier providing a centralized access to local phone numbers and toll - free numbers around the world .
Headquartered in Brussels , Belgium , they run a VoIP backbone distributed around multiple POP ’s with three aggregation superPOP ’s in Belgium , New York and Hong Kong .
The company provides local and toll - free numbers from 48 countries and more than 4,000 cities to carriers , ITSPs and call - centers worldwide .
Calls are collected locally and forwarded over IP to the customer ’s equipment .
Ordering , provisioning and configuration are done in realtime using a web - portal or a free API .
Local number portability is supported in 15 countries .
Watch the interview with Rod to find out what are the competitive advantages of Voxbone ’s innovative VoIP solutions .
In fact , you have to use the Phone app in portrait -- there are n't any apps in the device 's standard load that support automatic orientation .
Your personal take on the N900's look and feel depends almost entirely on how you approach it .
As a phone , it can only be described as beastly -- but as a dedicated internet device , it 's one of the smaller , sexier , and more practical devices in this tweener category to come to market .
Physically , anyone coming from an N810 will immediately notice what Nokia has done here -- they 've essentially traded height and width for thickness , probably a fair swap now that the latest model has made the leap from a pure MID to a smartphone with MID tendencies .
After all , as a phone , it has to fit in your pocket without much drama , and shaving over 17 mm off the width and 12 mm off the height certainly helps Nokia meet that goal .
That said , it really can't be overstated : the N900 is thick -- thick enough to put a bulge in even the loosest pocket .
Carrying it around reminded us of toting our trusty N95 back in the day , and a quick lookup confirmed that they 're nearly the same thickness -- the N95's actually a couple millimeters beefier , believe it or not -- so if you 're used to carrying something of that girth , it could actually be a pretty smooth transition .
On the other hand , owners of most modern WinMo devices , iPhones , and even Nokia 's own 5800 and N97 will have more of an adjustment period .
For better or worse , the N900 carries over some very uniquely Nokia - esque elements , notably the spring - loaded slider for toggling standby mode and the power button mounted dead center along the top edge .
They 're complemented by a volume rocker , 3.5 m m headphone jack ( doubling as a TV - out ) , two - stage camera button , and micro-USB port along the sides .
Oh , and of course , there 's a stylus tucked in the corner for actuating the resistive display .
It 's decent -- you wo n't find any metal bits or mind - blowing design here ( HTC typically does a better job with that ) , but more importantly , it 's long and comfortable enough to nearly resemble a standard writing utensil .
You 'll notice in the last paragraph that we refer to the right edge of the N900 as the " top " edge .
That 's because the device is very much landscape - oriented -- a throwback to its Internet Tablet roots and the evolution of Maemo , which predates today 's trend toward full - touch handsets that are fully functional and equally usable in any orientation .
We 'll talk about this a bit more in the software section , but for now , bear in mind that the controls are generally placed in a way that favors landscape use .
Tearing off the back gets at another Nokia quirk -- you really do have to tear it off , like so many Nokias before this .
It does n't slide at all , you just dig your fingernail in there , pull , and hope for the best .
That 's fine , we suppose -- generally speaking we 're uncomfortable about doing anything to our gadgets that involves tearing at a fastened cover , but as long as it's designed to do that and it does n't break , we 're cool .
Underneath you 've got direct access to the microSD slot , meaning that you can technically access it without pulling the battery .
Speaking of the battery , it 's a BL - 5J , the same 1320 mAh unit employed on the 5230 , 5800 , and X6 .
Underneath you 'll find the SIM tray , and those three nooks and crannies are about the only reasons you 've got to be in this area of the device .
Going back to the resistive display : all things considered , it 's not bad at all .
It 's certainly not the brightest we 've seen , but we found it bright enough to use in every situation we threw at it .
Interestingly , we never really noticed the phone 's ambient light sensor working , but maybe that 's the best - case scenario for an automatic brightness adjustment mechanism -- you should never have to think about it or let it disrupt you as you use the device , as long as the screen 's bright enough to read without getting blown out in dark environments .
In our earlier preview of a pre-production N900 , we had issues with sensitivity that we did n't seem to have here -- in all likelihood , we owe that more to the fact that we 've simply re-learned how to properly use a resistive display than any material change in the final retail unit 's screen .
Put simply , you 'll be fine here as long as you remember to stick to your fingernail and the stylus ; Maemo 5's UI elements are more or less exclusively large enough to be finger - friendly , and we found the experience a good deal more satisfying than what you get with S60 5th Edition .
Unless we 're using a drawing app , we 'd almost always prefer being able to reliably use our fingertip to a fingernail -- capacitive still wins for ease of use -- but Nokia seems to have done the best it could here .
Sliding the N900 open reveals a full QWERTY keyboard comprising three rows of well - domed keys .
Unfortunately , we 've seen countless better mobile keyboard designs -- we really do n't have a good explanation for why Nokia did it this way .
The first problem is that the N900 only slides about 40 percent of the way open , a far cry from something like the Touch Pro2 which ends up closer to 75 or 80 percent exposed in the fully locked , tilted position .
That explains , in part , why they 've only gone with three rows here when four gives you considerably more layout flexibility .
The next issue is that the space bar is pushed all the way over to the right side , making the learning curve unnecessarily steep ; the N97 and N97 Mini are both configured the same way , so we suppose Espoo has no intention of addressing this in the short term for whatever reason .
For most of our time with the phone , we found ourselves typing " M " when we meant to type a space ; do n't get us wrong , we 're certain you can get used to it , but the question is why should you have to ?
We were n't terribly happy with the slider mechanism itself , either ; it felt beefy enough and it'll probably survive through a typical user 's abuse , but it did n't have the smooth , gliding , beautifully spring - loaded response -- nor the satisfying " click " -- that you feel on many higher - end portrait QWERTY sliders these days , including Nokia 's own N97 .
How about battery life ?
1320 mAh is n't too shabby for a device of the N900's specs , but we came away with mixed results .
Moderate data and light voice use while connected to both WiFi and T - Mobile 3G consistently yielded a solid day ( as in a full 24 hours ) for us in the States , and we were thinking that a heavy user would n't have much issue making it through a day -- but a second review unit connected to T - Mobile Netherlands was consistently managing about 13 hours with middling use .
Of course , the N900 charges off a standard micro USB port and BL - 5Js are relatively easy to find , so you 've got options if you need extra juice midway through the day .
Hardware aside , it 's really the N900's platform -- Maemo 5 -- that has people buzzing .
There are plenty of reasons to believe that what we 're looking at here is a very early incarnation of what will some day be Nokia 's premier smartphone operating system ( regardless of whether Symbian soldiers on in emerging markets and the lower end of the mainstream ) , so it behooves us all to pay close attention as this thing evolves both in Nokia 's labs and in the open source community where Maemo was born and raised .
The first thing , and perhaps the most prominent thing , that a user sees regardless of device or operating system is the home screen .
Coming from S60 5th Edition 's restrictive grid - based widget placement , you might expect some limitations on the N900 -- but you 'd be wrong .
In fact , the N900 has one of the most extensible , customizable home screens of any mobile device we 've ever used ; you can drop widgets , bookmarks , and contacts exactly where you want them right down to the pixel , and you 've got a total of four panels that loop around as you swipe ( unlike Android , which stops in either direction ) .
The system works well and does a great job of maximizing the handset 's available screen real estate .
Tapping the icon in the upper left takes you to the main menu ( more on that in a moment ) or , if you 've got any apps minimized , a display that Nokia calls the " dashboard . "
Basically , it 's yet another interpretation of the so - called " card interface " popularized by webOS , and it works well here -- you see miniaturized views of all your open applications in one place .
Minimized applications smoothly glide into the grid of cards , and tapped cards smoothly glide open to full screen again -- a testament to the power of the N900's hardware , we suspect .
Beyond the home screen , system notifications are a pretty hot topic , too , considering how well Android and webOS handle them and how poorly the iPhone does by comparison .
Fortunately , Maemo 5 does a pretty great job here .
New text messages , emails , and the like are briefly displayed as a yellow bubble in the upper left of the display ; tapping it will take you right to the source of the notification ( the new SMS , for example ) .
If you let it go , though , the notification will persist as a " card " within the N900's multitasking dashboard , taking up the same space that a normal application would .
You might think this would be confusing , but it 's not for a very simple reason -- notifications appear as bright yellow squares , the same color as when they first appeared .
So unless you 've got an app minimized here with an entirely yellow background , you wo n't have any confusion .
If nothing else , Maemo 5 is pretty -- Nokia 's prettiest platform ever , in fact , by a wide margin .
We 're sure that 's due in no small part to the fact that the N900 is the first in the company 's Internet Tablet line to employ a modern ARM Cortex A8 - based core , making screen transitions and effects fast enough to accomplish their intended function : beautify the UI without sapping away precious seconds of the user 's time .
Out - of - focus screen elements are actually visually out of focus , which looks great ( photographers , think " nice bokeh " here ) and applications zoom and fade as you open , close , and minimize them .
" Pretty " does n't cut it , though -- at least , not without a healthy dose of usability and functionality to go along with it , and in this regard , the N900 is much , much more raw .
Indeed , Nokia has been surprisingly ( and wisely ) forthcoming about the fact that this is not a smartphone for the masses ; it 's for tweakers , hackers , geeks , nerds , and people who want as much control on their handheld device as possible -- and are n't afraid to get their hands dirty in the process .
In fact , we'd go so far as to say that the N900 is a proof of concept -- a reference platform for Maemo that just happens to be sold in stores .
Evidence of the N900's geeky aspirations are strewn about the platform from the X Terminal icon preloaded in the main menu , to the lack of an app store at launch ( more on this shortly ) , to the fact that you need to connect the handset to a PC and run shell commands just to perform a hard reset .
You 've got UI quirkiness to contend with , too .
Maemo 5 dispenses of the left - anchored taskbar present in every version of Maemo before it , and even the status bar in the upper left ( where you see time , signal strength , and so on ) has a tendency to disappear rather frequently , leaving you without any bearing or sense of how to navigate between apps or elements of the platform .
This is most clearly evident in the main menu , where you 're presented with nothing but a full page of icons -- and it's not like the N900 has a front - mounted home or back button , so to a novice user , it 's anyone 's guess how to back out to the home screen or move to another app that 's already running .
As it turns out , the answer generally is to find a blank out - of - focus area and tap on it to go back one screen , but depending on the screen you 're in , that occasionally leaves you hunting for a free area on which to tap .
[ You can also tap along the edge of the screen -- even if the home screen icon is n't visible -- and get back .
- Ed. ]
Worst case , you can hit the power button up top to call up the profile menu , which will bump you out to the home screen underneath -- but it 's not elegant by any stretch .
Speaking of UI quirkiness , this gets back to something we touched on earlier -- the N900's almost exclusive reliance on landscape mode .
We get the argument that the 770 , N800 , and N810 did n't have portrait mode at all , but times have changed -- people walk and surf at the same time these days ( particularly with devices like the N900 that have WWAN radios on board ) and it's a lot more convenient if you can do that one - handed .
Portrait mode , of course , lends itself to one - handed use .
If you lump this in with Maemo 5's general usability roughness , you get the sense that the platform was rushed just a bit -- Nokia took it to 90 percent and said , " hey , this is open source , let 's let the community fill in the blanks . "
We 're guessing there are plenty of buyers that are delighted with that policy , but again , these are the kinds of things that keep Nokia from having a platinum best seller on its hands .
Long term , it 'll be interesting to see how close Maemo 6 comes to closing that gap and making the platform accessible to consumers at large .
About the only places the N900 officially supports portrait mode at this point are the Phone and Photos apps ; you can hack it into the browser right now and we suspect the rest of the platform will get there soon enough , but we digress .
[ Turns out you can , you just need the keyboard open !
- Ed. ]
It 's a little weird , but we 're thankful in at least one regard : the phone is the one piece of software here that absolutely , positively must be ready to use in portrait , particularly considering that the earpiece is at one end .
As a phone , the N900's pretty basic -- again , Nokia considers this a MID with a phone bolted on , not the other way around -- but you get a finger - friendly keypad and full contact integration , which works swimmingly when paired with something like Google Sync ( it totally works in the latest N900 firmware , by the way ) .
There is one key area where the N900's phone excels , though : Skype support .
In fact , this is about the best Skype experience we 've ever had on a mobile phone -- you add your account through the N900's control panel , which then keeps you connected and ready to take and place VoIP calls just as you would a GSM call .
It 's truly seamless and worked extraordinarily well .
In fact , there was a point when we were on a GSM call and a Skype call came through on call waiting , which we could switch to and place the original caller on hold -- had we not known the caller was on Skype ahead of time , we would n't have been able to tell .
Likewise , you can natively add contacts '
Skype IDs in the address book .
Ironically , the whole integration makes the N900 the closest the Internet Tablet series has ever been to not needing a GSM radio -- and yet it 's the first to have one .
The N900 includes a Maemo build of Ovi Maps , a staple for most Nokia handsets sold today .
Coming from Google Maps on Android and iPhone , Ovi Maps leaves a lot to be desired here .
First up -- and this is n't Ovi Maps ' fault , specifically -- we had an awful time with AGPS , which was totally unable to get even a rough lock without GPS line of sight .
At this point , we 're used to living in the world of instant location mapping that Google has brought to every platform that Google Maps has touched , and we really miss it here -- waiting for a satellite constellation is so 2005 .
As for the app itself , it 's on par with something you might expect a couple years ago ; it can map routes ( and the latest firmware is supposed to speed that process substantially ) , but you do n't have turn - by - turn navigation or cool add - ons like street view out of the box .
Finally , map scrolling is one activity that 's made measurably easier on a capacitive screen -- preferably with multitouch -- so no amount of user hacking or third - party development is going to fix that particular issue .
On the plus side , the map renders quite quickly as you scroll ( everything we tested on the N900 moved with hustle , really ) and we appreciated the app's shortcuts for bouncing between common zoom levels ( country , city , and so on ) .
Speaking of Ovi , how about the Ovi Store ?
We just had a little bit of time to play with the live beta of Nokia 's Maemo port of the Store which went live shortly before this review , and at this point , it 's a little undercooked ( hence the " beta " label , we suppose ) .
The most glaring deficiency is in the usability of the UI ; rather than make an actual Ovi Store app , Nokia has elected to simply point users to a mobile - optimized portal in the browser , which ultimately leads to more scrolling and tapping than you 'd like .
That 's not the end of the world , though ; the bigger problem in the short term is the availability of actual ... you know , apps .
We searched for a few common phrases ( " IRC , " for example ) and were met with zero results ; in all , the store has fewer than 100 assets as of press time , and many of those are images , videos , and themes rather than actual applications .
Over the years , Internet Tablet users have grown accustomed to getting their free , open wares over both official and unofficial repositories , and injecting the Ovi Store 's layer of commercialism in there is a new step that might not gel at first with folks upgrading from N800s and N810s -- that said , it 's an absolutely vital step to taking Maemo mainstream , so we hope Nokia finds some creative ways to attract more high - profile devs to the platform .
Now , finally , let 's talk about this handset 's real treat , its crown jewel : the glorious browser .
The Internet Tablet line has used a fairly capable Mozilla - based browser for ages , but between the latest tweaked code and the N900's thoroughly freshened internals , it 's gone to an entirely new level .
Almost without fail , sites were rendered faithfully ( just as you 'd expect them to look in Firefox on your desktop ) with fully - functional , usable Flash embeds -- and it 's fast .
Not only is the initial rendering fast , but scrolling around complex pages ( Engadget 's always a good example ) was effortless ; you see the typical grid pattern when you first scroll into a new area , of course , but it fills in with the correct content rapidly .
To say we were blown away by the N900's raw browsing power would be an understatement -- in fact , we could realistically see carrying it in addition to another phone for browsing alone , because even in areas where it gives a little ground to the iPhone or Pre in usability , it smacks everyone down in raw power and compatibility .
In our line of work where 24 / 7 access to the web is of paramount importance , having the N900 in our pocket when we were away from our laptop was a comforting insurance policy .
As with Ovi Maps , the one complaint we 'd lodge here is that capacitive multitouch would 've been a huge win , but we adopted to the resistive setup without too much drama -- and the inclusion of a creative " swirl to zoom " gesture certainly mitigates the problem .
Just do n't lose the stylus !
We came into this review wanting to know as much about Maemo as a platform as we did about the N900 itself ; after all , the N900's just a single phone that 'll be dead and forgotten from store shelves within a year .
That 's just reality , the hustle - and - bustle pace of the modern handset release cycle .
Maemo , however , will live on -- but in what capacity ?
Where does it fit ( or could it fit ) in Nokia 's grand plan ?
After having dug in , we 're seeing glimmers of brilliance here that give us hope .
Maemo 5 is n't the polished , consumer - friendly , all - encompassing solution that Palm , Google , and Apple are all selling today , but it 's fairly evident that Nokia has built itself a stable , extensible platform that can reach those levels with a little tender loving care .
The company 's commitment to open source and the Maemo development community is commendable -- it 's something that should absolutely continue -- but going forward , we 'd love to see what kinds of magical things could happen if it took development to 100 percent feature completion internally with a full round of usability testing before handing it off to the eager geeks in the field .
The mere thought sends shivers down our spine .
That said , for now , Maemo officially remains an experiment ; there 's no greater evidence of that than the N900's half - bakedness .
And hey , calling the N900 half - baked seriously is n't a knock in this case -- it 's just a realistic admission of where Maemo stands today .
As it has with its predecessors , Nokia seems totally comfortable with that assessment , throwing this loosely - assembled box of high - power hardware and software at anyone who dares live on the bleeding mobile edge .
The company continues to insist that Symbian has a huge place in its line and will continue to do so , but long - term , we see nothing about Maemo that leads us to believe it could n't be Nokia 's single platform of the future .
Even if it takes high - end hardware to run effectively , you can't deny that today 's high - end is inevitably tomorrow 's low - end .
Everything gets cheaper , and Maemo itself -- by its very nature -- is free for Nokia to distribute .
Let 's turn our attention back to the N900 , though , since it 's the only Maemo 5 - powered device available today .
Is it a keeper ?
As a daily workhorse smartphone for your average Jill or Joe , it 's impossible to recommend the N900 at this point ; it 's just missing too much functionality that 's waiting to be written by some enterprising CS grad students with spare time on their hands .
As a second , dedicated browsing device or a geeky weekend hobby , though -- possibly an upgrade from an N810 -- the N900 is a very compelling device indeed , as long as you remember one simple rule : it 's a computer with a phone , not a phone that can compute .

WASHINGTON , Dec 2 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday that he was placing a hold on Ben Bernanke ’s nomination for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman , a move that could slow the confirmation process .
If the hold is not withdrawn , the move by Sanders , an independent from Vermont , means that Senate leaders will not be able to bring up the nomination for a vote by unanimous consent .
Instead , they may need to garner 60 votes in order to consider the nomination .

( CNN ) -- Crews removed about 46,000 gallons of oil from waters near Port Arthur , Texas , on Sunday , roughly 10 percent of the oil spilled a day earlier when a tanker collided with two barges , a U.S. Coast Guard officer said .
An estimated 462,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from barrels aboard the tanker , forcing the closure of the port in southern Texas , Petty Officer Larry Chambers told CNN .
The Sabine Neches Waterway near Port Arthur also was closed .
It was unclear Sunday when the port , about 100 miles east of Houston , Texas , will reopen or when crews will finish the cleanup , he said .
" We certainly want it to be done as soon as possible , but with that said , safety is the main issue , " Chambers said .
" We 're not going to open the port until it 's determined that vessels can pass through cleanly , safely and not cause any further damage . "
No injuries were reported when the Exxon Mobile - chartered tanker -- the 807 - foot Eagle Otome -- collided Saturday with two barges being towed by a tug boat .
The tanker was carrying about 570,000 gallons of crude oil to Exxon 's Beaumont refinery when it crashed , Exxon Mobile spokesman Kevin Allexon told CNN .
The cause of the crash was unknown , but is under investigation , he said .
" We are very concerned about how this could have happened , " Allexon said .
" We are very concerned about the impact to the environment , to the community .
No one wants to see this happen . "
The port is primarily for industrial use , but it is not far from wetlands .
None of the nearby marshes or sensitive wildlife were adversely affected , Chambers said , but one heron was " oiled . "
The bird was alive and undergoing treatment , he said .
An evacuation order that was imposed in a 50 - block area around the port after the collision was lifted .
That area was evacuated Saturday out of caution , as the tanker was carrying a type of oil containing sulfide .
Fifteen skimming vessels sailed the area recovering the oil and workers dropped more than 45,000 feet of boom -- fencing - like material -- to keep the oil from spreading , Chambers said .
More than 500 people were involved in containing and cleaning the spill , said Darrell Wilson , spokesman for Malaysia - based AET Tanker Holdings , the owner of the tanker .
The biggest oil spill in U.S. history occurred in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef in the Gulf of Alaska , resulting in the spill of 11 million gallons of crude .

Canada 's privacy commissioner is launching a series of public consultations to investigate online data collection through social networking and consumer profiling .
Jennifer Stoddart will examine the privacy risks associated with the online tracking , profiling and targeting of consumers in the lead - up to a review of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act .
Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart , seen here on Nov. 17 , will investigate online data collection through social networking and consumer profiling .
(( Sean Kilpatrick / Canadian Press ) )
Canadians are among the world 's most prolific Internet and social networking users and Stoddart 's office says there 's concern that personal information is being abused .
Pros versus cons
Advocates for the collection of user data say it leads to fun innovations in social media and a more personalized experience for users .
Some argue the user data would also improve the relevancy of advertising , which could foster free ad - driven Internet services .
But critics fear consumers are unknowingly revealing dangerous amounts of personal data when they use social networking sites .
Written submissions for the consultation are being accepted until March 15 , while public discussion panels are being organized in Toronto in April and Montreal in May .
A future consultation will also examine the privacy implications of " cloud computing , " which stores users ' data online rather than on personal computers .
Examples include Google 's popular Gmail service and its suite of Google Docs applications , including a word processor and spreadsheet maker , which work entirely online .
Stoddart released a report last July outlining privacy issues with Facebook and some were eventually addressed by the popular website .

Today 's episode of Boing Boing Video features rare and historic film from Mardi Gras in New Orleans , Louisiana , from 1956 .
Artist Mar Dore stumbled on a box of slides in her family 's home in Texas a few years back , and inside , discovered photographs that her father , John Mizenko , took of the parades back in the era of " Mad Men . "
That box of slides was like a time capsule , Mar says , and opened a door into history — the history of New Orleans , and of her own family .
I 've blogged one of his photographs here on Boing Boing before ( you can buy prints now ) , but in today 's Boing Boing Video , we explore the personal story behind them , and we travel back in time through " found " video footage of that same parade .
Below and after the jump , Mar ( who , it should be noted , is a member of my family ) shares the story behind this video :
My father was born in the small town of Covington , Louisiana in 1921 .
He was a chemical engineer , inventor and builder , and an amateur radio operator .
He worked for major oil companies and we had to move around a lot .
He shot the photos you see in this video in 1956 on February 12th and on Mardi Gras Day , February 14th , on the Mid-City route and on Canal Street in front of Miller - Wohls Department Store , which is no longer there .
A lot of the New Orleans you see in this video is no longer there .
The film was shot close to where my father was taking photos .
I keep looking for his face in the crowds .
He discovered that he had lymphoma cancer in 1990 .
His work as an engineer at oil companies had exposed him to toxic chemicals for decades , chemicals that caused cancer .
It claimed his life in 1991 .
These photographs celebrate his memory , and even though I 've not yet found his face in those crowds , the photographs themselves illustrate the joy he took in capturing the spirit of Mardi Gras and its wonderful celebration of life .
Mar runs an art gallery called Galleria Mar Dore , and she is selling large - format , archival quality prints of these photos .
View a gallery of these photos here .
And more about the photographer here .
Scans of the original hand - drawn sketches for the costumes you see on the floats are here .
EA 's financial problems from last year , it seems , are continuing to have repercussions .
Even after cutting 1,500 employees in November , the publisher is still looking to reduce operating costs .
As a result , the company is killing off a number of game servers on three separate dates in the coming months .
February 2 will see the largest number of game servers shut down , followed by a few more on February 9 .
While many of these games are a few years old and on older systems ( such as FIFA 07 for PC ) , some of the games on the list are shockingly recent .
The most surprising shutdown revelation is Madden 09 on all platforms , which will occur on April 6 .
Of course , no plans have been announced to turn off servers for Madden 10 , but fans have got to be wondering if they 're only going to be able to play that game 's online mode for roughly a year before it , too , is shut down .
It makes sense to shut down many of these servers , since they cater to what are most likely a small number of gamers at a significant expense to EA .
However , the shutdown of servers for titles like Madden 09 and NASCAR 09 seems like a heavy - handed attempt to force players to pick up newer entries for these series .
It 's a shame that EA is having such problems that it is forced to such drastic measures , but it 's even more of a shame that the company is using such tactics on general consumers .
Here 's the full list of affected games :
April 6 , 2010 Online Service Shutdown
Madden 09 for PlayStation 2 , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation Portable , Wii and Xbox 360
February 9 , 2010 Online Service Shutdown

AGUA PRIETA , Sonora - A few blocks from the municipal police station , on the morning after a cartel gunfight took four more lives in Sonora , drug dealers cruise the streets of La Zona Roja with cellphones in their hands .
Addicts in a local treatment center say these " carros alegres , " or happy cars , bring crack cocaine to consumers with all the speed and reliability of a pizza delivery .
The happy cars are one more sign of Mexico 's growing drug - abuse problem and serve as a backdrop to the government 's decision in August to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of narcotics .
When the measure was adopted , President Felipe Calder�n and Mexico 's Congress said they wanted to concentrate law - enforcement efforts on the ruthless cartels that are blamed for an estimated 13,000 deaths since Calder�n declared a war on drugs in December 2006 .
Calder�n also said decriminalization of personal - use quantities would thwart corrupt Mexican cops who sometimes shake down drug users for bribes .
The measure incited controversy from Mexico City to Washington , D.C. Legalization advocates suggested that America 's closest neighbor and ally in the drug war had finally recognized the waste of filling prisons with non-violent addicts who need treatment rather than punishment .
Drug -enforcement hard - liners warned that eliminating criminal charges for drug abuse would lead to increased public consumption and addiction , perhaps even spawning narco - tourism by Americans looking to get high legally in Mexico .
That the happy cars still cruise about Agua Prieta suggests that critics and supporters overestimated the law 's possible effects , both on drug violence and the scourge of addiction .
The reform seems to have had more impact in the rhetorical war over drug decriminalization than it has on Mexican streets .
Rather than claiming victory , legalization advocates say the new law may even make things worse because of the way it 's written .
Conversely , anti-legalization groups condemn the measure because it appears to legitimize drug abuse .
Beneath the lofty debate , cops , treatment counselors , government officials , researchers and addicts interviewed last month said there have been no discernible changes related to the new law .
Police still arrest and incarcerate drug users .
Americans have not flocked to dope parlors south of the border .
Mexican narcotics abuse surges unabated , as does the flow of drugs and blood .
At the municipal police station in Agua Prieta , Jose Martin Lopez , commander of an anti-narcotics unit , said the enforcement business remains " exactly the same as it was before . "
" Nothing has changed , " agreed Alejandro Marin , assistant director of a drug treatment center in Nogales .
" If police see somebody using drugs , smoking a joint , they pick ' em up . "
Kenn Morris , president of a San Diego market research firm that represents the Tijuana tourism bureau , said there is no sign of Americans visiting the border town to use drugs legally .
As for the new law 's overall impact , he added : " It was a big yawn . "
Treatment centers
While public attention focuses on violence and corruption spawned by drug cartels , more damage is hidden away in a Nogales barrio , behind a locked gate with walls topped by barbed wire .
The treatment center is temporary home to 180 addicts , alcoholics and psychiatric cases .
Most express ignorance of Mexico's new measure , and many criticize the idea of decriminalization .
" If the law allows us to have a little bit of drugs , then we as addicts will only carry a little bit and a little bit , " says Juan Manuel Rodriguez Arroyo , a heroin junkie for 32 years who now serves as volunteer director of the Nogales shelter .
" It 's bad symbolically .
It says you can use and nothing will happen . "
Marin , a recovering user as well as administrator , leads visitors past men cooking supper in a cauldron over a wood fire to a windowless detox unit .
Several recent arrivals , wrapped in blankets , squint and groan as sunlight breaches the room 's darkness .
Next door , in an assembly hall , about three dozen guys take turns proclaiming that they are addicts .
A young man in a Denver Broncos jacket , using heavy street slang , orates about the pain he has brought to his family , the damage he has done to himself .
Along Sonora 's northern border zone , this is one among dozens of treatment facilities , a sanctuary for crackheads , tweakers , huffers , junkies and boozers .
Some residents were committed by police .
Some were brought by family members .
A few admitted themselves .
At the treatment center in Agua Prieta , a 13 - year - old boy , the only child among 84 adults , says he began sniffing inhalants three years ago , then got hooked on cocaine .
This is his third time in rehab .
Another cocaine addict , 22 - year - old Arturo Quijar Rodriquez , says his wife forced him into recovery because he was neglecting the family .
Rodriguez , a municipal police officer , says he is hoping to be back on day shifts soon , while still spending nights in the treatment center .
During a series of interviews at two Sonoran shelters , the stories of dozens of men seemed to blur into one .
All started using drugs with friends , wound up dealing or smuggling , spent time in prison .
Now , in rehab , they are unanimous in declaring that they want to stay clean .
" It 's just like the same movie over and over with a different actor , " says Francisco Cardenas , one of the clients .
Legal controversy
The federal decriminalization law , which took effect Aug. 21 , calls for suspects caught with small drug quantities to appear before a prosecutor , who must determine whether the possession was for personal use or trafficking .
Mexico 's government contends the statute merely codifies what already was a legal reality .
The limits include 5 grams for marijuana ( about three to six joints , depending on size ) and 500 milligrams of cocaine ( roughly five doses , or " lines " ) .
Those found to be users must be released with a referral to health authorities , though it 's unclear how many referrals are made or whether they work .
At the same time , the law gives Mexico 's state and local police more drug - fighting authority .
For instance , the measure empowers them to prosecute street drug dealers , a job previously limited to the federal government .
It also calls for a central operations center housing drug - enforcement units at all levels in each state .
And it toughens penalties - four to eight years in prison - for anyone caught selling even tiny amounts of narcotics .
Finally , the measure allows one year for Mexico 's state and local authorities to adopt corresponding personal - use laws and three years to implement them .
But nearly half a year into the new law , many legalization advocates view Mexico 's change more as a setback than a victory .
Ethan Nadelmann , executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance , a coalition that favors decriminalization , said most addicts buy drugs in quantities greater than allowed under the measure , so the law in reality would not even decriminalize most " personal use . "
" It 's not clear yet whether this is three steps forward or two steps forward and three steps backward , " he said .
John Walsh , a senior associate at the Washington Office of Latin America , a non-governmental organization that promotes social and economic justice , predicts that Mexico 's law will wind up putting more drug users in prison at greater public expense .
Because penalties increase for possessing drugs beyond the allowed amounts , he said , the measure also may worsen police corruption , giving officers greater leverage for extortion .
Those who favor rigid enforcement standards are just as critical of Mexico 's new standard but for opposite reasons .
" It 's a bad message to kids , " said Calvina Fay , executive director of Drug Free America Foundation , noting that there is even grass - roots opposition to legalization south of the border .
" This is not what moms and dads and grandmas ( in Mexico ) want for their children .
They recognize that drug use is harmful to families . "
Fay warns that any softening of enforcement will create safety hazards on highways and in workplaces .
She rejects the idea that allowing personal - use amounts will somehow reduce police bribery scams .
" Decriminalizing drugs is n't going to clean up their corruption , " she said .
" And I do n't think it will make one bit of difference as far as easing up the violence . "
The larger debate
Because of such philosophical differences , Mexico 's reform has emerged as a talking point in the renewed debate over the war on drugs .
Walsh recently co-wrote a report that says decriminalization is spreading through Latin America : Ecuador , Argentina , Brazil , Columbia and now Mexico all have had recent court decisions or legislation eliminating personal - use narcotics offenses .
Walsh said there is little statistical information so far on the impact of decriminalization in Latin America .
But in Portugal , where possession of drugs was decriminalized in 2001 , research shows improved government control of product safety and distribution , among other issues , without an increase in narcotics use - and without a surge in recreational - drug tourism from surrounding nations .
In the United States , meanwhile , debate has focused primarily on cannabis : Thirteen states already have adopted so - called medical marijuana laws .
( Arizona voters are expected to cast ballots on a proposition this fall . )
Fourteen states have reduced pot possession from a crime to the equivalent of a traffic ticket .
And in October , the Justice Department announced that it will no longer raid properly registered dispensaries of medical marijuana .
Legalization proponents contend these are signs of a nation and world recognizing that the strategy of arrest and imprisonment of drug users is fundamentally flawed .
They argue that legal regulation of narcotics would break cartel monopolies while reducing violence , corruption and prison overcrowding .
They also contend that the billions of dollars now spent on enforcement could be shifted to treatment and education .
Walter McKay , Mexico City director for Law Enforcement Agents Against Prohibition , said the war on drugs created a lucrative black market that perpetuates cartels and their mayhem .
" This is a bloody , costly war , " he said .
" It 's slowly moving toward anarchy . "
But in the Nogales rehab center , 55 - year - old Carlos Hernandez said a quarter - century of addiction to cocaine and heroin have convinced him that even tiny amounts of narcotics endanger society .
" Oh , yes , it should be illegal , " he said .
" It destroys lives . "
UPDATE AT BOTTOM : Fox News cut live feed of Obama debate half - way through ; GOP aides say allowing cameras was a ‘ mistake ’
A combative President Obama sparred back and forth with Republicans at a House GOP retreat in Baltimore Friday , telling House members they had backed themselves into a corner by painting his administration as being radical .
It was an unusual question - and - answer session that some observers have compared to Question Period in the British House of Commons , when the prime minister takes questions from opposition lawmakers .
And even some conservative commentators admit Obama won the debate and gave himself a much - needed image boost .
ADVERTISEMENT
Invited by the GOP to attend their annual conference , the president accepted but surprised Republicans with a request to allow cameras into the conference room , Politico reports .
The GOP agreed .
Weaving between pleas for bipartisanship and direct criticism of GOP politicking , the president took Republicans to task for voting against last year ’s stimulus package and then attending “ ribbon cuttings ” for projects funded by it .
“ A lot of you have gone to ribbon cuttings for the same projects that you voted against , ” Obama said .
“ I say all this not to re-litigate the past , but it ’s simply to state , the component parts of the recovery act are consistent with what many of you say are important things to do . ”
Obama touched repeatedly on the theme that , in opposing his policies , Republicans at times oppose things that are in line with their ideology .
Among those things , Obama argued , are his proposed fee on banks and a freeze on discretionary spending .
“ Join me ” in passing the spending freeze , Obama asked the GOP , adding there ’s “ nothing in this proposal that runs contrary to the ideological predisposition of this caucus . ”

On the proposed bank fee , designed to recoup some of the money the US government lost in bailing out the banks in 2008 , Obama told House Minority Leader John Boehner : “ If you listen to the American people , John , they ’ll tell you they want their money back . ”
And in very frank language , Obama warned the GOP they are painting themselves into a political corner by using strong rhetoric in opposing White House ideas .
“ If the way these issues are being presented by the Republicans is that this is some wild - eyed plot to impose huge government in every aspect of our lives , what happens is you guys do n’t have a lot of room to negotiate with me , ” the president said .
“ The fact is that many of you , if you voted with the administration on something , are politically vulnerable with your own base in your own party .
You ’ve given yourselves very little room to work in a bipartisan fashion because what you ’ve told your constituents is this guy is doing all kinds of crazy stuff that ’s gonna destroy America . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The president also chastised Republicans for presenting health care reform as “ some Bolshevik plot . ”
But he spent a considerable amount of time arguing for bipartisanship , and for his own credentials as an open - minded leader who can work across party lines .
“ I am not an ideologue , ” Obama said , adding , “ These are serious times and what ’s required of all us is to do what ’s right for our country even if it ’s not best for our politics . …
There may be better things than poll numbers . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Even some conservative commentators conceded that Obama won the day .
“ Obama did well , got the better of GOP today , ” the Weekly Standard ‘s Michael Goldfarb tweeted .
“ Fortunately , we got the better of him the last six months or so .
And health care is dead . ”
Daniel Foster at the National Review argued it made both sides look good .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It would be hard to argue the exchange is anything but a plus - plus for Obama and the GOP , ” he wrote .
“ Both sides emerged from it looking as if , contra the public ’s greatest fears , they are serious about the deficit and health - care reform . …
[ T ]he Republicans went a long way toward showing that they are hardly a party of obstructionists with no solutions to offer Americans . ”
UPDATE : Some commentators are pointing to the fact that Fox News cut off the live feed of Obama ’s debate half - way through as proof that the president got the better of the GOP on Friday .
“ Perhaps the most telling aspect of the speech reactions , ” writes David Weigel at the Washington Independent , is that “ Fox News , alone among cable networks , cut away mid-broadcast and went to a newsless interview with Rep. Peter King ( R - NY ) . ”
NBC ’s Luke Russert offered more evidence that at least the GOP views it as a loss for their side .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ GOP aides telling me it was a mistake to allow cameras into Obama ’s QA with GOP members , ” Russert tweeted Friday .
“ Allowed BO to refute GOP for 1.5 hours on TV . ”

If you 've suffered any problems accessing any of the sites , the databases , the CPAN mirror , etc from the CPAN Testers server last night , please direct your wrath at Microsoft .
Last night the msnbot took out the CPAN Testers server with a dedicated denial of service attack .
As a consequence measures are now being put in place to completely ban the msnbot from accessing at least the Reports site , and probably all the sites on the server .
Microsoft in their incompetent wisdom decided to unleash 20 - 30 bots every few seconds .
I know this because I can see the IP addresses in the logs .
The ones spotted within a few minutes of rebooting the server this morning to clear the processes were :
65.55.207.50

It seems their bots completely ignore the rules specified in the robots .
txt , despite me setting it up as per their own guidelines on their site , and worst of all they do n't talk to each other to see they are accessing the same domain .
Most sensible bots , such as those of Google or Majestic 12 , will only let one bot at a time crawl a site , as most sensible companies acknowledge that a DOS attack is not good policy .
As a consequence I 'll now be denying access to anything with the IP matching /^65\.55 \ .( 106|107|207 ) /.
If you discover you fall into that pattern , and are a real person , please let me know .
If anyone from Microsoft ends up reading this , though likely you 'll have to do it in person and not via a bot , I now consider you to be no better than a script kiddie trying to bring down a government computer .
DOS attacks usually get people charged and arrested .
If CPAN Testers was a legal entity , then I might have been able to follow this through .
Instead I 'm locking the doors , and no longer letting you through .

Only one percent of Americans can claim to be millionaires , yet 44 percent of members of Congress are millionaires according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
CRP argues that more transparency in financial disclosure requirements is needed .
Dave Levinthal , writing in CRP's Capital Eye Blog , noted , however , that the median wealth of congressional members fell 5 percent in 2008 when compared to 2007 .
CRP data indicate that currently serving U.S. senators have a reportable worth of $ 1.79 million for 2008 , down from $ 2.27 million in 2007 , and House members median income was $ 622,254 in 2008 , down from $ 724,258 in 2007 .
However , Levinthal stated :
But with 237 millionaires still serving in Congress , most of the nation 's leaders are doing fine compared to many of their constituents living paycheck by paycheck , if they 're earning a paycheck at all .
CRP 's research indicates that the " biggest financial losers " were Sens. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) and Mark Warner ( D - Va. ) .
Those with sharp upward spikes in reported wealth were Sens. Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) , Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) and Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) .
CRP compiled financial disclosure statements and public tax records for use in this study .
However , members of Congress are only required to report their wealth and liabilities in broad ranges .
They are not required to report assets like personal residences or , interestingly , the income from their elected offices .
Dan Auble , who manages CRP 's database of lawmakers ' personal financial information , was quoted as saying : Federal disclosure requirements do n't make it easy to determine the true extent of federal politicians ' personal holdings .
More transparency regarding congressional members ' personal assets helps lawmakers make decisions in the interests of their constituents and discourages them from attempting to benefit from legislative actions .
For example .
Levinthal was quoted in The richest Senate member is Herb Kohl ( D - Wis. ) and Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) is the richest House member .
When examined by assets owned in particular The Pharmaceuticals / Health products industry ranked eighth .
According to Sphere , when the federal government bailed out several U.S. banks in 2008 , " the second most commonly held stock among members of Congress was Bank of America , " the CRP study showed .
Other bank stocks commonly owned by members of Congress and receiving congressionally approved funds were Citi Group , Goldman Sachs , and Wells Fargo .

" The richest Senate member is Herb Kohl ( D - Wis. ) and Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) is the richest House member .

The coal - pit “ Podmoskovnaya ” is located in the Tula region and now it is the only coal - pit in the whole central region of Russia .
The pit has always been considered to be a very promising undertaking , but lately they have been refusing to use coal for power generation in the central region .
The degradation began in the 90s , but formerly only in the Tula region there worked more than 30 coal - pits and there were coal - pits in the Ryazan region , in the Tver region and in the Smolensk region .
The coal - pit construction began in 1967 , it was supposed to be one of the largest pits of Podmoskovny coal - basin .
In 1974 it was put into service .
Currently the enterprise has about 80 employees who work in four shifts .
Coal mining is being produced in low volumes and in view of a current coal transfer price all that is absolutely unprofitable for the pit .
The main means of transportation in the pit – a construction railroad with the gauge width 900 mm .
The pit refuse heap .
Its height is about 50 meters and the highest top of the mast is about 120 meters .
The general view of the pit .
Coal - mining industry is within a hair of death here .
In theory there are projects aimed to develop this field but still no real actions are undertaken .
Until the 90s more than 1800 employees were working in the pit .
The coal is mined at the depth 74 meters from the land surface .
There are two bores going underground – the main one and the auxiliary one .
The main bore serves for coal lifting and air injection .
The auxiliary bore is for lifting of people and equipment .
The pit has three wings : northern , southern and eastern .
The southern is partially flooded and the eastern is gas - polluted .
The total extent of the subways is about 26 km .
The classrooms of the pit .
The multiple conveyer system scheme .
The teaching model of the tunneling machine 4 PP - 2 .
Overalls , a helmet , a lamp and a self - rescuer are required to descend into the mine .
The main clock .
Here we step into the cage to go underground .
“ Acclimatization ” in a special room underground .
Air gate in the northern direction .
No entry to the eastern wing as it is gas - polluted ( on the left ) .
Ahead is the vault sagging resulting from groundwater stream .
To prevent the fall , the gate vault has been strengthened by extra bearings .
A cart with a pumping unit .
A long face .
The telephone on the left .
The power train on the tracks , it feeds the mechanized complex .
The working itself .
Over the bearings .
The conveyor .
The conveyor drive .
The underground roundhouse .
Electric locomotives are repaired right here , they are not lifted .
The works done in the pit are very impressive and it is sad to realize that soon all this will probably disappear .
The pit has arrears of electricity and if it is shut off , in 6 hours there will happen its complete flooding .
Theoretically it would be possible to restore the flooded pit but hardly anyone would be concerned .
Though the coal supply is enough for some decades …
Remember how technology was supposed to make our lives easier ?
In practice it actually tends to make our lives more complicated .
This paradox has led many to embrace simplicity .
Here 's a collection of quotes about simplicity , and keeping things simple .
" Make everything as simple as possible , but not simpler "
Albert Einstein
" Simplicity means the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means . "
- Dr. Koichi Kawana , Architect , designed the botanical gardens
" Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art . "
- Frank Lloyd Wright , Architect , designed the Guggenheim .
" I do n't think I 've ever seen a piece of commercial software where the next version is simpler rather than more complex . "
- Walter Bender , Executive Director of the MIT media lab .
" Simplicity hinges as much on cutting nonessential features as on adding helpful ones . "
- Walter Bender
" The main purpose of science is simplicity and as we understand more things , everything is becoming simpler . "
- Edward Teller , Scientist , father of the H Bomb .
" ' Think simple ' as my old master used to say meaning reduce the whole of its parts into the simplest terms , getting back to first principles . "
- Frank Lloyd Wright
" Even for expert users things should be simple "

It 's bound to roil open source advocates , but some Ubuntu leaders are asking the community which third - party , proprietary applications should be available for easy installation .
You can weigh in on Photoshop , iTunes , Evernote , and more in an online survey .
As noted in the Ubuntu Forums post announcing the survey , the question is n't about which apps are included by default in the operating system , but which apps should be worked on to be easily installed from Ubuntu 's official software sources .
There are , to be sure , third - party , not - entirely - open apps available in the optional repositories you can enable from Ubuntu 's settings , but by asking whether apps like iTunes , Photoshop , and Spotify should be made easy to emulate and install on your Ubuntu system , the developer community is showing a real focus on expanding Linux use beyond the seasoned geek crowd .

( Wired ) -- Google 's Nexus
One phone may have been one of the most anticipated devices of the last few weeks .
But since the smartphone 's launch last Tuesday , it has left a string of unhappy customers in its wake .
Nexus
One has been plagued by consumer complaints including spotty 3G connectivity , a high early termination fee , poor customer support from Google and problems with the touchscreen .
" There are some aspects of the experience that Google did n't think through as carefully as they should have , " says Charles Golvin , an analyst with Forrester Research .
" This has implications for the store they have launched and their future ambitions for it .
Google , clearly , has a lot of work ahead of it . "
Google introduced the Nexus One as the first device to be sold by the search company itself , rather than a manufacturing or carrier partner .
The Nexus One , which runs Android 2.1 , has been designed by HTC and works with T - Mobile 's network in the United States .
But contrary to initial speculation , the device is n't free .
It will retail for $ 180 with a 2 - year contract with T - Mobile .
An unlocked version is also available for $ 530 -- a price similar to most other smartphones -- and that version will work on other GSM phone networks worldwide as well as AT&T in the United States , although with some limitations .
The difference , though , is the Nexus One is available only through Google 's online store .
Unlike with a Motorola Cliq or a HTC G1 , users can't walk into a T - Mobile store and buy the Nexus One .
They can't even count on T - Mobile 's customer service representatives in store or the company 's phone support to solve their problems .
It 's a strategy that has backfired on Google .
The company 's support forums are full of customer complaints around the Nexus and the company 's poor service .
" A lot of complaints and frustration that people are expressing would normally be handled by going back into the store or by calling the support help line , " says Golvin .
" Having a physical location where you can take your phone back helps customers and Google seems to have underestimated that . "
" Solving customer support issues is extremely important to us , because we want people to have a positive Nexus One experience , " says a Google spokesperson .
" We are trying to be as open and transparent as possible through our online customer help forums . "
Many of the customer complaints are centered about the device 's inability to connect to T - Mobile 's 3G network .
The Nexus
One does not pick up the 3G network or keeps switching to the slower EDGE network , say some users .
A Google spokesperson says the company is aware of the problem .
" We are aware of the issues that have affected a small number of users and are working quickly to fix any problems , " the spokesperson told Wired.com in an email .
" We hope to have more information soon .
When we do , we will post it to the user forum . "
Add to all this Google 's decision to charge a separate early termination fee in addition to the one charged by T - Mobile .
Nexus
One customers who bought the subsidized , $ 180 version and then decide to cancel their contracts will have to pay $ 200 to T - Mobile .
But Google also charges users a $ 350 " equipment recovery fee " if you give up on the contract within 120 days .
Including all charges , Nexus
One customers who want to bail early will end up paying $ 550 .
That 's significantly higher than the controversial $ 350 early termination fee imposed by Verizon last year .
" Google provides a subsidy for devices purchased with T - Mobile USA service .
If a consumer cancels service after 14 days , Google recoups this subsidy in the form of an equipment recovery fee , " says the Google spokesperson .
" After 120 days , the equipment recovery fee will no longer apply .
This is standard practice for third party resellers of T - Mobile and other operators , and you will find similar policies for other mobile service resellers .
The T - Mobile early termination fee is separate and handled by T - Mobile . "
Despite the problems , Google can bounce back , says Golvin .
Customer dissatisfaction is likely to be just a small speed bump in the road for Google 's mobile ambitions , he says .
" Google tends to have a bit of a Teflon coating , " says Golvin .
" People tend to cut them a lot more slack -- as they do with Apple -- than they do with their mobile operator . "

SFO — Passengers on a flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco on Saturday were exposed to tuberculosis when a sick man on a no - fly list was allowed aboard , but the risk of the infection spreading is low , officials said Tuesday .
The unidentified man had been placed on the “ Do Not Board ” list one day earlier because of his TB , according to Christine Pearson , a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
It was n’t until after the US Airways flight took off that authorities discovered the sick man was aboard , Pearson said .
San Mateo County health officials met him at SFO , isolated him and took him to a hospital .
US Airways is reportedly contacting passengers on that flight .
According to a report on MSNBC , the man boarded US Airways flight 401 bound for San Francisco around 6 p.m. Saturday .
The CDC collects information from state and county health departments and adds to the “ Do Not Board ” list people afflicted with dangerous , contagious diseases .
The goal is to prevent the spread of infection in the controlled air environment of an airplane .
That information is then relayed to the federal Transportation Security Administration , which notifies the airlines .
TSA spokeswoman Sterling Payne said the agency had done its job and the airline had access to the information about the man with tuberculosis .
US Airways did not immediately return a phone call asking how the man was able to board the plane .
Tuberculosis is a potentially deadly infectious disease that typically attacks the lungs .
Symptoms include a persistent cough with blood , chest pain , night sweats and fever .
What makes the disease dangerous is the fact that most symptoms do n’t appear until the disease is too far along for treatment to be effective .
Treatment could last for six months or longer .
This oversight is just the latest mishap to plague Philadelphia International Airport and the TSA .
Last week , a plane was returned to the gate after the luggage of a suspicious man — who was arrested before boarding — was left onboard .
Passengers forced officials to turn the plane around .
The Prime Minister tells us that our aims in Afghanistan are clear , justified , realistic and achievable .
Three - quarters of the terrorist plots against us , he says , originate in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
He wants the Afghans to deal with this threat themselves , so that we can bring our soldiers home .
So we and our allies are training the army and police , improving " governance " , tackling corruption and drugs , promoting education , health care and economic development .
We will thus , says the Foreign Secretary , unite " key players behind shared goals - al - Qaeda kept out , the different tribal groups kept onside , and the neighbours prepared to play a constructive role " .
All this , alas , is management - speak , with no obvious link between cause and effect .
Perhaps Gordon Brown 's London conference on 28 January will cast a clearer light on these hugely difficult issues .
History is not necessarily a reliable guide to action .
Circumstances change , and so do outcomes .
But ignorance of history is a bad basis for policymaking .
The debate about Afghanistan is contaminated with myth and illusion .
One is that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires , and that Nato is about to go the same way as the Russians and the British in the 19th century .
That is too simple .
In a purely military sense , the British won their wars in the 19th century and the Russians won theirs in 1979 - 89 .
It was the surrounding politics that went wrong .
For the British , the history of Afghanistan is a compound of jolly stuff about the Great Game and self - righteous stuff about dastardly Russian interference in places that were rightly our exclusive business .
The differences are fewer than we like to think .
Both Britain and Russia were driven by the same motives : the promotion of trade and the security of their imperial frontiers , justified by ideas of glory and the notion of a " civilising mission " .
Both gained their ends through diplomacy , bribery , deceit , intrigue , treachery and ruthless force .
Each was paranoid about the other : the British thought that the Russians were out to get their Indian territories , the Russians that the British wanted to control central Asia .
Neither seriously entertained such unpromising projects , although hotheads on both sides occasionally came up with wild schemes .
To read the full version of this piece , pick up a copy of this week 's New Statesman , available in all good newsagents .
Yes , this is going to be another flying car post in which we lament our current , terrestrial ways and our predominantly Earth - bound means of getting places .
NASA has what it thinks is the solution , a personal flying machine called Puffin that is just large enough for a person to wedge themselves into before lurching off vertically , powered by a pair of electric motors .
These motors are said to make the machine almost silent so an initial application could be covert battlefield insertions , meaning yet again those military brats get to have all the fun -- in theory .
However , we 're going to be downers and say we do n't think they 'll ever get to use this thing either , as we 're not seeing any room for battery packs in that man-sized fuselage .
But hey , there 's some rendered conceptualization after the break if you 're a dreamer .

A captive Bornean orangutan has been seen acting as a peacemaker , breaking up fights between other warring apes .
It is the first time that an orangutan has been seen behaving in this way , say scientists who published details in the journal Primates .
Peacemakers likely intervene in squabbles to ensure they do not spiral out of control .
That in turn stops violence affecting other apes in the group and helps the animals live harmoniously together .
Wild orangutans usually prefer to lead relatively solitary lives .
Orangutans can actively preserve peace in a captive group
Dr Tomoyuki Tajima
Kyoto University
" Orangutans spend most of their time alone in the wild , " says Dr Tomoyuki Tajima of Kyoto University in Japan , who recorded the behaviour along with colleague Mr Hidetoshi Kurotori , a keeper at the Tama Zoological Park in Tokyo .
" However , they sometimes come and travel together , so researchers regard them as semi-solitary . "
Yet in captivity , orangutans socially interact far more often , sometimes becoming aggressive toward one other .
So Tajima is studying how the apes cope with this novel situation .
He was surprised by what he found .
" Orangutans can actively preserve peace in a captive group , " he told BBC News .
That conclusion stems from observing five orangutans , comprising two adults , two juveniles and an infant , housed at the Tama Zoological Park .
During this time , one of the juveniles , a six - year - old female named Kiki , was introduced to the group .
Over 13 days of observations , another much older female called Chappy , thought to be 34 years old , became repeatedly aggressive toward Kiki , either chasing or physically attacking her on 28 separate occasions .
During 19 of these interactions , another orangutan intervened , physically stepping between the two squabbling apes to separate them .
Most of the time the peacemaker was an elder female orangutan called Gypsy , who is thought to be 51 years old .
However , a young juvenile male called Poppy also stepped in to quell the trouble .
On every occasion bar one , the peacemaking orangutan was not attacked by Chappy , the aggressor .
Similar peacemaking behaviour has been seen in gorillas and chimpanzees , but these are natural group - living apes , say the researchers .
For orangutans to mediate in this way shows just how flexible they are in adapting to new environments , says Dr Tajima .
The cause of the Feb. 11 death of fashion icon Alexander McQueen was asphyxiation by hanging .
The Westminster Coroner 's Court in London confirmed that McQueen , 40 , hung himself in a wardrobe closet at his Mayfair apartment , leaving a suicide note nearby .
The contents of the note have not been disclosed .
Full autopsy details will not be available for a few months , according to Coroner 's Officer Lynda Martindill .
A rep for the McQueen fashion house told People magazine that memorial plans have not yet been made for the fashion designer , saying , " We hope to know more shortly ...
It will be very low - key . "
McQueen was one of the youngest designers to win the title " British Designer of the Year , " and was a designer to stars Rihanna and Lady Gaga , among many others .

In trademark giant sunglasses , Ruth Flowers , a 69 - year - old from Bristol , is wowing the youth on the dancefloors of Paris
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 8 March 2010
The news feature below recounted how Ruth Flowers , 69 , from Bristol became a DJ now making a mark in Europe 's clubs under the name Mamy Rock .
It reported her as saying her grandson put her in touch with the French producer with whom she collaborated in becoming a DJ .
In fact , the producer sought her out after seeing pictures on the web from a 2003 photo shoot where Ruth Flowers was invited to model as a " bling granny " character ; Getty Images distributed the pictures .
It was Colin Hawkins , the photographer who conceived the shoot , who made the introduction after being approached by the producer .
Behind the decks at Queen , the biggest and brashest nightclub in Paris , the DJ lifts her arms to the heavens .
White ticker tape falls on to the crowd below , who hurl themselves around to the throbbing bass , intermittently yelling their approval .
They push to get to the booth , taking photos on their phones as the hottest star of the moment lines up the next tune .
But Ruth Flowers is not your average DJ .
Coming up to her 70th birthday , when many are well settled into retirement , the grandmother from Bristol has become an international sensation , in demand in clubs throughout Europe .
With spiky silver hair and scarlet lipstick , gold bomber jacket , baggy tracksuit bottoms , bling jewellery , and trademark giant black sunglasses , Flowers plays down the new - found fame of her twilight years .
" I 'm not a superstar DJ , " she said , before donning her diamante - encrusted headphones and starting her set .
" I 'm just a DJ . "
Mamy Rock , as she is known on the circuit , came to the wheels of steel later than most .
She fell in love with dance music after accompanying her grandson to a London nightclub .
" The bouncers did n't want to let me in at first , I was quite a lot older than the usual clientele , but once I got inside I hugely enjoyed it .
I thought ' I can do this . '
My husband had died , I was retired , I had the time , so why not ? "
Her grandson , who she says is " smitten " with the idea of his gran as an international DJ , put her in touch with a young French producer , who helped her develop her sound and image .
" I like to mix the old and the new , so I might put electro alongside an old favourite like the Rolling Stones , " she said .
Aurelien Simon , the 28 - year - old producer behind the DJ , said he helps Flowers interject modern music through her set .
" But Ruth always has the last word , " he insisted .
Still , there is no sign of her favourite band , Queen , in tonight 's playlist .
" Freddie Mercury … what a voice , " she said , playing with the huge skulls and crossbones ring on her finger .
" But I like to please the crowds , I give them what they want . "
There were few complaints on the dancefloor where Flowers received intense , and somewhat bizarre , adulation from the assembled sweaty Parisian youth .
" Mamy Rock ! Mamy Rock ! " shouted Pauline Robert , a 23 - year - old student , over the relentless thud of the music .
" We adore Mamy Rock .
She loves to make us dance .
We all want her as our grandmother . "
For Alexandra Ledys , 21 , the appeal lies in her originality .
" It 's so cool , I 've never seen a DJ that old before , " he said .
" Music brings together all generations . "
For now , Flowers is more popular across the channel than in the UK , but hopes to bring her brand of mamy rock back home , ideally to the Ministry of Sound .
But what the French call her traditional British eccentricity is part of the charm for these Parisians .
Idir Igoudjil , a 19 - year - old student at Paris 's prestigious Sciences Po , complimented her mixing as a pair of barely pubescent girls ground away alongside him .
" English women are fantastic , " he said .
" They are much less uptight than French girls . "
After playing a residency at a jetset villa at the Cannes film festival , Flowers ' popularity has snowballed .
" I can't believe the type of reaction I have got so far .
People seem to adore me , they say they want to be like me , when they should just try and be like themselves , the dear things , " she said , suddenly sounding like the grandmother she is .
With an electro - rock EP , MamyRock , on the horizon and more offers to play famous nightclubs throughout the world , she has no desire to slow down just yet .
" I 've got no intention of retiring , " she said .
" Well , unless I drop dead .
And I 'd much rather go out with a bang than linger . "
Flowers worked as a singer and singing teacher in Portugal for 14 years , and returned to the UK after the death of her husband .
She has little time for those who think she should grow old gracefully .
" I think you have to accept the challenges that come your way .
You can stay at home , and do nothing but go to an old people 's club and to church for a cup of tea once a week .
But you do n't have to do that .
If you want to do something then you really can , " she said , before setting out to play to her fans .
" I just hope I can work that machine . "
WASHINGTON  The chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben S. Bernanke , warned on Monday that high unemployment and a continued reluctance by banks to make loans were likely to slow the economic recovery for the next year .
And in a departure from the usual practice of Fed chairmen , Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure global investors about the recent fall in the value of the dollar by saying that the central bank was “ attentive to the implications of changes ” and would “ continue to monitor these developments closely . ”
It is rare for Fed officials to comment on exchange rates , which for decades have been the responsibility of the Treasury Department .
Mr. Bernanke ’s message seemed to be that the Fed saw no cause for alarm in the dollar ’s weakness and that it would not need to bolster the dollar by raising interest rates sooner than it would otherwise .
Taken together , the Fed chairman ’s comments highlighted the conflicting goals that Fed officials may have to balance .
To nurture the slow recovery and bolster employment , the central bank has vowed to keep interest rates low for “ an extended period , ” but to prevent a precipitous drop in the value of the dollar , which could stoke inflation , the Fed would have to raise interest rates .
A Harvard professor made a historian 's case for same - sex marriage in federal court Tuesday , saying backers of California 's Proposition 8 are offering the same rationale - that the survival of marriage is at stake - once used to defend bans on interracial unions and the legal subordination of wives .
Those who supported prohibitions on weddings across racial lines , bans dating from colonial days that the Supreme Court abolished only in 1967 , often argued that " the institution would be degraded , their own marriages would be devalued " if such unions were allowed , Nancy Cott testified in San Francisco on the second day of the U.S. District Court trial of a suit challenging Prop .
8 .
Similarly , she said , 19th century laws in most states that required women to surrender their property , earnings and legal status to their husbands were viewed by their supporters as " absolutely essential to what marriage was . "
It took a series of Supreme Court rulings in the 1970s , Cott said , to stamp out the remnants of sex discrimination in marriage laws .
Prop. 8 , a November 2008 initiative , amended the California Constitution to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman , overturning a May 2008 state Supreme Court ruling that extended marital rights to gays and lesbians .
Two same - sex couples and the city of San Francisco contend the measure violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender .
Prop . 8 's sponsors argue that the state is entitled to endorse traditional marriage while protecting gay rights through domestic partnerships .
The plaintiffs are seeking to undermine that justification with academics starting with Cott , author of a 2000 book , " Public Vows , " on the history of marriage in the United States .
Disputing assertions by the measure 's defenders that marriage has been defined uniformly over time and across cultures , she said she found an " overall direction of change " in the United States toward equality within marriage and fewer restrictions on one 's choice of a partner .
" Same - sex couples seem perfectly able to fulfill those roles , " and allowing them to marry " would be very beneficial to the institution , " Cott said .
She said the movement for same - sex unions over the last 20 years has increased the social support for marriage , which hit a low ebb in the 1970s with rising divorce rates and criticism of sex roles .
In cross-examination , David Thompson , lawyer for the Prop. 8 campaign committee , sought to portray Cott as a biased advocate who had once endorsed a statement by a group advocating " alternatives to marriage , " which he said included multiple partners .
Cott said she had only been endorsing the right not to marry .
Thompson also stressed the influence of Christianity on early marriage laws in the United States , part of his argument that religious and moral objections to same - sex marriage are a legitimate legal basis for Prop .
8 . But Cott said U.S. marriage is a civil , secular institution , regulated by the state .
Cott was followed by George Chauncey , a Yale history professor , who described decades of discriminatory practices against homosexuals - government employee purges of the 1950s , raids on gay bars , and what he called a campaign by media , clergy and politicians from the 1930s onward to depict gay men as perverts .
Chauncey cited the 1977 campaign led by Anita Bryant to repeal a gay - rights ordinance in Dade County , Fla. , who portrayed gays as predators of children .
He said the Prop. 8 campaign was a more refined version of that approach .

FUNDING PUBLIC HEALTH CARE WITH A PUBLICLY - OWNED BANK :
HOW CANADA DID IT
The story goes that Churchill offered a woman 5 million pounds to sleep with him .
She hedged and said they would have to discuss terms .
Then he offered her 5 pounds .
� Sir ! � she said .
� What sort of woman do you think I am ? � � Madam , � he replied , � We�ve already established that .
Now we�re just haggling over the price . �
The same might be said of President Obama�s health care bill , which was sold out to corporate interests early on .
The insurance lobby had its way with the bill ; after that they were just haggling over the price .
The �public option� was so watered down in congressional deal - making that it finally disappeared altogether .
However , the bill passed both Houses by razor - thin margins , and the stunning loss on January 19 of the late Ted Kennedy�s Democratic seat to a Republican may force Obama to start over with his agenda .
The good news is that this means there is still a chance of getting legislation that includes what Obama�s supporters thought they were getting when they elected him � a universal health care plan on the model of Medicare .
That still leaves the question of price , but all industrialized countries except the United States have managed to foot the bill for universal health care .
How is it that they can afford it when we can�t ?
Do they have some secret funding source that we don�t have ?�
In the case of our nearest neighbor Canada , the answer is actually that they do .
At least , they did for the first two decades of their national health service -- long enough to get it up and running .
Now the Canadian government , too , is struggling with a mounting debt to private banks at compound interest ; and its national health service is suffering along with other public programs .
But when Canada first launched its national health service , the funding came from money created by its own central bank .
Canada�s innovative funding model is one that could still be followed by a President committed to deliver on his promises .
The Canadian National Health Service Today
Despite what you may have read in the corporate - controlled press , studies show that Canadians are generally happy with the care they receive ; and they live an average of 2.5 years longer than Americans .
They receive free health service for all diagnostic procedures , hospital and home care deemed medically necessary .
People can choose the general practitioners they want ; there are no deductibles on basic care ; and co-pays are low or zero .
Care continues despite changing jobs , and no one is excluded for having a pre-existing condition .
Drug prices are negotiated by the government and are paid with public money for the elderly and homeless .
For the rest of the population , cost - sharing schemes are arranged between private insurers and provincial governments , with most provinces requiring families to pay small monthly premiums ( generally around $ 100 for a family of four ) .
According to a 2007 study , the government pays for more than two - thirds of all Canadian health care costs .
The US government , by contrast , pays for less than half of these costs .
In 2007 , the US spent a staggering 16 % of GDP on health care compared to 10 % in Canada .
Health costs paid for out - of - pocket by Canadians amount to less than $ 300 per capita annually .
But while that arrangement may look good to people in the U.S. , it is only a shadow of Canada�s former system .
The federal government�s contributions have decreased significantly , making up only slightly more than 20 % of provincial medical care costs in 2002 ; and this money is largely borrowed by the Canadian government at interest .
The portion not paid by the federal government must be borne by provincial governments through taxes .
In its early years , however , Canada�s public health system was funded under a provision of the Bank of Canada Act allowing the Bank to create the money to finance federal , provincial , and municipal projects on a nearly interest - free basis .
Money Created the Old - fashioned Way � by the Government Rather than the Banks
What was extraordinary about the Bank of Canada was not so much that it created money on its books as that it managed to wrest that power away from the private banking monopoly .
All banks actually create the money they lend simply with accounting entries on their books .
This was confirmed by Graham Towers , the first governor of the Bank of Canada , in hearings in 1935 .
Asked whether banks create � the medium of exchange , � he replied :
��That is right .
That is what they are there for .
. . .
That is the banking business , just in the way that a steel plant makes steel .
The manufacturing process consists of making a pen-and - ink or typewriter entry on a card in a book .
That is all .�
The decision to fund government programs through a publicly - owned central bank was driven by a crisis much like that in the U.S. today .
The country was in the throes of the Great Depression , and the money supply had radically contracted , causing businesses to close and unemployment to soar .
Many Canadians blamed the private banks for making conditions worse by failing to extend loans .
Prior to the 1935 Bank of Canada Act , private banks in Canada issued their own banknotes , which were regulated less by the government than by the Canadian Banker�s Association .
The country�s largest private bank , the Bank of Montreal , served as the government�s de facto banker .
By the eve of the Great Depression , interest on Canada�s public debt had reached one - third of government expenditures , and many officials believed that the government needed a central bank to come up with the money to pay its foreign debts .
A Royal Commission was put together in 1933 which supported creating a Bank .
A major debate then ensued over whether the central bank should be public or private .
Much of the credit for the Canadian public banking model goes to a Canadian mayor named Gerald Gratton McGeer .
He has been largely lost to history , and his book The Conquest of Poverty has been long out of print ; but according to local historian Will Abrams , it was McGeer�s lengthy presentations to the Ottawa Common Banking Committee that clarified for bankers , economists and legislators how well a publicly - owned bank could work .
McGeer�s model was based on the public banking system of Guernsey , an island state between Britain and France .
The Guernsey government began issuing currency to pay for public works as far back as 1816 .
To this day , its system of publicly - issued money has allowed its inhabitants to maintain full employment and enjoy quality infrastructure , while paying modest taxes and without suffering from price inflation .
The Bank of Canada became publicly - owned in 1938 under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , a staunch supporter of McGeer�s vision for a public central bank .
King maintained :
��Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility , all talk of the sovereignty of Parliament and of democracy is idle and futile .
Once a nation parts with the control of its currency and credit , it matters not who makes that nation 's laws .
Usury , once in control , will wreck any nation . �
What Can Be Done by a Government Issuing Its Own Currency
Along with New Zealand , Australia and other progressive countries , Canada proceeded to fund infrastructure and social programs using national credit issued by its own central bank .
The potential of this new credit tool for the Canadian economy was first demonstrated in World War II , in which Canada ranked fourth among the Allies for production of war goods .
Under the Returning Veterans Rehabilitation
Act of 1945 , some 54,000 returning vets were given financial aid to attend university .
The Department of Veterans Affairs provided another 80,000 vets with vocational training , and the Veterans� Land Act helped 33,000 vets buy farmland .
After the War , the Industrial Development Bank , a subsidiary of the Bank of Canada , was formed to boost Canadian businesses by offering loans at low interest rates .
The Bank of Canada also funded many infrastructure projects and social programs directly .
Under the 1950 Trans Canada Highway Act , Canada built the world�s longest road and the world�s longest inland waterway ( a joint venture with the United States ) , as well as the 28 - mile Welland Canal .
People over 70 , regardless of income or assets , received $ 40 a month from the government under the Old Age Security Act ; and children under 15 got a tax - free allowance of $ 5 - $ 8 a month .
Canadians first began talking about a government - run health system during the Great Depression , but at that time the government felt it could not afford the service .
Various provincial programs were launched in the 1940s , often to care for returning veterans .
But it was not until 1957 that the Canadian federal health care system was actually initiated , with funding from the Bank of Canada .
A Hospital
Act was passed under which the federal government agreed to pay half its citizens � bills at most hospitals ; and a Diagnostic Services
Act gave all Canadians free acute hospital care , as well as lab and radiology work .
In 1966 , the Hospital Act was expanded to cover physician services .
In 1984 , the Canada Health
Act ensured that no medically - necessary care would include private fees or a charge to citizens .
A Misguided Economic Policy Kills the Golden Goose
For three decades , Canada paid for these projects through its own government - owned central bank , without sparking price inflation .
Then in the late 1960s , a period of �stagflation � set in -- rising prices accompanied by high unemployment .
According to former Canadian Defense Minister Paul Hellyer , these elevated prices were the result of �cost - push� inflation , which could be traced to a combination of causes .
Big labor unions , big government , and big corporations all negotiated top dollar for their contracts .
In 1971 , President Richard Nixon took the U.S. dollar off the gold standard , putting a strain on currencies in international markets .
In 1974 , the price of oil quadrupled , following a secret deal between Henry Kissinger and the OPEC countries in which the latter agreed to sell their oil only in U.S. dollars and to deposit the dollars in U.S. banks .
Countries without sufficient dollar reserves had to borrow from these banks to buy the oil they needed , setting a debt trap that sprang shut when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates to 20 % in 1980 .
These increased costs drove up prices worldwide ; but in Canada , price inflation was blamed on the government drawing money from its own central bank .
Under the sway of the classical monetarist theory promoted by U.S. economist Milton Friedman , the Canadian government abandoned its successful experiment in self - funding and began borrowing from private international lenders .
These private banks created �credit� on their books just as the Bank of Canada had done ; but they lent it to the government at compound interest , creating a soaring national debt .
Today , interest on the debt is the Canadian government�s single largest budget expenditure -- larger than health care , senior entitlements or national defense .
The provision of government - paid services is gradually being undermined by a combination of cuts to funding and provision of private services .
Canada�s health care system is suffering along with the rest of the economy , necessitating the cutbacks and long waits for elective procedures described by critics .
But the achievements of an earlier debt - free era attest to the sustainability of a system of public health care funded with money issued through the government�s own central bank .
Goosing the Economy Again
The Bank of Canada was created to end the hardships of the depression and give the government full responsibility for the health of the economy .
As it turned out , the Bank also funded the health of the Canadian people .
The U.S. government could fund universal health coverage in the same way .
Ideally , it would nationalize the Federal Reserve or set up a separate government - owned bank for this purpose .
However , the same result could be achieved by borrowing from the privately - owned Federal Reserve , which always rebates the interest to the government after deducting its costs .
The federal debt is never paid off but is just rolled over from year to year .
Interest - free loans rolled over from year to year are the equivalent of debt - free government - issued money .
Contrary to popular belief , adding to the money supply in this way would not be inflationary .
Inflation results when �demand� ( �money � ) exceeds � supply � ( goods and services ) .
In this case the new money would be used to create new goods and services , so supply would be kept in balance with demand .
The result would particularly not be inflationary today , when we are suffering from a deflationary crisis .
As in the Great Depression , money is not available to buy products and fund programs because the money supply itself has collapsed .
The solution is not to slash programs but to put more money into the economy ; and that can be done by authorizing the government to create the funds it needs through its own bank . �

The phrase “ carrots and sticks ” appears in political discussion so often , the first results on Google for “ carrots and sticks ” are about politics and not about animal husbandry .
The Beast of Burden is officially human .
Example : President Obama speaking about dealing with Iran
“ If we show ourselves willing to talk and to offer carrots and sticks in order to deal with these pressing problems — and if Iran then rejects any overtures of that sort — it puts us in a stronger position to mobilize the international community to ratchet up pressure on Iran . ”
A good way NOT to make progress with Iranians is by analogizing them to donkeys and the USA as their master .
This phrase is dehumanizing , in that carrots and sticks are used on beasts of burden by their masters .
It is one of the few honest appraisals you ’ll hear a politician utter on how they view the world .
From their perspective , you and I and other nations are the dumb animals to be steered in the direction of their desires .
You do n’t use carrots and sticks on someone you consider to be your equal .
You would n’t threaten a neighbor with a club or bribe them with money to resolve a dispute .
When you consider someone your equal , you let them decide how to act for themselves without coercion .
You do n’t use carrots and sticks on your friends .
If you were to say to a friend , “ Come over to my home for a superbowl party ; there ’ll be lots of snacks for you if you come–and if you do n’t show up , I ’ll flatten your tires , ” they wo n’t be your friend long .
You would n’t say to your spouse , “ If you ’ll lose some weight I ’ll help clean up around the house , and if you do n’t , I ’ll have sex with someone else , ” unless the goal was to divorce so you could have sex with someone else .
Politicians are loaded with these carrots and sticks ; they ’ve got them for health care , cap and trade , banks , buying cars , and the economy in general .
Politicians see so much more work to be done , and have an arsenal of creative ideas to corral the masses .
That ’s what politicians do ; they pat themselves on the back for thinking up new forms of behavior modification .
Why is it acceptable to use laws to modify other peoples ’ behavior ?
We would n’t treat people we know and care about with a carrot and stick approach , so why is it considered acceptable to treat strangers this way ?
In Commentary , Jennifer Rubin attempted to explain why The Jews hate Sarah Palin .
( Because they hate Real Americans , is basically her answer . )
David Frum rebuts : she is just scary to everyone !
Both leave out one hugely important detail .
Rubin's argument ( most of which is behind a paywall , so if David Frum has severely misstated it , we apologize ! ) ( found in its entirety here ) is basically that American Jews dislike Palin because of all of her bullshit rural working - class signifiers : large family , no formal education , folksy , hunting , etc .
Jews , per Rubin , hate that stuff .
Jews would not dream of being waitresses ( !? ) .
Also Jews love aborting retarded babies .
Pro-life Americans saw Palin 's son Trig , born with Down syndrome in April 2008 , as an affirmation of Palin 's deeply held beliefs , a rare instance in which a politician did more than mouth platitudes about a " culture of life . "
But in affluent communities with large Jewish populations , Down - syndrome children are now largely absent due to the widespread use of diagnostic testing and " genetics counseling . "
Trig was not a selling point with many Jewish women who could n't imagine making a similar choice - indeed , many have , in fact , made the opposite one .
This strikes us as fairly reductive and inflammatory !
Like basically Jews are all urban cosmopolitan elites sneering at stupid hard - working Christians , and all that ?
Ok , Commentary !
If you say so !
Frum 's response covers most of that weirdness , and he explains , patiently , to Rubin , that Palin did not come from hardscrabble poverty , but was in actuality middle class and comfortable .
And he explains that maybe what Jews resent about Palin is that she is proudly dumb intellectually incurious .
And what they are maybe scared of is her tendency to speak of a Real America and Real Americans , in contrast to those scary coastal elites .
More than any politician in memory , Palin seems to divide her fellow - Americans into first class and second class citizens , real Americans and not - so - real Americans .
To do her justice , she has never said anything to suggest that Jews as Jews fall into the second , less - real , class .
But Jews do tend to have an intuition that when this sort of line - drawing is done , we are likely to find ourselves on the wrong side .
Ed Koch of all people captured this discomfort when he unexpectedly endorsed Barack Obama , because Palin scared the shit out of him .
It was the attempted book - banning — not the wolf - hunting — that did it .
But weirdly neither author mentions the Really Big Thing that could 've scared Jewish voters : her fucking crazy church .
Her church that invited the Jews for Jesus to come around to explain that the Jews had been persecuted for centuries because they did n't acknowledge the divinity of Jesus .
And then her pastor collected donations for the group .
And he said :
" Father , that comes full circle and we wish to extend your grace back to your people .
And we pray and we ask that as a result of this time here , and as a result of this offering , there will be people among the Jews today who come to say the name ‘ Jesus ' with faith . "
So , yeah .
That is maybe a bigger dealbreaker than the waitressing job .
Maybe !
And this was before Palin weirdly decided to quote crazy - ass antisemite Westbook Pegler in her fucking convention speech .
( The Pegler line , by the way , was most likely borrowed from a Pat Buchanan book . )
And before a photo was unearthed of Palin with a copy of the official magazine of the antisemitic John Birch Society on her desk .
Once again , all of these strike us as better reasons for Jews to be wary of Palin than the fact that she did not abort her special needs baby .
But what do we know ?
Unlike these two , we are not contributors to Commentary !

The last week was quiet in Iran , comparatively speaking .
The government announced it would try 16 people for their roles in last month 's street protests and charge them with " warring against God , " which carries the death penalty .
The head of the Iranian police force warned opponents of the regime that the authorities were now monitoring all e-mails and text messages .
Government goons defaced the grave of a student protester who was shot dead by police last year , pockmarking her gravestone with bullet holes .
A parliamentary panel accused Tehran 's prosecutor of beating three imprisoned protesters to death .
And the nation 's leaders continued growing filthy rich .
Since the fraudulent elections last June that returned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power , the government has been unstintingly harsh , even deadly , in trying to put down a national uprising .
Iran is a theocracy , and the state is charging its opponents with religious crimes .
So perhaps spiritual fervor is driving the government to attack its own people .
If not that , then maybe it is simply the typical dictator 's determination to hold onto power at any cost .
Certainly those are important motivators .
But another little - discussed feature of Iranian society is at least as important to the state 's overlords .
They are standing astride a river of cash that flows up to them , nonstop , in one of the most corrupt states in the world .
Religion is important , power is wonderful , but how marvelous must it feel to have $ 1 billion or more in a secret , offshore bank account ?
Corruption " is very widespread , and everyone is in on the action , everyone at the top , " said Gary Sick , an Iran expert at Columbia University who served on the National Security Council under three presidents .
" It 's a very , very ugly situation . "
When he ran for the presidency in 2005 , Ahmadinejad promised to end corruption and clean up the nation 's economy .
That was why people voted for him .
The Associated Press interviewed voters at the polls on election day , and most of them said something like Mahdi Mirmalek 's remark : " I will vote for Ahmadinejad because he is the one committed to fighting corruption . "
Well , that year , Transparency International placed Iran just past halfway down its Corruption Perceptions Index , No. 88 of 158 countries surveyed .
By 2007 , Iran had fallen to 131st place .
This year , in the survey just published , Iran is pushing toward the bottom : 168th out of 180 nation 's surveyed , in the company of Sudan , Chad and Burma .
Once Ahmadinejad won the election , " the whole corruption thing was forgotten , " Sick said .
" He did n't even pay it lip service anymore . "
Now the problem runs from the bottom of society all the way up .
" You have to bribe the postman to get your mail delivered , " said Abbas Milani , director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University .
" It 's pandemic , and , now , normalized . "
Petty exactions at the mailbox and city offices lead inexorably toward multimillion - dollar bribes to government officials from companies that want to start businesses .
It 's normalized , as Milani said .
The businessmen have the direct - wire addresses to move the money into the officials ' offshore accounts .
Given the wealth that washes through the economy from the oil business - Iran is the world 's fourth largest oil producing nation - the amount of money passed in some bribes is larger than the annual budgets of mid-size Iranian cities .
As so often happens in corrupt societies , Iran 's leaders profess to be clean and distressed about the graft .
Do n't believe it .
As Milani puts it : " You can't rule a bureaucracy where everyone who works for you is corrupt - and you are clean . "
Reporting from Iran shows that the children of both Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , are set up with positions that tie them directly into the money flow so that they are quite wealthy .
Are their fathers going to watch their children get rich while they live a pious life on a government salary ?
Unlikely .
When discussion of the problem does come up , of course the regime blames Washington .
Ayatollah Mesbah - Yazdi , an educator and government loyalist ( most likely on the dole ) , told a group of Republican Guard officers last fall that " America 's culture is full of corruption " and that the United States is exporting it to Iran .
He did n't explain the precise mechanics of that .
If the United States wants to do something that would really hurt the Iranian regime and force it to the table to talk about the nuclear program , find those secret offshore bank accounts .
Freeze them .
Seize them .
Over the last decade , it has become common to complain that governments , particularly in the west , have been too narrowly focused on the pursuit of rising GDP at the expense of other social goods .
People have looked wistfully to Bhutan , where , since 1972 , official government policy has been to prioritise instead the " Gross National Happiness " .
Be careful what you wish for , you might just get it .
For now that both government and opposition have embraced the happiness agenda , sceptical voices are warning that this marks a disturbing intrusion of the state into the private lives of citizens , and that , far from being benign , attempts to regulate the subjective states of citizens could have sinister implications .
Well - being , once absent from political discourse , has become a contested issue at the very heart of it .
Over recent weeks alone , policy proposals that put well - being and happiness at their core have been ubiquitous .
Demos published a report , " Building Character " , which proposed " a range of policy interventions " , arguing character capabilities " ought to be a concern for policy - makers " .
The Young Foundation also published " Sinking and Swimming " , arguing that " there is no reason why regular GDP reports should not be accompanied by regular reports on the psychological fitness and health of the population " .
The time may be right , it said , to rethink welfare through the lens of mental health , rather than material prosperity and physical well - being .
Such ways of thinking are now firmly entrenched in Westminster and Whitehall .
On 7 December , the Government published a report , " New Horizons " , setting out its 10 - year mental health strategy .
As Gordon Brown said in its introduction : " This is about more than preventing mental illness ... it is also about helping individuals and communities to bring the best out of themselves . "
As psychological well - being becomes more than just a health service concern that deals with chronic or acute problems , all branches of the state start to take an interest in it .
So , for instance , the recent announcement that mental health workers are to be placed in all job centres came not just from the Department of Health , but also the Department for Work and Pensions .
Well - being has also found its way on to the timetable at a top public school , Wellington College , where it was initially met with bewilderment but has increasingly received acclaim .
Since the Master of Wellington , Anthony Seldon , is a senior education advisor to the Conservative Party , expansion of the lessons into state schools is no longer an unlikely prospect .
The driving force behind this sea-change in Government priorities is the " new science of happiness " , positive psychology , enthusiastically championed in the UK by the government 's " happiness tsar " , the psychologist Lord Richard Layard .
The core tenets of positive psychology have become so absorbed by the Government that they can be summed up in the vision statement of " New Horizons " , which seeks " to move towards a society where people understand that their mental well - being is as important as their physical health if they are to live their lives to the full " .
But although the report says that we now know " the factors that affect well - being and some everyday strategies for preserving and boosting it " , both the claims of positive psychology and the role of the state in promoting individual well - being are hotly contested .
Providing the most sustained and visible resistance is Frank Furedi , Professor of Sociology at the University of Kent and the leading intellectual force behind of the Institute of Ideas .
Furedi set out his stall in his book Therapy Culture , a phrase which is not about therapy as such , but the trend towards the pathologising of ordinary problems of living .
In a therapy culture , people increasingly treat personal difficulties as disorders which need to be treated by professionals .
Since well - being has become an explicit objective of Government policy , the political dimensions of such objections have become more apparent .
For instance , Dennis Hayes , Professor of Education at the University of Derby and co-author of The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education , is alarmed by the extent to which ideas like " happy workers are more productive workers " are becoming management mantras .
Hayes has argued that he'd rather people were miserably unemployed and plotting revenge than happily engaged in trivial work .
Therapy culture , he believes , is filling a vacuum where politics used to be .
" Traditionally you 'd say disgruntlement led to the desire for change , " he told me .
" Disgruntlement now leads to therapy . "
Such worries could be dismissed as unreconstructed , a priori Marxism .
According to Marx , employees are alienated from their labour , as they do not own and profit from its products .
Any employee who professes to be happy is therefore suffering from false consciousness .
The promise of positive psychology thus becomes a threat : to make a more content workforce is to blind it to its sorry state .
But even if you do n't go along with this classical Marxist analysis , is n't it reasonable to worry about the state using therapeutic tools to make more productive workers ?
You do n't need to posit a paranoid conspiracy theory to see that the Government is at least in part enthused by the well - being agenda on the basis of its economic impact .
" New Horizons " estimates that the full cost to the economy of mental illness is " around £ 77bn , mostly due to lost productivity " .
Certainly , the Government has made very strong links between being mentally well and having a job .
" One of the best ways to improve mental health is through work , " wrote Gordon Brown .
" We know that work is good for people and that 's why we want to give everyone the support they need to stay in a job , or get back to work , " agreed Yvette Cooper , the Health Minister .
If we " know " these things , then do n't we also " know " that anyone who is not happily in work has something wrong with them ?
There are other ways in which advocates of positive psychology explicitly make claims that it helps with social goals that governments might have .
Anthony Seldon , for instance , has said that he believes that the introduction of well - being classes has probably contributed to better exam grades at Wellington College .
Martin Seligman , the godfather of positive psychology , talks about happiness making us " good citizens " .
The fear is of a Brave New World , regulated not by the popping of soma pills but by the more indirect route of positive psychology interventions .
The result will be content , compliant citizens , students and employees who come to see problems as only being ones of responses to circumstances , not in potentially unjust circumstances themselves .
Behind some of these critiques is a misguided belief that the battle between the interests of state and citizens is a zero- sum game , when it could actually be a win-win .
The happiness of workers need not be phoney just because it also means they 're more productive , just as children might leave school both more resilient and content as well as with grades that schools and education ministers are proud of .
If there is a problem with the politics of well - being , it cannot simply be that the state has something to gain from it .
There are , however , plenty of more serious questions raised by the growth of the well - being agenda , which largely assumes a medical model .
" Mental health problems are common , " says " New Horizons " .
" They are illnesses with causes and treatments , like physical illnesses . "
Even if that is the correct way to think about some problems , whether this is the right paradigm for most of what concerns our mental and emotional well - being is far more contentious .
Whether we view a difficulty as a problem of living or clinical conditions with treatments completely changes how we think about and deal with the issues we face .
Consider how a lack of motivation to do a boring job could be seen as a sane response to intolerable external circumstances , or as a symptom of a kind of depression .
If the latter becomes the orthodoxy , then the disgruntlement of workers will increasingly be assumed to be a sign that they , not the workplace , is dysfunctional .
For example , Martin Seligman recently talked on Radio 4's All In The Mind about a waitress who hated her job .
Seligman got her to take a test which identified her " signature strengths " , the strongest of which was " social intelligence " .
" So her job , " he said , " was to recraft waitressing to use social intelligence more . "
That meant resolving to " make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer 's evening . "
This made her happier , less depressed and got her bigger tips .
Good for her , you might think .
But what are the wider consequences of adopting this kind of approach ?
The " job " of everyone who is not happy with their work is simply to " recraft " it so that they are .
So if you 're not happy with your job , you 're just not doing your job .
This connects with the broader concern that happiness is becoming not something you are free to strive for , but an obligation .
" There is no duty we so much underrate as the duty to be happy , " wrote Robert Louis Stevenson , a quotation that was used as the epigraph of a recent self - help book and which seems to be increasingly repeated .
If happiness is something we can learn and is under our control , then the unhappy are not merely unfortunate , they 're negligent .
The objections against positive psychology would carry little force , however , if its main factual claims were simply true , and the evidence that they are can seem very impressive .
Graphs and charts can be wheeled out to show that people who are more optimistic and resilient do better on all number of measures of life success , such as health , happiness , wealth and longevity .
And optimism and resilience are things which it is claimed can be taught .
The upshot is that we can and should learn to be more positive .
The problem , however , is that by its own admission positive psychology is a young discipline , and there often seems to be a lack of subtlety in its interpretation of data .
Think , for example , about what nutritional science might tell us , if it based its findings on survey data .
It would find that people who eat more fruit and vegetables than meat every day are healthier than those who do n't .
True , but what prescription follows ?
Not that everyone should eat as much fruit and veg as possible and avoid all meat .
The evidence tells us eating plants is important , but it does n't tell us what a balanced diet looks like .
There is a similar danger that psychologists who divide the world up into positive and negative thinkers and find that the positive - minded do better are too quick to conclude that therefore we should all strive to be more positive .
As yet , there is little work being done which considers the roles of both positivity and negativity in a balanced psychological diet .
That which does presents a much more complicated picture .
For instance , there is considerable evidence , gathered by the psychologist Julie Norem and others , that defensive pessimism – believing that things will probably go wrong – has many psychological benefits , such as building resilience .
Such findings challenge one of the central tenets of positive psychology , that we should all try to be more optimistic .
" To claim optimism as a virtue without any reference to context is , I think , vacuous , inappropriate , and misleading , " says Norem .
" Also , optimism tends to go hand in hand with overconfidence , and often with egocentrism , where you feel okay about yourself , but maybe you feel more okay about yourself than you should . "
The possibility that perhaps there are times when we should n't feel good is often one that is glossed over when positive psychology is discussed as though it were a value - free science .
In fact it is thickly value - laden , in ways which are often concealed in its language , such as the phrase " emotional well - being " , which John Cottingham , the Professor of Philosophy at Reading university , thinks is " a kind of awkward fudge " .
Well - being , he argues , is a basic ethical concept to do with the pursuit of the good human life .
" If you just shove ' emotional ' in front of that , you seem to be thinking , we do n't have to go into all that ethical and philosophical guff about virtue .
We can just look at the emotions , which are something psychological and emotional , and we can measure those and get ' improved outcomes ' . "
But although this may be the popular conception of positive psychology , its leading advocates make no secret that it is much more than neutral science .
" Of course it 's not value free , " Layard told me .
" It is based on the assumption that misery is bad and happiness good .
And it assumes that everybody 's happiness / misery matters equally , which is the central principle of social justice . "
Indeed , Layard devotes a chapter of his book Happiness to a defence of utilitarianism , the view that what is right is to increase the greatest happiness of the greatest number .
" Bully for Bentham , " is his conclusion .
Anthony Seldon also proudly says that positive psychology " is value - full , and the values are profoundly humane " , based as they are upon " harmony in relationships , with oneself , with the environment and with others " .
But if the well - being agenda is indeed so value - laden , does the state have any business in promoting it ?
" The leaders of society have always been concerned with the development of character , " argues Layard , " since no society can function without some shared habits and norms .
And they have always felt special responsibility for children and young people . "
This echoes the challenge to mainstream liberal thought by communitarians , led by last year 's Reith lecturer , Michael Sandel .
For too long , liberals have kidded themselves that the civic sphere is a value - neutral zone , where decisions are made without any substantive vision of the good life .
But any political programme implies a value system , and Layard argues that at least positive psychology 's is " less judgmental than many value systems , since it considers lasting happiness to be a value wherever it comes from " .
In the wider public and political imagination , however , positive psychology is too often seen as just a set of empirical facts .
" Scientists have discovered " is the usual prefix to any claim made about positive psychology .
But claims about what is are so often followed up by claims about what we should do .
Evidence that children of married couples do better than those of cohabiting and single parents ( which is in any case too simplistic a conclusion to draw from the statistics ) , for instance , is used as grounds for promoting marriage .
But by the same logic , why not argue that people should be encouraged to become religious – in any religion – because faith is also correlated with happiness ?
Philosophers have warned for centuries about the dangers of sliding from " is " to " ought " without sufficient justification , but in their enthusiasm for the encouraging claims of positive psychology , not enough people are showing the same caution now .
Despite all these reasons to be wary about the well - being agenda and its encampment at the high table of politics , there is always a danger of throwing out the baby with the bathwater .
It would simply fly in the face of the evidence to suggest there is nothing of substance or interest to have emerged from the research into positive psychology .
And if we do want government to be concerned with more than just economic growth , it would be foolish for it to ignore the lessons it may have to offer .
Nevertheless , there are serious questions to be asked about the haste with which government , educators , business and think tanks have embraced positive psychology .
This is not just objective , value - free science , but a hybrid of often - incomplete empirical evidence and prescriptions for the good life which have n't always been thought through .
Positive psychology is too serious and important to be just dismissed , but before it is accorded too much respect , it needs to grow up and be explicit about where it values really lie .
Our genuine well - being may well depend on that .

In most ways my life is close to my ideal .
The conditions of my life are excellent .
I am satisfied with my life .
So far I have the important things I want in life .
If I could live my life over , I would change almost nothing .
31 -35 Extremely satisfied

21 - 25 Slightly satisfied
20 Neutral
15 - 19 Slightly dissatisfied
10 - 14 Dissatisfied
5 - 9 Extremely dissatisfied
Understanding Scores on the Satisfaction with Life Scale
30 - 35 Highly Satisfied
Respondents who score in this range love their lives and feel that things are going very well .
Their lives are not perfect , but they feel that things are about as good as lives get .
Furthermore , just because the person is satisfied does not mean she or he is complacent .
In fact , growth and challenge might be part of the reason the respondent is satisfied .
For most people in this high - scoring range , life is enjoyable , and the major domains of life are going well – work or school , family , friends , leisure , and personal development .
25 - 29 Satisfied
Individuals who score in this range like their lives and feel that things are going well .
Of course their lives are not perfect , but they feel that things are mostly good .
Furthermore , just because the person is satisfied does not mean she or he is complacent .
In fact , growth and challenge might be part of the reason the respondent is satisfied .
For most people in this high - scoring range , life is enjoyable , and the major domains of life are going well – work or school , family , friends , leisure , and personal development .
The person may draw motivation from the areas of dissatisfaction .
20 - 24 Average satisfaction
The average of life satisfaction in economically developed nations is in this range – the majority of people are generally satisfied , but have some areas where they very much would like some improvement .
Some individuals score in this range because they are mostly satisfied with most areas of their lives but see the need for some improvement in each area .
Other respondents score in this range because they are satisfied with most domains of their lives , but have one or two areas where they would like to see large improvements .
A person scoring in this range is normal in that they have areas of their lives that need improvement .
However , an individual in this range would usually like to move to a higher level by making some life changes .
15 - 19 Slightly below average in life satisfaction
People who score in this range usually have small but significant problems in several areas of their lives , or have many areas that are doing fine but one area that represents a substantial problem for them .
If a person has moved temporarily into this level of life satisfaction from a higher level because of some recent event , things will usually improve over time and satisfaction will generally move back up .
On the other hand , if a person is chronically slightly dissatisfied with many areas of life , some changes might be in order .
Sometimes the person is simply expecting too much , and sometimes life changes are needed .
Thus , although temporary dissatisfaction is common and normal , a chronic level of dissatisfaction across a number of areas of life calls for reflection .
Some people can gain motivation from a small level of dissatisfaction , but often dissatisfaction across a number of life domains is a distraction , and unpleasant as well .
10 - 14 Dissatisfied
People who score in this range are substantially dissatisfied with their lives .
People in this range may have a number of domains that are not going well , or one or two domains that are going very badly .
If life dissatisfaction is a response to a recent event such as bereavement , divorce , or a significant problem at work , the person will probably return over time to his or her former level of higher satisfaction .
However , if low levels of life satisfaction have been chronic for the person , some changes are in order – both in attitudes and patterns of thinking , and probably in life activities as well .
Low levels of life satisfaction in this range , if they persist , can indicate that things are going badly and life alterations are needed .
Furthermore , a person with low life satisfaction in this range is sometimes not functioning well because their unhappiness serves as a distraction .
Talking to a friend , member of the clergy , counsellor , or other specialist can often help the person get moving in the right direction , although positive change will be up to the person .
5 - 9 Extremely dissatisfied
Individuals who score in this range are usually extremely unhappy with their current life .
In some cases this is in reaction to some recent bad event such as widowhood or unemployment .
In other cases , it is a response to a chronic problem such as alcoholism or addiction .
In yet other cases the extreme dissatisfaction is a reaction due to something bad in life such as recently having lost a loved one .
However , dissatisfaction at this level is often due to dissatisfaction in multiple areas of life .
Whatever the reason for the low level of life satisfaction , it may be that the help of others are needed – a friend or family member , counselling with a member of the clergy , or help from a psychologist or other counsellor .
If the dissatisfaction is chronic , the person needs to change , and often others can help .
Common to each category :
To understand life satisfaction scores , it is helpful to understand some of the components that go into most people 's experience of satisfaction .
One of the most important influences on happiness is social relationships .
People who score high on life satisfaction tend to have close and supportive family and friends , whereas those who do not have close friends and family are more likely to be dissatisfied .
Of course the loss of a close friend or family member can cause dissatisfaction with life , and it may take quite a time for the person to bounce back from the loss .
Another factor that influences the life satisfaction of most people is work or school , or performance in an important role such as homemaker or grandparent .
When the person enjoys his or her work , whether it is paid or unpaid work , and feels that it is meaningful and important , this contributes to life satisfaction .
When work is going poorly because of bad circumstances or a poor fit with the person 's strengths , this can lower life satisfaction .
When a person has important goals , and is failing to make adequate progress toward them , this too can lead to life dissatisfaction .
A third factor that influences the life satisfaction of most people is personal – satisfaction with the self , religious or spiritual life , learning and growth , and leisure .
For many people these are sources of satisfaction .
However , when these sources of personal worth are frustrated , they can be powerful sources of dissatisfaction .
Of course there are additional sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction – some that are common to most people such as health , and others that are unique to each individual .
Most people know the factors that lead to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction , although a person 's temperament – a general tendency to be happy or unhappy – can colour their responses .
There is no one key to life satisfaction , but rather a recipe that includes a number of ingredients .
With time and persistent work , people 's life satisfaction usually goes up when they are dissatisfied .
People who have had a loss recover over time .
People who have a dissatisfying relationship or work often make changes over time that will increase their dissatisfaction .
One key ingredient to happiness , as mentioned above , is social relationships , and another key ingredient is to have important goals that derive from one 's values , and to make progress toward those goals .
For many people it is important to feel a connection to something larger than oneself .
When a person tends to be chronically dissatisfied , they should look within themselves and ask whether they need to develop more positive attitudes to life and the world .

The sugars dwelling in cellulosic biomass are the target of many alternative fuel schemes , but they can be difficult to get to and even more difficult to process into the fatty acids that we need to make biofuels .
E. coli has long been known to synthesize fatty acids efficiently , but natural processes make harvesting those acids particularly difficult .
Researchers would like E. coli to biosynthesize indefinitely , but like any organism trying to remain competitive in nature , E. coli does n't waste energy manufacturing more fatty acids than it needs to survive .
The same lobbyist that sold Washington on Enron is now touting Ben Bernanke .
According to Politico , former Enron lobbyist Linda Robertson has been managing Bernanke ’s confirmation effort on behalf of the Federal Reserve — coaching him through the process in much the same way she coached Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling through the Washington influence game .
Robertson played a key role in some of Enron ’s most scandalous moments in the year prior to its collapse .
For starters , she was at the center of negotiations involving the highly secretive energy task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney .
A review of Enron email shows that Robertson guided Lay through pivotal meetings with Cheney and other officials , and actually authored the Enron memo and talking points that were later integrated into Cheney ’s controversial energy plan .
Cheney ’s task force was criticized for its heavy industry bias — it worked in close cooperation with companies like Enron while largely ignoring the concerns of environmental and consumer groups .
The Bush administration refused to make many details of its functions public .
Enron was one of the companies that got special attention from Cheney , and Robertson authored the plan that Enron sent to Cheney .
She first sent the energy plan talking points to Lay chief of staff Steven Kean and chief lobbyist Richard Shapiro on April 5 , 2001 ( unfortunately , I ca n’t find a link — it ’s pulled from the database available here ) :
The attached Talking Points are for Ken ’s use in his conversations and / or meetings with Bush Administration officials on their National Energy Plan .
We are awaiting word on a possible meeting today with Josh Bolton at 4:30 .
We have confirmed a meeting Friday at 3:45 with Larry Lindsey .
Thanks
The next day , Robertson and Lay met with a number of Bush administration officials , according to a report by the House Oversight committee .
A week later , on April 13 , Robertson emailed Shapiro and Kean to let them know that she was faxing the talking points to Cheney ’s office in preparation for an April 17 meeting between Lay , Robertson , and Cheney :
Cheney ’s office asked us to fax them prior to the meeting a document on what
we intend to talk about .
Rick and I agreed to send the document we gave to
Karl Rove a couple of weeks ago .
We sent this to Rosie so that she could fax
it to Cheney .
She showed it to Ken first .
He had edits to the document .
They are below .
FYI .
The document , as revised , is being faxed to Cheney now .
A House Oversight investigation later obtained these documents and found that the Bush White House plan had adopted “ all or significant portions of Enron ’s recommendations ” in seven of the eight areas outlined in Robertson ’s document .
Most of the recommendations involved federal intervention that deregulated the country ’s power markets .
Robertson and Lay ’s meeting with Cheney came at the height of the California electricity crisis , which was saddling the state with rolling blackouts , and due at least in part to Enron ’s manipulation of energy prices .
Enron was profiting from the crisis and lobbying hard against price caps .
Robertson played a key role in this effort ; the memo she submitted to Cheney recommended that “ The administration should reject any attempt to re-regulate wholesale power markets by adopting price caps . ”
The following day , according to the Nation ’s John Nichols , Cheney gave an unusual interview to the Los Angeles Times , in which he repeatedly came out against price caps ( FERC instituted price caps a few days later , apparently against Cheney ’s wishes ) .
California had been plunged into catastrophic debt and darkness by deregulatory policies , but Robertson worked all the levers of the Washington influence game to push things even further .
The parallels to the Bernanke confirmation fight are obvious .
Robertson came out of the Clinton Treasury and would seem to be an unlikely author for a Bush administration plan — especially one that Congressional Democrats railed against as a product of corporate influence .
But throughout her career , Robertson has demonstrated that her allegiances to corporate America trump partisan politics .
She just may be the perfect pick for the Bernanke fight : for the confirmation to go through , she ’ll need to rally an anti-populist , bi-partisan coalition of corporate Senators .
We ’ll have more on Robertson tomorrow .

The increase in Chinese purchases has been clear for some time , as has their agreement with Saudi Arabia to increase purchase levels .
As a result the world is rapidly returning to the production levels that were achieved before the financial recession .
Increases in Chinese oil demand should n't be too surprising , given how rapidly personal auto sales have been increasing .
The Chinese purchased 13.6 million cars and light trucks last year , compared to 10.4 million for the USA -- they are now the world 's # 1 auto market .
We should not be surprised if this demand continues to grow and exert upward pressure on prices .
The recent run-up in oil prices to $ 84 barrel is being blamed on an increase in Chinese oil imports .
In December , Chinese imports of crude oil rose to 20 million tonnes , or the equivalent of 4.7 million barrels a day .
Recent purchases of African crude have been especially high , with purchases by Asian markets reaching 1.9 million barrels a day in early January , up from 1.58 million barrels a day in December .
If we go to the EIA web page , the figures released a couple of days ago ( which are only compiled through this past October ) show that peak world production was in July 2008 .
( Note that this counts all liquids , including ethanol , and natural gas liquids . )
At that time , total production was 86.620 mbd , of which OPEC produced 36.412 mbd and the USA some 8.830 mbd .
In January a year ago , production was at its lowest over the last couple of years at some 83.145 mbd ; OPEC was at 33.402 ; and the USA at 8.731 mbd .
By October 2009 , however , world production had returned to 85.302 mbd .
This is very close to the average value for 2008 , and some 1.3 mbd above the average , to date , for 2009 .
OPEC production was running at 34.381 mbd .
Non-OPEC production , which has been bouncing around 50 mbd since December 2003 , and which has been predicted to be in terminal decline , did reach a new peak ( according to the EIA ) of 50.921 mbd in October .
However , the general prediction for non-OPEC production relates to crude oil production , rather than all liquids , which is the EIA figure .
It would thus appear that we are within 1.3 mbd of reaching a new record for production ( and this was for last October , and as I noted above , sales in December were significantly up in China ) .
The numbers for crude oil alone are obviously lower .
In July 2008 world production was 74.746 mbd , with 33.138 mbd of production from OPEC ; after a nadir of 71.430 mbd last May , when OPEC was at 30.399 mbd , by October production was back up to 73.121 mbd , with OPEC at 31.012 mbd .
The difference between peak and October is 1.6 mbd .
Until now I have anticipated that we would not revisit the levels of production that we were at when oil reached $ 147 a barrel ( which was in July 2008 ) for at least another year .
Depending on how you view these levels of production , that pessimism about the growth or regeneration of the world economy for which this might be considered to act as a proxy appears that it might be too conservative a view .
We may well exceed the current maximum values by sometime this summer , when we usually see peak annual demand .
The question will then become one of the availability of the market to meet the higher levels of demand , and can this be done without returning to the high prices that were encountered the last time around .
And with those questions comes the slightly longer term one as to how much higher world oil production can be raised , before we bump into a physical production limit .
I tend to believe the generalized view that non-OPEC production is at a peak -- if not , over a sustained period , just about past it .
But even if non-OPEC overall production level is sustained or slightly increased , this will still throw the burden of meeting significant increases in global demand on OPEC , and this re-opens the debate over how much additional oil that they can bring to the market , given the slow release of the production quotas under which they have been operating for the past year .
( Saudi Arabia , for example , which peaked at 9.7 mbd in July 2008 and dropped to 8.062 mbd in February of 2009 , crept back up to 8.54 mbd in July and was at 8.34 mbd in October .
Over this period Russian production has steadily increased , with October levels reaching 9.629 mbd .
This contributes to the non-OPEC rise .
USA production is also up recently , and North Sea production seems to be recovering from a dip . )
Well , those are the numbers .
They are moving up faster than I had expected , and I ’m afraid it will likely mean that higher gasoline prices will rise faster than I had expected to be the case .
That is because you do n't get these levels of production unless someone is buying and using the product .
As demand rises , we will have the opportunity to see whether the claims that have been made about high global reserves being available to expand production are true .
Also , if oil prices do rise , we can also see whether and when they impact the global financial recovery .

A lot of virology and biotechnology is involved with genetic technology , genes and their proteins , and retroviruses .
These scientists meddle in those areas to produce vaccines .
It is apparent that this approach to health is similar to biotechnology 's approach with GMO 's for food production .
Meddling with the basic building blocks of organic life has led to more problems created than solved .
From the online Encyclopedia Britannica , " Retroviruses make up an unusual group of viruses .
(. . .)
Retroviruses also contain an essential enzyme known as reverse transcriptase .
. . . and contain RNA strands instead of DNA .
" Essentially , the trancriptase enables the RNA to manufacture proteins , which is the reverse of DNA protein creation .
Thus the term retro .
Those proteins are then incorporated by the host genome .
Then that host cell manufactures the viral protein .
A retro virus could be considered a parasite virus that uses the DNA from host cells to create its proteins .
Dawn Crim of VacTruth asks , " Is it possible that retroviruses are alive and well in vaccines ? "
She continues , " In 1996 the Swiss National Center for Retroviruses questioned the safety of live - virus vaccines .
This organization found certain live chicken - cell derived vaccines ( such as the MMR vaccine ) contaminated with avian ( bird ) retroviral particles .
"
They concluded that they did not know whether or not these retroviral particles would cause disease in humans .
They could not determine safety or non safety .
However , Dr. Russell Blaylock is certain that in addition to the autoimmune dangers from the preservatives and adjuncts in vaccines , there is a strong chance of disease down the road from the " stealth or retroviruses " that live attenuated virus vaccines may contain as by - products from using infected tissues .
See Natural News article " What To Do If You Cannot Avoid the Flu Shot " https://www.naturalnews.com/027106_vaccinatio...
A former vaccine scientist turned whistle blower under cover of anonymity told investigative report Jon Rappoport that there was no way to eliminate potentially harmful viral contaminates from the the viruses intentionally used to manufacture vaccines .
Canadian Dr. Andrew Moulden asserts , " . . . vaccines are not addressing the common cause of disease and disorder in human physiology .
It is not the germs causing disease and death and chronic illness , . . . all pathogens are inducing disease and death and disability via a singular common set of mechanism . " " Louis Pasteur 's germ theory was just that , a theory .
. . . this means that much of what we are doing in western medicine is wrong , we have been practicing medicine in a state of confusing cause and effect and causing more harm , globally , than good - for over 200 years !
" So why does western medicine continue to expand with virus hunts and vaccine creations ?
The hubris of vaccination disease intervention does n't stand up to the epidemiology of diseases waning before vaccinations appeared .
Factually , chronic diseases are on the rise as vaccinations have increased , especially among the heavily vaccinated .
Vaccination is the irreproachable sacred cow of western medicine .
It is also a major cash cow .
Billions of dollars annually are at stake for our trusted creators of health solutions , who actually manufacture agents of disease to treat people more and again as they get sicker and older , but not wiser .

I have previously blogged about VxClass and our algorithms for automated generation of byte signatures here and here and here .
I have also blogged about private signatures beforehand , a concept that I think has great relevance for defense against ( and response to ) targeted attacks .
One point I left open in the previous blog post was the following question :
How do I actually use the byte signatures in a real - world scenario ?
In this post , I will answer that question :
We will use the latest version of Mandiant ’s Memoryze and VxClass and walk through the entire process of memory acquisition , malware classification , signature generation and signature deployment .
In detail , our steps are going to be the following :
We will pre-populate a VxClass system with a good quantity of Zeus samples
We will examine the clusters generated from this We infect a previously clean XP with a new Zeus sample
We identify the suspicious memory sections that were created by Zeus using Memoryze and AuditViewer , two great ( and free ! ) tools that Mandiant has released
We acquire the injected memory sections from the infected system and submit them to VxClass VxClass recognizes the similarity to previously submitted Zeus samples and generates a byte signature to detect the entire cluster of both old and new Zeus variants .
This signature is unique to us , and can be used to detect infections by this malware on any Windows machine .
The signature is then fed into Memoryze to identify the infection on other machines
Wow , that ’s quite a list .
So where do we start ?
We start out by examining a small set of about 180 malware samples that we pre-populated a fresh VxClass with .
These samples were labeled “ Zeus ” or “ Zbot ” by some anti-virus software , so we assume they are Zeus variants .
VxClass has generated family trees , and assigned most of the files to these trees .
In the next two pictures , it will become evident what the “ similarity score ” between two samples means :
It indicates how much overlap there is between the code of the two executables under consideration .
To further illustrate the issue , we drew some Venn diagrams illustrating the overlap between the highlighted samples on the right hand side .
The next screenshot shows where in the family tree these two items are located ( you might have to load the non-thumbnail version to actually see this ) :
But enough of this .
As a next step , I infect a vanilla XP machine with a new random sample that was labelled Zeus — one that VxClass has never seen before .
After having done this , I use Memoryze ( and AuditViewer , a nice GUI for it ) to identify the memory sections that have been injected into various processes .
To do this , you have to click through a few dialogs that ask you to configure the following things :
The location of Memoryze The output path for the data
Whether you wish to work from live memory ( yes )
In the first step , we just want to identify those processes that Zeus injected itself into – we will acquire the injected memory separately .
We hence check “ Process Enumeration ” and leave the “ Acquisition ” fields unchecked .
Finally , we enable “ Memory Sections ” and “ Detect Injected DLLs ” to be enumerated for each process .
AuditViewer now launches Memoryze , and after a brief waiting period we can inspect the results .
AuditViewer is nice enough to highlight the processes that contain suspicious injected DLLs in red .
Furthermore , we can immediately spot the problematic section of memory , because AuditViewer has highlighted it , too .
In the next step , we simply upload the .VAD file of this memory section to our VxClass box and look whether this is in any way similar to the code already in the box .
And no surprise :
It is quite similar to a number of other executables in the database :
In the next step , we will want to generate a traditional byte signature for all executables in the relevant cluster .
This is pretty easy — highlight them , assign a tag to them , and then right - click “ create signature ” ( screenshot below ) .
A few seconds later , the signature is ready and can be downloaded ( in ClamAV format ) from the “ Signatures ” tab in the VxClass web UI .
The generated signature is the following :
cluster .
C.worm:0:*:81ec*000000*8b75*ff75* 56ff15*0033*8945*0f84*558bec83ec10565733f668 * 0033 ff8975fcff15*0033c08945f4393d*0076*463b35 * 0072c7*8b7d*8b7d08e8*837d*007413*ff7608e8 * feffff8bc889*85c9*3c20740b*013845 fe7444 * c645fe00e9e1000000*558bec81ec*020000*535633 * 0000*0033*8d85*fdffff*5089 *ff15*8d85*b301 * 83f907750d*0085c075*6a07585068*8b7d188d043b8d440014 * 8bf08975*020000*8365*00566a0033c0c645ff00e8 * 06000085c00f85*010000*0fb645fd0fb70cc5*008b3d
This is clearly much longer than what would be strictly required – we usually generate much longer signatures than the bare minimum in order to minimize the risk of false positives .
The cool thing about the signature is that it is private — e.g. no other user of VxClass would get the same signature ( to be precise : the probability of another user getting the same signature is astronomically small ) .
This means that unless you share this signature ( like I did above ) , it remains as a “ secret weapon ” in your arsenal :
The malware authors do not know what signature you are going to detect them with , so they ca n’t intentionally “ break ” this signature .
Now , an important question remains unanswered :
How does one deploy such a signature ?
We have two options :
We can use AuditViewer to configure Memoryze again , or we can simply run Memoryze from the command line with the appropriate configuration file to scan through the physical memory of a machine .
In order to use AuditViewer , simply configure it as usual : Provide it with the location of Memoryze and tell it to analyze live memory .
After you have done so , you mark the “ enumerate processes ” checkbox , and finally , you tell AuditViewer about the byte pattern you wish to search for :
AuditViewer will then launch Memoryze in the background which will scan through all processes and identify those that contain the pattern in question .
AuditViewer saves the current configuration for Memoryze in a file called out.xml in your Memoryze directory .
This means you can simply make a copy of out.xml in your Memoryze directory and re-use it on other machines without having to re-run AuditViewer .
Simply install Memoryze on a machine and then launch “ Memoryze - script out.xml -o < outputdir > “ .
You now have a new way of detecting variants of the malware that was used to attack you .
But best of all :
This method is secret – the signature is n’t shared with the wider world – and the attacker therefore has a much harder time immunizing his attack tools prior to the next attack .
To summarize : Combining VxClass with Memoryze and AuditViewer makes the acquisition and correlation of malicious code easy – but best of all , these tools also provide a quick and convenient way to automatically generate high - quality detection mechanisms that are kept secret from the attackers .

Unusually , I ’m in complete agreement with a recent headline on the Wall Street Journal op - ed page :
“ The Climate Science Is n’t Settled ”
The article below is the same mix of innuendo and misrepresentation that its author normally writes , but the headline is correct .
The WSJ seems to think that the headline is some terribly important pronouncement that in some way undercuts the scientific consensus on climate change but they are simply using an old rhetorical ‘ trick ’ .
The phrase “ the science is settled ” is associated almost 100 % with contrarian comments on climate and is usually a paraphrase of what ‘ some scientists ’ are supposed to have said .
The reality is that it depends very much on what you are talking about and I have never heard any scientist say this in any general context – at a recent meeting I was at , someone claimed that this had been said by the participants and he was roundly shouted down by the assembled experts .
The reason why no scientist has said this is because they know full well that knowledge about science is not binary – science is n’t either settled or not settled .
This is a false and misleading dichotomy .
Instead , we know things with varying degrees of confidence – for instance , conservation of energy is pretty well accepted , as is the theory of gravity ( despite continuing interest in what happens at very small scales or very high energies ) , while the exact nature of dark matter is still unclear .
The forced binary distinction implicit in the phrase is designed to misleadingly relegate anything about which there is still uncertainty to the category of completely unknown .
i.e. that since we do n’t know everything , we know nothing .
In the climate field , there are a number of issues which are no longer subject to fundamental debate in the community .
The existence of the greenhouse effect , the increase in CO2 ( and other GHGs ) over the last hundred years and its human cause , and the fact the planet warmed significantly over the 20th Century are not much in doubt .
IPCC described these factors as ‘ virtually certain ’ or ‘ unequivocal ’ .
The attribution of the warming over the last 50 years to human activity is also pretty well established – that is ‘ highly likely ’ and the anticipation that further warming will continue as CO2 levels continue to rise is a well supported conclusion .
To the extent that anyone has said that the scientific debate is over , this is what they are referring to .
In answer to colloquial questions like “ Is anthropogenic warming real ? ” , the answer is yes with high confidence .
But no scientists would be scientists if they thought there was nothing left to find out .
Think of the science as a large building , with foundations reaching back to the 19th Century and a whole edifice of knowledge built upon them .
The community spends most of its time trying to add a brick here or a brick there and slowly adding to the construction .
The idea that the ‘ science is settled ’ is equivalent to stating that the building is complete and that nothing further can be added .
Obviously that is false – new bricks ( and windows and decoration and interior designs ) are being added and argued about all the time .
However , while the science may not be settled , we can still tell what kind of building we have and what the overall picture looks like .
Arguments over whether a single brick should be blue or yellow do n’t change the building from a skyscraper to a mud hut .
The IPCC reports should be required reading for anyone who thinks that scientists think that the ‘ science is settled ’ – the vast array of uncertainties that are discussed and dissected puts that notion to bed immediately .
But what we do have are reasons for concern .
As Mike Hulme recently wrote :
[ S] cience has clearly revealed that humans are influencing global climate and will continue to do so , but we do n’t know the full scale of the risks involved , nor how rapidly they will evolve , nor indeed — with clear insight — the relative roles of all the forcing agents involved at different scales .
…
The central battlegrounds on which we need to fight out the policy implications of climate change concern matters of risk management , of valuation , and political ideology .
We must move the locus of public argumentation here not because the science has somehow been “ done ” or “ is settled ” ; science will never be either of these things , although it can offer powerful forms of knowledge not available in other ways .
It is a false hope to expect science to dispel the fog of uncertainty so that it finally becomes clear exactly what the future holds and what role humans have in causing it .
Dealing with the future always involves dealing with uncertainty – and this is as true with climate as it is with the economy .
Science has led to a great deal of well - supported concern that increasing emissions of CO2 ( in particular ) are posing a substantial risk to human society .
Playing rhetorical games in the face of this , while momentarily satisfying for blog commenters , is no answer at all to the real issues we face .
New York , N.Y. ( December 20 , 2005 ) – Stefan Gleason , Vice President of the National Right to Work Foundation , a non-profit charitable organization that provides free legal aid to employees suffering from compulsory unionism abuses , made the following statement in response to today ’s illegal mass transit strike that shut down the New York City subway system : “ Transportation Workers Union ( TWU ) officials are not only holding New York City and its economy hostage to their self - serving demands , but they are potentially jeopardizing the jobs of New York City ’s 30,000 mass transit workers .
“ These union officials have a public - be - damned attitude and are holding a gun to the head of New York City ’s business owners and workers .
The costs of this illegal strike to New York ’s working families will be enormous .
“ Moreover , Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) officials may ultimately have no choice but to fire the illegal strikers in order to uphold the rule of law and to preserve New York ’s security and economic vitality .
President Ronald Reagan took similar action to protect the travelling public when he ordered the firing in 1981 of illegally striking air traffic controllers who refused to return to their jobs .
“ This illegal strike is a direct result of the coercive privileges union officials have gained under New York law that empowers them to force workers into union affiliation – like it or not .
As long as union officials in New York enjoy compulsory unionism privileges , individual workers , the economy , and the public in general will continue to pay the price . ”

In my last report from Physics@FOM , I will talk about something I am truly not competent to discuss : " Holography , ADS / CFT and the emergence of gravity . "
I realize that I am not always the sharpest knife in the drawer , but I have never found myself so lost so quickly in a presentation .
I think this comes from the difficulties in conveying some very new concepts by Erik Verlinde , who is still in the process of grappling with them himself .
Nevertheless , let me try .
Holography , and anti de Sitter space / conformal field theory are two ways of describing the bending of space and the entropy associated with it .
The two models are very closely related to each other .
So close that , according to Wikipedia — the fount of all reliable knowledge — theorists can't agree if they are the same or not .
But the point about both is that they resolve the problem of unifying gravity with quantum mechanics by getting rid of gravity .
OK , that 's not entirely accurate .
Gravity is still a force , but it is generated by something more fundamental : entropy .
Entropy can be described in the language of quantum mechanics and conformal field theory is one model for this sort of description .
In these models , gravity kind of falls out of the equations for free — where " free " is an enormous amount of work done by someone else .
Verlinde 's made several analogies in his talk , but the best is probably that of a polymer in a liquid .
A polymer is a long chain of similar units , and it has considerable freedom in how it arranges itself in space .
But , given time and the influence of Brownian motion , a polymer will rearrange itself so that it minimizes its volume .
Essentially , the act of random collision events results in a macroscopic behavior that is not random at all .
How does this relate to gravity ?
Space is the set of dimensions that allows motion to take place , but it also stores information via its configuration — no , I do n't know how that happens — but the maximum amount of information per unit space is finite .
Essentially , there are only so many configurations available to space and , once you have used them all , no more information can be stored .
So , we have space , even empty space , that has information sitting in it .
Entropy just involves counting states — that is , space that has information stored in it has some entropy .
Since there is more information stored in some parts of space — for instance , in highly curved parts of space — then the entropy is not uniform .
And nonuniform entropy drives forces and macroscopic activity , such as the polymer that minimizes its entropy by minimizing its volume .
To get gravity , one takes standard thermodynamics , but replaces temperature with non-local degrees of freedom — and , no , I do n't know what that means either .
In this system , we find a macroscopic force that attracts mass to mass .
Or more precisely , highly curved regions of space tend to have forces acting on them that increase their curvature .
Looking specifically at a black hole , space is curved sharply around it — so sharply that , from the inside , it is closed off from the rest of the universe .
As objects fall into the black hole , the event horizon expands ( this is the spherical surface that , from the inside , is perceived as a closed surface ) .
That sphere now has more surface area , and so can accommodate more information , all of which remains on the surface of the object .
This additional information increases the entropy of the black hole , and , as a result , its gravitational attraction increases .
This seems to be general property .
Any massive object can be thought of as a closed surface with a certain amount of entropy .
If this sounds a bit like charged spheres and electromagnetism , you are on the home straight , because the mathematics is exactly the same .
As a result , you end up with things like a Gauss ' Law for gravity , and you can calculate some pretty cool things .
Historically , macroscopic thermodynamics , which describes observable macroscopic forces in terms of macroscopic quantities , was worked out first .
However , the foundation of thermodyamics is a microscopic theory that relates the macroscopic features to the detailed behavior of individual units , such as atoms or molecules in an ideal gas .
We now await the 21st century equivalents of Boltzmann and Maxwell to provide the microscopic theory of space - time thermodynamics so that there is a nice solid foundation for this very fascinating idea .
For those of who think " Hooray , no more string theory , " I have bad news for you .
First of all , all of these ideas are born out of string theory , and second , where do you think the microscopic theory is going to come from ?

Yushchenko has seen his support evaporate in the past five years Ukraine 's President Viktor Yushchenko , the one - time hero of the Orange Revolution , has been eliminated from the country 's presidential election .
A run-off will be held on 7 February after no candidate won 50 % of the vote .
With more than 90 % of votes counted , the president had won only about 5 % .
Former PM Viktor Yanukovych led current PM Yulia Tymoshenko by some 35 % to 25 % .
Despite allegations of fraud by candidates , international monitors gave the election a clean bill of health .
Officials from the Organization for Security and Co-operation ( OSCE ) said the election was of high quality and met Ukraine 's democratic commitments .
It was Mr Yanukovych 's victory in the 2004 election that was challenged by the Orange Revolution , and later annulled by the Supreme Court .
ANALYSIS Gabriel Gatehouse
BBC News , Kiev Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was instrumental in bringing the current President , Viktor Yushchenko , to power during the Orange Revolution five years ago .
But the pair soon fell out , and she is now portraying herself as the heir of the Orange mantle .
Five years ago , Viktor Yanukovych was the villain , tainted by open support from Moscow and allegations of vote - rigging .
Now , both candidates say they favour closer ties with Russia - after five years of increasingly tense relations under President Yushchenko - and the Kremlin seems happy with either .
Mr Yushchenko and Mrs Tymoshenko were allies in the Orange movement , and became president and prime minister in its aftermath .
But they have since become bitter rivals , and the poll highlighted their recent power struggle .
But long before all the ballots were counted , the verdict was clear , says the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Kiev .
Ukrainians had overwhelmingly rejected the man who led the pro-Western protests on Independence Square five years ago .
Disillusionment has grown among voters over the failure to tackle corruption in the intervening years , and to push forward links with the EU , our correspondent says .
Fraud concerns
As opinion polls had predicted , the first - round winner was Mr Yanukovych , ahead of Mrs Tymoshenko .
The two will take part in a run - off in three weeks ' time .
On opposing sides of the Orange Revolution in 2004 and 2005 , both now favour closer ties with Russia .
Mr Yanukovych has made an extraordinary comeback after his victory of five years ago was ruled fraudulent , our correspondent says .
Yanukovych supporters gathered in Kiev to celebrate on Monday
He seemed delighted to have defeated his old enemy , saying : " Today marks the end of Orange power .
There will be no room for ( Yushchenko ) in the second round .
He has officially lost the faith of the people . "
Analysts expect Mrs Tymoshenko to pick up more votes in the second round , and the race could be very close .
The leading candidates had accused each other of trying to rig the election , and there have been warnings of unrest after the vote .
But Andrei Magera , deputy head of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission , said there was no evidence of voter intimidation nor organised fraud .
" There was nothing similar to mass actions that took place in the year of 2004 when voters with absentee ballots had been carried all over Ukraine by buses , " he said .
Mrs Tymoshenko responded to the result by saying : " Despite the great campaign of discrimination that was launched by all the oligarchs who rallied around Yanukovych , people showed their wisdom , trust and faith in me . "
She said she was ready for talks with the defeated candidates " so that we can move forward with uniting the democratic forces " .
A total of 18 candidates took part in the election .
Turnout was reported to be about 67 % .

Good or Bad , The New Law Makes it Harder for Teens to Obtain Credit
You may recall that back in May of 2009 the President signed into law the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 , or CARD .
This act was packed with all sorts of new credit card rules and regulations that would hopefully lead to more responsible borrowing .
While this was big news back when it was introduced in May , it has somewhat fallen off the radar even though it ’s scheduled to take effect on February 22nd .
One of the highlights of the new law has to do with teens and credit cards .
We ’ve known that over the years college students have been prime targets for credit card companies .
They would flood college campuses during the first few weeks of school and run all sorts of promotions and give away freebies in order to get kids to sign up for credit cards .
While this may not seem like that big of a deal , a lot of these young people soon received cards in the mail and were granted credit limits of a few thousand dollars .
Unfortunately , without a steady source of income and understanding the consequences of racking up a credit card balance these students soon found themselves in trouble as they had minimum payments coming due .
Get a Job or a Co - Signer
In the past the only requirement to qualify for a credit card was to be at least 18 years old and to have a heartbeat .
Credit card companies would give a card to just about anyone .
Today , lending has already tightened up , but it ’s going to get even worse ( or better ? ) for teenagers .
When the new laws take effect you will need to be at least 21 years old to get a credit card without a co-signer or verifiable income .
Teens will still be able to apply for a credit card once they turn 18 , but to qualify they will need to either have their parents or guardian co-sign or have a job earning enough income to qualify for a card .
Sorry , kids .
Looks like the days of accepting every credit card offer that comes through your dorm room mailbox and having the best spring break ever are over .
Good News / Bad News for Parents
The new credit card law is a mixed bag for parents .
First , the bad news .
Your teen ’s credit problems now become your problem .
In the past if your teenager got a credit card and racked up an unpayable balance there was no legal obligation for the parents to step in and help out .
Not any more .
Now that you ’ll have to co-sign your teen ’s card you ’re on the hook for their mistakes .
This could be as benign as having to help them out with payments if they ca n’t afford them to actually having your credit destroyed if they get into serious trouble , make late payments , default , etc .
There ’s also some good news .
You now have a little bit of control over your teen ’s spending and you do n’t have to worry as much about whether or not they are racking up thousands in debt that you do n’t know about while they are away at college .
Now you can make sure they only have a credit card with a low interest rate , an appropriate credit limit , and keep tabs on how much they spend and their ability to pay the bill each month .
Parents should use this as a teaching moment to help their teens learn how credit cards work , the importance of establishing credit , and making those payments on time .
Good News / Bad News for Teens
Even though most teens wo n’t like it , there is a lot of good that will come from these changes .
It will now be a lot harder for teens to carelessly rack up substantial debt and ruin their credit at such an early age .
I know firsthand how easy it is to get into credit card trouble while in college .
Been there and done that !
So , now that you ’ll need a job that pays enough to afford credit card payments or put your parents on the card with you it ’s far less likely that major credit card problems will arise .
That being said , it ’s not all good .
If a teen ’s parents already have bad credit it might be impossible for them to even qualify for a credit card they can co-sign on .
That could mean they are out of luck until they turn 21 .
Most credit card opponents would say this is still good news .
But let ’s not forget reality .
You need to establish a credit history at some point as it plays a very important role in your life .
From getting a mortgage , a car , getting a job , or even renting an apartment , your credit score can make or break you .
If you ca n’t get a credit card until you ’re 21 that means you have lost three years of potential credit history .
As a 21 year old is graduating college and getting ready to set out on their new life it can be that much harder if you ’re trying to also establish credit for the first time .
Strategies for Teens and Parents
If you ’re under 21 and currently do n’t have a credit card but have been thinking about getting one , you may want to apply for a good 0 % rewards card before the February deadline .
No , this does n’t mean all teenagers should rush out and just start applying for credit .
But , if you were already thinking about getting a card , be it for emergencies or just to establish some credit history , it might make sense to get one before the new restrictions take effect .
If you are thinking about getting a card you should treat it as if the new restrictions were already in effect .
Talk to your parents about it and let them know you ’re going to get a credit card .
They can help you make the right decision and share some wisdom so that you can avoid the mistakes they may have made .
Parents , it ’s also time for you to start thinking about how these changes will affect you and your teen .
If you already have a teenager or have children that will be turning 18 in the coming years , you better be prepared for them to start asking you about credit cards .
Decide what your policy regarding credit cards will be and determine how you ’re going to teach your kids how to use them responsibly so that you do n’t end up in credit trouble yourself .
And while you ’re thinking about that , you should probably check your credit score and make sure your credit is good enough that you can help your kids out when the time does come .
Have credit trouble ?
Here are some tips to help you improve your credit score .

I 'd buy an iPad just to read comic books .
Think I 'm nuts ?
I probably am , but see how you feel after this first look at what Panelfly , maker of a popular comic book iPhone app , is building for the iPad .

Instead of simply scaling up the existing iPhone app , the folks from Panelfly put their heads together with the Sugarcube dev team and brainstormed .
With all the talk of the iPad and how it could restore comic books to their former glory , they realized that they needed to revamp the app and make a version specifically for the iPad .
This way they could take full advantage of the device 's screen size and provide a new way of purchasing and interacting with the content .

The way the Panelfly iPhone app works is that you download the app for free from the app store and then add comics to your library through in - app purchases .
Stephen Lynch , CTO and designer at Panelfly , hinted that the company is currently exploring several different purchase models for the iPad version , but was unfortunately unable to elaborate even when I tried to coax out whether there 'd be a subscription option .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
As far as reading and navigating content on the new iPad app goes , let 's just say it 'll blow us all away .
From what Stephen was able to share with me , Panelfly " did n't want to stray too far from the native Apple UI elements , [ they ] wanted to create something that was [ theirs ] as well as a platform that gave the content the respect it deserves . "
And from the looks and sound of it ?
They 've succeeded .
Be sure to click on the images in the gallery for the full - sized view .
It 's worth it .

Call me a geeky comic book lover , but apps like this one are what I 'm looking forward to when it comes to the iPad .
The gadget wo n't replace my computer , it wo n't replace my TV , and it wo n't replace any other device I 've got around the house .
But it will be what I sit down with when I want to catch up on some comics , magazines , journal articles , and what will be formerly known as " print " media .
NOT YOUR FATHER'S ARMY
By Chuck Baldwin
February 5 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
Most of us Americans have a deep and abiding respect and admiration for our country 's fighting men who have served -- and are serving -- within the US Armed Forces .
We appreciate their willingness to put themselves in harm 's way for the preservation of our nation 's liberty and independence .
We honor their sacrifice .
Indeed , many of us share that sacrifice with the deaths , dismemberments , and paralysis of our most cherished loved ones who were killed or injured in the line of duty .
It is time , however , that we awaken to the reality of what our military is becoming and where it is heading .
Suffice it to say , this is not your father 's army .
On December 8 , 1941 , my father , Ed Baldwin -- along with his two brothers , Bud and Gene - - marched down to a recruiting office in Little Rock , Arkansas , to enlist .
The Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor the day before , and no branch of service had to beg people to enlist that day .
Bud joined the Navy .
Gene joined the Marines .
When government officials saw Dad 's resumé , they selected him to help construct the atomic bomb .
All three brothers served their country with distinction throughout the war .
But what all of us need to realize is , World War II was the last constitutionally fought war in which America has been engaged .
The United Nations was created at the end of WWII , and ever since then , our military forces have increasingly become the " peacekeeping " arm of that evil institution .
Since WWII , American forces have fought major wars in South Korea , South Vietnam ( including Laos and Cambodia ) , Kosovo , the Persian Gulf ( Kuwait ) , Iraq , Afghanistan , and now Pakistan -- all for the benefit of the United Nations .
Add to these major wars lesser conflicts ( except to those Americans killed or wounded in them ) such as Lebanon , Dominican Republic , Congo ( Zaire ) , Iran , El Salvador , Libya , Grenada , Honduras , Chad , Panama , Colombia , Bolivia , Peru , Saudi Arabia , Macedonia , Bosnia , Sierra Leone , Kenya , Tanzania , and Somalia .
And this does not take into account the countless CIA - sponsored Black Ops missions that have taken place all over the world .
Yes , American forces have been used to both put people in power and take people out of power all over the world .
And as often as not , the people we put in power were counted among the " bad guys , " while the people we removed from power were " good guys . "
Remember , our own CIA was the organization most responsible for the rise to power of Osama Bin Laden .
And it was the US government that surreptitiously set up the murder of Dr. Jonas Savimbi , who was one of the best friends the United States had overseas .
Plus , does anyone remember how the US treated our friend , the Shah of Iran ?
Yes , some of us are old enough to remember when Iran was one of the best friends we had in that region of the world .
But mind you , not one single war in which American forces have been engaged since WWII has been constitutionally fought .
Not one !
Ever since the United Nations was created , its interests have dominated the usage of US forces .
In fact , our military today is quickly morphing into the tip of the spear for a burgeoning , global New World Order .
To those with eyes to see , the evidence is everywhere .
It 's not even being hidden anymore .
Have you seen that new US Navy television commercial ?
It boldly proclaims , " The US Navy : A GLOBAL FORCE For Good . "
( Emphasis added . )
This politically correct , UN - dominated New World Order has changed ( and is changing ) our US military right before our eyes .
It has taken the greatest and proudest independent fighting force in the world -- one created to defend the people and property of the United States -- and turned it into a global military policeman for the evil Machiavellians at the UN .

In order to convert the US military into a true " Global Force , " several changes are being forced upon our fighting men .
First , more and more women are entering the US military .
Currently , women comprise about 20 % of military personnel .
And for the first time in US history , women are actively engaged in combat units in the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The massive integration of women in combat may serve the interests of political correctness , but it does not serve the interests of combat effectiveness .
Neither does it serve the interests of family and child rearing .
And I do n't care how old fashioned that sounds !
Wives and mothers are the backbone of family nurturing .
To willingly take mothers away from their children -- and subject both mother and child to the separation and suffering that military life demands -- is both unnatural and cruel .
And there is another stark reality that few people want to discuss : the fact that 30 % of all women in the US military are raped .
Yes , you read it right : 30 % .
According to NPR , " In 2003 , a survey of female veterans found that 30 percent said they were raped in the military .
A 2004 study of veterans who were seeking help for post - traumatic stress disorder found that 71 percent of the women said they were sexually assaulted or raped while serving .
And a 1995 study of female veterans of the Gulf and earlier wars , found that 90 percent had been sexually harassed . "
See the report here .
Government and military brass know that the introduction of women into the military environment ( especially the combat environment ) is reaping problems of epidemic proportions , but they are deliberately ignoring and even covering them up .
For example , does anyone recall the name Jamie Leigh Jones ?
According to ABC News , " A Houston , Texas woman says she was gang - raped by Halliburton / KBR coworkers in Baghdad , and the company and the U.S. government are covering up the incident .
" Jamie Leigh Jones , now 22 , says that after she was raped by multiple men at a KBR camp in the Green Zone , the company put her under guard in a shipping container with a bed and warned her that if she left Iraq for medical treatment , she 'd be out of a job . "
See the report here .
And this story leads into another phenomenon being created within this New World Order army : the way our government and military are increasing their use of " private " or " independent " contractors .
In the past , these people were always known simply as mercenaries .
Call them what you will , mercenaries are now a major component of the way our government wages war .
According to Global Research , " The growing use of private armies not only subjects target populations to savage warfare but makes it easier for the White House to subvert domestic public opinion and wage wars .
" Americans are less inclined to oppose a war that is being fought by hired foreign mercenaries , even when their own tax dollars are being squandered to fund it .
" ' The increasing use of contractors , private forces , or , as some would say , " mercenaries , " makes wars easier to begin and to fight -- it just takes money and not the citizenry , ' said Michael Ratner , of New York 's Center for Constitutional Rights .
' To the extent a population is called upon to go to war , there is resistance , a necessary resistance to prevent wars of self - aggrandizement , foolish wars , and , in the case of the United States , hegemonic imperialist wars . ' "
See the report here .
Remember , at any given moment , there might be as many -- if not more -- mercenaries fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan as there are US military forces .
For example , according to the Christian Science Monitor , in early 2008 , the number of mercenaries fighting in Iraq numbered more than 190,000 .
Remember , in addition to the benefit of not drafting US citizens to fight these perpetual wars ( and thus avoid incurring the wrath and resistance of the American public ) , mercenaries enjoy the luxury of not having to comply with the military rules of engagement .
And the stories of atrocities committed by US - employed mercenaries in Iraq and Afghanistan are too numerous to list .

In addition to the Jamie Jones case mentioned above , consider the case where Blackwater ( now called Xe ) mercenaries mowed down 17 Iraqi citizens in an unprovoked attack .
And , of course , no one at Blackwater was held accountable for these murders .
Reports of abuse , cruelty , and savagery by mercenaries in Iraq are commonplace .
According to the Global Research report , " Many soldiers of fortune on private payrolls previously served dictators in South Africa , Chile , and elsewhere . "
The Washington Post quotes Brigadier General Karl Horst , an advisor to the U.S. Joint Force Command as saying , " These guys [ mercenaries ] run loose in this country [ Iraq ] and do stupid stuff .
There 's no authority over them , so you can't come down on them hard when they escalate force . . .
They shoot people , and someone else has to deal with the aftermath .
It happens all over the place . "
And you wonder why the United States is viewed so negatively around the world ?
Granted , there is a place and proper use for mercenaries .
Fred E. Foldvary , Senior Editor of The Progress Report , rightly observes , " One alternative to U.S. military action against terrorists who have attacked the U.S. and other countries , and are threatening further attacks , is to enact Letters of Marque and Reprisal .
Article I , Section 8 , paragraph 11 of the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to ' grant letters of Marque and Reprisal and make rules concerning captures on land and water . '
A ' reprisal ' means an action taken in return for some injury .
A reprisal could be a seizing of property or guilty persons in retaliation for an attack and injury .
It could include forces used against the perpetrators for the redress of grievances .
A reprisal could even involve killing a terrorist who is threatening further harm and cannot be captured .
" ' Marque ' is related to ' marching ' and means crossing or marching across a border in order to do a reprisal .
So a letter of Marque and Reprisal would authorize a private person , not in the U.S. armed forces , to conduct reprisal operations outside the borders of the U.S.A .
" Such Letters are grantable not just by the U.S. Constitution , but also by international law , which is why it was able to be included in the Constitution .
The Letters are grantable whenever the citizens or subjects of one country are injured by those in another country and justice is denied by the government of that country , as happened with the attack by persons who were in Afghanistan . "
See Foldvary 's column here .
And that is exactly what Congressman Ron Paul attempted to do .
He proposed H.R. 3076 , the September 11 Marque and Reprisal Act of 2001 , to authorize the U.S. State Department to issue such Letters .
See Dr. Paul's Press Release here .
However , neither the Congress nor the White House -- Democrat or Republican -- has any intention of following the Constitution ; therefore , Letters of Marque and Reprisal were never authorized .
As a result , no authority has been granted to these mercenaries to wage war on behalf of anyone , especially not the people of the United States .
But what unauthorized mercenaries do accomplish is to fulfill the demands of internationalists and globalists to use unaccountable and uncontrolled ( at least by normal military protocols ) private armies for their own personal and nefarious purposes .
The next step for our politically correct " Global Force " is the authorization for homosexuals to serve openly in the US military .
This has long been the goal of globalists , and it is now about to happen .
It was globalist President Bill Clinton who introduced the current " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy that allows homosexuals to serve in the US armed forces -- but not openly .
Of course , this was a major departure from US military history .
From George Washington 's Continental army until the Clinton administration , homosexuality was deemed " incompatible " with military service .
And now globalist Barack Obama is leading Congress to change the policy even further by allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the US military .
However , please consider this : if our governmental and military leaders would cover up the raping of American servicewomen by servicemen , do n't you know that they will cover up the raping of American servicemen by homosexual servicemen ?
Mark this down : mixing sex ( heterosexual or homosexual ) and military service is a recipe for disaster .
And the potential damage inflicted upon military units ( especially combat units ) is exacerbated exponentially by the introduction of large numbers of homosexuals and women into those units .
( This is the universal sentiment of virtually every active duty or retired serviceman I have ever spoken with . )
But it does fit perfectly into the plans of the New World Order architects , who want to use the US military as much for the advancement of their politically correct agenda as they do for any actual military purpose .
Plus , dare I mention how that many violent gangs in North America are encouraging their members to join the US military in order to learn tactics and skills , which enable them to more effectively inflict their criminality upon the American people ?
Well , it 's true .
And our military brass knows it 's true , and yet they still allow these thugs to enter our military .
Hispanic gang members , especially , are entering the US military in droves .
According to a report in The American Conservative magazine , " [ R]ecent figures indicate that gang membership in the Armed Forces significantly surpasses civilian levels .
Stars and Stripes reported that 1 to 2 percent of the military are gang members , compared to 0.02 percent of the general population . "

And , sadly , while many of our fine military leaders ( not to mention many of our active duty soldiers , sailors , airmen , and Marines ) see all of this taking place , they are practically powerless to stop it , because political correctness and globalism run rampant in Washington , D.C. , including at the Pentagon .

THE DUMBEST STORY OF THE WEEK ….
The Weekly Standard ‘s Michael Goldfarb “ reported ” Tuesday that the White House is playing hardball with Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) on health care .
Citing an anonymous “ Senate aide , ” Goldfarb , a former blogger for the McCain / Palin campaign , said the Obama team “ is now threatening to put Nebraska ’s Offutt Air Force Base on the BRAC list if Nelson does n’t fall into line . ”
Now , after watching this White House operate for 11 months , this certainly does n’t sound like the kind of thing the Obama team would do .
Have we seen any evidence of these kinds of strong - arm tactics this year ?
Goldfarb noted that Offutt “ is the headquarters for US Strategic Command , the successor to Strategic Air Command , ” and was placed in Nebraska for strategic , national security reasons .
Obama would threaten to close it over a cloture vote ?
Without some credible evidence , it ’s the kind of dubious story from an unreliable writer that few serious people would find credible .
In case anyone was inclined to believe the suspect claim , Nelson ’s spokesperson told reporters , “ The rumor is not true .
This misinformation is coming from inside - the - Beltway partisans who only want to derail health care reform . ”
Soon after , White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer added , “ To be perfectly clear : these rumors are completely baseless and false . ”
So , that ’s it , right ?
Time to move on ?
Fat chance .
Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , Michelle Malkin , and a variety of right - wing personalities quickly started spreading the rumor around .
On his Fox News show yesterday , Glenn Beck not only suggested the rumor is true , but equated the non-existent threat with “ treason ” — three times .
But wait , it gets dumber .
Much dumber .
Nebraska ’s Sen. Mike Johanns and 19 other Republican senators Wednesday called for a hearing into reports that the Obama administration used the future of Offutt Air Force Base as bargaining chip in the health care debate .
Sen . Ben Nelson , D - Neb. , has said the rumors are completely false .
The White House has called them “ absurd . ”
A defense analyst said Wednesday that base closures simply do n’t work that way .
Even Johanns himself said he does n’t believe the rumors .
Then why on earth should the Senate Armed Forces Committee hold a hearing to explore a baseless right - wing rumor , unsupported by even the slightest evidence ?
Why would 20 Republican senators — half of the entire Senate GOP caucus — be so recklessly foolish ?
Because hyping lies may pay political dividends , and that ’s all that matters .
Helping demonstrate the absurdities of conservative thinking , the GOP senators and Goldfarb are now arguing that if the uncorroborated rumor is n’t true , the White House should n’t mind a federal investigation into the matter .
( The Senate Armed Forces Committee , apparently , should operate as a fact - checker for right - wing blogs . )
Goldfarb argued yesterday that the unequivocal denials of the rumor make him more inclined to believe its accuracy .
Just think , if Republicans take back Congress , far - right bloggers will publish nonsense on a Monday , and congressional committees will spend the rest of the week investigating the nonsense .
It will be the mid-90s all over again .
Jan. 29 , 2010  -- President Obama announced today a proposal to establish a $ 33 billion tax credit to encourage small businesses to hire more workers and increase wages .
The plan is one of several the president is pushing to help bolster employment in a country where one in 10 Americans no longer receives a paycheck .
The announcement comes two days after the president 's first State of the Union address , when he said that jobs must be the U.S. 's top priority this year .
The tax credit , the president said , " is a simple , easy - to - understand mechanism that will cut taxes for more than 1 million small businesses . "
Obama , who spoke today at the Chesapeake Machine Company 's manufacturing plant -- a Baltimore firm employing 40 people -- said the credit will give small businesses " an incentive to hire more people and a little bit of extra money to pay higher wages , to expand work hours or invest in their company . "
The president also reiterated his call for the Senate to pass a jobs bill .
The House last month approved a $ 150 billion bill that included some of the job creation efforts touted by the president .
Some Republicans , meanwhile , have also introduced proposals for business tax breaks and Obama said that he looked forward to working with them .
" I 'm open to any good ideas from Democrats or Republicans , " he said .
Critics argue that among Obama 's proposals , some are more realistic than others .
Below , ABCNews.com takes a look at the president 's plans and where , some say , they fall short .
Small Business Tax Credits for Hiring , Raising Wages ; Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes
Under the president 's proposed tax credit , businesses would receive a $ 5,000 tax credit for every net new employee that they employ in 2010 .
The total amount of credit will be capped at $ 500,000 per firm to ensure that the majority of the benefit goes to small businesses .
Though increasing payrolls would typically lead to an increase in Social Security taxes , under Obama 's plan , small businesses would be reimbursed for the Social Security payroll taxes they would pay on real increases in their payrolls , including wage increases .
The reimbursements would not apply to pay raise that bump compensation above $ 106,800 , the Social Security taxable maximum .
The White House estimates that 1 million small businesses would benefit from the credit .
The idea of a tax credit to promote hiring is an idea that 's been making the rounds for some time .
But critics say small businesses might hesitate to take advantage of the tax credit if lagging demand means they do n't actually have the need for more workers .
" A lot of it is just confidence , " said Gus Faucher , the director of macroeconomics at Moody's Economy.com .
The tax credit , he said , " may help a bit around the margins , but small businesses need to be convinced that the expansion is going to keep going .
I 'm not sure the tax credit is going to be that useful into getting them to hire unless they 're convinced that the demand is going to be there . "
John Schmitt , an economist at the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research , said there 's no reason not to extend the credit to large businesses too .
According to the SBA , firms with fewer than 500 workers employ just over half the U.S. private sector labor force , leaving the rest , Schmitt said , to large businesses .
" Small businesses create a lot of jobs , but large businesses create a lot of jobs too , " he said .
Schmitt questioned whether the credit might prove inefficient -- small businesses that planned on hiring anyway could still reap the benefits of the credit .
" In any kind of context like this , you want to spend money on changing people 's behavior .
You do n't want to give money to people for things that they were going to do anyway . "
The same is true , he said , for ending capital gains taxes for small businesses , which is meant to increase their investment in equipment and other capital expenditures .
Even without the elimination of capital gain taxes , " how many of these people would have made those investments anyway ? " he asked .
Obama today responded to concerns that the credit would benefit businesses that had already planned on increasing hiring .
" It 's true that in some instances this tax credit will go to businesses that were going to hire folks anyway .
But then , it simply becomes a tax cut for small businesses that will spur investment and expansion .
And that 's a good thing , too , " he said . "
And that 's why this type of tax cut is considered by economists -- who rarely agree on anything -- to be one of the most cost - effective ways of accelerating job growth . "
The president said that his proposal would also include provisions to prevent businesses from " gaming the system . "
He said , for instance , that an employer would not be eligible for the tax credit if he doubled his workforce but cut each worker 's hours in half .
" We 're not going to let you game the system to take advantage of the tax credit , unless you 're doing right by your workers , " Obama said .
Tax Incentives for Investment by All Businesses
Whether they 're for businesses large or small , incentives to get businesses to buy more equipment and the like benefits the economy because it may encourage suppliers to increase their payrolls to keep up with rising demand , supporters say .
While " it 's not directly impacting the labor market , stronger demand for investment leads to strong hiring down the road , " Faucher said .
But , once again , it may not be the most efficient way to encourage hiring -- at least not in the U.S.
That 's because so much of the manufactured products purchased by U.S. companies are made abroad .
" A lot of that money will not go to job creation here in the U.S. , " said Schmitt .
" A lot of it may go overseas . "
$ 30 Billion From Repaid Troubled Asset Relief Program Funds to Community Banks for Small Business Lending
With the credit market still tight for small businesses , expanding lending to them would allow for more hiring , supporters say .
The money could be spent , specifically , for loan guarantees that the Small Business Administration provide to banks to ensure that they do n't lose money when they lend to small businesses , said Gus Faucher , the director of macroeconomics at Moody 's Economy.com .
( The House jobs bill includes $ 354 million for SBA loan guarantees . )
" It 's an area that would be helpful in getting job growth again , " Faucher said .
But Schmitt said that extending more loans to small businesses may not have as big an impact as some might hope .
As with the hiring tax credit , there are concerns about whether a lack of demand might render the proposal largely ineffective -- ie. , why would businesses borrow to produce more goods when not enough people are buying those goods ?
" Without demand in the economy for the goods and services of small business , the availability of credit is just not sufficient , " he said .
Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill says many questions also remain about how the government could actually measure an increase in credit availability to small businesses .
" How will we be able to see and measure incremental credit availability to small businesses ?
How much credit availability currently exists for small businesses ?
Are there credit worthy businesses that are being turned down ? " he asked in an e-mail to ABCNews.com .
" Credit worthy means there is a high probability the borrower will pay back the loan in the agreed time with the agreed interest payment .
How will the community banks be selected to receive the incremental money ?
How long will it take to get this money into the system ? "
O'Neill took issue with Obama 's contention that the money used for the $ 30 billion program will be that which " Wall Street banks have repaid " through the Troubled Asset Relief Program , also known as the bank bailout .
" Since we are in a deep deficit hole this is more borrowed money .
The President implied this was available money because the banks had paid it back … this is an accounting fiction … I hope the President knows better than what he inferred , " he said .
( For more on what O'Neill had to say , click here . )
Government Investment in Infrastructure , Clean Energy Projects
The House 's jobs bill includes $ 48.3 billion for infrastructure investments , including $ 2 billion for renewable energy and electricity projects .
In his speech yesterday , Obama touted a new high - speed railroad system -- funded by the administration 's $ 787 billion stimulus program last year -- that is breaking ground today in Tampa , Fla .
" There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help our nation move goods , services and information , " he said .
The usual critique of infrastructure investments -- both those funded by last year 's stimulus and those proposed in Washington now -- is that they take a while to come to fruition .
Faucher said that , given the state of today 's economy , that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
Some have predicted , after all , that the U.S. unemployment rate will hover around 10 percent for the next two years .
" Even if it takes a while for these projects to get going , they 're still going to have a positive impact on labor market once they do start up , " he said .
He 's less optimistic , however , about job creation by the clean energy sector .
" It 's such a small part of the economy , " he said .
" Maybe they think it polls well , but in terms of actual substantive job growth it 's a drop in the bucket . "
Cut Tax Breaks for Companies Sending Jobs Overseas , Give Tax Breaks to Companies Creating Jobs in the U.S .
The advent of foreign outsourcing has long been a thorn in the side of U.S. labor advocates , particularly those who've watched the U.S. manufacturing sector shrink to a shell of its former self .
Business advocates , meanwhile , argue that cheaper labor costs overseas allow them to be more competitive in a global market .
So would tax incentives to level the playing field between U.S. 's more expensive labor costs and those of , say , China ?
University of Maryland economist Peter Morici says no .
" The Chinese give these companies a 50 percent cost advantages with currency and subsidies , " he said .
" Do you think a marginal tax rate cut is going to change that ? "
Schmitt takes a similar perspective : Whatever U.S. companies might gain in tax savings by keeping more jobs at home might be lost through the lower profits that result from such a move , which in turn would lead to less hiring .
" I think on net , it 's probably like to be a wash , " he said .
" I 'm skeptical that there is big job gains to be gained from this . "
Increasing Foreign Exports
Perhaps Obama 's boldest assertion was that the U.S. could double its exports in five years and create 2 million jobs in the process .
The president cited the Doha trade agreement and strengthening trade relations with " key partners like South Korea , Panama and Colombia " in explaining this goal .
" I was glad that he mentioned exports , " Morici said .
" ... It 's a real problem and if he does n't fix it we 're broke . "
But Morici argues that the only real way to significantly increase exports is to improve trade with one of the biggest players on the global trade scene : China .
The president , he said , needs to challenge China 's protectionist policies .
Schmitt said that the trading partners Obama cited -- South Korea , Panama and Colombia -- " are not remotely capable absorbing the volume of exports we need . "
He also argued that the Doha trade agreement wo n't prove to be a huge help .
The agreement , Schmitt said , largely focuses on trade by developing countries , not rich countries like the U.S .
" It 's wishful thinking just to get up and say we 're going to double exports and create 2 million jobs for next five years without having a plan to allow us to get there , " he said .
Convincing the world to spend more on American exports , he said , may come down to somehow lowering the value of the U.S. dollar -- an idea that would likely draw fire from those worried about inflation .
It 's not a popular solution , Schmitt conceded .
" Nobody wants to have weaker dollar , " he said , " because that sounds bad . "

SEATTLE - Cleaner air for the Washington coast is a little closer to reality .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is taking steps to require cleaner fuel for the largest ships operating in United States ' waters .
The high - sulfur , bunker fuel generally used in large cargo and cruise ships emits the same types of pollution as coal - fired power plants on shore .
Starting in 2011 , the EPA will require U.S. - registered ships to have technology on board to reduce those emissions , or to burn cleaner fuel .
However , most large ships are n't registered in the U.S. , so the rules only cover about 10 percent of the vessels that call at American ports .
Sarah Burt is an attorney for Earthjustice , the law firm representing groups that have been trying to get the EPA to make these rules since the mid-1990s .
She says the agency could be much tougher .
" The EPA has authority to regulate all ships that come into U.S. ports and waters .
And so , EPA could have applied these standards to all ships that emit pollutants , in the United States .
And that 's what we have been encouraging EPA to do . "
Burt says the new rules are n't more stringent because the agency does n't want to put American shipping companies at a disadvantage , compared to competitors registered in other countries where the pollution standards are lax .
The EPA also has already exempted about 400 older steamships from having to comply .
Burt says asthma and other chronic conditions are worse in busy port areas because of the smog created by burning bunker fuel .
" After all the petroleum products have been refined out , it 's the sludge that remains - really heavy , really contaminated stuff .
And they 've been using this for a long time , even though engines of all other classes have been forced to run on distillate fuel or Diesel . "
The EPA says it will also limit the production and sale of bunker fuel in the U.S. Burt says the agency is asking the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , which serves as the " United Nations " of the shipping industry , to approve the rules .
The IMO meets again in March .
The public is growing increasingly skeptical about the supposed crisis we face from human - caused global warming .
From the story :
The drop off in public support for the idea that global warming is a fact mostly caused by human activity looks most pronounced in Canada .
In November , 63 % of Canadians supported global warming as a man-made phenomenon .
By Dec. 23 , that support had fallen 52 % .
Among Canadians , 13 % are now not sure .
A similar trend has been noted in the United States , where confidence in global warming theory has dropped to 46 % , down from 49 % in November — and down from 51 % in July last year .
In Britain , only 43 % believe man-made global warming is a fact , down from 47 % in November and from 55 % in July .
In all three countries , there are signs of growing skepticism .
Climategate : True , the scandal did not disprove global warming , but it shredded the myth that global warming scientists are objective investigators .
Moreover , the clear intent of the global warming community ’s top scientists to stifle heterodox thinking , exposed in the purloined e-mails , reveals a lack of faith in their ability to win the debate based on a full review of the scientific evidence .

Al Gore : Al Gore ’s is the face of global warming , and that has profoundly hurt the cause .
His many factual “ exaggerations , ” his refusal to debate — if you really think the world is coming to an end , you take on all comers in every possible venue — his hypocritical lifestyle , the fortune he has made off of global warming hysteria , his inability to answer non fawning questions on the few occasions they are asked , the clear propagandistic nature of his movie , his imperiousness , the queasy feeling that something is off in his personality , his ridiculous persona , all combine to undermine belief in a climate crisis among regular folk .

The Media ’s Booster Mentality :
The media ’s credibility on this issue — among many others — is utterly shot because journalists have acted as boosters rather than skeptical reporters .
People notice and tune out the increasingly shrill stories of the coming catastrophes of melted ice , dead polar bears , and planetary breakdown .

Ignored Inconvenient Truths : Climate changes .
Five thousand years ago the Sahara was green and the San Francisco Bay was an inland valley .
Temperatures were warmer circa 1000 - 14000 , so warm that grapes grew in England and Iceland , and Greenland sustained farming communities .
The Medieval warming period has been often ignored in the climate models , adding to the belief that “ the scientists ” are stacking the deck .

The Crisis is Always Years Away :
The steady warming predicted by the climate models has not happened .
Instead , over the last decade , temperatures have remained static , perhaps with a slight tick down .
But , we are told , warming will begin again in ten years .
As I pointed out in an earlier post , we have been told the end is about ten years away for almost ten years now .
Eventually , such assertions come to seem akin to the deadbeat promising , “ The check is in the mail . ”

The Weather : Global warming proponents have used every heat wave and serious hurricane as evidence that the catastrophe was almost upon us .
Then , when the weather became arctic , they sniffed that the ignorant masses just do n’t understand the difference between climate and weather .
There is a difference , but people understand weather :
It is something they experience , touch , and feel .
When the warming trend was clear , people tended to believe .
Now that it is n’t , people do n’t .

Now that it is n’t , people do n’t .
The Cure is Worse Than the Disease : People see that global warming alarmists want to raise their heating bills , increase the price of gasoline , dismantle entire industries , and give away tens of billions to developing nations , most of which , people suspect , will end up in Swiss bank accounts .
Moreover , the stated intent by the bureaucrats and technocrats to use global warming as a pretext to establish global governance — with themselves in charge — along with the statements by some alarmists extolling China ’s tyrannical one child policy and their promotion of radical population control , leaves many preferring to face the risks of warming rather than be subjected to the policies supposedly needed to stop it .

The General Collapse of Authority : “ Trust us , we ’re the experts , ” used to go a long way .
No more .
With the sciences clearly politicized , with ubiquitous corruption across the breadth and depth of the governing and intellectual classes — both liberal and conservative — people no longer believe what they are told .
I think there are many good and rational reasons for the dramatic decline in public belief in global warming hysteria .
In no particular order , and without attempting to be comprehensive , they are : Increasingly , the governing class seeks to push the governed where they do n’t want to go .
That works in autocratic societies .
But we are still free .
Unless the global warming alarmists change their ways , the public ’s support for fighting “ climate change ” will continue to deflate like a tire punctured by a nail .
The recent global uptick in atmospheric methane levels is confirmed today by new figures from NIWA ’s Baring Head station , near Wellington .
Southern hemisphere methane rose by 0.7 % over the two years 2007 - 2008 .
The video above , narrated by tropospheric chemist Katja Riedel gives an inside view of what goes on in and above the Baring Head lighthouse — well worth a view .
The increase comes after a three year period when levels had appeared to stabilise , as NIWA ’s graph shows :
From NIWA ’s press release :
This [ … ] accounts for more than half of the growth observed over the ten years 1999â € “ 2008 ( 1.2 % ) .
Methane is the second most important contributor to global warming behind carbon dioxide , though its abundance in the atmosphere is far lower .
Additional methane traps twenty one times more heat over 100 years than the same mass of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) .
â€
œThe evidence we have shows that methane in the atmosphere is now more than double what it ever was during the 800,000 years before 1700 ADâ€ says NIWA Principal Scientist , Dr Keith Lassey .
This is based on analyses of ancient air trapped in polar ice that has been extracted and dated .
The new figures confirm the global picture compiled by NOAA in the US .
The increase is thought to be related to a return to wetter conditions in the tropics after a relatively dry period from 1999â € “ 2006 and warming in the Arctic .
There ’s a lot more background information on NIWA ’s news page .

Auf der Studentendemonstration am 17.11.09 hatte ein Polizist einen Totenkopf - Aufkleber auf seinem Schlagstock .
Wir haben Ulrich Faßbender , den Leiter der Pressestelle des Polizeipräsidiums Essen und Tanja Horn , die Pressesprecherin dazu befragt .
Ruhrbarone : Was ist in dieser Angelegenheit bisher passiert ?
Horn : Derjenige ist relativ schnell identifiziert worden .
Natürlich ist er innendienstlich sehr dazu befragt worden .
Es ist ein Verfahren eingeleitet worden .
Der Kollege hat glaubhaft erklärt , dass der Totenkopf aus dem Videospiel „ Guitar Hero “ stammt .
Da ist ein Aufkleber - Set dabei .
Mit Rosen , Vögelchen und einem Totenkopf .
Den hat er auf seinen Schlagstock geklebt .
Mindestens geschmacklos , aber völlig nicht darüber nachgedacht .
Ruhrbarone : Was meinen
Sie mit geschmacklos ?
Horn : Damit meine ich , dass es nicht mehr und nicht weniger ist .
Es ist kein Verstoß gegen irgendwelche gesetzliche Norm .
Es macht ein ganz schlechtes Gefühl .
Und ich finde es auch nicht in Ordnung .
Und deswegen wurde der Kollege innendienstlich zur Rechenschaft gezogen .
Faßbender : Der Kollege hat uns glaubhaft versichern können , dass er die unterstellte Gesinnung in keinster Weise damit verbunden hat .
Dieses Fehlverhalten des Beamten hat natürlich das Ansehen der Polizei in Misskredit gebracht .
Wir müssen gucken , inwieweit es intern sanktioniert werde muss .
Ruhrbarone : Und inwieweit wird es sanktioniert ?

Faßbender : Dem Kollegen wurde ordentlich der Kopf gewaschen und damit ist das Ding für die Zukunft erledigt .
Ruhrbarone : Keine dienstrechtlichen Folgen ?
Faßbender : Genau .
Ruhrbarone : Keine Strafe ?
Faßbender : Keine .
Die Konsequenzen wären für ihn drastischer ausgefallen , wenn wir den Eindruck gehabt hätten , dass es Rechtstendenzen bei dem Kollegen gegeben hat .
Aber das ist nicht der Fall .
Ruhrbarone : .. weil der Polizist unwissend war ?
Aber Unwissenheit schützt doch nicht vor Strafe .
Faßbender : Dass das jetzt mit Ahnungslosigkeit erklärt wird , das ist natürlich ein anderes Extrem .
Wo sie natürlich zu Recht einhaken und sagen : dann darf ihm das trotzdem nicht passieren .
Gut .
Aber das sind auch alles nur Menschen , die Fehler machen .
Ruhrbarone : Werden die Polizisten während der Ausbildung denn nicht über die Nazi -Symbolik aufgeklärt ?
Horn : Bestandteil der polizeilichen Ausbildung ist auch Staatsbürgerkunde .
Da findet auch die deutsche Geschichte ihren Anteil .
Da wird darüber geredet .
Ruhrbarone : Reicht ein Gespräch aus , damit das in der Zukunft nicht mehr passiert ?
Faßbender : Das ist sehr präventiv .
Das ist durch die Diskussion in der Öffentlichkeit nicht nur in Essen , sondern in ganzem Land ein Thema geworden .
Dass dieser Kollege aus Gedankenlosigkeit , Gleichgültigkeit , keine Ahnung was , nicht darüber nachgedacht hat , was das bedeutet , bei einer Demo einen Schlagstock mit diesem Symbol zu tragen .
Ruhrbarone :
Wie konnten die anderen Kollegen den Aufkleber nicht früher bemerken und melden ?
Faßbender : Der Aufkleber ist ja schon in der Demo entfernt worden .
Ruhrbarone : Nachdem ihn einige Demonstranten bemerkt haben und Fotos davon gemacht haben .
Warum nicht davor ?
Horn :
Ich weiß nicht , wie lange der Kollege den Aufkleber hatte .
Ich weiß auch nicht , ob das andere Kollegen bemerkt haben .
Wir haben auch niemanden aus der Hundertschaft dazu befragt .
Das ist nicht gemacht worden .
Man hat das mit dem Kollegen entsprechend so bearbeitet , wie wir das besprochen haben .
Und wie es aus meiner Sicht auch richtig ist .
Ruhrbarone : Konnten Sie in diesem Gespräch nicht erfahren , wie lange er den Aufkleber schon hatte ?
Horn :
Ich weiß nicht , wie lange er den schon hatte .
Wir haben ja das Gespräch nicht geführt , das haben seine Chefs gemacht .
Alles was wir wissen müssen , ist bekannt .
Ruhrbarone : Haben Sie ein Protokoll von diesem Gespräch ?
Horn : Nein .
Ruhrbarone :
Es ist also nicht auszuschließen , dass Kollegen , die über diese Symbolik wussten , den Aufkleber bei ihrem Kollegen bemerkt haben .
Und nichts gemacht haben .
Finden
Sie das nicht interessant zu hinterfragen ?
Horn : Ja doch , das finde ich auch interessant .
Aber ich weiß es jetzt einfach nicht .
This is the sixth post in the article series " Vim Plugins You Should Know About " .
This time I am going to introduce you to a vim plugin called " nerd_tree.vim " .
It 's so useful that I can't imagine working without it in vim .
Nerd
Tree is a nifty plugin that allows you to explore the file system and open files and directories directly from vim .
It opens the file system tree in a new vim window and you may use keyboard shortcuts and mouse to open files in new tabs , in new horizontal and vertical splits , quickly navigate between directories and create bookmarks for your most important projects .
This plugin was written by Marty Grenfell ( also known as scrooloose ) .

Bacterial Vaginosis ( BV ) What is BV ?
Once upon a time , for a personal reason , I had got interested to find about bacterial vaginosis ( BV - also known as bacterial vaginitis ) .
And then I came to acquire knowledge on BV and I now know enough that I can share with you .
I am an ordinary person , and not a doctor , nor a medical professional , nor medically qualified .
I have researched on the Internet while I did my own personal study and online research on the issue , and also spoke / wrote to a lot of other women who had / have this bacterial infection of the vagina .
What I have realized is that BV often becomes a recurring problem because the conventional treatments often do not aim at eliminating the root cause but treat the symptoms - the root cause is most often not taken care of and hence the infection keeps coming back in the longer run .
Using a natural remedy to eliminate the root cause is one of the better ways to treat it , because that way the issue stands the least chance of coming back .
To me , this understanding is valuable for anyone suffering from this vaginal issue , and even more so if it is recurring , and I share the details here .
Further , I share an outline of the 3 steps to the 3 - day permanent natural cure ( without infringing a certain copyright and intellectual right , to the extent possible ) on this page .
Bacterial vaginosis is a bacterial disease that affects the vagina of the women .
This is found most commonly in women in their menstrual age - the phase of life in which the woman gets periods .
BV is infamous for coming back and recurring in spite of prescribed antibiotic treatments .
In other words , antibiotics have often been unsuccessful in providing permanent relief from the bacterial infection .
The root cause of the anomaly is believed to be imbalance of pH ( acidity levels ) inside the vagina , which leads to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria resulting in an unhealthy vaginal flora .
However , while there are clear ways to treat the problem , there is no expert consensus on what the root cause of the infection is .
I describe the natural treatments of BV on this page .
The human vagina sees a balance of good and bad bacteria , and the problem happens when the bad bacteria ( anaerobes ) outgrow the good bacteria leading to problems .
In fact , contrary to the popular belief that yeast infections are more common , more than half of vaginal infections among women at a given time could be caused by bacteria rather than yeast .
In other words , many times women think that they are infected with yeast while the reality is that they are infected with the BV .
The fact that not one but multiple species of bacteria are responsible for this vaginal infection , makes it a tough challenge to solve bacterial vaginosis permanently .
It is often observed that antibiotics provide temporary relief to the problems but the symptoms keep coming back after a temporary improvement .
Picture : Cell - level details for uteral cervix ( post - vaginal ) infested with " bad " bacteria
There can be multiple causes behind bacterial vaginosis .
One of the popular beliefs is that the cause is sexual .
A school of thought suggests that this issue is an STD that occurs among women with multiple sex partners .
While that is true in some cases , but in general an infection in the vagina ( and the general female reproductive organs ) can occur due to other reasons too .
The core of the problem lies in imbalance of pH inside the vagina , leading to imbalance in the desired levels of bacteria inside the female reproductive canal .
Menopause , thongs and anaemia are known to cause BV .
Here is more information on the causes behind the infection .
The most noticeable symptom of bacterial vaginosis is a foul odor that originates in the vagina .
This odor is fishy in nature .
This usually co-occurs with a discharge from the vagina ( also foul - smelling : more on our BV Symptoms page ) , a burning sensation , possible itching inside and around the vagina / vulva .
A well - known symptom of bacterial vaginosis is to experience discharge of white , grey , yellowish or greenish color .
The infected woman may experience some pain in the vaginal area .
BV may further lead to infection of the bladder and the urethra as well as skin infection around the vulva ( genitals ) .
Read this page for the detailed primary and secondary symptoms : the symptoms of BV .
BV can lead to long - lasting serious problems if it is not treated .
The right treatment can quickly cure the problem , but if not treated then it can inflate the risk of getting one affected with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ( PID ) , cervicitis ( at the uterus orifice ) and endometritis .
This infection , during pregnancy , adds to the complication , and one may stand at the risk of facing undesirable pregnancy outcomes .
Pregnant women are known to have premature delivery and stillbirth as consequence of having BV during the pregnancy period .
This infection of the vagina is at times mistaken by some people as other issues such as yeast infection and trichomoniasis .
Many people wrongly believe the bacterial vaginosis to be a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) caused by being sexually active with multiple partners .
BV is not known to be directly harmful to the uterus or the fallopian tubes .
Also , this bacteria - driven issue of the human vagina is not related to other problems of the reproductive organs such as genital warts ( caused by human papillomavirus - HPV ) etc .
A woman suffering from BV will , however , become more susceptible to other STDs such as herpes , chlamydia , HIV and gonorrhoea , and can pass HIV easily to her partner .
It has also been found in a study that bacterial vaginosis is associated with a 357 % increase in cervical intraepithelial neplasia ( CIN ) , a cervical cell abnormality that can potentially lead to cervical cancer .
So it is important to treat the vaginal condition and eliminate the unhealthy bacteria at the earliest to prevent further complications .
In a nutshell , BV is an infection caused by high increase of bad bacteria .
The causes are still not very clear and has been a topic of discussions and experiments till date , but the core disturbance happens when the pH ( acidity ) balance in the human vagina is not at the desired level .
This is very much curable with the right treatment - in fact some of the best natural remedies can quickly arrest and cure the problem by permanently resetting the levels of vaginal acidity levels .
Health advisers tend to prescribe antibiotics such as metronidazole and clindamycin to cure the problem .
These antibiotics kill the vaginal bacteria including the offending ones , resulting in temporary control and prevention but not a permanent cure .
In the cases that the vagina self - heals , the bad bacteria gets permanently eliminated , resulting in permanent elimination of bacterial vaginosis and a healthy vagina .
If the vagina does not self - heal then the cure is not permanent .
Bacterial vaginosis is an issue that is known to come back and recur .
Chronic BV is an extremely common situation in spite of full - fledged conventional treatment .
The root cause that makes this issue recur , is also related to the genital ( in - vagina ) pH .
Even if an initial treatment with antibiotic gets the BV under control , unless the pH ( acidity ) of the vagina is not brought back to the normal levels , the microbes ( bacteria ) will start growing again after 3 - 4 weeks , once the effect of the antibiotics go away .
The real solution to BV is to control the vaginal pH once and for all .
The best way to do this is to follow healthy lifestyle practices , have food and drinks that allow the vaginal flora to remain healthy and initially controlling the aggravated levels of the bacteria inside the vagina .
The best way to do this is to follow natural treatment methods , which rely upon natural elements that the body can take and sustain for long periods of time , and in fact become healthier .
Sustained long antibiotic treatment is extremely unhealthy .
Many women suffering from the chronic form of this vaginal problem have been best able to cure their problems altogether using using natural elements for the cure .
An Innocent Model of Linear Logic by Paul - André Melliès was referenced by Noam in a serendipitious subthread of the " Claiming Infinities " thread .
Here 's the abstract :
Since its early days , deterministic sequential game semantics has been limited to linear or polarized fragments of linear logic .
Every attempt to extend the semantics to full propositional linear logic has bumped against the so - called Blass problem , which indicates ( misleadingly ) that a category of sequential games cannot be self - dual and cartesian at the same time .
We circumvent this problem by considering ( 1 ) that sequential games are inherently positional ; ( 2 ) that they admit internal positions as well as external positions .
We construct in this way a sequential game model of propositional linear logic , which incorporates two variants of the innocent arena game model : the well - bracketed and the non well - bracketed ones .
The introduction goes on to refer to to André Joyal 's " Category Y with Conway games as objects , and winning strategies as morphisms , composed by sequential interaction , " and points out that " it is a precursor of game semantics for proof theory and programming languages , " and is " a self - dual category of sequential games . "
The foreword mentions that the paper goes on to give " a crash course on asynchronous games " and then " constructs a linear continuation monad equivalent to the identity functor , by allowing internal positions in our games , [ which ] circumvents the Blass problem and defines a model of linear logic . "
Jacques Carette called this paper mind - blowing .
My mind - blow warning light already exploded .
I 'm posting this paper because I know a number of LtUers are interested in these topics , and this way I can buttonhole one of them the next time I see them and ask them to explain it to me . ;)
In a stunning move , the Ontario College of Pharmacists has prohibited Ontario pharmacies from selling health products that are not approved for safety and efficacy by Health Canada .
This directive , which takes effect immediately , banishes some of the most questionable “ alternative ” health products from pharmacy shelves .
This message was sent to all pharmacies and pharmacists on January 20 , 2010 :
ADVISORY NOTICE To All Pharmacists and Pharmacies OCP Position re : Sale of Non-Approved Marketed Health Products Dear Colleague :
At its meeting on December 10 , 2009 the Council of the Ontario College of Pharmacists approved the adoption of the following national position statement approved by the Board of the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities ( NAPRA ) at its November meeting : “ Pharmacists should not sell a marketed health product without a Drug Identification Number ( DIN ) , Natural Health Product Number ( NPN ) or Drug Identification Number for Homeopathic Medicine ( DIN - HM ) . ”
Accordingly , pharmacists are advised not to purchase or accept for sale any marketed health products , including natural health products , that do not possess a DIN , NPN , or DIN - HM .
A copy of the position statement can be found on the NAPRA website www.napra.ca.
Your cooperation is much appreciated .
Yours truly ,

This is a bold , decisive decision by a pharmacy regulator , and a tremendous victory for advocates of science - based pharmacy .
As I ’ve pointed out , the Canadian framework for regulating supplements , vitamins , and alternative health products ( the Natural Health Products Regulations ) were enacted in 2004 , but the implementation has been slow .
With the regulations , Health Canada mandated basic manufacturing quality standards , but significantly relaxed the standard for efficacy claims ( compared to drugs ) .
Manufacturers are permitted to make efficacy claims based on “ traditional uses ” and other sources that are essentially anecdotal in nature .
The NHP regulations apply to nutritional supplements , probiotics , traditional Chinese medicine , vitamins , herbal products , and homeopathy .
Over 10,000 natural health products have been approved for sale by Health Canada , but thousands of products are unapproved , and openly sold on pharmacy shelves .
Why ?
Health Canada permits the sale of unapproved products , as long as an application for review has been filed .
But this left pharmacists in a difficult position when dealing with unapproved products :
Had an application for review been filed ?
There was no easy way to determine this .
Did an unapproved product meet basic manufacturing & quality standards ?
There was no regulator assurance .
But with this order , the Ontario College of Pharmacists has eliminated the issue :
If it is n’t approved , it can not be sold in an Ontario pharmacy .
I was particularly pleased to see this statement from the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities :
Pharmacists are obliged to hold the health and safety of the public or patient as their first and foremost consideration .
As such , they must follow very specific standards of practice to fulfill this role .
When presented with a product that does not bear a number issued by Health Canada , it leaves the pharmacist and their patient with no confirmation that the product was properly assessed for its safety , efficacy and quality nor granted approval for sale .
and
Even though an argument can be made that an NHP or homeopathic product without a product license is not necessarily unsafe , the reverse is also true .
There is no guarantee that the required criteria for product safety were met .
Pharmacists should not be placed in situations where they may be in a position to sell products that have not received approval for sale in Canada .
Fantastic .
Professionalism and patient safety first .
Is a particular product licensed by Health Canada ?
You can look it up here , in Health Canada ’s Licensed Natural Health Products Database .
Or you can look on the package .
If the product does not have a DIN ( drug identification number ) NPN ( natural health product number ) or DIN - HM ( homeopathic remedy number ) , then the product is not approved .
It may not be sold in an Ontario pharmacy .
Does this take all the pseudoscience out of Ontario pharmacies ?
No .
The fact that “ approved ” homeopathic remedies are permitted for sale in pharmacies is an embarrassment to the profession of pharmacy ( and a lesson that British pharmacies are learning the hard way ) .
Checking through the database , there are some dubious “ cleanse ” and “ detox ” products that have actually been approved for sale and given NPNs .
( Happily , no oil of oregano products appear to have been approved , so they should be disappearing from pharmacy shelves ) .
But at a minimum , licensure signals to pharmacists and consumers that what is on the label should actually be what ’s in the bottle .
Will this directive restrict patient access to natural health products ?
No .
Over 10,000 products have been approved for sale in Canada .
This is enough to fill a warehouse - sized pharmacy .
If consumers really want unlicensed products , they can buy them elsewhere .
Pharmacies in Ontario are raising the quality standard for consumers – only approved products may be sold .
While there are still a lot of unproven and questionable products that remain on pharmacy shelves , today we ’ll celebrate this massive WIN in Ontario .
Kudos to the Ontario College of Pharmacists for this move to enhance pharmacy practice and patient safety .
Iran election unrest an example of US ' naked political scheming ' behind free speech facade , says Communist party editorial
The United States used " online warfare " to stir up unrest in Iran after last year 's elections , the Chinese Communist party newspaper claimed today , hitting back at Hillary Clinton 's speech last week about internet freedom .
An editorial in the People 's Daily accused the US of launching a " hacker brigade " and said it had used social media such as Twitter to spread rumours and create trouble .
" Behind what America calls free speech is naked political scheming .
How did the unrest after the Iranian election come about ? " said the editorial , signed by Wang Xiaoyang .
" It was because online warfare launched by America , via YouTube video and Twitter microblogging , spread rumours , created splits , stirred up and sowed discord between the followers of conservative reformist factions . "
Washington said at the time of the unrest that it had asked Twitter , which was embraced by Iranian anti-government protesters , to remain open .
Several social media sites , including YouTube , Facebook and Twitter , have been blocked in China in the last year .
The editorial asked rhetorically whether obscenity or activities promoting terrorism would be allowed on the net in the US .
" We 're afraid that in the eyes of American politicians , only information controlled by America is free information , only news acknowledged by America is free news , only speech approved by America is free speech , and only information flow that suits American interests is free information flow , " it added .
It attacked the decision to cut off of Microsoft 's instant messaging services to nations covered by US sanctions , including Cuba , Iran , Syria , Sudan and North Korea , as violating America 's stated desire for free information flow .
Washington later said that such services fostered democracy and encouraged their restoration .
China initially gave a low - key response to Google 's announcement that it was no longer willing to censor google .cn .
The internet giant said it had reached its decision following a Chinese - originated cyber attack targeting the email accounts of human rights activists , and in light of increasing online censorship .
Clinton 's direct challenge to China , in a speech that had echoes of the cold war with its references to the Berlin wall and an " information curtain " , led Beijing to warn that US criticism could damage bilateral relations .
Clinton called on China to hold a full and open investigation into the December attack on Google .
In an interview carried by several Chinese newspapers today , Zhou Yonglin , deputy operations director of the national computer network emergency response technical team , said : " Everyone with technical knowledge of computers knows that just because a hacker used an IP address in China , the attack was not necessarily launched by a Chinese hacker . "
US diplomats sought to reach out to the Chinese public by briefing bloggers in China on Friday .
They held a similar meeting during Barack Obama 's visit in November .
In this way , the IAS is both independent and deeply interconnected with , and supported by , antiauthoritarian , anarchist and like - minded individuals , organizations , and movements .
The IAS , in short , is about the antiauthoritarian Left sustaining itself through mutual aid and solidarity .
It ’s an organization which seeks to further develop the effectiveness and reach of anarchism .

Britons have been warned to brace themselves for an increase in food prices as plunging temperatures leave farmers unable to harvest vegetables and hauliers struggle to distribute fresh produce .
Gordon Brown , who will chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee early this week to discuss the freeze , was today forced to reassure the country that it would not run out of gas or grit for its roads during the coldest weather in 30 years .
Police confirmed today that the weather - related death toll had risen to 26 .
A 90 - year - old woman froze to death in her garden near Barnsley after falling in the snow .
Widow Mary Priestland was discovered when her neighbour called round to make her tea .
A 42 - year - old Newcastle woman died after being found lying in the snow this morning .
She had told her family she was going for a walk at 7 pm on Friday .
Concerns have now switched to food supply .
Sub - zero temperatures have made it impossible to extract some vegetables from the ground .
Producers of brussels sprouts and cabbages are all reporting problems with harvesting .
Cauliflowers are said to have turned to " mush " in the sustained frost , with the result that only imported ones are available – at more than £ 2 each .
" Food is selling fast and there is a problem with replenishing it , " said Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses .
" One business I spoke to said it was like Christmas Eve , with people rushing to buy up food .
This will inevitably have an impact on food prices . "
Food prices had already started to edge up after a sustained period of low inflation .
Food inflation increased by 3.7 % in December , up from 2.8 % in November , said the British Retail Consortium .
In Ireland , 6,000 acres of potatoes remains unharvested and there are claims that up to three - quarters of the crop may be ruined .
Potato growers in Northern Ireland say they are facing some of the biggest losses in recent history because of frost damage .
Meanwhile , greengrocers in some of the worst - hit areas are reporting shortages , with the price of carrots and parsnips reportedly rising by 30 % in some small shops .
A spokesman for the National Farmers ' Union said : " There are isolated examples of farms struggling to get milk supplies out , but so far the majority of farmers , although finding it difficult , are getting on with the job . "
Milk suppliers in Somerset said they feared they may have to dump 100,000 litres of organic milk because tankers could not get through .
In a move that underscores the severity of the situation , on Monday the government will permit an emergency relaxation of European laws regulating the driving hours for hauliers involved in the distribution of animal feed .
Under the temporary rules , the hauliers will be allowed to drive for 10 hours rather than the EU maximum of nine .
There will also be a reduction in their mandatory daily rest requirements , from 11 to nine hours .
Today , the prime minister insisted gas supplies were not running out , despite record levels of demand .
In a podcast from Downing Street , Brown said : " I can assure you : supplies are not running out .
We 've got plenty of gas in our own backyard – the North Sea – and we also have access to the large reserves in Norway and Netherlands . "
Last week , nearly 100 large businesses were forced to stop using gas in an attempt to conserve supplies .
Brown also tried to allay concerns over salt stocks .
" Working with the suppliers and the highway authorities , we are making sure stocks of salt to grit roads and pavements get to where they 're most needed , " he said .
On Friday , a government emergency planning committee met to discuss the UK 's state of preparation if the cold weather continues .
The committee heard the country has a stockpile of 320,000 tonnes of gritting salt , but transport sources suggest the UK is getting through 60,000 tonnes a day , more than four times the amount produced .
Further supplies are due to arrive from Spain and the US later this month .
However , some have questioned how the UK will cope if these supplies prove insufficient and the cold snap returns .
" The government has failed to build up a strategic Highways Agency reserve and ministers have sat on their hands , " said the Conservatives ' local government spokeswoman , Caroline Spelman .
Edmund King , president of the AA , said he had raised concerns about salt supplies before Christmas .
" We were not assured that everyone was as prepared as they should have been … and that 's why I wrote to the Local Government Association in November , prior to the cold snap , " King told the BBC .
" There is more we could have done . "

Once word hit that certain departments within South England Financial were going to be outsourced , employees naturally started to get a bit nervious .
Being a contractor — and therefore exempt from any kind of nice severance package — Jon Kipper was determined to find a new job before the axe fell .
After about a month of tossing his resumé out into the world , Jon received a call from a very perky recuriter regarding a position that was almost a dead ringer to what he was doing .
Although the position was in London — a good two hours from his flat by train —
Jon liked the idea of working in the big city with all the glitz and glare .
" I tweaked your resumé a bit to make it look a little more professional , and the guys at PoshBank were very impressed and are keen to meet you " he joyfully exclaimed .
" Just between you and me , I think you 're a shoe - in for the job . "
He went on to explain that the folks at PoshBank had been searching for months for just the right candidate and , of all the applicants submitted , only Jon was considered worthy of an interview .
All he really had to do was just show up .
Unable to resist a sure thing , Jon gathered up his best suit , requested a day off at his current job ( unpaid , obviously ) and booked the extortionate train tickets to London .
When the day of the interview arrived , Jon was pumped up and ready to go .
Just to make sure that he was well prepared , Jon took along a manilla envelope containing a copy of the Job Description , a few extra copies of his resumé , and an article about the 20 most - asked interview questions at mega - sized financial institutions .
The latter would be perfect for the time sitting on the train to rehearse a few questions and then hopefully win the hearts of the big bad London boys .
Jon arrived in good time and was quickly introduced to the friendly interviewers : the Head of IT .
After a few straightforward questions on Active Directory , Jon 's nerves were under control and the interviewer moved on to address one of the points on his resumé .
" Lotus Notes ... " he began .
This is going to be a walk in the park !
Jon thought , After using Outlook for so long , how much different can Notes be for reading email ?
" ... Tell me .
How you would go about configuring the security of a new Domino server and adding it to the current cluster " .
Jon froze .
" Um , actually , that 's not something I can do " , he eventually stuttered , " After all , my mail security expertise was with Microsoft Exchange .
I 've never touched a Domino Server , but I 'd be eager though to learn — "
" Then why have you listed ' 3 years of Lotus Notes Server configuration and administration ' as one of your key skills ? "
Jon swallowed hard .
" Ummm ... may I take a look at that ? "
Jon leaned over and could n't believe what he saw .
Rather than the resumé he had posted , it was a hideously formatted bastardisation that was looked like the most hideous Word template ever .
As if that was n't bad enough , it included line after line of exaggeration in every single skill listed .
Jon figured that to be able to attain the experience listed , he would have needed to start in I.T. sometime after turning 15 .
Jon quickly produced the real McCoy from his manilla envelope and placed it next to the offending article .
The Head of IT looked as though he was going to explode .
After a deep breath , and through clenched teeth , he stood up slowly , and thanked Jon for his time .
He then swung open the door and headed back to the lobby where he commanded one of the receptionists to " please show Mr. Kipper to the exit " .
Jon felt swindled .
Not only had he annoyed a potential employer through no fault of his own , but he had lost a day 's pay doing so .
And as if that was n't bad enough , the expensive British Rail ticket for the ride home added a nice little insult to his injury .
Maybe the bright lights of London are n't for a simple lad like me , he thought to himself as he walked back to the train station .
But just then , the phone rang .
He picked it up with his stardard greeting , " Hello this is Jon Kipper speaking . "
" Hey Jon !
My name is Darren .
I found your resumé and I think you'd be perfect for a permanent position at a fantastic financial institution .
How soon can you get to London for an interview ? "
Maybe things were looking up after all .
" I 'm actually in London at the moment .
I could do it later this afternoon if that 's not too short notice . "
Jon figured that he might finally be able to justify the overpriced train tickets .
" Fantastic !
I 'll call the guys back and see if we can set something up for this afternoon .
I just need to reformat your resumé and send it over , " he paused for a moment and added , " but from what I 've told them , they seemed pretty impressed .
They 're a great outfit called ' PoshBank ' right in the heart of the city . "
Jon was at a loss for words .
" Between you and me , " the recruiter jumped in , filling the moment of silence , " I think you 're a shoe - in for the job .
They 've only interviewed one other guy , and apparently he was a complete loser " .
Are you considering implementing video content into your campaign ?
According to research , there ’s never been a better time to do so !
55 % of people watch some form of video content every day .
By creating a great video , you could reach your audience in a new and exciting way .
Here ’s what you need to know about creating the best brand videos .
1. Storyboard Before Shooting
Creating video content can be fun .
However , it ’s also extremely time - consuming .
To shorten your production time and ensure that your video gets to your audience in a timely manner , create storyboards for your videos .
That way , you ’ll know exactly what shots you need before you even get into the field .
2. Inform First , Sell Second
Writing scripts for digital marketing videos can be surprisingly tricky .
You ’ll need to strike a different tone than you would in , say , a blog , or even a social media post .
You ’ll want to approach your script from a conversational tone .
Remember , someone has to deliver the lines you ’re writing — do they sound natural ?
Along those lines , make sure you ’re not leaning too hard on marketing speak .
Think of how you write blog posts .
Your goal should always be to provide your audience with information instead of selling them on a product or else you ’ll risk losing your audience ’s trust .
3. Choose The Right Spokesperson
Remember those boring educational videos you watched in school ?
The ones where people droned on and on ?
If you ’re not careful , your video marketing could bear a striking resemblance to those snooze - inducing videos .
Whether you ’re using talking heads or a pure and simple voice - over , use the right cast .
Your spokesperson ( or spokespeople ) should be enthusiastic about what they ’re saying .
If your own cast is n’t excited about your content , why should your audience ?
4. Set The Tone With Music
It ’s impossible to imagine “ Jaws ” without the terrifying music alerting us of the shark ’s presence , or the abrasive screeching violins during the shower scene in “ Psycho . ”
These examples show just how powerful music is .
Try to cut video content along with music that matches the mood you ’re trying to set .
Ideally , you ’ll want to use something fun and upbeat that does n’t distract from your content .
5. End With a Strong Call to Action
When push comes to shove , your brand videos are like any other form of content your brand publishes — it needs to further your sales goals by encouraging your audience to take action .
As you script your video , do n’t forget to ensure it includes a strong , thorough CTA .
Let customers know what you ’d like them to do , and how you ’d like them to reach you .
For example , “ To get your quote today , be sure to call us at [ phone number ] . ”
Use These Tips to Create the Best Brand Videos
Now you have everything you need to create the best brand videos out there .
Good luck , and we ca n’t wait to see what you create !

CHAPTER 5 LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT
The problem of how thought and language are related is one of the major problems in contemporary philosophy , and it is particularly troublesome for Materialism which is committed to the denial of dualism .
The main reason for the difficulty is that we do not have a clear command of the concepts of thought and language .
Consequently , different claims about their relation are possible -- depending on how " thought " and " language " are understood .
In this chapter I propose to discuss their relation based on Sellars ' latest writings .
I. DESIDERATA
Any proposed theory of the relation of thought to language must be able to meet the following conditions of adequacy .
Give an explanation for the pre-linguistic intelligent behavior of children .
That children behave intelligently is commonly taken for granted .
This is exemplified by various behaviors : the ability to discriminate and classify objects , the strategies and ' insights ' used by children to achieve given ends .
The use of tools is an obvious example .
Even such seeming obvious actions as avoiding bumping into things , not tripping over things , reaching to get something , not falling from heights , must be explained .
A specific recommendation would be that any proposed theory should come to grips with the findings and speculations of such child psychologists as Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky .
{1} Give an explanation for the claims of the deaf and blind , or the deaf and mute that they had thoughts prior to learning a language ; e.g. , the case of Helen Keller and I .
Ballard .
{2} Also take into account the data available about children growing up in isolation from language , such as the case of Victor , the " wild boy of Aveyron , " who was found in Southern France in 1799 ; the Indian girls Kamala and Amala , who were found in Midnapur , India , in 1920 ; Kaspar Hauser , who was found near Hanover in 1823 ; and the girl Genie , who was found in 1970 .
{3} Give an explanation for the seemingly intelligent behavior of animals as reported by such ethologists as Konrad Lorenz .
{4} Animals manage to move about avoiding obstacles and dangerous situations .
They stalk and kill effectively .
Sometimes they use tools for certain ends .
And some of these tool discoveries seem to be passed from generation to generation .
For example , the learned behavior of Japanese macaques of Koshima Island to wash sand from sweet potatoes and grains of wheat before eating them .
Explain the communication between animals : e.g. , the dance of the bees , chimps and gorillas using a sign " language , " {5} dolphin communication .
{6} Account for the possibility of humans learning a language .
How is it that humans are able to learn a conventional language such as English , while no other animals can -- not even the chimps and gorillas ( Washoe , Koko ) .
What resources are needed to learn a language ?
Account for the existence of a distinction in our language between thoughts and language .
We do make a distinction between these and describe them as if they were independent .
And how do we account for such phenomena as our ability to perceive much more than we have words to express .
For example , we can distinguish between various hues of colors for which we have no names .
Then there is the phenomenon of not being able to express what we are thinking , or not finding the adequate words which express our thoughts .
How is this possible ?
Distinguish , if possible , a human use of language from an ideal computer's .
Can an ideal computer be said to be intelligent ?
What criteria must be satisfied ?
Is the Turing test adequate ?
{7} Some claim that the existence of Gödel 's incompleteness theorem makes it theoretically impossible for a computer to think .
{8} Relate the theory of thought and language to the findings of brain research .
For example , is the theory consistent with our knowledge of various forms of brain dysfunctions , such as , aphasia , agnosia , etc.?{9}
I am not proposing to consider all these -- that would be a staggering undertaking .
I am only suggesting that any adequate theory of thought and language must do justice to these questions and explain the phenomena .
What I will try to do is at least not write in such a way as if I were totally unaware of these areas of research , and I certainly do n't want to claim anything that goes counter to what is well established by science .
II .
THOUGHT AND CONVENTIONAL LANGUAGE
Philosophers are divided on whether thought can exist prior to the acquisition of a conventional language .
As a first approximation , it appears that behaviorists favor the total dependence of thought on language .
I have in mind Watson , Ryle , Wittgenstein , Malcolm , Skinner , Rorty , Quine , and Rosenberg .
The " mentalists " or " cognitivists " appear to favor the partial independence of thought from language .
I have in mind Descartes , Locke , Kant , Husserl , Russell , Moore , Lewis , Piaget , Hall , Marras , Chisholm , Castañeda , Chomsky , and Fodor .
On first impression , I would place Sellars with the behaviorists and ascribe to him the view that thought is dependent on language .
And looking over the critical literature on Sellars , this view is sometimes ascribed to him .
{10 } In general , the shared claim of Sellars ' critics is that language genetically presupposes , at least , some kind of sign understanding .
These critics would all probably agree with the following observation made by Nelson Goodman :
The linguist may be forgiven for a vocational myopia that blinds him to all symbol systems other than languages .
Anyone else recognizes that gestures , nods of approval and disapproval , pointings , facial expressions , bodily demonstrations , sketches , diagrams , models , play an important role in the acquisition and inculcation of skills of all sorts ; and that mastery of symbols of many of these kinds occurs before , and aids enormously , in the acquisition of language . {11}
The implication of this kind of criticism , if it is directed towards Sellars , is to attribute to him the belief that the necessary condition of having awareness , thoughts , and symbolic or conceptual abilities is the possession of a conventional language .
All these critics , in rejecting Sellars ' alleged account of thought and language , accept the existence of thoughts as genetically prior to language .
A seeming corollary of this is the claim that we have concepts prior to language , and that we use symbols prior to language , that there are " natural signs " prior and independently of " conventional signs , " {12} and , to borrow the title of Fodor 's book , {13 } there is a " language of thought " prior to the language of speech .
I had similar misgivings about Sellars ' position , but after much reflection I would not make such interpretations of Sellars , at least not in these ambiguous , vague , and somewhat elliptical ways .
I would n't even use the same formulations which Sellars himself actually uses about his views , and not without disambiguation , and setting the theses in a context .
How could Thurston , for example , make her claim be consistent with a passage such as :
The ' linguistic model ' begins to look far too narrow and specialized to capture the nature of thinking , even at the strictly human level -- let alone in the sense in which animals think .
{14}
I grant that a limited reading of Sellars would suggest the interpretation that thought is dependent on language , especially if it is based of his celebrated " Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind " , where we find the notorious passage cited by Thurston :
all awareness of sorts , resemblances , facts , etc. , in short , all awareness of abstract entities -- indeed , all awareness even of particulars -- is a linguistic affair .{ 15}
But a more extensive reading of Sellars would unearth such passages as : " there is a legitimate sense in which animals can be said to think . " {
16}
Sellars comes to grips with these misinterpretations of his position only after 1980 in his two essays " Behaviorism , Language and Meaning " and " Mental Events . " { 17 } His opening statement in " Mental Events " is :
I find that I am often construed as holding that mental events in the sense of thoughts , as contrasted with aches and pains , are linguistic events .
This is a misunderstanding .
What I have held is that the members of a certain class of linguistic events are thoughts .
The misunderstanding is simply a case of illicit conversion , the move from ' All A is B ' to ' All B is A '. {18}
Sellars is clearly expressing the view that there are thoughts which are independent of language .
In " Behaviorism , Language and Meaning , " he tells us that :
Thus viewed from the standpoint of methodology , verbal behaviorism is perfectly compatible with the idea that there are pre-linguistic representational activities .
Indeed , the ability to have primitive representational episodes might be not only pre-linguistic , but innate .{ 19}
It is clear that Sellars does not deny pre-linguistic representational abilities , as Marras , for example , seems to contend quite explicitly .
How is this misunderstanding to be explained ?
It has something to do with the way Sellars characterizes a language , and how he determines which characteristics are essential to it and which ones are not .
In " Behaviorism , Language and Meaning " and " Mental Events , " Sellars introduces the notion of a Representational System ( RS ) , of which a Language ( L ) is a species , by which " the organism constructs maps of itself in its environment , and locates itself and its behavior on the map . " { 20 } He adds ,
Such representational systems ( RS ) or cognitive map - makers , can be brought about by natural selection and transmitted genetically , as in the case of bees .
Undoubtedly a primitive RS is also an innate endowment of human beings .
The concept of innate abilities to be aware of something as something , and hence of pre-linguistic awareness is perfectly intelligible .{ 21}
But is n't this last sentence in contradiction with , " all awareness of sorts , resemblances , facts , etc. , in short , all awareness of abstract entities -- indeed , all awareness even of particulars -- is a linguistic affair " ?{ 22 } Before accusing Sellars of a contradiction , the more sympathetic approach is to accuse Sellars of a carelessness of formulation and of an ambiguous use of words .
It is the latter approach that I will take .
The source of the muddle lies in a failure by Sellars to remind the readers in the appropriate contexts of the distinction between a Representational System and a Language .
And because he rarely writes about thoughts with an RS context presupposed , but with a clear L context presupposed , the result is the appearance that Sellars ascribes thoughts to language users only . { 23}
I will examine both RS and L , and their relation , starting with an RS .
But before I examine the details of an RS , let me just point out some of the claims made about an RS .
One claim is that the necessary condition for thought ( of any type ) is the possession of an RS .
Another claim is that RSs are possessed by some animals and pre-linguistic children , as well as by language users .
Still another claim is that an RS may be a genetic endowment .
The RS - L distinction , though formulated explicitly in " Mental Events , " has precursors in Sellars ' writing .
The first time that Sellars made a similar distinction was in " Language , Rules and Behavior " , published in 1949 -- his fourth publication .
Here he made the distinction between ' tied symbol behavior ' ( corresponding to RS ) and ' rule - regulated symbol behavior ' ( corresponding to L ) .
{ 24 } In Science and Metaphysics , {25} Sellars stresses the distinction between ' non- conceptual representations ' and ' conceptual representations ' .
So the distinction seems to be something that may have been presupposed by Sellars in all his writings .
How does this distinction between RS and L shed light on the misleading passages in Sellars ?
Let me explain it this way .
RS can be viewed as a truncated analogue of L .
As such , many concepts appropriate to L will also be appropriate in an analogous manner to RS .
To make a distinction between concepts appropriate to L and RS , I will use Sellars ' device of placing a prefix to a word to represent the RS analogue of an L concept .
In doing this , I want to point out that Sellars ' own practice here is ambiguous .
He uses the 'ur -' prefix convention in some places to designate a pre-conceptual ability ; {26 } but at other places he uses it to designate a primitive form of a concept .
{ 27}
In view of this ambiguity , I will use the prefix ' ur -' , to designate a primitive concept of L , and the prefix 'rs - ' to designate an analogue in RS .
One source of the misunderstanding of Sellars can , then , be explained by a failure to note , or appreciate the ' tied symbol behavior ' ( RS ) versus ' rule - regulated symbol behavior ' ( L ) distinction .
But another source of misunderstanding may be due to Sellars ' terminology .
Sellars uses psychological verbs and their nominalizations , for the most part , to characterize only the behavior of humans with a language because he believes that the necessary condition for ascribing appropriate psychological states to a mature human subject is that the subject possesses a language .
Thus , Sellars ascribes awareness , thoughts , knowledge , beliefs , etc. ( in a primary sense ) only to language users .
And he denies that these ascriptions -- in the primary sense -- can be made to pre-linguistic animals and children .
Of course Sellars ' manner of speaking goes counter to a widespread linguistic practice of using psychological verbs and their nominalizations to characterize animal behavior .
So the impression is left in the reader 's mind that Sellars denies psychological states to pre-linguistic children and animals .
But such a conclusion is only a half - truth .
For , in fact , Sellars has always claimed that psychological ascriptions can be made to pre-linguistic children and animals in a derivative , analogous manner ; as is clearly presented in the following passage :
Not all ' organized behavior ' is built on linguistic structures .
The most that can be claimed is that what might be called ' conceptual thinking ' is essentially tied to language , and that , for obvious reasons , the central or core concept of what thinking is pertains to conceptual thinking .
Thus , our common - sense understanding of what sub- conceptual thinking -- e.g. , that of babies and animals -- consists in , involves viewing them as engaged in ' rudimentary ' forms of conceptual thinking .
We interpret their behavior using conceptual thinking as a model but qualify this model in ad hoc and unsystematic ways which really amounts to the introduction of a new notion which is nevertheless labeled ' thinking ' .
Such analogical extensions of concepts , when supported by experience , are by no means illegitimate .
Indeed , it is essential to science .
It is only when the negative analogies are overlooked that the danger of serious confusion and misunderstanding arises .{ 28}
It is clear , then , that Sellars ascribes thinking , or , more precisely , in my new terminology , ' rs - thinking ' to pre-linguistic children and animals .
What is not clear , as the above passage expresses , is the difference between a Language and a Representational System .
Let 's turn to this task .
III .
REPRESENTATIONAL
SYSTEMS AND LANGUAGE
In this part I want to demarcate an animal representational system , RS , which suffices for the occurrence of a ' mental event ' , from a conventional human language , L. Such a demarcation is implicit in Sellars ' writings , but it is explicitly presented only in his recent article " Mental Events " .
A great deal of obscurity has been removed for me from Sellars ' writings by this essay .
Understanding this demarcation has helped me to understand much of Sellars ' previous writings , and many things have fallen into place .
This demarcation enables us to appreciate Sellars ' insistence over the years that the presence of concepts is totally dependent on the presence of a conventional language .
A demarcation between an RS and L will enable us to understand the following claims , which , I believe , Sellars makes .
An L is a species of RS .
Some animals have an RS .
No non-human animal ( in fact ) has L .
No non-human animal ( in fact ) has concepts . 'x has concepts ' is equivalent to 'x has L '
In the following discussion , I am assuming that we are dealing with animals having the capacities of at least rats .
I am also assuming that a teleological description of , for example , rat behavior is appropriate ; specifically , that it is appropriate to describe a rat , for example , as wanting something , as searching for something , as avoiding something , and so on .
{ 29 }
It is with this kind of background assumption that the following discussion proceeds .
In one sense , it explains why teleological descriptions are appropriate .
Minimally , to have an RS something must represent something else .
Call the representing state a " symbol " and the represented thing an " object . "
But immediately Sellars rejects any claim that such a correlation , even a multitude of such correlations , is sufficient for an RS .
Note that this objection is enough to indicate for us that Sellars would reject a " private language " as depicted by Wittgenstein .
Such a purported " language " was to consist of the sign ' E ' standing for some private state or object .
The privacy here is not relevant .
Sellars would also reject a so - called " public language " as a language , which consisted of the sign ' E ' standing for some public state or object .
But worse , neither of these so called ' languages ' would even qualify to be RSs .
What more is needed is a variety of kinds of correlations -- a complexity .
He suggests that in order to have an RS " this correlation may essentially involve other correlations -- thus between it and other representational states and between representational states and actions . "
{ 30 } He presents this more explicitly elsewhere :
To be sure , the child must also acquire the ability to respond to cases with the right words , but until these response patterns have been integrated with intra-linguistic moves and language - departure transitions , they have no conceptual character and do not even count as labels .{31}
So far , then , Sellars is claiming that an organism in order to have an RS must have , as necessary conditions , the following three characteristics :
An organism correlates symbols with objects which are in the environment ( or in itself ) .
An organism correlates symbols with other symbols .
An organism correlates symbols with physical states , normally movements .
All these correlations are to be understood as causal relations .
In addition , ( ii ) is to be understood as an association of symbols , and can be called a ' Humean inference ' .{ 32 }
He adds that these symbols in order to be functioning in an RS must have propositional form , i.e. , these symbols must " represent an object and represent it as of a certain character . " { 33 } The fact that our language is of the subject - predicate form , he implies , is an accidental feature , and does not by its presence demarcate an L from an RS .
The function of predication could be accomplished by means other than using a separate predicate word : for example , by the fact that a symbol itself has a certain character .
Thus it is possible to represent the fact that a car is white by writing the word ' car ' in a special way -- let 's say by using a particular font , or by writing it in a particular color , or by writing it in a particular size , or whatever .
Sellars constructs such an alternative language -- calling it ' Jumblese ' -- which dispenses with predicate words in " Naming and Saying . " { 34 } He cautions that the idea that " the presence or absence of a subject - predicate structure marks a radical difference between linguistic and non-linguistic RSs " constitutes one of " two fundamental flaws in traditional conceptions of the mental . "
{ 35 } The other flaw , which I will just mention but not discuss , is " The notion that essential to mental events is the involvement of abstract entities . " { 36 } But in any case , the possession of sentence analogues can be ascribed to some animals : " a certain representational state of a trained rat could be said to be a ' This is a triangular ' state , and hence to express the proposition that this is triangular . "
{ 37 } Having described an RS so far , we should compare it with Sellars ' description of a conventional language .
The fullest exposition of the nature of language is in " Some Reflections on Language Games " ;{38 } but more succinct presentations are given in other writings .
The following is a good description :
Essential to any language are three types of pattern governed linguistic behavior .
( 1 ) Language Entry Transitions :
The speaker responds , ceteris paribus , to objects in perceptual situations , to certain states of himself , with appropriate linguistic activity .
( 2 ) Intra-linguistic Transitions :
The speaker 's linguistic conceptual episodes tend to occur in patterns of valid inference ( theoretical and practical ) , and tend not to occur in patterns which violate logical principles .
( 3 ) Language Departure Transitions :
The speaker responds , ceteris paribus , to such linguistic conceptual episodes as ' I will now raise my hand ' with an upward motion of the hand , etc.{39}
Sellars is constructing here a model of a conventional language .
It is clear to me that he lists the necessary conditions for a language , and it is clear that they are generically almost identical to the necessary conditions for an RS .
So it is clear that these cannot be sufficient for L .
But before I state the demarcating characteristics between an RS and an L , the above characterizations of L need some amplification and qualification .
The first crucial point is that each type of transition in L is a causal relation , as it is in RS ; and in the linguistic context the intra-linguistic transitions are described as being ' inferential ' -- again , as they are in RS .
These causal transitions are as follows .
In the case of a mature language user , the language entry transition consists of being caused to respond with an observation ( perception ) sentence to sensorial stimuli ; intra-language transitions consist of being caused to respond to the stimulus of a sentence with another sentence ; while language departure transitions consist of causally responding to a sentence expressing an intention by an appropriate movement .
The second crucial point is that in each type of transition a proposition is involved , as it is in RS .
Propositions are sentences or their analogues ( in some medium ) functioning in the perception - inference - action roles .
The concept of a proposition ( which some may identify with a thought ) is a concept of something that is translinguistically analogical to other languages or language - like structures ( see below the chapter on Behaviorism ) .
To talk of propositions , according to Sellars , is to talk abstractly about the role a sentence plays in a language or a language analogue .
What is abstracted from is the peculiar linguistic medium or vehicle of expression .
As an example , " Das ist rot " , " This is red " , and " RED " ( in Jumblese ) express the same proposition by playing a similar role in the observation - inference - action transitions in their respective linguistic mediums .
The third crucial point is that in the cited passage Sellars uses the term ' transition ' in contrast to ' action . '
He argues that not all linguistic events are actions .
Indeed such central kinds of events as the three kinds of transitions , i.e. , perceptual takings , inferences , and volitions , are not actions for Sellars ( and never become actions ) for the simple reason that they are not the sort of thing that can be done on purpose .
For example , " One can decide to look in the next room , but not to take there to be a burglar in the next room . "
{ 40 } For perceptual responses are , as such , involuntary -- passions rather than actions .
In the case of inferences , one can infer from seeing smoke that there is a fire , but it sounds odd to say that one decides to infer that there is fire .
As to volitions ,
I have emphasized that volitions are not actions but acts in the Aristotelian sense of actualities .
It does not make sense to speak of willing to will to do A , anymore than it makes sense to speak of willing to feel sympathy for someone .{ 41}
Sellars ' view of language as composed of non-actions appears at first sight to be in basic disagreement with the later Wittgenstein's , J. Austin's , and the earlier J. Searle 's views that language is composed of speech actions .
Sellars is rejecting the claim that the performance of speech actions is basic .
Of course he agrees that humans perform speech actions , but these , according to him , are explainable by speech non-actions .
And if we take stock of G. Harman 's essay " Three Levels of Meaning , " {42 } as does Sellars , there may not be disagreement .
There may simply be different types of interests .
Sellars summarizes these three levels of interest as follows :
One group takes as its central theme the idea that language is , so to speak , the very medium in which we think , at least at the distinctively human level .
Another finds its clue in the fact of communication .
Still another focuses its attention on the kinship between such linguistic acts as stating and promising and a broad spectrum of social practices .{ 43}
These three levels are hierarchically related : the third presupposes the second , which in turn presupposes the first .
Sellars ' interest is with the first ; whereas Wittgenstein , Austin , and Searle , from this perspective , were interested in the third level .
An RS is , as we see , analogous to an L .
Both have entry , inference , and exit transitions .
And the elements of both are propositions .
Included in the intra-RS transitions are transitions in conformity to inference patterns , such as , seeing smoke causing an expectation of or looking for fire ; or seeing lightning causing an expectation of thunder .
RS - inferences , in short , are to be characterized by causal transitions , which in the context of RS are called ' Humean inferences ' .
Who has an RS ?
Some animals and pre-linguistic children .
And , as Sellars implies , language users may at times operate in a distinct RS , i.e. , distinct from their conventional language .
This seems to be true of musicians and painters : " One is tempted to say that the musician not only thinks about sound , but also ' in sound ' , " {44 } and
visual perception itself is not just a conceptualizing of colored objects within visual range -- a ' thinking about ' colored objects in a certain context -- but , in a sense most difficult to analyze , a thinking in color about colored objects .{ 45 }
So far we have described a truncated form of L which is equivalent to an RS .
And it is obvious from his remarks on animal behavior that Sellars does attribute to animals an ability to have an RS .
And if the having of an RS is sufficient to have thought , then animals possessing an RS have thoughts .
This sign use by animals is to be understood by analogy to a conventional language .
But if the term ' language ' is restricted to a conventional language , then , of course , nothing else will be a ' language ' unless it can be sufficiently analogous to our language .
But to say that requires asking the question :
What else is necessary for a conventional language which is missing from an RS ?
A. META -REPRESENTATION
What amendments are needed , then , to move from RS to L ?
The obvious choice is to say that reflection has something to do with it , and to say that the minimal addition needed for this is the ability to have meta- representations .
The position would then be that human thought is distinct from animal thought in including meta - thoughts .
But this wo n't do for Sellars .
We encounter passages such as the following :
Just as animal representational systems are , so to speak , minimal , so the animal 's representation of its mapping activities , its meta - representations are equally primitive or minimal .{46}
and ,
A child can have an ur - awareness of an ur - awareness which is adequate to play a role of self - awareness in primitive mapping activity , without being aware of it as a ' mental ' activity ; indeed without being aware of it as an ' inner ' as contrasted with ' overt ' representational activity .
This contrast is a highly sophisticated one .
Thus an ur - representation of ur - representation as representations should not be supposed to represent them as judgments , or inferences , as involving singular terms , predicates , or modalities . {47}
In view of this complication , Sellars ' position is not that animals and young children do not have thoughts or meta - thoughts , but that they do not have sophisticated types of thoughts or meta - thoughts , as is expressed in the following passage :
ability to represent these representational episodes with any degree of adequacy might presuppose a degree of sophistication which comes only with the mastery of language .{ 48}
B. MEDIATING PREMISES AND LOGICAL TERMS
The suggestion as to what else is needed for a language is given in this passage :
the notion of a language which enables one to state matters of fact but does not permit argument , explanation , in short reason - giving , in accordance with the principles of formal logic , is a chimera .{49}
The key difference between RS and L lies , then , for Sellars , in the kinds of inferences that are possible within these systems .
We could call them respectively RS - inferences and L - inferences ; instead , Sellars calls them ' Humean inferences ' and ' Aristotelian inferences ' , respectively .
{50 }
The difference between them seems to be that Humean inferences are unmediated by , while Aristotelian inferences are mediated by premises .
An example of the former is :
' Smoke here ' , ' fire nearby '
An example of the latter is :
' Smoke here ' , ' If smoke anywhere , then fire nearby ' , ' fire nearby '
The key difference , then , between RS and L seems to lie in the availability of mediating premises for L , but not for RS .
Immediately the objection can be raised : Has n't Sellars granted to animals the ability to entertain propositions ; hence , premises ?
He has , indeed .
So the presence or absence of mediating premises is not the key difference .
The crucial difference lies in the nature of these mediating premises , and in the nature of the available propositions generally .
The key is that the sentences of L contain logical and modal terms , such as : ' not ' , ' and ' , ' or ' , ' implies ' , ' equivalent ' , ' all ' , ' some ' , ' necessarily ' ; and such meta- words ( i.e. , a syntactical and semantical vocabulary ) as : ' sentence ' , ' judgment ' , ' subject ' , ' predicate ' , ' operator ' , ' means ' , ' valid ' , etc. So Sellars ' claim becomes minimally that a necessary condition for L is the availability of a logical vocabulary .
I should point out that the staunchest defender of the private language thesis , Henri-Neri Castañeda , agrees with this understanding of a language :
Certainly Wittgenstein is entitled to define ' private language ' as he pleases .
And if on his definition a private language has no logical words , or only a sign ' E , ' I agree that private languages are impossible .{51}
C. AUXILIARY POSITIONS
In " Some Reflections on Language Games , " Sellars called mediating premises ' auxiliary positions ' {52} , and in " Mental Events " mentions their similarity to Quine 's ' standing sentences ' .{ 53 } Let us take as an example of an auxiliary position the sentence ' All A are B ' .
Now from a formal point of view , from this sentence in conjunction with ' This is an A ' we can deduce ' This is a B ' .
But the status of the sentence of the form ' All A are B ' may vary from a logical or conceptual relation between the A and B , to a causal connection , to an accidental relation .
To mark the distinction , Sellars introduces correlative principles of inference which are on a meta - level .
These are divided by Sellars into formal and material principles of inference .
Elsewhere , {54} Sellars uses the Carnapian terminology of logical rules ( or L- rules ) , and physical rules ( or P- rules ) .
These are meant to capture , respectively , the notions of analytic and synthetic propositions .
But he refrains from using the word ' analytic ' because of its ambiguity .
In " Is There a Synthetic A Priori ? " { 55 } and in " Empiricism and Abstract Entities , " {56 } he distinguishes a narrow and a broad definition of ' analytic ' -- ' analytic - 2 ' and ' analytic - 1 ' , respectively .
A proposition is analytic - 2 " if it is either a truth of logic or is logically true . " { 57 } A proposition is analytic - 1 if it is " true by virtue of the meanings of the terms involved . " { 58 } And the meaning of descriptive terms , for Sellars , includes the specification of causal laws .
Thus , Sellars ' analytic - 1 includes what traditionally are taken to be synthetic sentences .
And for Sellars " ' synthetic ' will be used to mean neither logically true nor logically false . "
{ 59 } Thus ' synthetic ' is to contrast with ' analytic - 2 ' ; not with ' analytic - 1 ' .
Sellars has thus made possible an overlap between the synthetic and the analytic - 1 .
And his formal - material distinction corresponds , then , to the analytic - 2 -- ( analytic - 1 cum synthetic ) distinction .
Sellars himself is troubled by whether he has embraced a version of the synthetic a priori , and whether this is an offensive type of a priori .
He concludes that the acceptance or rejection of a ' synthetic a priori ' depends , then , on how the phrase is interpreted .
And on the above interpretation , he does accept a version of it .{ 60}
I have been talking indiscriminately about the mediating premises as ' positions ' , ' propositions ' , ' principles ' , ' rules ' , and I should add ' norms ' to this list .
The language of positions is used in the context of causal responses ; the language of propositions is used in talking about linguistic function ; while talk of rules , principles , and norms presupposes a metalanguage and the performance of actions , which are subject to evaluation ( criticism ) .
At the moment , I do n't want to enter into these distinctions .
All that is important for our present purposes is that L is distinguished from an RS by the availability in L of ' auxiliary positions ' .
1. ADDITIONAL AUXILIARY POSITIONS : VALUES
Sellars ' discussion of ' auxiliary positions ' in " Some Reflections on Language Games " is misleading by being restricted to a discussion of forms such as ' All A are B ' and the correlative formal and material principles of inference .
For as Sellars himself would acknowledge , the discussion of L should be seen from the perspective of values in general , and practical reasoning specifically .
{ 61 } Thus , talk of rules of inference presupposes the existence of such epistemic values as desire for consistency , coherence , truth , predictability , and explanation .
Sellars talks about value statements in Science and Metaphysics {62} as occurring in " first level discourse " , implying that auxiliary positions should be expanded .
He regiments value statements to the form : ' Would that p ' .
Let us use ' would ' as our valuation operator . { 63 } All discourse , in fact , for Sellars , implies values .
And if values are seen from a hierarchical perspective , then , for Sellars , all " ground - floor valuings . . . are dominated by an over - arching ego - directed valuing expressed , in our terminology , by : Would that I led a satisfying life . " { 64 } He calls this the principle of Rational Egoism . { 65 }
This is a controversial thesis , and I will not discuss it .
I am not concerned here with the correctness of this specific principle , or how it relates to the moral ' Would that we led a satisfying life ' .
All that I am concerned with is the logic of the situation , namely that ' Would that p ' sentences are basic to understanding Language .
Incidentally , I am puzzled by the fact that commentators on Sellars ' theory of practical reasoning often omit even mentioning the ' Would that p ' form .
This is true of H - N. Castañeda , B. Aune , and W. Solomon .
{66 } Solomon , for example , writes : " Sellars ' account of practical reasoning encompasses three main topics : ( 1 ) intentions ; ( 2 ) volitions ; and ( 3 ) the process of practical inference " .
{ 67} Solomon is truncating Sellars account .
It actually begins with expressions of value : Would that p .
And these are in the nature of wishes .
If the wish is believed to be ( practically ) possible of realization , it becomes characterized as a desire .
An intention is the desire to do the action A which it is believed will help bring about the consequence p ; while a volition is the thought ( the intention , so to say , whose time has come ) which precedes and causes the action A.{ 68 }
But , to repeat , my main point is that Sellars ' discussion of L in " Some Reflections on Language Games " should have been expanded to include value sentences as auxiliary positions .
2. ARE AUXILIARY POSITIONS OR RULES OF INFERENCE DISPENSABLE ?
The next question to ask is : Are ' auxiliary positions ' dispensable ?
Sellars replied : " it is conceivable that a language game might dispense with auxiliary positions altogether , though at the expense of multiplying moves . " { 69 }
This means that the function of auxiliary positions will be taken over by the correlative inference rules .
Now , are inference rules dispensable ?
Obviously not the formal rules -- without them there would be no logic , and hence no language .
But what about the material rules of inference ?
Most of Sellars ' earliest writings are taken up by this question .
And his position is that they are indispensable to any empirical language .
Since Sellars ' metalinguistic concerns are based on Carnap 's work , his polemics are directed at Carnap 's position , as expressed in the following passage .
The implication of Carnap 's passage seems to be that P - rules are dispensable .
For the sake of brevity , we shall call all the logico - mathematical transformation rules of S logical or L- rules ; and all the remainder , physical or P - rules .
Whether in the construction of a language S we formulate only L - rules or include also P - rules , and , if so , to what extent , is not a logico - philosophical problem , but a matter of convention and hence , at most , a question of expedience .
If P - rules are stated , we may frequently be placed in the position of having to alter the language ; and if we go so far as to adopt all acknowledged sentences as valid , then we must be continuously expanding it .
But there is no fundamental objections to this .{70}
Carnap makes two observations .
The first is that P - rules are dispensable from an object language .
But Carnap is not clear whether their function is to be formulated in a metalanguage , or whether it is to remain unexpressed , or whether the function itself is translatable into an extensional language .
If Carnap means to assert the last position , then it is tenable only if the thesis of extensionality itself is tenable .
According to Carnap , this is the thesis that :
a universal language of science may be extensional ; or , more exactly : for every given intensional language S1 , an extensional language S2 may be constructed such that S1 can be translated into S2.{ 71}
An ' extension sentence ' is a truth - functional sentence , and an ' extensional language ' is one composed entirely of truth - functional sentences .
An ' intensional sentence ' , by contrast , is not truth - functional , and an ' intensional language ' is one which contains some intensional sentences .
To deny the extensionality thesis all one need do is hold that there is at least one kind of intensional sentence which cannot be translated into an extensional one .
Now , one of Sellars ' characteristics as an analytic philosopher is the rejection of the extensionality thesis for various kinds of meta- linguistic sentences :
Now I do not know of any successful attempt to define the logical modalities , the causal modalities or normative expressions in purely extensional terms , and ( as already indicated ) I do not think it can be done .{ 72}
Intensional sentences which cannot be translated include deontic sentences , semantical sentences , L-rules , and , as relevant to the present problem , P - rules .
A P-rule , for Sellars , is a kind of conditional sentence which cannot be expressed either by a material implication ( truth - functional ) nor by Lewis 's strict implication .
{ 73 } Sellars expedient is to introduce an new ( arrow ) symbol for an untranslatable intensional causal connector which has its own peculiar logic . { 74}
Once the extensionality thesis is denied for P - rules , there is the following ambiguity to be cleared up concerning Carnap 's position .
If Carnap 's remarks apply only to an object language , then his position can be granted ; indeed , Sellars ' program calls for an extensional object language -- but provided that P - rules are in the metalanguage , which , in fact , is where Sellars locates them .
Sellars position is , then , this :
Material rules are as essential to meaning ( and hence to language and thought ) as formal rules , contributing the architectural detail of its structure within the flying buttresses of logical form . {
75}
The other alternative for Carnap , if the dispensability of P - rules in an object language is not to entail the extensionality thesis , or the move to a metalanguage , is to opt for leaving P- rules in a language as unformalized and implicit .
But such an alternative in order to become a live option must be backed - up by arguments to the effect that ordinary language defies formalization .
At best , this alternative would suggest that ordinary language is too unsystematic to warrant formalization .
Sellars is sympathetic to the complexity , but not to the skepticism .
The philosophical endeavor must be to regiment ordinary language through the construction of models -- despite their shortcomings .
The second observation that Carnap made is that if the convention is adopted to include P - rules , the result will be a perpetual change in the meaning of descriptive words in a language .
This is a correct observation , and Sellars is quite conscious of it .
In fact his theory of induction , from the linguistic perspective , is developed with the end in mind of discovering and amending P - rules ; which amounts to the claim that a theory of induction is a theory of how to change language .
Sellars , in fact , put it almost identically : " I regard rules of inductive inference as rules for the reasoned change of a language . " { 76}
The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that though auxiliary positions are dispensable , their correlative L-rules and P - rules are not .
And this marks the distinction between an L and an RS .
D. APING REASON
But the inclusion or exclusion of auxiliary positions or rules of inference in L locates the difference but does not express it .
The difference is more fundamental .
The essential demarcation between RS and L lies , as has been noted , in the availability of logical and modal words in L , and their unavailability in RS .
The obvious objection to this -- an objection which I have entertained for a long time , and which I thought was the Achilles ' heel of Sellars ' philosophy -- was to think that animal behavior displays an analogy to logical inference .
And therefore , I thought , the difference between L and RS is drawn at the wrong place .
But is it drawn at the wrong place ?
Sellars is quite aware of behavior in animals which resembles logical inference -- it is what has already been referred to by Sellars as ' Humean inference ' , and which B. Russell described as ' animal inference ' .{ 77} Sellars also notes that Leibniz spoke of this as a " consecutiveness which imitates reason . " { 78 } An example of a Humean inference , it will be recalled , was : ' Smoke here ' , ' fire nearby ' .
And it resembles the Aristotelian inference : ' Smoke here , ' ' If smoke anywhere , then fire nearby ' , ' fire nearby ' .
The resemblance lies in the transition from similar initial states to similar end states , i.e. , from an analogous observations of ' Smoke here ' to analogous mental states of ' Fire nearby ' .
The objection may be pushed further .
It can be conceded that the difference between RS and L is in the availability of the auxiliary positions .
But this is an accidental distinction .
For , after all , Sellars himself had admitted that such positions are dispensable .
Their role can be taken over by the rules of inference .
Are we to attribute an awareness of rules to animals ?
How would that be possible ?
Rules are , after all , formulated in a language .
And if an animal has rules , they must be contained in a meta -RS .
Yes , the objector may continue , Sellars has conceded that animals may be said to have meta- representations .
So why can't we attribute to them rules expressed in a meta- representation ?
To answer this objection , we have to start by pointing out that Sellars distinguishes between rule - conforming ( or rule - patterned ) and rule - following ( or rule - regulated ) behavior .
The difference between them is that rule conforming behavior does not involve the formulation of a rule as an element in conscious thought , while rule following behavior does .
For example , a rat , after being trained to run a maze , has a representation of the maze in the sense that given the proper context , being in one position of the maze will trigger off a series of appropriate responses .
Now contrast this with a human car driver who consults a map to guide him in his journey .
The ' map ' in the rat 's case is not something consulted ; whereas in the driver 's case it is .
To keep to the metaphor , the rat acts non-consciously in conformity to the path on the map ; the driver acts by consciously following the path on the map .
Inference rules are , then , rules which are available for consultation .
While no rules are available for consultation to an RS organism .
The reason is this .
A rule is , as Sellars points out , always a rule of action of the form : ' If you want to bring about the result R , then if the circumstances are C , then you must ( ought , may , may not , cannot , etc. ) do action A '. { 79 }
It is because an RS organism cannot infer through the process of obeying a rule that it cannot be said to ' infer ' in the primary sense of ' inference ' , which is ' Aristotelian inference ' .
As Sellars puts it , " an intra-linguistic move is not in the full sense an inference unless the subject not only conforms to but obeys syntactic rules . " { 80}
Why is a rule ( or its analogue ) not available to an animal ?
Sellars ' answer is straightforward .
An animal does not have the required logical vocabulary that is explicitly expressed by the rule formula , nor the logical connections ( meanings ) that are implied by the use of the rule formula .
Suppose the objector responds by claiming that logical connector analogues are available to an RS organism .
For example , a rat can be trained to respond to , let 's say , a pink cube .
And it refuses to respond to other colors and volumes .
Is n't this refusal to respond an analogue of negation ?
Sellars asks this question explicitly : " How can a pre-logical RS ape the use of negation ? " { 81 } His answer is that indeed a Humean RS organism has the resources of accepting or rejecting a proposition , but notes that we , as Aristotelian RSs , not only have the resources of accepting or rejecting a proposition , but we also have the resources of affirming or negating a proposition as well .
And ( our ) concept of negation is not equivalent to ( our ) concept of rejection .
The latter concept , he tells us , is more basic .
Negation entails rejection , but not vice versa .{ 82}
Sellars argues that from our perspective , if an RS organism rejects p , this entails ( for us ) that it does not represent p.
But from our perspective , these are equivalent for it .
Now our notion of not representing p includes representing not - p .
And ( for us ) representing not - p entails rejecting p ( which is equivalent for the RS to not representing p ) .
But not representing p does not entail the representing of not -p .
Therefore , argues Sellars , " The concept of rejection is more basic than the concept of negation . " { 83 } This is to say that our concept of negation is a richer concept than that of rejection .
This conclusion seems to be correct for yet another reason .
Consider the fact that we can make a distinction between the negation of a sentence and the negation of the predicate of a sentence , i.e. , ' It is not the case that p ' and ' This a in not F ' .
The latter entails the former , but the former does not entail the latter .
A Humean RS would fail to make the distinction by representing both cases through the rejection of the propositions .
If it is granted to Sellars that negation is not available to an RS organism , then it also follows that none of the other truth - functional logical constants are available to an RS organism as well .
This follows from the fact that truth - functions require one primitive logical constant with negation , and all other logical constants are interdefinable with the inclusion of the negation operator .
We can make even a broader generalization by saying that no conceptual propositions at all are available to an RS organism since their meanings are dependent on their logical connections with other propositions .
And as a corollary , no proposition which entails a truth - functional proposition is available to an RS organism .
Now normally a truth - functional logic or a truncated form ( which includes negation ) is part of most other logics , such as modal and intuitive logics .
If that is the case , then none of these dependent logics are available to an RS organism either .
A specific case concerns Sellars ' material rules of inference which are correlative to ' causal laws ' .
He writes , " For a lucid presentation of the fundamentals of a logic of causal modalities , see Burks . . . " { 84 } In Arthur Burks we are given the following axiom : " a causal implication [ materially ] implies a material implication . "
{ 85 } The significance of this is that an RS organism , by this reasoning , lacks the concept of a causal law because it lacks the correlative material rule of inference .
There is one last point which must be cleared up .
All that has been said so far seems to be compatible with the view that human beings , in possessing a language , are able to perceive negative facts .
This is not Sellars ' view .
All logical operators , as well as various modal and semantical words , are ultimately to be located in the metalanguage .
Their role is to enable us to move from propositions to propositions .
At the object level there are only positive sentences which picture reality .
Thus , a form such as ' not - p ' is to be understood as the denial of the truth of p.{86}
With these observations in place , I can make the following conclusions on the difference between RS and L ( using organisms ) .
Although both use the entry to RS , intra-RS , and RS departure transitions , and although both use rs-propositions , and both have meta - representations ; because primitive RSs lack a logical vocabulary , RS organisms can , at best , conform to inference rules .
This has the appearance of aping reason .
But only an L has a logical vocabulary which enables an L organism to follow rules -- both formal and material .
And here is a crucial point for Sellars .
To have words in one 's vocabulary that are essential in formal and material inferences is to have concepts :
the conceptual meaning of a descriptive term is constituted by what can be inferred from it in accordance with the logical and extra-logical rules of inference of the language ( conceptual frame ) to which it belongs .{ 87}
But if we expand on this by including such auxiliary positions as expressions of value and obligation , then the broader formulation becomes : " to express a concept is to be relevant to inferences which can be drawn from statements in which the expression occurs . " { 88}
IV . LANGUAGE AND CONCEPTS
A major contention of Sellars ' philosophy is that the possession of concepts requires the possession of a language .
And anything that does not possess a language , does not possess concepts .
Which is to say that the possession of concepts is materially equivalent to the possession of language .
Hence , since animals and infants do not possess a language , they do not possess concepts .
This seems to go counter to a widespread usage , especially by psychologists , which grants to animals and pre-linguistic children the possession of concepts -- albeit rudimentary concepts which are truncations or analogues of linguistic concepts .
The following passage is typical of how psychologists use the word ' concept ' :
Concept formation refers to the process of discovering some characteristic that is common to a series of discrete objects , and that sets off these objects from all other objects .
A concept refers to the description of this common element .{ 89}
Even psychologists who write books with titles like Language and Thought use the word ' concept ' in this way : " any concept is the internal representation of a certain class of experiences " , {90} and " a person has learned a concept when he can with a high degree of reliability discriminate between instances and noninstances . "
{91}
These descriptions of a concept by psychologists , as far as I can tell , do not differ from talk of ' stimulus discrimination ' and ' stimulus generalization ' .
It seems that the statement ' S has a concept of C ' is materially equivalent to 'S has generalized C ' or ' S can discriminate C '. Peter Geach has made a similar observation about psychologists ' use of ' concept ' : " they would say that an animal has acquired a concept if it has learned a discriminative response to some feature of its environment . "
{ 92} Sellars grants to animals " " discriminative behavior " such as is found in white rats " , {93 } but he does not grant them concepts .
His use of ' concept ' , then , is different ; in fact , restricted to language users .
It is obvious that the word ' concept ' is used in different ways not only by different groups of people , but often by individuals within a certain group , e.g. , by philosophers .
To avoid talk at cross-purposes the term has to be disambiguated .
And since we are concerned with Sellars ' philosophy , we must try to understand how he uses this word .
Some people would accept the formula :
' S has a concept of x ' if and only if 'S has a thought about x '
or , put otherwise ,
The necessary and sufficient condition of having concepts is the possession of thoughts .
This , with appropriate commentary , is acceptable to Sellars .
But if it is conjoined with R. Chisholm 's view that " Thoughts would be intentional even if there were no linguistic entities , " {94 } then the distinction between RS - thoughts and L - thoughts would have to be introduced .
Sellars could agree with Chisholm that there could be RS - thoughts even if there were no language .
For some people any word of a language expresses a concept .
For example , Geach states that it is " a sufficient condition for James 's having the concept of so - and - so that he should have mastered the intelligent use ( including the use in made - up sentences ) of a word for so - and - so in some language . { 95 }
This use of ' concept ' is too broad for Sellars .
His synonym for this use is ' sense ' ( and he mentions G. Frege as his source for this usage .{
96}
Sometimes the word ' concept ' is restricted to a subset of words in a language .
For Frege all grammatical predicates stand for concepts ; whereas subjects name objects .
At one point Sellars expressed the intention to use ' concept ' in this sense : " I am strongly inclined to follow his [ Frege 's ] lead and limit the term " concept " to predicative senses . "
{ 97 }
But this is not his preferred usage in most writings .
In " Language of Theories , " for example , he writes , " If one begins by listing a variety of types of expression which can without too much discomfort be said to express concepts -- noun expressions , predicative expressions , logical connectives , quantifiers . . ." { 98}
In " Conceptual Change , " Sellars distinguishes two uses of the word ' concept ' :
In one of its less controversial uses , a concept is something a person has , namely a certain ability , and is always the concept of something , where ' something ' is used in the broadest possible sense .{ 99 }
There is , however , another use of ' concept ' in which one speaks of certain entities as concepts in a sense which , though acknowledging that they are items which thoughts can be " of " ( and , indeed , uses this fact to pick them out ) , takes the relation between these entities and particular minds to be an " external one .
{100}
The second use has two interpretations .
Some philosophers . . . have held that concepts in the second sense are " objective " in that their existence is independent -- not only of this mind or that mind , but of mind uberhaupt .
Others , while stressing their independence of particular minds have stressed objectivity in the sense of inter-subjectivity ( compare the objectivity of institutions ) , and have suggested that conceptual entities are mind - dependent in this broader sense .
{101}
The first use makes a concept dependent on a particular mind .
The second use makes a concept independent of a particular mind .
And this can mean that concepts are independent of all minds ; or that they are independent of any particular mind -- though dependent on some mind or other .
The last is Sellars view .
I think that these questions about the objectivity or subjectivity of concepts are secondary questions .
The primary question is to specify the nature of concepts .
This is the problem of specifying the category or ' genus ' of a concept .
Is it an object ?
a relation ?
a quality ?
a function ?
a disposition ?
a capacity ?
or whatnot .
Once this question has been answered , then the question of objectivity can be raised .
The essential trait of a concept is that it be a term in a sentence playing a necessary part in inferences : " to express a concept is to be relevant to inferences . "
{ 102 } But this formulation is misleading in view of the distinction between Humean and Aristotelian inferences .
What Sellars means to say is that a concept is expressed by a term in a sentence which is essential to an Aristotelian inference .
And the necessary constituents of a language are the three types of transition patterns , auxiliary positions , and the principles of inference .
Thus , for example , because the word " alas " has no ( relevant ) " inferential force " it is not a concept .
{103}
To answer the categorial question , to have a concept ( in the primary sense ) is to have an ability to use words in the appropriate inference patterns .
Thus W. Robinson 's attempt to capture Sellars ' idea of a concept , given as : " A concept is a mind dependent ability to be in a state which corresponds to a property " {104} wo n't do .
This definition would be compatible with what an RS organism has .
But the introduction of the term ' concept ' by Sellars is meant to demarcate something in human language users from what animals possess .
This sentiment is well expressed by Geach in his criticism of the psychologists ' use of ' concept ' :
What is at issue here is not just the way the term " concept " is to be used , but the desirability of comparing these achievements of rats and dogs with the performance of human beings who possess a concept of triangle ; the psychologists I am criticizing want to play down the difference between human and animal performances , and I want to stress them .
{105}
I think this is exactly Sellars ' view .
A. CONCEPTS AND INFERENCE
In the previous section , I have explained that a language involves the possession of a logical vocabulary and inferences .
In this section I want to spell out these logical structures for particular categories .
Let 's start with a proposition p.
To have a concept of p , by the requirement of formal rules of inference , we should be able to know various logical equivalences and implications ; as that ' p ' is materially equivalent to ' not not p' , and that ' p ' materially implies 'p or q ' ; that 'p and q ' materially implies ' p ' , etc .
Next , let 's consider ' physical kinds ' , ' particulars ' , or ' individuals ' generally .
First , any particular must have a non-relation property , " it does n't make sense to speak of individuals which stand in relations , but have no qualitative character . "
{ 106} Second , these materially imply various capacities and dispositional , properties expressible by causal and counterfactual implications .
For example , the concept of a match materially implies such counterfactuals as ' If x is a match , and if x were scratched , then x would light ' .
And such counterfactuals depend on the truth of such causal laws as ' All matches if scratched , in circumstances C , light . '
Indeed the concept of a physical kind materially implies clusters of such causal and counterfactual propositions .
{107}
Next , concerning the concept of universals or properties , Sellars makes three claims .
The first is that the meaning of a universal is dependent on the type of particular which exemplifies it .
Second , since the concept of a particular , as we saw above , depends on the physical laws into which it enters , Sellars , after presenting his arguments , concludes , " universals and laws are correlative , same universals , same laws , different universals , different laws . "
{ 108} Third , Sellars argues that the concept of a generic property is a disjunctive concept : " the generic is , at bottom , the disjunctive . "
{ 109}
Basic factual predicates come in families of competing predicates , one or other of which must be satisfied by every object which can satisfy a predicate of that family .
If a is not f1 it must be f2 or f3 . {110}
For example , the concept of a color is that of something being white or orange or violet or blue or red or . . . green .
This means that to have the concept of something being red is to have the ability to infer that this thing is not green , not blue , not yellow , etc. -- " it is obvious that being ( an expanse of ) red implies not being ( an expanse ) of green . "
{ 111}
[ Given this notion of the sortal ( generic , universal ) as disjunctive , we are in a position to give a partial explication of Sellars ' notorious passage :
all awareness of sorts , resemblances , facts , etc. , in short , all awareness of abstract entities -- indeed , all awareness even of particulars -- is a linguistic affair .
The assumption of this passage is that Determinables ( sorts , kinds ) are to be analyzed in terms of a disjunction of Determinates .
The general formula would be :
( Concept )
If x is aware that y is Determinable , then x is aware that y is Determinate - 1 or Determinate - 2 or Determinate - 3 or . . . Determinate-n .
If x is aware that y is colored , then x is aware that x is white or orange or violet or blue or red or . . . green .
What would be the analogous situation for animals ?
My best guess is that if Sellars is right about the absence of a logical vocabulary in animals , and animals are correctly credited with the ability to recognize generic features , then their ability must not be represented by the general formula above , but by the following formula :
( Intuition )
If x is aware that y is Determinable , then x is aware that y is Determinate - 1 or x is aware that y is Determinate - 2 or x is aware that y is Determinate - 3 or . . . x is aware that y is Determinate -n .
( manifold of representations )
If x is aware of a manifold of rs's , then x is aware that rs - 1 or x is aware that rs - 2 or x is aware that rs - 3 or . . . x is aware that rs -n. ( representation of a manifold )
If x has a representation of a manifold , then x is aware that rs - 1 or rs - 2 or rs - 3 or . . . rs-n .
V. HOLISM
Furthermore , since the units of inference are propositions , it follows that concepts are imbedded in various propositions .
And if we try to think through the extent of conceptual interconnections which the characterization of propositions , particulars , and properties entail , we will come to the Sellarsian conclusion that to have one concept implies having many ; indeed , it implies having a language game .
This is Sellars holism about concepts .
So , " ' conceptual structure ' in this sense refers to language games . "
{ 112}
On the one hand this holism is antithetical to the logical atomism view espoused in Wittgenstein 's Tractatus { 113} that " 2.061 States of affairs are independent of one another .
2.062 From the existence or non-existence of one state of affairs it is impossible to infer the existence or non-existence of another . "
On the other hand , Sellars does not mean to espouse a Hegelian view that the meaning of a concept lies in the Absolute .
{114} The clue to Sellars ' holism is provided by the Wittgensteinian phrase " language game . "
In this sense , each person could , first , have many languages ; for example , a Manifest Image and the Scientific Image .
And as H. Brown points out in his commentary on Sellars ' holism , " we can view the individual who learns a second ( or third , etc. ) science as learning a new language . "
{ 115} Second , Sellars speaks about degrees of mastery of a language .
The implication of this is that it is possible to know a language in disjoined fragments ; thus , denying any implications for absolute or total holism .
In conclusion , the point of this section has been to disambiguate the concept of a ' concept ' , and to delineate Sellars use of it .
His use is that a concept is any word in a sentence which is relevant to inferences .
And I pointed out the kinds of inferences that Sellars has in mind .
The upshot is that the possession of concepts is correlative with the possession of a language .
And the implication of such a requirement of inferential connections needed for the possession of concepts leads to a holism about language , but , as I suggested , it need not be as extensive as the Absolute .
The two cases , along with the destruction of chicken coops , water wells , a cement plant and some 4,000 homes , are crucial building blocks in the Goldstone case that Israel set out to eliminate infrastructure so as to cause intense civilian suffering .
The report stated that “ the destruction of food supply installations , water sanitation systems , concrete factories and residential houses was the result of a deliberate and systematic policy by the Israeli armed forces . ”
It added that Israel waged “ a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish , humiliate and terrorize a civilian population , radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself , and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability . ”
Maj . Gen. Avichai Mandelblit , the Israeli military advocate general , said in an interview that those assertions went beyond anything of which others had accused Israel .
“ I have read every report , from Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International , the Arab League , ” he said at his desk in the military ’s Tel Aviv headquarters .
“ We ourselves set up investigations into 140 complaints .
It is when you read these other reports and complaints that you realize how truly vicious the Goldstone report is .
He made it look like we set out to go after the economic infrastructure and civilians , that it was intentional .
It ’s a vicious lie . ”
Another senior military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity following regular military practice , said that neither the military command structure nor the government wanted to invade Gaza in December 2008 , but felt that the continual rocket attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians forced their hand .
The war , he said , followed the least aggressive of three contemplated routes  conquer Gaza and occupy it again as was done in the West Bank in 2002 , retake Hamas ’s weapons supply routes and hold them to dry out the organization ’s arsenal , or attack the Hamas military and state infrastructure and leave .
It was the third that occurred .
That invasion killed some 1,400 Palestinians and destroyed a great deal of property , including buildings like the parliament ’s offices that have no military function .
There were accusations of inappropriate weapons use .
All that led many human rights advocates , both foreign and Israeli , to accuse Israel of violating international norms .

Abstract
Research has revealed a significant increase in regulatory activity in the last quarter of the final year of U.S. presidential administrations , with a great deal of regulatory activity occurring in the period between the election and the inauguration of the new president .
Despite the expressed intent to minimize midnight regulation , the volume of regulatory activity at the end of the administration of George W. Bush spiked in a magnitude similar to that of other recent transitions .
There was , however a difference .
While the end of the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton exhibited the issuance of new regulations that imposed new regulatory burdens or tightened existing ones , the end of the Bush administration exhibited an increase in deregulatory actions , in which regulatory burdens were either removed or loosened .
While the midnight regulation phenomenon has been studied extensively , there has not been separate attention paid to midnight deregulation .
This article examines whether as a theoretical or practical matter , the analysis of midnight deregulation should differ from the analysis of midnight regulation generally .
As I have explained in prior work , midnight regulation generally occurs for three reasons , hurrying , waiting and delay .
Hurrying refers to the tendency to work to deadline to accomplish as much as possible , including the desire to project the outgoing administration ’s agenda into the future .
Waiting refers to the desire to wait to take action until late in the term to avoid political consequences , score political points at the right time and force the incoming administration to focus on late - term actions at the outset of the administration .
Delay refers to the possibility that some actions occur late in the term because of externally imposed delay .
Midnight deregulation appears to be mainly a result of waiting , and for all three reasons , i.e. to avoid political opposition , score points with the base and force the new administration to deal with the midnight actions at the outset of the term .
Because , as a normative matter , waiting is the most undesirable reason for midnight regulatory action , midnight deregulation may be even worse than midnight regulation .
Further reinforcing this is the likelihood that the benefits of deregulation are concentrated while the costs are widely spread , which means that narrow interests , rather than general public interests , are behind midnight deregulation .
In sum , this means that the need for reform of midnight deregulation is even greater than the need for reform of midnight regulation generally .
Newsmakers and even the oil markets ( USO , X , USL ) have learned to get used to tensions between the West and Iran .
Last week , an Iranian physics professor linked to the country ’s nuclear program was assassinated .
Iran blamed Israel and the United States for the remote control bombing of the man ’s car .
Iran , for once , was probably right .
Foreign spies in Iran are likely trying to help make it clear to the Iranian government that Israel and the United States will not tolerate Iran ’s nuclear program .
The bombing forces many scientists in Iran think twice about their profession .
Next door , in neighboring Iraq , the country is accepting 100 billion in foreign investment that will update Iraq ’s aging oil production capabilities , possibly allowing them to produce much more oil and become a more important player for the oil market .
Some peak oil analysts now even see a risk in the idea that oil production has hit its peak due to the new investments .
Others contend that cheap oil production has still hit its peak but more expensive production will continue to help meet demand .
Either way , Iran is left with aging oil producing technology and a desperate radical religious government which has demonstrated a disregard for its citizens in recent anti government flare ups .
Their government does not hesitate to turn the country ’s attention on their battle with Israel and the United States to garner nationalist sympathy and turn their citizens ’ attention away from internal struggles .
But the recent killing of the professor suggests that the empty threats are becoming decreasingly empty and increasingly real .
In slow motion , we may be witnessing the path to war , where an unreasonable government is left with no other choice but to create international conflict .
The unpopular Iranian government has proven that it can survive its own country ’s protestors and will intentionally try to refocus the country ’s rage on its nation ’s enemies .
The U.S. and Israel , in turn , are adamant about stopping the Iranian government ’s nuclear program and the recent assassination proves how far they are willing to go .
Iran has made clear that their greatest weapon is the disruption of the oil trade .
That ’s a trade - off that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly accepted as fine with him .
What may happen ?
Rising tensions followed by a good excuse for the West to attack is what happens next , if the history of Iraq were to repeat itself in Iran .
The mullahs will then have no choice but to disrupt traffic in the Straight of Hormuz , which will temporarily devastate the oil trade .
After the U.S. takes back control of the passageway , Iranians will put their resources into attacking oil pipelines and oil wells , as Iraq did to Kuwait in a similar act of desperation .
If history were to repeat itself , oil prices are in for another decade of dramatic price increases .
The View
Today , my boyfriend refuses to do doggy style anymore because I , and I quote , " have a weird looking butthole , it ’s not dirty or anything , it ’s just the strangest butthole I ’ve ever seen , it ’s really distracting . "
So now , I ’m not only self conscious about my small boobs , but my ugly asshole too .
FML
AUSTRALIANS are the worst sinners in the world , British researchers have decided .
In a study of 35 countries , Australians come up as the most likely to commit one of the biblical seven deadly sins .
An article in the February edition of Focus , a UK magazine produced by the BBC , states Australians rank first for envy and third for lust and gluttony .
The authors used a points system to determine which countries committed the seven deadly sins - lust , gluttony , greed , sloth , wrath , envy and pride - the most .
They measured a nation 's tendency towards being sloths , for example , by looking at the number of days they took off work .
When a country finished first in a category it was awarded 10 points .
A second placing gathered nine points , and so on for all placings in the top 10 .
The final tally deemed Australians the most " sin-prone " , followed by people in the US , Canada , Finland and Spain .
Despite a documented love of taking sickies , sloth is the sin Australians are least likely to commit , with eight other countries considered lazier , the report shows .
Only six nationalities were considered more wrathful and three were more greedy or proud .
University of Adelaide Emeritus Professor Chilla Bulbeck , from the School of Social Sciences , said the results and criteria used to uncover them were questionable .
" Australians did well with the low ranking in the sloth category , but why not measure the length of the average working week , showing unpaid hours of work ?
" The article also tends to focus on what men do or experience rather than women .
" Domestic violence is the most common assault experienced by women , but it 's not factored into the wrath category . "
James Cook University social demographer Dr Sue Bandaranaike said : " The US , Canada and Australia are the most obese countries in the world so when you see them finish in the gluttony section in that order , it 's no surprise . "
Topping each of the sin categories were South Korea ( lust ) , the US ( gluttony ) , Mexico ( greed ) , Iceland ( sloth and pride ) , South Africa ( wrath ) and Australia ( envy ) .
With the Vancouver Olympics approaching , sports regulators are taking note of a new wave of genetic technologies that could one day be used to cheat .
Like steroids and other performance enhancers , " gene doping " might soon allow athletes to grow bigger , stronger , and faster via unnatural means .
( Related : " What It Takes to Build the Unbeatable Body " in National Geographic magazine . )
While nobody knows if gene doping is currently being practiced , " it can be done now , " said Theodore Friedmann , a gene - therapy researcher at the University of California , San Diego .
Most likely , current efforts would be " hamfisted " and dangerous , he said .
But " we know there are disreputable people in sport with access to technology and a lot of money . "
Friedmann and colleagues are therefore calling on scientists to help keep gene doping out of the Olympics and other sports events .
The experts advise controlling access to gene therapies and warning athletes of the potentially serious health risks .
" Marathon Mice "
No Vancouver Olympian has been accused of gene doping to date .
But Friedmann and colleagues note in tomorrow 's issue of the journal Science that it 's currently possible for athletes seeking to increase endurance to do so by boosting their muscle cells ' expression of a gene called PPAR -∂.
( Get an overview of human genetics . )
This gene affects muscle - cell metabolism , and " it also has major effects on fat metabolism and is one of the things being looked at for treatment of obesity and diabetes , " Friedmann said .
When used in mice , PPAR -∂ converted ordinary creatures into superathletes , dubbed marathon mice .
Another potential gene - therapy agent is Repoxygen , a medication that was being considered as a way to fight anemia , Friedmann said .
The experimental technique boosts red blood cell production — which would be a way for athletes to increase the amount of oxygen delivered by blood to the muscles .
In fact , in 2006 a German newspaper reported on a coach caught trying to buy Repoxygen , which is not approved for human use .
Misusing such treatments via gene doping is dangerous , Friedmann said , with substantial risks of cancer or even death .
How to Catch Olympics Cheats
Unlike drug enhancements , gene doping wo n't show up in existing blood or urine tests .
To catch gene dopers , sports authorities are considering new testing methods based on looking for changes in cheaters ' gene expression and cellular proteins .
" Doping agents do n't act in a vacuum , " Friedmann said .
" They have multiple effects , and many of these will influence the way in which genes are expressed and the proteins produced .
If you look at all 25,000 [ human ] genes , there will be a large number of changes " after gene doping .
Figuring out which changes are caused by doping , however , wo n't be easy .
" The biggest problem would be understanding what other factors might affect the pattern , " said Michael Lawton , molecular toxicologist and drug - safety expert at the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer .
Gender , age , diet , and exercise can all affect gene expression , he said .
" What you want is to avoid false positives that you think are drug use but are actually something else . "
Study author Friedmann agrees that looking for changes in gene expression is n't a validated and foolproof approach yet , but he thinks definitive tests will be coming down the line .
He also notes that , while delving into athletes ' genomes raises important privacy issues , " that 's kind of the cost of being an elite athlete . "
Mari Holden , a silver - medal cyclist from the 2000 Summer Olympics and now a cycling coach , agrees .
An homage to the pulp sci-fi of the 50s , the Void is a fascinating world , so that makes it all the more painful to watch as this new universe is wasted so completely .

It ’s common for a computer program to display behavior seemingly unrelated to its source code .
Additionally , programs written in C/ C++ frequently change their behavior when the compiler optimization options are changed .
This post is a quick guide to figuring out if the compiler is at fault .
This post was motivated by a blog post by Eric Raymond .
Eric is addressing a more general topic — heisenbugs — but I felt that the compiler side of the story needed clarification .
Not Compiler Bugs
It ’s best to start out assuming that the code being compiled is broken , not the compiler .
Close to 200 kinds of “ undefined behavior ” are mentioned in the C and C++ standards .
For example , dividing by zero , shifting an integer by an amount not less than its bitwidth , accessing past the end of an array , and updating an object multiple times between sequence points are all undefined behaviors .
The compiler is permitted to assume that these never happen , and its behavior is unconstrained when they do happen .
Additionally , C/C++ leave some important behaviors , such as the order of evaluation of arguments to a function , “ unspecified . ”
Unspecified means that some ordering must be chosen , but that the compiler can choose a different order every time based on the optimization options , the phase of the moon , etc .
Undefined and unspecified behavior are at the root of most suspected compiler bugs .
There are many ways to avoid these : use tools like valgrind , enable and heed compiler warnings , write code carefully and defensively , etc .
Timing dependencies and their close cousins , race conditions , are another very common reason why programs change their behavior when compiler options are changed .
Tool support for catching races is reasonably good these days .
For timing problems , you ’re more or less on your own , especially when programming embedded systems .
Fortunately , most programs have a limited number of timing dependencies and they ’re not too hard to spot by hand , usually .
Compiler Bugs
Most experienced developers have run into some compiler bugs .
However , as mentioned above , their incidence is far lower than other problems .
Compilers tend to be extremely reliable when the following conditions are met :
the compiler is heavily used
the optimization options chosen are heavily used
the code being compiled “ looks like ” most other code
In other words , if you ’re compiling vanilla C code using a released version of gcc at - O or - O2 on an x86 machine , you are unlikely to run into a compiler bug .
Fundamentally , your code is exercising very well - tested code paths in the compiler .
Of course , bugs in vanilla code are always possible .
For example I discovered that the version of gcc that shipped with Ubuntu 8.04 for x86 miscompiled this C function at all optimization levels :
int foo ( void ) { signed char x = 1 ; unsigned char y = - 1 ; return x > y ; }
The correct return value is 0 , the Ubuntu compiler returned 1 .
The base version of gcc was fine , but the Ubuntu people applied about 5 MB of patches and one of them broke the compiler .
Compiler bugs where the wrong code is emitted at all optimization levels are relatively uncommon , as are bugs when optimizations are disabled .
However , both happen .
In general , bugs can be expected to be more common as the optimizer is asked to be more aggressive .
If any of the conditions above is not met , the incidence of compiler bugs can go up dramatically .
Consider these situations :
you are using an cross - compiler for a new , obsolete , or unpopular embedded processor
you are using strange combinations of optimization flags
you are compiling machine - generated C code or otherwise straying outside the compiler ’s comfort zone
In these situations , compiler bugs can become a frequent hazard instead of an occasional novelty .
Workarounds are needed .
Common workarounds include :
use a different version of the compiler
turn off optimizations for the module that is being miscompiled
edit the code to avoid triggering the bug ( for example , if 64 - bit adds are being miscompiled , you could do the add in assembly or else piece together a 64 - bit add from 32 - bit operations )
None of these is particularly satisfactory , but most large embedded projects rely on the second and third of these workarounds to avoid compiler bugs .
Once a big embedded system is working and tested , developers never , ever upgrade the compiler .
The devil you know .
Embedded software developers can experience nightmarish compiler bugs for several reasons .
There are many embedded compilers , many embedded targets , and often many versions of each target chip .
There tend to be far fewer developers ( even if there are a couple billion Nokia phones , all the software is developed by a few hundred people– compare that with x86 - gcc ’s user base ) .
The upshot is that embedded compilers tend to be less well - tested , and some embedded compilers are really , really buggy .
Of course some are extremely good – but the average quality is not great .
Bugs in embedded software may actually matter , as Toyota recently realized .
Assigning Blame
When attempting to blame the compiler , people often turn to the assembly code too quickly .
It is easy and comforting to look at assembly code because its semantics are so simple and clear , compared to C/ C ++.
The problem is that doing so diverts attention from where the problem usually lies : in undefined behavior at the source code level .
Let me give an example .
Let ’s say that I believe the following code is being miscompiled :
int foo ( int x ) { return ( x+1 ) > x ; }
My evidence is as follows .
At - O1 , gcc - 4.3.2 emits good code :
$ gcc -4 - O1 - S foo .c -o - - fomit - frame - pointer _foo : movl 4 ( %esp ) , %edx leal 1 ( %edx ) , %eax cmpl %edx , %eax setg %al movzbl %al , %eax ret
However , at - O2 the same compiler suddenly believes that the function returns constant true :
$ gcc -4 - O2 - S foo .c -o - - fomit - frame - pointer _foo : movl $ 1 , %eax ret
When looking at these two fragments of assembly , it ’s easy see a smoking gun and start blaming the compiler .
In fact , the compiler is not wrong here .
Instead , at - O2 gcc is exploiting the undefined nature of signed overflow in C .
In detail , the compiler is performing the following case analysis :
Case 1 : ( x+1 ) â‰¤ INT_MAX : ( x+1 ) > x evaluates to true
Case 2 : ( x+1 ) > INT_MAX : undefined behavior
Since the compiler ’s behavior is unconstrained when the program executes an operation with undefined behavior , it can do anything it wants to : crash the program , cause it to send email to your grandmother , or whatever .
In this case , the compiler simply chose the most efficient implementation for Case 2 : the same behavior as Case 1 , permitting the cases to be collapsed into a single “ return 1 . ”
As a programmer , it ’s easy to look at this kind of compiler behavior , where undefined behavior is cunningly exploited to produce faster code , and conclude that the compiler is essentially evil .
This is probably not far from the truth , but this is the worldview promoted by the C and C++ standards .
For people who really dislike it , Java and most assembly languages are refreshingly free of undefined behaviors .
Reporting a Bug
Once you ’re sure you ’ve found a compiler bug , you should try to find out if it ’s a known bug or not .
If not , please consider reporting it .
If you report a serious wrong - code bug in LLVM or GCC , it is extremely likely to be fixed in the next release , saving yourself and others from future frustration .
Creating a good bug report can be challenging .
The GCC developers , for example , happen to be somewhat merciless when it comes to dealing with bogus bug reports ( probably for good reason– they must receive a lot of these ) .
Making matters worse , there is a substantial gray zone of behaviors not covered by the C standard but that are expected of real compilers .
This includes the behavior of extensions such as inline assembly and attributes .
Arguments about bugs in these extensions can be frustrating for everyone .
OS code and embedded systems tend to live in this gray zone a lot .
To show people that you have found a compiler bug , you need to create a bug report that is convincing , reproducible , and actionable .
You need a small test case ( 2 - 3 lines is ideal ) that is obviously free of undefined behavior , obviously independent of unspecified behavior , and obviously miscompiled .
Creating small failure - inducing test cases is hard work .
You also need to provide the expected result , and perhaps give a list of compilers and options that produce that result .
Third , you need to clearly identify the version of the compiler that produces the wrong result , including the target CPU and OS , the options used to build the compiler , etc .
If the compiler is a patched one supplied by an OS vendor ( as in the Ubuntu example above ) , you should say so .
Creds
So far I ’ve tried to present the facts .
This last bit is self - promotion .
For the last few years I ’ve run a research project in finding C compiler defects ; so far we ’ve reported around 190 bugs to various compiler development teams .
Each bug report contained a new way to crash a compiler , or cause it to generate wrong code .
A bit more info is here and here .
The motivation for this project came from roughly a decade of hands - on experience with compilers for embedded systems .
Between working on TinyOS and teaching embedded systems classes , I saw an appalling number of compiler bugs and finally got sick of it .
How many safety - critical , mission - critical , and security - critical systems are being compiled with buggy tools ?
Too many .
In summary : We ’re finding compiler bugs so you do n’t have to .
Here are our GCC bugs and our LLVM bugs .
The extent to which the Efficient Market Hypothesis is true , and the extent to which EMH is believed to be true , are co-determined in simultaneous equilibrium by " supply " and " demand " .
Here 's the picture :
The downward - sloping ( hence " demand " ) curve shows the extent to which EMH is true as a function of the extent to which people believe EMH is true .
At one extreme , if nobody believes that EMH is true , so people believe there is no relation between market prices and fundamental values , then each individual has a strong incentive to research carefully the fundamental values of assets before buying and selling , and so market prices will reflect all the information available to everyone , so EMH will be true .
At the other extreme , if everyone believes EMH is true , so that market prices already reflect all available information on fundamental values , then no individual has any incentive to collect and process that information , and everybody picks assets by throwing darts , or buys the index , so market prices will not reflect any available information on fundamentals , so EMH will be false .
The upward - sloping ( hence " supply " ) curve shows the extent to which people will believe that EMH is true as a function of the extent to which it is actually true .
If EMH is totally false , people will ( eventually ) learn that it is false , and that it is sensible to collect and process information on fundamental values .
If EMH is true , people will learn that too , and wo n't bother to collect and process information .
There will probably be lags in both curves .
There will be a lag in the supply response if learning the extent of market efficiency takes time and experience .
There will be a lag in the demand response if it takes time for market prices to drift away from fundamental values when people stop collecting information and start throwing darts instead .
Maybe you can get a cobweb model out of these lags .
Maybe that cobweb model would look like Minsky - esque cycles : markets start out efficient , so people slowly learn they are efficient , so they slowly drift away from efficiency ... etc .
Do n't take the picture too seriously .
It 's only a heuristic device .
I do n't know precisely what should be on the axes .
The " extent to which EMH is true " could be perhaps be defined as the R2 of market prices on fundamental values .
But then different people have different bits of local information , and different costs of collecting and processing information , so it 's not too clear exactly how much information should be reflected in fundamental values for 100 % EMH .
The " extent to which people believe EMH is true " could be defined as x % of the population believes that EMH is 100 % true , or 100 % of the population believes that EMH is x % true , or some combination .
And what 's important is whether they act as if they believe it is true , of course .
Since I do n't know precisely what 's on the axes , I can't say whether the demand and supply curves should be curved or straight , or whether they should hit the corners .
If a change in the market structure ( allowing short sales ? ) made the market a more efficient processor of information , that would be represented by an upward / rightward shift of the demand curve .
Note that a shift in the demand curve would be partly offset by a movement along the curve .
A decrease in the costs of collecting information would be represented by a leftward / upward shift in the supply curve ( more people collect information , thereby acting as if they believed EMH were false .
Again , the shift in the curve is partly offset by a movement along the curve .
I have n't seen this picture drawn before , but I do n't know if it 's original .
All the bits of the picture are certainly widely known .
It helps me think about EMH .
I have made a distinction between fundamental analysis of asset values vs. buying the index / throwing darts .
I 'm not clear yet on where technical analysis fits in .
January 20 , 2010
Scott Brown , a nearly unknown Republican a few weeks ago , won a comfortable victory over Democrats in the special election for U.S. senator in liberal Massachusetts .
IT WAS pretty clear that Martha Coakley 's goose was cooked before the polls closed yesterday in the Massachusetts election to fill Ted Kennedy 's seat in the U.S. Senate .
First , only the Democratic candidate 's advisers were claiming that their " internal polls " showed Coakley ahead - - most major public polls showed her losing to formerly unknown Republican Scott Brown by anywhere from five to nine percentage points .
Second , her campaign announced a possible challenge to the results on the grounds of nebulous charges of voter fraud .
And third , Democrats -- from the state level to the White House - - started blaming each other for what happened .
If nothing else , you knew these were signals of a campaign that thought it was going to lose .
And lose it did , with Brown -- who vows to be the " 41st vote " to uphold Republican filibusters to defeat health care reform legislation being considered in Congress -- beating Coakley by a margin of 52 percent to 47 percent .
How , in a state that had n't sent a Republican to the U.S. Senate since 1972 , could a third - rate Republican state senator defeat the supposedly popular Democratic state attorney general ?
How could one of the " bluest " ( most pro-Democratic ) electorates in the country replace Ted Kennedy -- who often called health care reform " the cause of my life " -- with a conservative Republican whose main program is to defeat health care reform ?
Columnist : Lance Selfa Lance Selfa is the author of The Democrats : A Critical History , a socialist analysis of the Democratic Party , and editor of The Struggle for Palestine , a collection of essays by leading solidarity activists .
He is on the editorial board of the International Socialist Review .
True , Coakley ran a lousy campaign .
She was a terrible candidate who gave off the aura that she was simply entitled to take over the seat left vacant when Kennedy died .
At a time when ordinary Americans are fed up with politicians and business leaders who act as if it's " business as usual " while ordinary people are hurting , this was a kiss of death .
All Brown had to do was to call out Coakley , insisting that he was running for the " people 's ' seat , " in order to tap into the electorate 's anger at out - of - touch politicians .
But it 's too easy to put the blame on Coakley - - which is exactly what the Obama White House and its supporters are trying to do with their post-election spin .
After all , Brown ran chiefly on a national issue -- defeating health care reform -- aimed right at the heart of the agenda that Barack Obama and the Democrats have championed for most of the last year .
If the health care legislation that Congress looked likely to pass until Tuesday was at all popular , Coakley would have won in a walk .
But the health care proposals pushed by the Democratic Congress have become increasingly unpopular as the year has gone on .
Incredibly , an issue that Democrats should have been able to use to defeat conservative Republicans for a generation to come has become a political albatross around their necks .
Why ?
Because the Obama administration turned the legislation into a corporate welfare scheme for the insurance companies , one of the most reviled industries in the country .
As Robert Kuttner , editor of the liberal American Prospect , wrote :
By embracing a deal that required the government to come up with a trillion dollars of subsidy for the insurance industry , Obama was forced to pursue policies that were justifiably unpopular - - such as taxing premiums of people with decent insurance , or compelling people to buy policies that they often could n't afford , or diverting money from Medicare .
He managed to scare silly the single - most satisfied clientele of our one island of efficient single - payer health insurance -- senior citizens -- and to alienate one of his most loyal constituencies , trade unionists .
The bill helped about two - thirds of America 's uninsured , but did almost nothing for the 85 percent of Americans with insurance that is becoming more costly and unreliable by the day -- except frighten them into believing that what little they have is at increased risk of being taken away .
This has made it easy for Republicans to oppose the bill without even having to pay a political price for fronting for the current dysfunctional system .
REPUBLICANS
WILL also claim that the election result in Massachusetts represented a repudiation of the " liberal agenda , " " big government , " the " Washington elite " and the like .
And as surely as day follows night , the clamor of Beltway pundits and conservatives urging Obama and the Democrats to " move to the center " ( i.e. to the right ) will grow deafening .
The idea that Obama was even pursuing a liberal agenda will come as news to millions of his supporters who have become increasingly demoralized with an administration that seems more interested in helping out Wall Street bankers than " Main Street " Americans losing their jobs and houses .
A September 2009 Economic Policy Institute poll asked a national sample of registered voters to say who they thought had " been helped a lot or some " from the policies the administration enacted .
The result : 13 percent said the " average working person , " 64 percent identified " large banks , " and 54 percent said " Wall Street investment companies . "
Democratic consultant Celinda Lake , who did polling for the Coakley campaign , found an even more amazing result in Massachusetts .
As she told the Huffington Post :
On the eve of the election , Martha Coakley had a 21 - point advantage over Scott Brown on who would fight Wall Street and deliver for Main Street .
But it did n't predict to the vote , because voters thought , even if they sent her down here , it would n't happen .
Fine , she had done it in Massachusetts , but no one was doing it in Washington ... 2010 is fast turning out to be a blame election , and I think that either we 're going to characterize who deserves the blame -- whether that 's banks and lobbyists and people who still want to hold on to national Republican economic strategies -- or we 're going to get the blame .
And that 's a very different tone than , often , the administration is comfortable with .
If Americans are repudiating " big government , " it 's because they see the government helping Wall Street , rather than working people -- hardly an endorsement of Republican trickle - down economics .
But if Democrats are the party in power and seen as fronting for Wall Street or the insurance cartel , an angry electorate looking for some bums to throw out of office will toss the Democrats .
And as long as there 's no credible third party alternative from the left , the Republicans and the right will benefit from Democratic losses .
The Murmansk Marine Biological Institute – one of the most northern academic institutes in the world where fundamental and scientific engineering problems of the modern marine biology , oceanography and ecology are solved .
It is the oldest establishment of the Russian Science Academy in the North .
Since 1935 the institute has been investigating northern seas , gradually expanding the range of its works from Dalnezelenetsky bay to the ocean space from Iceland to the Laptev Sea .
Since 1996
The Murmansk Marine Biological Institute has included southern seas in the sphere of its attention , that is why the institute is focusing on the Barents sea and the Sea of Azov .
Let ’s have a look at the acting temporary station .
The story of the institute began in the second half of the 19th century when in 1881 there was established the first Russian marine biological station at the initiative of the St. Petersburg naturalists community .
In the end of the 19th century the biological station moved closer to the Arctic , in 1935 its successor became the Murmansk Biological Station of the Academy of Science of the USSR that was reorganized into the Murmansk Marine Biological Institute in 1958 .
In 1989 it moved to Murmansk city .
In 1998 there was opened an oceanography and biology department in Rostov - on - Don , since 2001 the Azov branch has been working .
In 1999 there was opened the Northern marine biological station in the Kola Bay and in 2001 for the first time there was launched scientific base reconstruction at Spitsbergen archipelago where the institute took an active part .
Annually at the station more than 100 researches from different RAS institutes and other establishments do their scientific work , students of various institutes of higher education come here on training .
The station seems to be suspended and then totally plundered .
The abandoned houses began to ruin in that climate and now the main building of the institute represents a pitiful sight .
Neuron .
Library .
Some kind of laboratories …
Cabinets with extraction for work with chemicals .
Infernal powder …
The administrative part .
Laboratories .
As a part of the roof lacks the top storey is simply rotting …
Soon water will be here too …
On the floor moss is living .
Attic with no roof .
View at the outskirts …
… and at Dalniye Zelentsy settlement .
Houses on the right also belong to the institute but they look pitiful too .
Water intake for the seaquarium .
The main building with a little tower with no roof against the background of the bay and the settlement .
The only alive thing found in the settlement .
And this laboratory that studies algae .
Even some repair work has been done here …
Malaysian authorities yesterday destroyed two dozen homes in an indigenous Iban community near the town of Bintulu in Sarawak , alleges a human rights group .
The Bruno Manser Fund ( BMF ) reports the Malaysian police and soldiers “ demolished about 25 houses with all the natives ’ belongings inside without prior notice being given to the community ” in serving an eviction order that is currently under appeal .
BMF notes that one of the victims is headman Nor anak Nyaway , a community leader who won international recognition for his land rights battle against the Sarawak government .
Iban natives of Sungai Sekabai are shocked after the destruction of their village by the Malaysian authorities ; in the center headman Nor anak Nyaway .

“ In a 2001 landmark court ruling , the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak acknowledged that the Iban community under Nor had native customary rights not only over their farmland but also over primary rainforests , ” said BMF in a statement .
Baru Bian , the legal representative of the Iban community and Sarawak chairman of Anwar Ibrahim ’s Justice party , PKR , called the demolition “ unacceptable ” and “ inhumane . ”
He plans to ask the court for an injunction and compensation for the community for loss of property .
The Iban have been in conflict with the Sarawak government for decades .
The Iban say authorities have parceled out their customary lands to loggers and oil palm plantation developers .
Planned dam projects are also a point of contention .

Theoretically , the 10 - month freeze on building Israeli settlements in the West Bank was supposed to benefit the Palestinian cause .
But at the run-down cafes that make up a town square of sorts here in the Jalazon Refugee Camp , there ’s a different story .
It ’s just before noon , and the area is full of young men with nowhere to go .
Normally , about half of Jalazon ’s able - bodied men are employed in construction in nearby Jewish settlements .
But since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , under pressure from President Barack Obama , announced the settlement building freeze in October , much of the work has disappeared .
In the long - term , the freeze is meant to help the stagnant Israeli - Palestinian peace process , and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said he would n’t agree to a resumption in peace talks without a building moratorium .
But in the short - term , thousands of Palestinians who work in construction across the West Bank are feeling the pinch .
They ’re annoyed that no one seems to be paying attention to the impact on their lives of what they see as a pointless exercise .
“ Work in the settlements has decreased dramatically in the last few months – it ’s nothing like it was before .
But our lives have n’t changed for the better and the leaders are n’t any closer to peace , so what ’s the point ? ” says Walid Mustafa , a sort of self - appointed spokesman of the unemployed and father of seven who says he ’s lucky to find work one day a month .
“ The settlement freeze is temporary anyway .
The Israeli government is made up of settlers , and they will build again soon enough . ”
Mr. Mustafa estimates that about 80 percent of camp residents who work in construction are now unemployed , while those still working are taking jobs for 50 shekels a day ( $ 13 ) rather than the 150 shekels ( $ 40 ) they used to make .
“ The settlement freeze has only brought more poverty , ” complains Abdel Aziz Othman .
“ There ’s no work anywhere , ” agrees Issa Muhammed Mahmoud , a young man who spends most days sitting here , chatting and drinking tea for lack of something else to do .
“ I used to be able to go into Israel to work on sites there , but now they do n’t give permits for that , and they ’re bringing laborers from China to do it . ”
Palestinian : I 'm not judged for working in settlements
The fact that so many Palestinians work on building sites in the occupied West Bank is a sensitive matter , though most construction workers here will talk freely about it .
On the one hand , settlements are roundly considered by Palestinians to be an impediment to the establishment of a Palestinian state , and clearly stand in the way of Palestinian territorial contiguity in the West Bank .
The 120 settlements that Israel has built in the West Bank since 1967 are considered illegal under international law , and Israel never annexed the territory .
But on the other hand , most Palestinians consider working in settlements to be a form of realpolitik applied to home economics .
Palestinians who are skilled in masonry , construction , and other relevant trades have built the vast majority of homes in Israel ’s controversial settlements to meet their daily needs .
“ While the politicians dawdle away the months , we have families to feed , ” says Fawzi Aqraba , a Palestinian from the Nablus area interviewed while finishing off a home in the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Netafim .
“ Everyone at home in my village knows what I do , and I do n’t think anyone judges it .
We have to survive . ”
New ' Dignity Fund ' for Palestinians
Mr. Abbas rejected Netanyahu ’s offer of a 10 - month settlement freeze late last year , maintaining his position that the stop - work order should mean all building comes to a halt , and that it must include East Jerusalem .
Netanyahu exempted approximately 3,000 buildings – projects already begun – from the freeze , and he has rejected calls to limit Israeli building anywhere in Jerusalem .
George Mitchell , the US Middle East peace envoy , was here last week in the hopes of forging a breakthrough , but none was apparent .
Palestinian officials hold that the Israeli offer is too limited in scope .
“ Washington , along with the international community , is pressuring the Palestinians without obliging Israel to stop settlement construction , ” Nabil Shaath , a member of the Central Committee of Abbas ’s Fatah party , said Tuesday in a statement e-mailed to reporters .
Ziad Toame , director general at the Palestinian Ministry of National Economy , says the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) recognizes that many Palestinian workers depend on jobs in the settlements .
Mr. Toame ’s ministry is in charge of enforcing a new PA campaign to get Palestinians to stop buying goods made in settlements .
As part of the campaign , Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad set up a $ 2 million “ Dignity Fund ” to compensate Palestinian merchants for their losses .
“ We hope that the Dignity Fund will be expanded , if we get more donors , and then we might be able to compensate construction workers as well , ” Toame says .
“ Or start training programs so they can do something else . ”

Last November , Mint reported at length on the many ways that banks and creditors were sticking it to consumers in anticipation of the The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 ( set to take effect in February . )
Among the various unsavory practices were sudden interest rate hikes , strict enforcement of overdraft fees , “ due date roulette ” , reduced credit limits and universal default – all of which will soon be prohibited .
And despite often being depicted as helpless and uneducated , consumers have begun retaliating by hitting the big banks where it hurts – at their bottom line .
Slowly but surely , people are concluding that it is simply not worth transacting with institutions that mistreat them , and are beginning to take their business elsewhere instead .
Consumer rebellion against banks has taken several forms thus far .
Let ’s take a look at some of these :
Withdrawing Money
Perhaps the most direct retaliation to bank mistreatment is the simple removal of money by consumers from their bank accounts .
To be sure , some of this activity owes to the pathetic amount of interest currently being paid out by most banks .
In the UK , for instance , TheMoneyStop reports that consumers are , “ … withdrawing billions due to poor returns ” on their savings accounts .
In the United States , however , banks are increasingly seeing depositors withdraw their money due largely to the types of shoddy service discussed earlier .
Indeed , many consumers are apparently resolved to withdraw their money from the “ Big Four ” banks ( Citibank , Chase , Wells Fargo and Bank of America ) even if it makes no visible difference to the overall industry .
The Week.com quoted a disgruntled customer as saying , bluntly , “ … maybe I ca n’t make Chase feel my pain — but I ’ll feel better about myself in the morning . ”
( AMagill )
The bitterness that some customers feel toward their banks is hard to exaggerate , and the data substantiates the anecdotes .
According to Rueters , a J.D. Power & Associates survey found that , “ … only 35 percent of customers polled said they are highly committed to their retail banks ” during 2009 , “ … down from 37 percent in 2008 and 41 percent in 2007 . ”
Bank of America and Citibank were named specifically as receiving low marks in customer service , perhaps providing an impetus for consumers to withdraw funds .
Switching to Smaller , Local Banks
Another outlet for the frustrations of disenfranchised consumers has been switching to smaller , local banks .
Despite blogger Felix Salmon ’s remark that changing banks , “ … is hard , and people are lazy ” , the Huffington Post reported on January 8 that its viral , video - driven Move Your Money campaign has resulted in millions of dollars being transferred from big banks to smaller , local competitors .
Among the beneficiaries of the growing exodus has been Trustco ’s Albany , NY branch , which , “ … had 30 new accounts opened just Thursday , almost all of them new customers saying it was their way of ‘ fighting back ’ against larger banks like Citi and Chase . ”
Nor are unwealthy consumers the only ones making a stand .
Albany ’s NEWS10 television station reported that , “ … one of those new accounts [ at Trustco ] is seven figures . ”
And far from being a local trend , Trustco administrative vice president Robert Leonard states that , “ … the trend is the same at their branches in Westchester and in their Florida branch . ”
( Betssssssy )
Additionally , Financial - Planning.com reports that since ‘ Move Your Money ’ kicked off on December 29 , “ … daily Web traffic has more than tripled on the National Association of Federal Credit Unions ’ CULookUp.com , a credit union locator site . ”
While this is an admittedly crude proxy for new account openings , NAFCU President Fred Becker said , “ … it is a good indication that bank customers are looking for alternatives . ”
The campaign ’s two week - old Facebook group , actively for all of two weeks , already boasts a following of over 20,000 members .
And even in Michigan ( whose economy is so bad that one might expect consumers to sit tight regardless of poor bank treatment ) the Lansing State Journal finds that , “ … about 59,000 people joined one of Michigan ’s 335 credit unions in 2009 through the end of September – the most in more than five years . ”
Heightened Interest in Online Banks
Dissatisfaction with big name banks has also led to rising interest in Internet - only , “ direct ” banks .
The trend was foreseen as far back as April 2009 , when BankTech.com reported a study by Tower Group predicting that , “ … the amount of money deposited with direct banks will double by 2012 . ”
Monetarily , such a prediction equates to , “ …$ 350 billion in deposits held by direct banks by 2012 , up from $ 160 billion last year . ”
Without question , some of this growth can be attributed to consumers becoming more comfortable with online banking in general .
However , in many respects , the benefits of Internet - only banks dovetail perfectly with the biggest reasons people are unhappy with their current banks .
Since the costs of operating direct banks are less than ten percent than those of brick and mortar banks , consumers benefit from fewer and less expensive fees .
Some online banks ( such as EBank ) not only refrain from levying their own ATM fees , but also reimburse any such fees that other banks charge – the very same day .
( Mint )
Additionally , direct banks have acquired a reputation for paying higher rates of return on savings deposits than traditional banks .
Bankaholic ‘s report on the top 50 money market rates and high interest savings accounts found two direct banks ( Capital One Direct and Ally Banking ) in the top three at 1.58 % and 1.49 % , respectively , as of January 11 .
With larger banks often paying less than 1 % interest on savings deposits ( in addition to nickel and diming their customers to death ) , it ’s hardly surprising that direct , online banks are attracting more people into the fold .
Outright Refusal to Pay
The more radical among consumers are actually refusing to pay what banks and creditors say they owe .
An exemplar of this tactic is Ben Pavone , a California lawyer who , “ … told Bank of America in a letter last week that he refuses to pay off his credit card debt until the bank lowers his interest rate ” , according to the Huffington Post .
Furthermore , should Bank of America try to tarnish Pavone ’s credit rating , the feisty lawyer vows , “ … he ’ll sue ’em . ”
Reportedly , Pavone ’s dissatisfaction with the bank stemmed from his credit limit being reduced when Pavone requested that it be raised .
Nevertheless , the lawyer now considers himself to have been , “ … squeezed for cash ” and is “ …eager to argue in court that your interest rates are unfair within the meaning of various state and federal statues , and anxious to point out that you ‘ had ’ to cut my credit limit from $ 32,000 down to $ 30,000 at the same time you were borrowing billions from the federal government and paid your executive bonuses in full . ”
It ’s important to realize what is at stake when lawsuits are discussed .
Even an attorney must endure myriad forms , procedures and paperwork ( not to mention an investment of time ) to move a lawsuit through the legal system .
It is a far more complicated process than many people believe .
The fact that some are not only willing to refuse payment but fight for their decision in court suggests that even sophisticated and successful individuals are growing tired of bank industry games .

Pavone says he drew inspiration for his decision from Ann Minch ’s “ Debtors Revolt ” campaign , which itself grew out of Minch ’s frustration with Chase Bank .
Upon being informed that her credit card interest rate had zoomed to 21.24 % , Minch responded , “ … are you stupid ?
Chase Bank , are you stupid ? ” in a YouTube clip that has drawn over 50,000 views since its release .
Even personal finance guru Suze Orman has lent her moral support to the Debtors Revolt .
When Minch appeared as a guest on Orman ’s TV program , she revealed that she , like others discussed earlier , had , “ … closed her savings and checking accounts with Bank of America and put her money in a local bank . ”
Before departing the topic , Orman declared herself as emphatically , “ … on the bandwagon of credit unions ” and other smaller institutions which treat customers ethically .
The Debtors Revolt is hardly an isolated occurence , and has spurred countless imitators to carry on what Ann Minch started .
Short & Long Term Implications
The financial sector is in such a state of upheavel that it is difficult to make iron - clad predictions about its future .
However , consumer response to bank practices of the last 12 - 18 months indicate that patience is running low for the various money - squeezing tactics that were once the norm .
Aside from the the looming Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act and other regulatory pressures , consumers are now applying discipline personally , through the market , by taking their deposits to more upstanding and efficient institutions .
It is not difficult to imagine a resurgance in community banking ( coupled with increased use of online direct banks ) spelling reduced marketshare for the “ big four . ”

THE WIZARDS OF OAKWOOD DRIVE Extends Its Run , Continuing Interactive Home Performances
Tom Salamon a ??s THE WIZARDS OF OAKWOOD DRIVE is continuing its run beginning October 10 through November .
The Wizards of Oakwood Drive was initially commissioned by The La Jolla Playhouse and began performances in July and ran through this past weekend .
In an article on the liberal website Elaph , Dr. Khaled Montasser , a liberal Egyptian physician , criticizes the phenomenon of endorsing traditional ideas that have been disproven by science , such as the Muslim belief that a woman can be pregnant for up to four years .
He points out that this notion is believed even by some Muslim doctors , and is acknowledged in the laws of some Arab countries , including those that are not theocracies .
He calls on the Muslims not to accept outdated and unscientific ideas just because they were proposed by important clerics , stressing that contesting the opinions of religious scholars is not tantamount to attacking or disparaging the religion itself .
Following are excerpts from his article : [ 1 ]
At a Medical Conference , a Professor Raised the Notion of a Hidden Pregnancy Lasting One to Four Years
" In a medical conference held at one of the faculties of general medicine , a professor asked for permission to speak , and said : ' Why does n't this conference deal with [ the phenomenon of ] hidden pregnancy ? '
When the participants asked what he meant by ' hidden pregnancy , ' he replied : ' I mean a pregnancy that lasts one , two , three or four [ years ] . '
The conferees , both the students and the professors , were puzzled and asked one another , ' Is there such a thing as a pregnancy that lasts three or four years ? '
The professor answered confidently , with contempt for his colleagues ' ignorance : ' Of course .
Imam Malik [ founder of the Maliki school of Islam ] stayed in his mother 's womb for three years . '
" The danger posed by this belief is that , [ in this case ] , the one who held it was a professor of medicine , who is probably schooled in the doctrine of scientific thinking , and relies on medical journals as his source [ of knowledge ] .
Faced with a medical question , such as how long a pregnancy can last , he [ is expected to ] rely on what he has learned and read in these [ scientific ] sources , rather than on what he has read in texts of Islamic jurisprudence .
" Unfortunately , however , this doctor was not [ just ] speaking for himself .
He represents a phenomenon , namely the victory of tradition over reason .
He represents a school of thought that is willing to sacrifice all medical learning in order to uphold the predominance of jurisprudential Islamic texts and traditional fatwas .
Proof of this is [ the fact ] that it is not only this professor who holds such views .
I will have you know that the chief proponent of female circumcision [ in Egypt ] is a professor of gynecology and obstetrics , who even argued against the minister of health in a court hearing [ about this matter ] . " [ 2 ]
The Notion of Hidden Pregnancy Has Crept into the State Laws
" Some Islamic scholars , like those of the Hanafi [ school ] , believe that a pregnancy can last up to two years , while those of the Maliki and Shafi 'i schools think it can last up to four years , and some of them [ have said ] even five years or more .
We [ can ] accept these statements as a kind of folklore , but not as any kind of scientific truth ...
I refuse to let anyone force me to accept this nonsense under the pretext of implementing the shari'a .
Islam is a religion of reason , and [ cannot ] be associated with these medieval notions .
Moreover , my mind refuses to accept something just because the Mufti wrote it in his book or because it appears in the Al - Azhar curriculum .
How can I accept this as science when not a single gynecologist or obstetrician has ever witnessed [ such an event ] since the advent of scientific gynecology and obstetrics ?...
And from a moral perspective , how can I provide a jurisprudential loophole for a woman who was probably promiscuous after the death of her husband and then presented her baby , conceived in sin , as a baby of her dead husband by relying on the [ notion ] of a hidden pregnancy or on a fatwa issued by some [ cleric ] or religious school ?
This is what happened on December 14 , 1927 at a shari 'a court in Mecca .
The qadi ... ruled that the baby was conceived by the woman 's dead husband who had died five years previously .
" The important question is whether the notion of a ' hidden pregnancy ' is confined to religious legal texts and is acknowledged only in [ Muslim ] theocracies , or has [ also ] found its way into the laws of non-theocratic [ Muslim ] states that have been terrorized [ into submission ] by the slogans of the pressure group called political Islam .
[ Is Egypt ] a state that respects reason and [ rational ] thinking or one that sanctifies tradition and accusations of heresy ?
" Science is familiar with the notion of a fetus , but does not recognize the notion of a hidden pregnancy or a pregnancy lasting more than ten months , let alone two to four years .
The law is expected to be guided by [ science ] instead of pandering to religious scholars at the expense of science .
[ The ideas about ' hidden pregnancy ' ] are religious opinions that [ reflect the beliefs ] of past eras , and they should be treated as such , not as a sword that hangs over the neck of the legislator .
" It seems inconceivable that the laws of Egypt , Syria , or the Gulf states should include clauses about hidden pregnancy that reflect beliefs from the fourth century – [ but the fact is that they do ] .
For example , [ Egyptian ] Law No. 15 from 1929 states that ' a woman 's appeal to acknowledge her dead husband [ as the father of ] her child will not be considered if [ the baby ] was born over a year after [ the husband 's ] death . '
Law No. 131 from 1948 includes a clause stipulating that ' the law will take into account the rights of [ a child ] born as the result of a hidden pregnancy , ' and Law No. 67 from 1980 [ states that ] ' a hidden pregnancy is legitimate [ grounds ] for granting rights . '
Article 29 of the Personal Status Code [ says ] :
' The guardian of a child born [ as a result of ] a hidden pregnancy must inform the Attorney General 's [ office ] when the pregnancy ends . '
Article 128 in the Syrian legal code and the property guardianship law in Bahrain say the same thing . "
A Woman Is Not an Elephant – She Can't Be Pregnant for More than 10 Months
" The proponents of tradition and enemies of rationality always argue that the religious scholars are [ simply ] cognizant of [ unusual ] cases that are possible , though rare .
But there is a big difference between rare and impossible .
It is impossible that a woman , who belongs to the human race , should suddenly turn into an Asian elephant and be pregnant for over two years .
Even [ a pregnancy lasting ] one whole year ... is impossible ...
The womb is not a storeroom ...
When a fetus stays in his mother 's womb over 42 weeks , he is in danger of dying in utero , and if he stays there more than 43 weeks he will surely die ...
A 50 - week fetus will certainly start to rot in his mother 's womb ...
The duration of pregnancy is not a random affair ; it is not a matter of possibilities , of changes in human nature or of changes that occur with time .
Someone who says today that Imam Malik stayed in his mother 's womb for three years is making light of a serious matter – and the blame lies not with those who said this in the past , but with those who endorse this opinion today .
" Debating and criticizing the opinions of religious scholars does not mean criticizing or disparaging religion .
We must n't be too sensitive to discuss a scientific issue that was misunderstood by the religious scholars of the past .
There is no need to wave swords when discussing such issues .
The fault lies not with those who [ dare to ] contest the [ opinions of the religious scholars ] , but with those who think that these opinions are synonymous with the religion itself .
The despicable questions that the clerics ask , [ such as ] ' Are you saying that the religious scholars were liars ? ' or ' Who are you to [ argue ] with figures of their caliber ? ' – are an impediment to any progress in science and in thinking .
" We are not accusing the religious scholars of lying , but are [ merely ] treating their opinions as part of [ the beliefs ] that prevailed in their time .
We do not regard [ these opinions ] as sacrosanct just because those who held them were authoritative figures .
Scientific truths are judged by other criteria that have nothing to do with the piety or devoutness of those who propose them .
Moreover , one who contests a clerical opinion having to do with science is not attacking or disparaging the religious scholars , even if he is less pious than they .
But he is probably equipped with modern research tools that are more effective than those that were available to those scholars .
This does not in any way detract from their importance [ as religious scholars ] or from the [ value ] of their religious opinions ...
" The issue of hidden pregnancy opens a gateway to debating all the scientific and medical notions that appear in the jurisprudential texts .
It is inconceivable that today , in the 21st century , we should repeat the opinions of ancient religious scholars – [ such as the notion ] that the menstrual blood feeds the fetus during pregnancy and turns into breast milk [ after birth ] – and discard everything science has taught us about gynecology ...
It is inconceivable that we should use terms like ' the man 's [ white ] fluid ' and ' the woman 's [ yellow ] fluid ' in discussing genetics , sexology , or infertility , while discarding [ terms like ] semen , ova , and the enormous wealth of knowledge gained since the discovery of DNA .
The same goes for all the religious notions about medicine that are treated as religious commandments instead of as outdated medical [ ideas ] , such as the notion of bloodletting which is defended so much that you would think it ’s the sixth Koranic Pillar [ of Islam ] . "

A partir de enero del 2017 , todas las empresas que ofrecen servicio de tercerización deben entregar , a la firma que las contrate , el recibo de pago de los trabajadores en donde se especifiquen las retenciones que se hicieron al trabajador como las cuotas patronales del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social ( IMSS ) e Infonavit , así como el pago de ISR e IVA .
La autoridad acaba de cerrar la pinza con las nuevas disposiciones que entrarán en vigor a partir del primero de enero , vamos a ver cómo funciona ; muchos de los pasos que ha dado la autoridad son buenos , en algunos casos son inclusive excedidos , pero seguramente lo valorará y analizará , porque en las empresas de tercerización que cumplen no creo que haya problema ; pero sí en las que utilizan esquemas ilegales , declaró Edmundo Escobar , nuevo presidente de la Asociación Mexicana de Empresas de Capital Humano ( AMECH ) .
En entrevista con El Economista , explicó que esta nueva medida se suma a las que se tomaron en el 2009 en el IMSS , cuya obligación de las empresas es reportar a los trabajadores que son tercerizados ; posteriormente se sumó la reforma laboral en el 2012 en donde , no sólo se reconoce la subcontratación , sino que se definieron los requisitos que deben cumplirse para no caer en simulación laboral .
Con las nuevas reglas que entran en vigor a partir del primero de enero lo que a la autoridad le va a permitir es que las empresas que contratan servicio de tercerización o servicios de personal no lo hagan con un propósito de evadir o abusar de un esquema que no cumpla con las obligaciones legales , así saber si el que presta el servicio pagó sus impuestos , le dará mucha certeza a la industria , parece excesivo pero seguramente la autoridad tendrá que revisar estos esquemas , pero lo que es cierto es que es la única forma en la que esta última pueda darse cuenta que las empresas que sí cumplimos y las que no .
Por otra parte , el presidente de la AMECH dijo que aún no se tienen proyecciones sobre la contratación de personal bajo el esquema de tercerización que se prevé para el próximo año ; y para este 2016 el reporte mensual de noviembre ( con datos de agosto ) indica un crecimiento de 7.5 por ciento .
Vamos a continuar con el trabajo que se viene dando y vamos a darle ( a la autoridad ) todos los elementos para el desarrollo de estas empresas que sí cumplimos y que somos empresas que no utilizan esquemas abusivos , sino que , por el contrario , se fomenta que el empleo formal vaya creciendo , concluyó .

Back in the mid-1940s , Seagram 's advertised its VO Canadian whiskey with a series of extremely manly magazine ads about " Men Who Plan Beyond Tomorrow " -- unspecified futuristic thinkers who liked the fact that Seagram 's was patient enough to age VO for six years .
No , it does n't make much sense to me , either .
But the ads , each of which depicted a different miracle that would transform postwar America , are glorious .
They 're entertaining when they sort - of - accurately predict scenarios that eventually came to be , such as the rise of the cell phone .
And they 're even more so when they marvel at wonders - to - be such as coin - operated streetcorner fax machines .
Herewith , some highlights as they appeared in LIFE magazine -- click the dates to see the issues with the ads at Google Books .

The Top 10 Medical Advances of the Decade From genome to hormones , doctors pick the top medical advances of the decade .
Dec. 17 , 2009  --
The first decade of the 21st century brought a number of discoveries , mistakes and medical advances that influenced medicine from the patient 's bedside to the medicine cabinet .
In some cases , these advances changed deeply rooted beliefs in medicine .
In others , they opened up possibilities beyond what doctors thought was possible years ago .
ABC News , in collaboration with MedPage Today , reached out to more than 800 specialists for their suggestions .
More than 125 experts in various fields and specialties responded .
Their suggestions were then sent to the American Association for the History of Medicine , which narrowed the pool down to an authoritative list of 10 medical advances this decade that have had the most impact .
1. Human Genome Discoveries Reach the Bedside
In 2000 , scientists with the International Human Genome Project released a rough draft of the human genome to the public on the Internet .
For the first time , the world could download and read the complete set of human genetic information and begin to discover what our roughly 20,000 genes do .
Mapping the human genome was a race involving time and money in the 1990s , with two competitors at the lead .
Starting first in 1990 was the government - funded Human Genome Project , which released data to the public daily as it built technologies and mapped animal genomes .
The group completed a draft of the human genome in about 10 years using about $ 2.5 billion in taxpayer money for all activities and $ 300 million for the human genome .
At the end of the decade the human Genome Project had a competitor -- a private company , Celera Genomics , which used a different " shot gun " sequencing technique and spent $ 100 million on mapping the human genome , according to Dr. Craig Venter , the chief scientist behind Celera Genomics .
Both groups announced drafts of the human genome at a June 26 , 2000 press conference with President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
" It 's one of the major landmarks that rank up there with going to the moon .
Obviously people think I could be a little biased , but I think historians will agree with me , " said Dr. Francis Collins , who was the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute when the genome was mapped .
" I think when people look back in 100 years , and look at what was the most significant advance in medicine and all of scientific research in this decade it will be the human genome , " said Collins said , who is now the director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health .
In 2003 , a " final " draft was released by researchers , and in 2007 more updates to the genome were published .
" It 's the precursor for lots of medical advances , " said Venter , now chairman and president of the non-profit J. Craig Venter Institute .
" That was absolutely the hope for it , that it will begin to change things , " said Venter , who was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Obama last month for his work on the human genome .
Collins said he expects the knowledge of the human genome to slowly influence medical achievements considering the time it takes to test medical theories and how much scientists have left to learn about the genome .
But some advances are already underway .
" Certainly in the area of cancer , it is in fact routine for people to find out their own genetic risk and to modify their surveillance , " said Collins .
The fields of breast and colon cancer have seen significant gains in this sort of genetically - personalized medicine .
Collins also expects people will have their genome sequenced regularly in the next five years or so , once the cost of sequencing the genome reaches about $ 5,000 and privacy protections for people 's genetic information are in place .
" There will be drugs and other therapies waiting for you based on an understanding of the human genome that will likely be more effective and less toxic , " said Collins .
For example , Collins said doctors have changed the way they treat a form of childhood leukemia .
About one in 300 kids used to have severe toxic side effects , and occasionally die , from the normal dose of the cancer drug called " 6 - MP . "
Through genomic research , scientists found that only children with a certain genetic mutation will have these dangerous side effects .
Now doctors can do a genetic screening and prescribe the right dose for each child .
Unknown Future Ahead With Genome Mapped
" The potential here is enormous and we 're only at the very beginning stages , " said Keith - Thomas Ayoob , associate professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York .
" Last century , DNA was discovered .
Now , we have the protein - coding sequence for our 23,000 - plus genes .
" There 's incredible potential here -- for good and bad , but at least it 's got the potential for good , " said Ayoob .
Many have voiced concerns about individuals ' genetic privacy if genome sequencing becomes cheaper , widely accessible and popular .
But others say the benefits are too much to ignore .
Dr. Margit Burmeister , professor of psychiatry and human genetics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , said our genes , for example , already have changed the way we treat lung cancer by tailoring medicine to the individual .
" Drugs like Iressa [ a lung cancer drug ] should only be given to people with certain mutations , " Burmeister said .
" This is really only the start , and my prediction is that in the next 10 years , this will become a lot more important . "
" It 's hard to imaging areas of society that are n't touched by it , " said Venter .
2. Doctors and Patients Harness Information Technology
Patients may not even think of it as they sign in with a pad and pen , then sit in the waiting room while the nurse pulls their file .
But doctors say the internet and information technology has actually changed the way they practice medicine for the better .
Even doctors need to look things up from time to time .
" Early in practice , " said Dr. John Messmer , associate professor at the Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey , " if I had a clinical question to research , I had to go to the library , pull out multiple years of the Index Medicus , look up the topic , write down the references , go to the stacks and pull the volumes of journals , find the article , read the article , go to the copy machine and make a copy .
...
If I were lucky , I would have my answer in about four hours . "
" Now I can be on rounds and in five minutes have more information on the topic than I need , " Messner said .
" On my iPod Touch , I can look up a medication , check the formulary to see if it 's covered , check for interactions with a patient 's other meds and double check details of the pharmacology of the med , plus quickly review the problem I am treating .
And I do n't even have to go online . "
Information technology also , to some degree , has made life safer for the patient .
Once admitted to a hospital , they get a bar code that matches their blood samples and their IVs .
" The ways in which computer systems are improving hospital care ... is pervasive and radical , " said Dr. Margaret Humphreys , editor of the Journal of the History of Medicine .
But many physicians have been reluctant to go digital because there is a significant upfront investment , which is why several of the health care reform measures now before Congress include provisions to underwrite some of this cost .
With or without reform , the Obama administration has an ambitious program aimed at converting paper records to electronic health records .
It has earmarked $ 20 billion to pay for the switch - over and named medical wonk Dr. David Blumenthal to serve as national coordinator for health information technology .
3. Anti-Smoking Laws and Campaigns Reduce Public Smoking
There is no national smoking ban in the United States .
However , 27 states and the District of Columbia have enacted restrictions , including seven states that banned smoking in bars and casinos in recent years .
In a report issued last October , the Institute of Medicine said those public smoking bans have cut exposure to secondhand smoke , which , in turn , has contributed to a reduction in heart attacks and death from heart disease .
Dr. Lynn Goldman of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , who chaired the committee that wrote the Institute 's report , said the debate was over and that , " Smoking bans work . "
Experts on the history of medicine agreed .
In the United States , " anti-smoking campaigns , including banning of smoking in workplaces and public places [ has ] enormous impact across socio-economic classes on many diseases , " said Humphreys of the Journal of the History of Medicine , who added that smoking increases the risk for strokes and many cancers .
" In terms of the greatest good for the greatest number , there can be no doubt that the decline in smoking has had the greatest impact , " Humphreys added .
" Virginia and North Carolina are just getting around to banning cigarettes in all restaurants now , so the public bans do track over the last 10 years . "
While public smoking bans protect people from secondhand smoke , doctors said they also motivate people to quit .
" It 's probably the most important ' doable ' public health measure for decreasing morbidity and mortality , " said Dr. Richard Kahn of Tenants Harbor , Maine .
" There is good data that as it becomes more difficult for people to smoke , more will quit . "
4. Heart Disease Deaths Drop by 40 Percent
Those looking for dramatic improvements in public health need look no further than the world of heart disease .
A mere 25 years ago , when a patient came to a hospital with a heart attack , the best that could be done was to put the patient in a darkened room , give him or her morphine for pain and lidocaine , which doctors believed would prevent dangerous irregular heartbeats , and hope for the best .
Heart attacks , called infarcts , were " big " and the damage to the heart muscle often was catastrophic , leading eventually to heart failure and death .
By contrast , treating a heart attack now is all about speed :
Speed the patient to the hospital so that a clot that blocks the life - saving flow of blood can be " busted " with drugs like the genetically engineered tissue plasminogen activator or tPA .
Or , if the problem is a vessel narrowed by buildup of plaque , a tiny flexible tube called a stent can be guided from an artery in the groin or the forearm up into the heart , where it is used to prop open the vessel to allow blood to flow normally .
Still other patients are sent to surgery , where surgeons have learned sophisticated techniques to sew new vessels into the heart to bypass diseased arteries .
Moreover , drugs that did n't exist 25 years ago -- chiefly statins like Simvastatin , Lipitor , Mevacor and Crestor -- now are used routinely to slow the progression of atherosclerosis , the medical term that describes the build - up of the hard , waxy substance called plaque that narrows arteries .
Cardiologists say such efforts really began to bear fruit after 2000 .
" In 1998 /2000 , the American Heart Association set a decade - long goal to reduce coronary heart disease and stroke and risk by 25 percent by 2010 .
We actually realized this goal by 2008 and have seen continued improvements in the reduction of deaths due to coronary heart disease and stroke , " said Dr. Clyde Yancy , president of the American Heart Association .
" As of today we have seen a near 40 percent reduction in death due to coronary artery disease since 1998 / 2000 . "
Research shows about half of the gains in heart disease came from new treatment interventions , Yancy said , and the other half , or up to 60 percent , are because of prevention .
" What this means is that the community ' gets it ' .
Better control of blood pressure , pre-emptive lowering of blood cholesterol levels , better diets , and reduced smoking are resulting in fewer [ cardiac ] events , " he said .
5. Stem Cell Research : Laboratory Breakthroughs and Some Clinical Advances
Probably no area of research has fired the public imagination and ignited the fires of public controversy as much as stem cell research .
In reality , this area has generated more political action than reproducible clinical advances -- the much - publicized ban on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research was rescinded this year .
But the clinical advances -- even when they have come from pilot studies -- have been tantalizing .
For example , European researchers genetically manipulated bone marrow cells taken from two 7 - year - old boys and then transplanted the altered cells back into the boys and apparently arrested the progress of a fatal brain disease called adrenoleukodystropy or ALD , which was the disease that affected the child in the movie " Lorenzo's Oil " .
" Cases like those fuel the promise of stem cell research .
As the population ages , the opportunity for ' replacement parts ' becomes more and more inviting , and I 'm counting on stem cell research to give me , at least , new cartilage for my knees , " Humphreys joked .
" This seems likely to be the future of regenerative medicine . "
Stem cell researcher Dr. George Daley of Children 's Hospital Boston , called the progress in both adult and embryonic stem cell research this decade " breathtaking . "
" Now we can make embryonic - like stem cells directly from skin cells , which makes it possible to model a multitude of human diseases in the petri dish .
New drugs based on stem cells are being developed , and the first human clinical trial based on products of human embryonic stem cells is expected in 2010 , " said Daley .
" The science of the past decade has been spectacular , and we 're hopeful that in the next decade , we 'll start to realize the promise of new stem cell therapies . "
6.Targeted Therapies for Cancer Expand With New Drugs
Two blockbuster targeted therapies burst on the cancer scene in late 1990s , and arguably changed forever the concept of cancer treatment , converting what often was a fatal disease into a chronic illness .
The first involves Herceptin , a drug that targets a type of breast cancer that is characterized by a specific cancer gene -- an oncogene -- called HER - 2 .
Women whose cancers express HER - 2 , which is estimated to be about 25 percent of women with breast cancer , will respond to Herceptin even when other powerful chemotherapy drugs have failed .
Dr. Kimberly Blackwell of Duke University Medical Center said doctors received a standing ovation when they presented the results of Herceptin drug trials .
" The introduction / approval of Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) and lapatinib ( TyKerb ) in breast cancer will prevent many women 's breast cancers from recurring and have significantly improved survival for many women faced with breast cancer , " said Blackwell .
" More important , these drugs represent highly effective agents that target the cancer , not the patient .
" Probably one of the only standing ovations I will witness in my career was when [ it was ] presented by Edward Romond at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology , " Blackwell added .
The other therapy , using a cancer pill called Gleevec , targets genetic mutation called bcr-abl ( b.c.r. able ) that causes cancer cells to grow and multiply in patients with a variety of cancers , including chronic myeloid leukemia , or with a stomach cancer called GIST .
The two breakthrough agents opened the door to a number of cancer drugs that targeted specific molecules that control not only cell growth , but also the blood supply that feeds tumors .
7. Combination Drug Therapy Extends HIV Survival
Since the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy , or HAART , as this combination therapy approach is called , HIV / AIDS has evolved into a serious , but chronic disease with survival stretching into decades .
Moreover , this " cocktail " approach to treatment , where drugs are combined in different ways or different sequences has become a model for treating other diseases ranging from lung cancer to heart disease .
" In 1996 , a 20 - year - old person in the U.S. with AIDS expected to live about 3 to 5 years and now expects to live to be 69 years .
That is amazing , " said Dr. John Bartlett , past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America .
" Think of it : In 1996 , everyone in our HIV clinic was prepared to die .
Now , they all live .
And most of them look great .
They just need to take the meds . "
" Next challenge is the cure , " Bartlett said .
In more than a decade since the emergence of HAART , researchers have constantly refined the regimens to improve results , with evidence now emerging that some combinations may be more effective on patients with more extensive disease .
Dr. Thomas Coates , of the University of California Los Angeles , pointed out that the HIV death rates still are dropping because of continual HIV research .
" The drop in death rates from HIV in the developed world [ is ] due to improved medications , " Coates said .
" There was the 10 percent drop in deaths due to HIV in the U.S. between 2006 and 2007 . "
In Africa , where the HIV / AIDS crises hits hardest today , Coates said doctors are slowly making progress .
One of the most triumphant feats in the past decade has been to use antiretroviral drugs to block mother - to - infant HIV transmission .
" It has made a big difference in the developed world where vertical transmission rates have plummeted from over 1000 at the peak to fewer than 100 per year ( in the US ) , " said Coates .
" Advances are being made in the developing world , with Botswana leading the way now with a 3 percent vertical transmission rate .
It was the first and still is the most effective prevention strategy we have . "

8. Minimally Invasive Techniques Revolutionize Surgery
Ten years ago someone would expect to see a six inch scar after a doctor removed an organ , but new techniques in minimally invasive surgery have virtually eliminated scars from some procedures .
In the late 2000s , doctors at the Cleveland Clinic started using a technique that removed the kidney - through the naval , leaving patients examining their belly buttons in search of a scar after donating their kidney .
Today women can look forward to much shorter recovery times from hysterectomies due to another form of natural orifice surgery .
Now doctors can remove the uterus through the vagina , not a large incision in the abdomen .
Medical historian Dr. Sandra
Moss could testify to the shortened recovery time from minimally invasive surgery .
" My younger sister and I had the same operation 20 years apart .
I was hors de combat ( out of commission ) for one month and loopy from pain meds for two weeks , " Moss said .
" She was back at work in a few days on no pain medications . "
Doctors also have used robotic surgery to improve the accuracy of procedures , especially in cancer cases .
" Robotic surgery increased the ability of cancer surgeons to get clean margins as well , due to the magnification of the structures , " said Dr. Douglas Bacon of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
Dr. Richard Caselli of the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale , Ariz. , pointed out that robotic surgery " offers the potential for surgeons to operate on patients remotely . "
But critics , and there are many , say the cost of the robotic hardware may outweigh the benefit .
Moreover , critics say that the robot revolution is racing ahead of the evidence .
9. Study Finds Heart , Cancer Risk With Hormone Replacement Therapy
Until July 2002 , most doctors treating middle - aged women believed that giving their patients hormones -- either estrogen alone or estrogen combined with progestin -- would protect their hearts from the ravages of age that seemed to attack women after menopause .
Hormone replacement therapy , or HRT , also was thought to be good for the bones , the brain , the skin , the figure and the libido , and was considered the best treatment to control the annoying and sometimes disabling symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes , depression and sleep disturbances .
And then the world changed .
The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute , which was sponsoring a placebo controlled trial of hormone replacement therapy in more than 161,000 healthy women , announced that it was shutting down the study because HRT increased the risk of heart attack , stroke , blood clots and breast cancer .
It was the " oops " heard round the world .
Dr. Larry Norton of the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York City , believes the two biggest advances in breast cancer this decade were the targeted - breast cancer treatment with Herceptin and " the finding that post - menopausal hormone replacement is associated with a huge increase in the risk of breast cancer . "
But the news from the Women 's Health Initiative , as the study was known , was n't all bad .
HRT did reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and fractures and was proven to be an effective treatment for hot flashes and some other menopause symptoms .
10 . Scientists Peer Into Mind With Functional MRI
Mind -reading has moved from carnival attraction to the halls of medicine with what is known as a functional MRI .
The medical mind - readers are not trying to identify a card randomly selected from a deck .
They are using sophisticated imaging techniques to map the way the mind works .
The process , often called fMRI , traces the working of neurons -- brain cells – by tracking changes in the oxygen levels and blood flow in the brain .
The more brain activity in one area , the more oxygen will be used resulting in more blood flow to that area .
The patient lies awake inside an MRI scanner and he or she is asked to perform a simple task , like identifying a color or solving a math problem .
As the patient answers the question , the fMRI tracks the areas of the brain that are activated .
As the patient answers the question , the fMRI tracks the areas of the brain that are activated by tracing the speed at which the cells metabolize the sugar , or glucose .
First developed in the early 1990s , fMRI began to shape research at the beginning of the decade .
" It has certainly taken off in the past 10 years as a means for studying the living human brain in action , " said Caselli .
" It has given us innumerable insights into cognition , social interactions , reward systems , decision making and so on . "
Using this technique , researchers are learning valuable information about disease such as depression , brain cancer , autism , memory disorders and even conditions such as the skin disorder psoriasis .
Never has a generation been so completely taken over by a totalitarian state as was the case in Hitler ’s Third Reich : at the age of 10 children joined the “ Jungvolk ” movement , at 14 they joined the Hitler Youth , and at 18 they joined the party , the “ Wehrmacht ” , the SA , or the SS .
This 5 - part documentary by Guido Knopp and the ZDF Contemporary History Department is the first comprehensive film portrayal of the young people in the Third Reich .
With in - depth witness statements and some previously unpublished archive material , the documentary demonstrates how Hitler succeeded in gaining power over “ his children ” through years of manipulation .
Why I think Mongo is to Databases what Rails was to Frameworks
Strong statement , eh ?
The more I work with Mongo the more I am coming around to this way of thinking .
I tell no lie when I say that I now approach Mongo with the same kind of excitement I first felt using Rails .
For some , that may be enough , but for others , you probably require more than a feeling to check out a new technology .
Below are 7 Mongo and MongoMapper related features that I have found to be really awesome while working on switching Harmony , a new website management system by my company , Ordered List , to Mongo from MySQL .
1. Migrations are Dead
Remember the first time you created and ran a migration in Rails .
Can you ?
Think back to the exuberance of the moment when you realized tempting fate on a production server was a thing of the past .
Well I have news for you Walter Cronkite , migrations are so last year .
Yep , you do n’t migrate when you want to add or remove columns with Mongo .
Heck , you do n’t even add or remove columns .
Need a new piece of data ?
Throw a new key into any model and you can start adding data to it .
No need to bring your app to a screeching halt , migrate and then head back to normal land .
Just add a key and start collecting data .
2. Single Collection Inheritance Gone Wild
There are times when inheritance is sweet .
Let ’s take Harmony for example .
Harmony is all about managing websites .
Websites have content .
Content does not equal pages .
Most website management tools are called content management systems and all that means is that you get a title field and a content field .
There , you can now manage content .
Wrong !
Pages are made up of content .
Each piece of content could be as tiny as a number or as large a massive PDF .
Also , different types of pages behave differently .
Technically a blog and a page are both pages , but a page has children that are most likely ordered intentionally , whereas a blog has children that are ordered by publish date .
So how did Mongo help us with this ?
Well , we created a base Item model .
Sites have many items .
Items have many custom pieces of data .
So , we have an Item model that acts as the base for our Page , Blog , Link , BlogPost and such models .
Then each of those defines specific keys and behaviors that they do not have in common the other items .
By using inheritance , they all share the same base keys , validations , callbacks and collection .
Then for behaviors and keys that are shared by some , but not all , we are creating modules and including them .
One such module is SortableItem .
This gets included in Page , Blog and Link as those can all be sorted and have previous and next items .
The SortableItem module defines a position key and keeps the position order in check when creating and destroying items that include it .
Think of it as acts_as_list .
This has been so handy .
Steve was building the doc site and said he wished he had a link type , something that shows up in the navigation , but cross links to another section or another site .
I was like , so make it !
Here it is in all its glory .
class Link < Item include SortableItem key :url , String , : required => true , :allow_blank => false def permalink Harmony.escape_url( title ) end end
Yep , barely any code .
We inherit from item , include the sortable attributes , define a new key named url ( where the link should go to ) and make sure the permalink is always set to the title .
Nothing to it .
This kind of flexibility is huge when you get new feature ideas .
All these completely different documents are stored in the same collection and follow a lot of the same rules but none of them has any more data stored with it than is absolutely needed .
No creating a column for any key that could be in any row .
Just define the keys that go with specific document types .
Sweet !
3. Array Keys
Harmony has sites and users .
Users are unique across all of Harmony .
One username and password and you can access any specific site or all sites of a particular account .
Normally this would require a join table , maybe even some polymorphism .
What we decided to do is very simple .
Mongo natively understands arrays .
Our site model has an array key named authorizations and our Account model has one named memberships .
These two array keys store arrays of user ids .
We could de-normalize even more and just have a sites array key on user , but we decided not to .
class Site include MongoMapper :: Document key :authorizations , Array , : index => true # def add_user , remove_user , authorized ?
end class Account include MongoMapper :: Document key : memberships , Array , : index => true # def add_user , remove_user , member ?
end
What is cool about this is that it is still simple to get all the users for a given site .
class
Site def users user_ids = [ authorizations , memberships].flatten.compact.uniq User.all ( : id => user_ids , : order => ' last_name , first_name ' ) end end
The sweet thing about this is that not only does Mongo know how to store arrays in documents , but you can even index the values and perform efficient queries on arrays .
Eventually , I want to roll array key stuff like this into MongoMapper supported associations , but I just have n’t had a chance to abstract them yet .
Look for that on the horizon .
4. Hash Keys
As if array keys were not enough , hash keys are just as awesome .
Harmony has a really intelligent activity stream .
Lets face it , most activity streams out there suck .
Take Github ’s for example .
I will pick on them because I know the guys and they are awesome .
They are so successful , they can take it . :)
It may be handy that I can see every single user who follows or forks MongoMapper , but personally I would find it way more helpful if their activity stream just put in one entry that was more like this .
“ 14 users started watching MongoMapper today and another 3 forked it .
Oh , and you had 400 pageviews . ”
Am I right ?
Maybe I have too many projects , but their feed is overwhelming for me at times .
What we did to remedy this in Harmony is make the activity stream intelligent .
When actions happen , it checks if the same action has happened recently and just increments a count .
What you end up with are things in the activity stream like :
“ Mongo is to Databases what Rails was to Frameworks was updated 24 times today by John Nunemaker . ”
On top of that , we use a hash key named source to store all of the attributes from the original object right in the activity stream collection .
This means we do 0 , yes 0 , extra queries to show each activity .
Our activity model looks something like this ( obviously this is really pared down ) :
class Activity include MongoMapper :: Document key : source , Hash key :action , String key : count , Integer , : default => 1 end
Then , we define an API in that model to normalize the different attributes that could be there .
For example , here is the title method :
class Activity def title source [ ' title ' ] || source [ ' name ' ] || source [ ' filename ' ] end end
In order to determine if a new action is already in the stream and just needs to be incremented , we can then use Mongo ’s ability to query inside hashes with something like this :
Activity.first ( { ' source._id ' => id , :action => ' updated ' , :created_at.gt => Time.zone.now.beginning_of_day.utc })
How fricken sweet is that ?
Major .
Epic .
5. Embedding Custom Objects
What is that you say ?
Arrays and hashes just are n’t enough for you .
Well go fly a kite …or just use an embedded object .
When Harmony was powered by MySQL ( back a few months ago ) , we had an Item model and an ItemAttributes ( key , value , item_id ) model .
Item was the base for all the different types of content and item attributes were how we allowed for custom data on items .
This meant every time we queried for an item , we also had to get its attributes .
This is n’t a big deal when you know all the items up front as you can eager load some stuff , but we do n’t always know all the items that are going to be shown on a page until it happens .
That pretty much killed the effectiveness of eager loading .
It also meant that we just always got all of an item ’s attributes each time we got an item ( and performed the queries to get the info ) , just in case one of those attributes was being used ( title and path are on all items ) .
With Mongo , however , we just embed custom data right with the item .
Anytime we get an item , all the custom data comes with it .
This is great as there is never a time where we would get an attribute without the item it is related to .
For example , here is part of an item document with some custom data in it :
{ " _id " =>... , " _type " =>" Page " , " title " => " Our Writing " , " path " => " / our- writing / " , " data " = >[ { " _id " =>... , " file_upload " = > false , " value " = > " " , " key " = >" content "} , { " _id " =>... , " file_upload " = > true , " value " = > " " , " key " = >" pic" } ] , }
Now anytime we get an item , we already have the data .
No need to query for it .
This alone will help performance so much in the future , that it alone had the weight to convince us to switch to Mongo , despite being almost 90 % done in MySQL .
The great part is embedded objects are just arrays of hashes in Mongo , but MongoMapper automatically turns them into pure ruby objects .
class Item include MongoMapper :: Document many : data do def [ ] ( key ) detect { |d| d.key == key .
to_s } end end end class Datum include MongoMapper : : EmbeddedDocument key : key , String key : value end
Just like that , each piece of custom data gets embedded in the item on save and converted to a Datum object when fetched from the database .
The association extension on data even allows for getting data by its key quite easily like so :
Item.first.data[ ' foo ' ] # return datum instance if foo key present
6. Incrementing and Decrementing
A decision we made the moment we switched to Mongo was to take advantage of its awesome parts as much as we could .
One way we do that is storing published post counts on year , month and day archive items and label items .
Anytime a post is published , unpublished , etc. we use Mongo ’s increment modifier to bump the count up or down .
This means that there is no query at all needed to get the number of posts published in a given year , month or day or of a certain label if we already have that document .
We have several callbacks related to a post ’s publish status that call methods that perform stuff like this under the hood :
# ids is array of item ids conditions = { : _id => {' $ in ' => ids}} # amount is either 1 or - 1 for increment and decrement increments = {' $inc ' => {:post_count => amount}} collection.update ( conditions , increments , : multi => true )
For now , we drop down the ruby driver ( collection.update ) , but I have tickets ( inc , the rest ) to abstract this out of Harmony and into MongoMapper .
Modifiers like this are super handy for us and will be even more handy when we roll out statistics in Harmony as we ’ll use increments to keep track of pageviews and such .
7. Files , aka GridFS
Man , with all the awesome I ’ve mentioned above , some of you may be tired , but I need you to hang with me for one more topic .
Mongo actually has a really cool GridFS specification that is implemented for all the drivers to allow storing files right in the database .
I remember when storing files in the database was a horrible idea , but with Mongo this is really neat .
We currently store all theme files and assets right in Mongo .
This was handy when in development for passing data around and was nice for building everything in stage before our move to production .
When we were ready to move to production , we literally just dumped stage and restored it on production .
Just like that all data and files were up and running .
No need for S3 or separate file backup processes .
Just store the files in Mongo and serve them right out of there .
We then heavily use etags and HTTP caching and intend on doing more in the future to make sure that serving these files stays performant , but that is for another day . :)
As of now , it is plenty fast and sooooo convenient .
Conclusion
We have been amazed at how much code we cut out of Harmony with the switch from MySQL to Mongo .
We ’re also really excited about the features mentioned above and how they are going to help us grow our first product , Harmony .
I ca n’t imagine building some of the flexibility we ’ve built into Harmony or some of the ideas we have planned for the future with a relational database .
I am truly as excited about the future of Mongo as I once was ( and still am ) about the future of Rails .
The machine is usually is 35 F inside , the display was showing 89 F .
So if the Coke was at 89 F how long will it take to reach 35 F assuming the freezer is at 32 F ?
So I just bought a can of Coke from a machine , and it came out hot so how long will it take to chill it in the freezer ?
The next version of Linux is not only the first to offer the Nouveau KMS graphics driver for NVIDIA graphics hardware , it also comes with a multitude of improvements for the two AMD / ATI and Intel graphics drivers which support Kernel - based Mode Setting ( KMS ) .
At the end of last week , Linus Torvalds released Linux 2.6.33 - rc6 , the sixth release candidate of Linux 2.6.33 ; the final version is expected either at the end of this month , or early next month .
As usual at this stage in the development cycle , the number of changes and their extent is beginning to decrease ;
Torvalds writes that development is reaching the point where most things " just work " ( '[ ...] we 're getting to that stage of the release cycle where things mostly should " just work " [ ... ] ')
The Kernel Log takes this opportunity to continue its report about the advancements of Linux 2.6.33 and discuss what 's new in terms of graphics hardware support in part three of the " Coming in 2.6.33 " mini series .
The most important changes concerning the kernel 's network support , file systems and storage subsystem were covered in part one and two of this series .
New driver for NVIDIA GPUs
As previously reported , the kernel developers have , at the urging of Linus Torvalds , included the kernel code for the Nouveau driver for GeForce graphics cores ( GPUs / Graphics Processing Units ) in the Linux kernel 's staging area .
Version 2.6.33 of the kernel will , therefore , also offer Kernel - based Mode Setting ( KMS ) for many older as well as modern NVIDIA graphics chips ; KMS has so far only been available with AMD / ATI and Intel GPUs .
It allows flicker - free start - ups , faster switching between X Server and text console , and more reliable graphics hardware reinitialisation when waking up from system sleep states .
Based on the new kernel code , the Nouveau driver for X.org is capable of dual screen operation via RandR and offers Xvideo acceleration for recent GeForce models – these two features are not available with the " nv " ( full name " xf86-video-nv " )
X.org driver many distributions configure for NVIDIA hardware .
3D acceleration , however , has not been mastered by either of the drivers – while it is currently under construction for Nouveau , it is still considered very experimental in this reverse engineered driver .
Therefore , 3D support will for now continue to require NVIDIA 's proprietary graphics driver , which some graphics cards also require to enable fan control .
However , NVIDIA drivers only work if the Nouveau KMS code is disabled – one way of doing this at run-time is to set the " nomodeset " kernel parameter when booting .
Shortly before merging Nouveau , the developers modified the driver in such a way that the " ctxprogs " component , which was previously an integral part and often regarded as " firmware " , is now only retrieved if required .
Some distributions include this non -open source code for recent GPUs , which is sometimes called " Voodoo " , even though the code was developed using proprietary graphics drivers and its inclusion might not be legal .
The discussions around this problem prompted a developer to write open source code that replaces ctxprogs .
This code was included in Linux 2.6.33 a few days after Nouveau – so far , however , it only supports generation NV40 GPUs , which are found on series 6000 and 7000 GeForce cards .
KMS included as standard
In early January , the developers of Nouveau took the integration of the driver 's KMS code as an opportunity to remove about fifteen thousand lines of code for setting video modes without KMS , from the Nouveau driver for X.org ; this measure was taken to simplify the maintenance and ongoing development of Nouveau .
The Nouveau team are not alone in this decision , as the developers of Intel 's graphics driver for X.org also removed their driver 's " User Mode Setting " ( UMS ) functionality : ) before they released version 2.10 of the driver in early January .
As a result , current and future versions of these drivers will rely on kernels which offer KMS support , which is likely to promote the fast and wide - spread acceptance of this relatively young technology .
When combined with the " drmmode overlay support " feature first integrated in the KMS driver for Intel GPUs with Linux 2.6.33 , version 2.10 of the Intel graphics drivers now also supports video overlays .
The developers have also included numerous improvements for Ironlake graphics cores , which are used in Westmere CPUs such as the series i3 und i5 dual core processors introduced at the beginning of the year .
The Intel KMS driver now also supports resolutions with a colour depth of 30 bits .
The kernel 's DRM ( Direct Rendering Manager ) , which is used by the KMS drivers , and the Intel drivers based on it will from now on offer an interface that improves the way graphics drivers synchronise the display of new screen content when flipping pages .
This is to reduce or avoid " tearing " , a type of image distortion which can be a particular nuisance when rendering video output .
To make kernel - side " Page Flipping Support " available , the developers had to extend the DRI2 protocol .
As a result , the technology will only be functional with Mesa 7.8 , X Server 1.9 and with version 2.11 of the Intel graphics driver for X.org , which is still in development – a comprehensive blog post by PCI subsystem maintainer and driver developer Jesse Barnes provides further details .
Better rating for Radeon drivers
The kernel 's DRM and KMS code for Radeon graphics chips now allows monitors to be controlled via DisplayPort ( 1 , 2 ) and eDP ( embedded DisplayPort ) ; audio output via HDMI is now also possible .
Another new inclusion is the IRQ support for r6xx and r7xx GPUs , which allows monitor change overs to be detected without repeated polling and is a prerequisite for the previously mentioned page flipping support for Radeon cards – however , the whole set - up will only work when combined with a firmware update .
The developers also made many minor corrections and improvements to the Radeon KMS driver .
As a result , the code has now matured to a degree that allowed the developers to remove it from the staging area , which is intended for incomplete and low quality drivers , and indicate in their commit comment that the driver is now stable enough to be used in the Linux distributions .
Another new addition to the kernel is the vmwgfx KMS driver for virtual " SVGA2 " graphics hardware , which is visible to guest systems in some of the VMWare hypervisors .
Like the KMS drivers for GeForce and Radeon graphics hardware , this driver will initially be placed in the staging area because , at least , the driver interfaces for 3D support still require adjustment .
Furthermore , a display subsystem and drivers for OMAP2 / 3 processors have found their way into the kernel via a Nokia developer – such ARM CPUs are , for instance , included in Nokia 's n900 and in the Beagle Board .
Minor gems
Many further minor , but by no means insignificant , changes can be found in the list below , which contains the commit headers referring to the respective change .
Like many of the references in the text above , the links point to the relevant commit in the web front end of the Git branch for the kernel sources maintained by Linus Torvalds at kernel.org .
The commit comments and the patches themselves provide extensive further information on the respective changes .

In The New Republic , Ed Kilgore declares farewell and good riddance to the short - lived liberal - libertarian romance :
The progressive - libertarian alliance may have provided tactical benefits in 2006 , augmenting the Democratic " wave " election of that year .
But 2008 showed that libertarian support is hardly crucial : Obama still won " libertarian " states such as Colorado and New Hampshire handily , even without their backing , and he generally performed better in the " libertarian West " than any Democratic nominee since LBJ . [… ]
[ W ] ith the arrival of the Tea Party movement , libertarians have acquired a kind of mass political cachet that they 've never before enjoyed .
As Nate Silver estimated last year , the early tea parties were " two parts Ron Paul / libertarian conservative –with its strength out West and in New Hampshire–and one part Sarah Palin / red - meat conservative –with its strength in rural areas , particularly in the South . "
This phenomenon has pulled libertarianism rightward : Despite some expressed concerns about the crudeness and cultural conservatism of many Tea Party activists , it has become clear that most self - conscious libertarians are willing to participate in , and cheerlead for , the Tea Party movement as though their political futures depend on it .
That , in turn , has torn open cultural rifts between libertarians and liberals .
Progressives who previously fawned over the libertarians '
Jeffersonian modesty are now exposed to the unattractive aspect of libertarianism that is familiar to readers of Ayn Rand : a Nietzschean disdain for the poor and minorities that tends to dovetail with the atavistic and semi-racist habits of reactionary cultural traditionalists .
After all , it is only a few steps from the Tea Party movement 's founding " rant " — in which self - described Randian business commentator Rick Santelli blasted " losers " who could n't pay their mortgages — to populist backlash against all transfer payments of any type , complaints about people " voting for a living " instead of " working for a living , " and paranoid conspiracy theories about groups like ACORN .
Certainly , few self - conscious libertarians have much tolerance for racism , but they are encouraging a point of view about " welfare " that has long been catnip to racists .
And that 's a problem for liberals .
How can an alliance last in a climate where a progressive think tanker has to look down the rostrum at that nice Cato Institute colleague and wonder if he or she privately thinks the poor are " looter scum " ; or if he 's willing to get behind the Sarah Palin presidential candidacy that 's so wildly popular in Tea Party circles ? [… ]
[ E ] ven liberals who are frustrated with the president have trouble mustering any sympathy for the Obama - bashing of contemporary libertarians — a sign that the earlier alliance really was an ephemeral product of the Bush administration 's many sins .
Kilgore also points out that Citizens United v. FEC exposed some other fundamental faultlines .
I think you can boil this fooferaw down to two essential points : 1 ) Economics matter .
2 ) Yes , a political tendency that is critical of government power is likely to criticize the government in power .
Speaking only for myself , I do n't see libertarianism moving rightward , I see rightward moving libertarian .
Which is to be expected , what with the whole not - having - power thing ( as Kilgore points out , the Democrats ' wilderness years included such incongruities as Markos Moulitsas penning " libertarian Democrat " manifestos ) .
Many libertarians already treat the Tea Party movement ( and more than that , Sarah Palin ) with 10 - foot tongs , and it wo n't take many more Joe Farah / Tom Tancredo Tea Party - branded speeches to expose many of the conservative / libertarian cracks that were so evident during the Bushitler years .
As for welfare and all that , again this is just me talking , but I have never for one second in my life used or thought the phrase " welfare queen " to mean anything besides one of those Evil Corporations my liberal pals are so afraid of .
I do n't give one shit about ACORN , would n't vote for Sarah Palin at gunpoint , and do n't look down the rostrum at that nice Center for American Progress colleague fretting about their private thoughts .
What I do care about , regardless of who 's president , is human freedom and prosperity .
And I strongly and consistently suspect that when the government accumulates more power , I and everyone else ( except those wielding it ) have less of which I seek .
Republicans diss libertarians when they 're in power , and Democrats diss libertarians when they 're in power .
Their changing attitudes toward our little ( albeit growing ) tribe is mildly interesting , but it 's about as newsworthy ( and painful ) as a dog biting a chew toy .

I wrote about the " Liberaltarian Jackalope " last April .
Studies from around the world have reported that men are more jealous of sexual infidelity than emotional infidelity .
And women are the opposite — they ’re more jealous of emotional cheating than sexual cheating .
Experts often lean on an evolutionary cause for this gender difference :
Men can never be sure they are the baby - daddy and women are most concerned with securing a genuinely loyal father to care for the children .
Well , authors of a recent study in Psychological Science question the strength of the evolutionary just - so theory — realizing that there are men who find emotional cheating far worse than sexual cheating .
The study reports that personality patterns , shaped by one ’s relationship history , can have an impact on jealousy .
Over 400 participants took a survey to measure their jealousy type , meaning which troubles them more : sexual or emotional fidelity .
Then they completed a test which specifically measures attachment style in relationships ( those styles include : secure , fearful , preoccupied and dismissing . )
And they found that 65 percent of those who are autonomous and tend to be dismissive about commitment reported greater stress about sexual cheating than emotional cheating .
And 77 percent of those who are more securely attached and committed in relationships found emotional betrayal to be worse than sexual duplicity .
Even within each sex the results were striking .
Dismissive women were four times more likely to report greater sexual jealousy than securely committed women .
And dismissive men were 50 times more likely to report sexual jealousy than securely committed men .
So the authors warn : sex differences in jealousy are much more nuanced than a evolutionary explanation might imply .

From 1933 to 1999 , the Glass - Steagall Act separated commercial banking from investment banking , preventing deposit - taking banks from using consumers ’ money for risky stock market investments .
For two decades prior to Glass - Steagall ’s repeal , the financial sector experienced robust , record - breaking growth .
And less than a decade after the law was repealed , the US ’s financial system experienced near - total collapse , forcing the government to bail the big banks out with hundreds of billions in taxpayers ’ money .
ADVERTISEMENT
Yet , despite these basic facts , bankers are saying that a return to the Glass - Steagall Act — which would see some of the US ’s largest banks get broken up — would have a “ severe effect ” on the banking system , and are warning that it would mean banks would lend less to businesses and consumers , further hurting the economy .
“ The impact on Wall Street would be severe , ” Wayne Abernathy , a vice president at the American Bankers Association , told Bloomberg news service .
The issue of returning to the Glass - Steagall Act — which was enacted in the 1930s as a way of preventing another stock market crash like the one that happened in 1929 — has become a hot topic in Washington ever since Sen.
John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - WA ) put forward a bipartisan bill to bring back some of the provisions in the original Glass - Steagall Act .
Bringing back the wall between investment and commercial banking means that some of the highest - profile banks in America — including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup — would have to be broken up .
And while that idea sends shudders down the spines of Wall Street traders , it has plenty of appeal on Main Street , where anger with the bank bailout has been simmering for more than a year .
DEVASTATION ON WALL STREET — OR NO CHANGE ?
ADVERTISEMENT
Yet not all opponents of Glass - Steagall believe it would have a “ severe ” impact on Wall Street — some are saying it would change nothing at all .
“ If you look at what happened , with or without Glass - Steagall , it would have made no difference , ” Bloomberg quoted H. Rodgin Cohen , a corporate lawyer involved in many cases stemming from last year ’s financial collapse .
Bloomberg reported :
Cohen and others say the law would n’t have saved Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , both of which were pure investment banks , from collapse .
And the government would not have been able to enlist JPMorgan Chase & Co. to take on the assets of Bear Stearns or allow Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley to become bank holding companies , giving them access to the Federal Reserve ’s discount window .
Rather than split up banks , regulators should provide better supervision and require tougher capital requirements , said Cohen , who was also involved on behalf of banking clients in shaping the bill that dismantled parts of Glass - Steagall .

Other defenders of the status quo have made far less substantial arguments .
“ I think going back to Glass - Steagall would be like going back to the Walkman , ” said an unnamed Treasury official .
ADVERTISEMENT
Political observers say that the McCain - Cantwell bill has only a slim chance of becoming law .
When the bill was tabled earlier this month , Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , said it would be “ pretty difficult ” to garner the support needed in the House and Senate to pass the legislation .
The current financial reform measures working their way through Congress do not include anything quite as landscape - shifting as a return to Glass - Steagall .
For some economic analysts , the push to bring back Glass - Steagall amounts to war .
“ Congress is at war with Wall Street , ” Lyle Gramley , a former board member of the Federal Reserve , told Bloomberg .
“ They perceive Wall Street as being the root source of our financial crisis , and they want to do something to make sure that does n’t happen again . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Yet for other observers , it is n’t war enough .
“ The repeal of Glass - Steagall has exposed the U.S. economy to a level of risk that is simply unacceptable , ” House Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) , who introduced a bill similar to McCain - Cantwell in the House , wrote in a recent column .
Atlanta , Georgia ( CNN ) --
There are burglar bars on the windows of Second Mount Olive Baptist Church .
It takes a good shove to open its rusty metal door , identical to all the other offices in this rundown strip mall just off the highway in south Atlanta .
A fan whips up pages of a mildewed Old Testament lying open on one of the pews .
An overturned Culligan water tank , Mount Olive 's donation jar , is empty except for some change and a wadded buck .
The Rev. Johnny L. Jones , 73 , looks out at his congregation of about 15 .
He slips in his dentures .
And then the old man disappears .
In his place is the Rev. Hurricane , pounding a Hammond organ , ignoring the sweat that 's pooling at his temples , letting whoever wants to get up and take the mic for a solo .
Holding their elaborate hats in place , two elderly ladies defy their hips .
They are singing hard : " This old building keep a - leakin ' / I gotta move to a betta home / these old bones of mine keep on achin ' / I gotta move to a betta home ! "
And then the Rev. Hurricane does his Thing .
He is on his tippy toes , spinning .
He 's spinning and singing , arms up , voice higher , spinning , spinning .
Lance Ledbetter is on his feet , too .
Small , pale , hair impeccably combed , seeming transported from some black - and - white movie , he low - humming it and grinning .
Pushing his glasses up his nose , he turns to his wife , April : " Are you getting this ? "
A human Google of folk , gospel and blues music , Ledbetter , a Grammy - winning ethnographer , recorded the Rev. Hurricane for the better part of 2009 .
Ledbetter 's record label , Dust - to - Digital , released an LP of the Hurricane 's most stirring sermons , " Jesus Christ From A to Z , " featuring a sermon called " The Devil Made Me Do It . "
Old - school Atlantans , 20 - something hipsters and music lovers of every genre were at the release party .
The LP , released shortly before Christmas and available online and nationwide in stores , is a personal revival for the Hurricane , who was once a national gospel superstar signed with Jewel Records , which produced John Lee Hooker .
The record also suggests once again that Ledbetter and Dust - to - Digital can do what no one else can :
Make old ( like , really old ) time music cool again .
On Sunday , Ledbetter will find out whether he's won a second Grammy , this time for " Take Me To The Water : Immersion Baptism In Vintage Music And Photography 1890 - 1950 , " a CD ( compiled from old 78 - rpm records ) and 96 - page hardcover book with 75 spooky sepia photograph reproductions .
Works of art
Dust - to - Digital 's critical success , and its praise among varied music lovers , has much to do with another long - lost art : packaging .
His first project , 2003's " Goodbye , Babylon " -- " the greatest anthology of antique Southern sacred song and oratory ever assembled , " raved Rolling Stone magazine -- is a six - CD set of hymns , sacred harp , choirs , jug bands , a cappella and blues , some more than 100 years old , which comes in a hand - made pine box with a silk - screen of the Tower of Babel painting on the cover .
The box slides open to reveal inlaid raw Georgia cotton and a thick book " by authors of wide reputation " containing rare photos , lyrics and anecdotes about the singers .
For $ 100 , it can be found online -- and in art galleries .
The project took Ledbetter four years as he sought rare private collections around the world .
He compiled the work at considerable expense while holding down a full - time IT job .
Ledbetter was absorbed in a small network of musicologists whose private collections he wanted to mine .
Among them was the charismatic Joe Bussard , who has more than 25,000 American folk , gospel and blues records , most one - of - a- kind .
" I spent a year just listening to songs Joe sent me , " he said .
" It was my life .
I would n't leave my apartment .
My friends and my family did n't understand what I was doing , but I knew I was going to make something important . "
' It just came over me '
Raised in LaFayette , Georgia , Ledbetter began buying rock records from indie labels .
" I figured out that if you followed a label , you could trust that they had a curatorial approach , and you just bought whatever they put out , " he said .
He later spent time at the John C. Campbell Folk School in the mountains of North Carolina , a place where he enjoyed old - time school dances on the weekends with friends , and then worked at an Atlanta college radio station .
It was there he first heard the Smithsonian 's reissue of its Anthology of American Folk Music .
" I put it on the stereo in my apartment , and it just came over me , " he said .
" It 's like it connected every moment of my life in music that meant anything , like when I was kid going to cattle auctions and in college going to square dances .
It was a mystery unveiled to me about my history and American history . "
Ledbetter took over a gospel show on the station , quickly realizing that gospel music before 1940 was very hard to find .
Frustrated after searching so long , he decided that the only way to get it was to found his own label .
He also began the steep learning curve of digitizing old recordings , playing with needles and different grooves in a record to get just the right sound , running each millisecond through a computer and then recording .
A prime example : Dust - to - Digital 's conversion of the first known recording of the human voice .
The voice was recorded in France in 1860 -- nearly two decades before Thomas Edison invented the phonograph -- on paper , for a device unable to play back its work .
The recording , of a French folk song , would ultimately be reproduced by Dust - to - Digital relying on a complex algorithm .
" It 's a technological miracle that they got the sound , " Ledbetter said .
" That 's what 's exciting for me .
Music is something of what came before what came before , with hopefully a fresh interpretation . "
The Rev. Hurricane could use something like a miracle .
On the up in the 1960s and early 1970s , his LPs were flying , music critics were paying attention , and his church had grown to 5,000 members .
He had some nice suits , and his hurricane spin was the holiest in the South .
The voice of his mother was always front - of - mind .
" When I told her I wanted to spread the Gospel , and I was a boy , she said , ' I do n't want no jack - legged preacher in this family , ' " he said .
She did n't raise her son to be a Swaggart or a Bakker .
A promise was never better kept .
But when his church burned in 1973 , Jones lost his mojo big time .
His mid-'90s release , " Jesus Is in Town , " generated not a whisper .
But since Dust - to - Digital took an interest , with its connections to contemporary artists , Jones has packed several reputable venues , singing and sweating in a three - piece suit for hours .
" Maybe this will bring people back , " he said , wiping his forehead with a gold handkerchief after a Sunday morning at Mount Olive .
" Let 's pray for it . "
So we all effectively strip naked at airports , do we , in the cause of freedom .
How is that being free ?
Airport officials who like the work now look at nude images of nine - year - old girls .
How is that being free ?
How is that defending freedom , not losing it ?
And we bomb Yemen now , do we , to show how wrong they were to make fools of us with their exploding underpants .
How is that useful ?
How will that deter terrorists , bring down the number of terrorists ?
It will bring up the number , surely .
And we keep Guantanamo open , do we , because Yemenis back in Yemen might break free , and put on exploding underpants and board British Airways and fly to New York .
We keep Guantanamo open though the US President says ' it 's a recruiting poster for terrorists ' .
How does this help ?
How does this help in any way ?
The fact is , we 've lost .
We 've lost the arms race with the terrorists .
They now have exploding underpants .
Which means they can turn up in Times Square on New Year 's Eve and blow up a hundred people .
Or they can turn up in the Opera House and blow up an orchestra .
They can turn up at a Cricket Test and blow up the Members ' Stand .
How can they not do this ?
How can we stop them ?
We can't .
There are twenty million , probably , young men and boys , and maybe a million women and girls , willing to put on exploding underwear and mingle with the infidel , mingle with them long enough to blow up a few of them .
Which means they can kill , if they want to , sixty million of us .
We have lost this war .
We should seek a truce with the victors .
We should see if we can discern what they want , and decide what proportion of it we can give to them .
We did this in Vietnam .
We gave them the whole country , fleeing in lurching helicopters and kicking embassy servants off their rope ladders and ditching them in the sea .
We did this in Cuba after the Missile Crisis , guaranteeing fifty years of Castroism , which has thus far done us no harm .
We did this in Indonesia , by giving them West New Guinea , and , for a time , East Timor .
We did this in Korea , by abandoning our plans to invade or nuke Red China , and signing a truce that is still in place , and letting Red China into the UN .
What do the terrorists want ?
Our armies out of Iraq , it seems , and our armies are going .
Our armies out of Afghanistan , where they 're eventually leaving anyway .
It 's hard to ask a young man to be the last young man to die for the drug- running Karzai brothers and it 's getting harder .
Israel 's air force out of Gaza , Bethlehem , Hebron .
Most of the world wants that too , though the American armaments lords like selling high - tech rockets to Israel
What else do they want ?
Oh yes , the US armies out of the Holy Land of Saudi Arabia .
Well , they 've already left .
Is there anything else ?
I do n't think so .
Do they want to forcibly convert America to Islam by terror - bombing them into submission ?
Do n't think so .
They know they'd be nuked if they tried .
So what they want is pretty much what eighty percent of the West wants now .
Why not give it to them ?
There does n't have to be a written surrender .
Just a mild - mannered withdrawal , tiptoeing out , over a year or two , of Christian armies from Muslim countries .
The Terror would cease then .
Or come down to ' acceptable levels ' .
Though it 's always been at acceptable levels , really , if you look at it proportionally .
Consider these figures .
The number of white Christians or white agnostics killed by terrorists in the last ten years is around 4,500 .
This includes those killed by 9/11 , the Bali bombings , the Madrid , London and Glasgow bombings , the occasional assassination of a UN official , a CIA operative , a Russian who is hardline over Chechnya , the occasional death on a pirate ship .
But this number is less than the number killed in that time on New South Wales roads , which is about five thousand .
And four hundred and twenty thousand less than the number killed on US roads .
And forty - two million less than the number killed worldwide by cigarettes .
Yet no -one has bombed General Motors or SAAB or Phillip Morris .
No-one has proposed to fire - bomb Detroit , bomb it back to the Stone Age .
And billions upon billions have been spent on electronic devices at airports and in parliament houses and government offices that are now superseded and never worked anyway .
I got my Swiss Army knife into three parliament buildings on nine occasions , and was sprung only twice .
And I could have been Sirhan Sirhan or Charlie Manson .
No , old friend , no .
No ; no .
We should budget for terrorist deaths , the way we do for tobacco deaths , and road accident deaths .
We should sigh and say it 's a pity and counsel terrorists not to be terrorists in advertising campaigns , and write the dead off .
It 's just too costly spending the money we do getting nowhere .
Or perhaps you think letting strangers look at your nine - year - old daughter naked is worth it .
Worth it to save five hundred lives this year , if we do , and a hundred next year , if we do .
We 'd be better off spending the money on safer seatbelts .
Or fire - bombing fields of tobacco in Alabama .
Or curing diabetes .
This would save more lives .
The War on Terror is a racket .
It 's made Blackwater a billion dollars , and the Military - Industrial Complex five hundred billion thus far from pilotless rockets that blow up children .
Money that might have beaten back AIDS in Africa , and saved more lives .
Four and a half thousand dead in ten years .
A drop in the ocean .
Seven hundred thousand Rwandans died in a couple of weeks .
Fifty thousand Iraqis died in a year .
Three million fled their country ( including all the dentists ) in three years .
And twenty Muslims die in car bombings every other day .
Why are we stripping naked in airports ?
Are we mad ?
Or following the wrong advice ?
How does this help our image as a civilised people ?
We look like fools .
Hysterical fools .
Chicken Littles on speed .
Idiots .
Chiliasts howling ' prepare to meet thy doom ' .
We should start tiptoeing out of the Muslim countries , very soon .
Or perhaps you have a better idea .
EVERY fortnight an aeroplane carrying Polish policemen touches down at an airport in southern England .
Waiting for them each time is a glum band of 20 or so handcuffed men who are to be flown back to face trial in Poland .
Extradited prisoners are normally transferred on ordinary commercial flights , but a surge in the number being sent from Britain to Poland means that now a fortnightly “ Con Air ” service is being laid on by the Polish authorities .
Astonishingly , Poland now accounts for more than half of all Britain 's extraditions to Europe ( see chart ) .
The number of transfers grew from four in 2005 to 186 in the first nine months of 2008 .
That is about ten times the number being sent to Ireland , despite the fact that Irish migrants easily outnumber Poles in Britain .
What explains this sudden plague of hardened criminals ?
A look at the charge sheet suggests that they may not be so hard after all .
The crimes for which people have been extradited include “ theft of a chicken ” , “ theft of a piglet ” and “ theft of a cupboard door ” .
Whereas most countries are happy to put minor offences on hold until the suspect re-enters the country , Poland requests extradition for almost any crime , however petty .
Some of its eastern neighbours take a similarly finicky approach .
Britain has to take the requests seriously because of the European arrest warrant , which since 2004 has allowed courts to order the arrest of suspects anywhere in the European Union .
The warrant has accelerated the process of extradition and made it harder for border - hopping criminals to evade justice .
But , like other legal innovations passed in the wake of the attacks on America in 2001 , it has become more widely used than expected .
Britain 's High Court ruled in October that it could not stop the extradition to Romania of a man wanted for stealing ten chickens .
Pressure groups such as Fair Trials International worry about the standard of justice in some of the countries to which suspects are being fast - tracked .
The trivial requests are also wearing thin with the British police .
Fugitives are tracked down by the Serious Organised Crime Agency , an outfit designed to bust international crime syndicates , which now finds itself a partner in the war on poultry pinching .
In 2008 Britain sent a delegation to Poland to plead for a let - up , but to no avail .
In November a meeting of EU members in Brussels again tried to forge a compromise , fruitlessly .
The Poles say they are constitutionally bound to pursue every offender .
Others say that Poland uses more discretion at home , where its own resources are at stake .
The number of extraditions looks set to grow .
In April Britain will join a technologically whizzy pan-European information - sharing scheme , which will replace the current system of faxes and phone calls .
The Home Office reckons it will mean that British police have to make about three times as many extradition arrests as they do now .
Processing the extra traffic will cost £ 17 m a year even before police and court - staffing costs are factored in .
Surprisingly , dissent among British politicians is muted .
The opposition Conservatives are wary of kicking off an argument about Europe within their own ranks , and the Liberal Democrats are supportive of the scheme , partly because it was their European Parliament grouping that pushed the arrest warrant through in the first place .
For now , Britain will remain shoulder - to - shoulder with Poland in the crusade against chicken rustling .

Obama Orders Air Marshal Surge by Feb. 1 : ' Race Against Time ' U.S. fears more airplane bombers are in the terrorist pipeline .
Jan. 6 , 2010  -- President Barack Obama has ordered a " surge " of federal air marshals to be in place by Feb. 1 in what officials said was a " race against time , " with other suicide bombers believed to be in the terrorist pipeline , although there is no specific imminent threat , federal officials told ABC News .
Under a preliminary plan , the officials said the already existing federal air marshal force of more than 3,200 personnel would be deployed almost exclusively to overseas flights flown by U.S. carriers .
Domestic high - risk flights will be covered by agents from other federal law enforcement agencies who were trained as air marshals in the wake of the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .
" The personnel we trained back then comprised a kind of reserve air marshal force and they are now going to be borrowed on orders from the President to work domestic flights , " said a senior law enforcement agent briefed on the plan .
At the time of the Sept. 11 attacks , there were only 32 federal air marshals .
During his Tuesday speech on air security , President Obama said he had ordered " concrete steps " to enhance security , including " more air marshals on flights . "
Officials said the augmented force of air marshals would include agents from other departments within the Department of Homeland Security , including Customs , Border Patrol , ICE and the Secret Service .
The officials said intelligence reports and the debriefing of the accused underwear bomber , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , indicated that there could be more than a dozen other young men trained for suicide missions against U.S. aircraft .
" The rush is to get our people in place before they get theirs launched , " said the senior law enforcement official .
" We are going to try to cover every single U.S. flag carrier flight from overseas into the United States , " the official said .
Administrative officials from the Federal Air Marshal program were ordered to leave their offices and take flight assignments , the official added .
" Most of us have not had a day off since the attempted bombing on Christmas , " the official said .

Part 1 : Laying A Theoretical Background
Update ( 1/26/2010 ) : Since the original publication of this story on Tom's Hardware DE , we 've shared our findings and benchmark binary with AMD for analysis .
The company 's commentary is included in our conclusion .
Intro : Are n't All Graphics Cards Equal When It Come To 2D ?
Since the launch of Windows 7 a few months ago , graphics card vendors have introduced a handful of new GPUs , working to develop and roll out drivers for their products .
Enough time has also passed for them to clean up the teething pains of a fresh operating system ( which have been , thankfully , significantly less painful than what we saw during the move to Vista ) , enabling objective benchmarks on a clean slate of new technology .
We also realized that , while 3D takes center stage nowadays , there might also be some benefits for us to revisit a component of graphics that we take for granted every day without really thinking too much about it — namely , 2D .
This was n't one of those out - of - the - blue " let 's add something to the test suite that has n't been a real issue since the days when RAMDAC performance was a major differentiator " moments .
More on this shortly .
Although the primary area of interest for most users is on the display speed of the Windows GUI ( where Windows 7 earns lots of praise in comparison to Vista ) , we determined somewhat reluctantly that the supposed “ graphics refresh ” in Windows 7 is n’t really too fresh at all .
Compared to Windows XP ( and even Vista ) , graphics card vendors do n't seem to have fully optimized for 2D graphics in Windows 7 quite yet , at least when it comes to close examination of the brand new implementation of GDI ( Graphics Device Interface ) API calls .
What we know as 2D graphics consist of more than cool colors , object blending effects , and animated menus with drop shadows ; they also require developers to get down and dirty with pixels , lines , curves , rectangles , polygons , and all kinds of other “ graphics primitives , ” as they ’re sometimes called .
Important Preliminary Note
We wanted to stay away from emotional overtones in this article , even though devoted occupants of the red or green camps might need to rub their eyes as they read through this material .
Because we ourselves did n’t want to believe the results of our own tests , we took extra time and care in this story ’s preparation , in the interests of all affected parties , to produce results that are as objective and defensible as possible .
We also worked hard to create the most objective possible bases for comparing graphics cards against one another .
We will also avoid pointing fingers : rather , it ’s important to understand this article as a contribution and an aid to those users who not only use their PCs for gaming , but also for those who use their PCs to get real work done .
In this context , it ’s important to observe that , currently , it can be quite vexing to work productively with 2D graphics in Windows 7 .
For example , using a Radeon HD 5870 and the latest drivers , we found it difficult to produce simple vector - based graphics , to render simple or complex CAD designs , or even to play 2D games in higher graphics quality modes .
We mention this not as a criticism , but instead as an approach to a definite problem that we sought to analyze and understand as fully as possible .
Theory and Practice
Because most readers are likely unaware of the built - in functions and behavior of 2D acceleration in Windows XP through Windows 7 , we ’ve broken this extremely comprehensive article into two parts .
In this first part , we will convey the noteworthy background and technical topics relevant to 2D graphics , so that when readers graduate to the second part , they ’ll not only be able to understand our tests , but also be better - equipped to interpret our results .
To help this process along , we even developed our own small benchmarking program ( and will make it available for interested parties to download and use for themselves ) .
Our goal is to make both parts as informative , readable , and noteworthy as possible .
In the next section , we ’ll tackle 2D basics .
In passing , we ’d also like to observe that a little background in this area wo n’t hurt anybody , and may even come in handy for other things besides understanding our benchmarks .
In a trial that never became the referendum on abortion that some abortion foes wanted , Scott Roeder , a 51 - year - old airport shuttle driver , was convicted today of murdering George Tiller , one the nation ’s few physicians who performed late - term abortions .
The jury of seven men and five women deliberated for only 37 minutes .
Roeder faces life in prison after being convicted of first - degree murder .
Roeder also was convicted on two counts of aggravated assault for threatening to shoot church ushers Keith Martin and Gary Hoepner as he fled Reformation Lutheran Church after murdering Tiller .
Whether Roeder shot Tiller at point - blank range in the forehead at Tiller ’s church in Wichita last May was never at issue ; Roeder had admitted it to reporters , in court filings and finally to a jury on Thursday .
He also said he had been stalking Tiller since at least 1999 .
“ I have never seen a state ’s case and a defense case that so neatly dovetail , ” said prosecutor Anne Swegle , noting that Roeder admitted systematically stalking Tiller before calmly approaching him in church , pressing a gun to his forehead and firing a . 22 - caliber slug into his brain .
“ He was totally remorseless in delivering to you his version of events , ” Swegle told the jury .
Roeder , the only witness called by the defense , said he felt relief after shooting Tiller on May 31 .
After the murder , he drove toward Kansas City , stopping for a pizza along the way .
Roeder had wanted to claim the crime was justifiable homicide , based on his belief that abortion -- in every case -- is murder .
But Sedgwick County Judge Warren Wilbert said he could not claim he acted out of necessity .
Abortion rights groups became alarmed when Roeder ’s attorneys asked the judge to allow the jury to consider convicting Roeder of voluntary manslaughter .
At the end of testimony Thursday , Wilbert ruled that the jury could only consider premeditated , first - degree murder .
Roeder is also the subject of a Justice Department investigation , and he could face federal charges in connection with the murder .
The conviction brings a kind of closure to the city of Wichita , which became a center of the anti-abortion movement in the late 1980s and 1990s .
After a religious conversion in 1992 , Roeder became active in a network of abortion foes , some of whom have been convicted of violent acts against abortion providers .
Tiller , 67 , who was beloved by his patients , was a victim numerous times .
In 1986 , his clinic , Women ’s Health Care Services , was firebombed .
In 1991 , the clinic became a focus of protest in the so - called “ Summer of Mercy . ”
Thousands of anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested as they tried to blockade his clinic .
In 1993 , anti-abortion activist Rachelle Shannon shot Tiller in both arms as he left the clinic .
He was back at work the next day .
Roeder testified Thursday that he befriended Shannon , who is in prison in Kansas .
“ I admired her , ” Roeder said .
In 2002 , the head of Operation Rescue , a group dedicated to ending abortion using confrontational tactics , moved to Wichita .
Its president , Troy Newman , said his goal was to put Tiller out of business .
Many of Tiller ’s patients were women who discovered late in pregnancy that their fetuses were severely compromised by genetic anomalies .
But he also terminated the pregnancies of women who might suffer psychological harm if their pregnancies went to term .
Under Kansas law , such abortions were legal as long as two doctors , independent of one another , signed off on the procedures .
After Tiller was murdered , his wife announced his clinic would close for good .
Advocates on both sides of the abortion divide found themselves squeezed together on the hard courtroom benches during the trial , which began last Friday with the prosecution ’s opening statements .
Officials from the National Abortion Federation and the Feminist Majority Foundation sat with anti-abortion extremists , some of whom have spent substantial time in prison for violence against abortion clinics .

Palin's sourcing
Sarah Palin's Facebook entry attacks the stimulus in familiar terms , but what caught my attention were the four links — two of them to the financial paper Investors Business Daily .
One is to an unsigned editorial suggesting the stimulus is an invitation to " fraud and corruption , " the other to a report on foreign - made wind turbines .
The paper , though , has come to fill an open space in the conservative media , an authoritative - sounding voice somewhere to the right of The Wall Street Journal .
It got in some trouble for suggesting Steven Hawking would never have survived in Britain and went fairly deep into speculation over Barack Obama 's religion : Perhaps he was n't a " lapsed Muslim " but in fact an African nativist .
Scholars & Rogues honors JD Salinger as our 32nd masthead scrogue .
J.D. Salinger is dead .
If you want to know about his lousy life or how he treated his kids or his ex-wives and girlfriends , or any of that other People Magazine crap , look somewhere else .
I just do n’t feel like going into it .
Too many jerks spend all their time reading that shit anyway , and it ’s just not worth recounting it when you could read it all at TMZ or some place like that and besides Salinger himself was pretty touchy about people talking about him and he ’d probably sue from the grave .
I mean , the guy sued every goddamn body who ever said boo to him for the last 50 years or so .
Some stuff just is n’t worth the trouble .
So I ’ll just talk about driving to town last night … .
See , I was driving into town tonight after I ’d read about Salinger dying and listening to satellite radio and the station played Johnny Winter ’s cover of “ Let It Bleed ” which somehow tied into hearing about Salinger ’s death : we all need someone we can lean on .
And thinking about Salinger being dead started me thinking about how Salinger would write about it .
I wondered then if maybe he’d had a ball glove that he ’d written snatches of poetry on so he ’d have something to read during the lulls in a ball game .
But then I was listening again to Winter ’s cover of the song by The Rolling Stones , so that made me think of that snatch of poetry attributed to Brian Jones ( and to Gertrude Stein and to many an 18th century girl ’s sampler ) that ’s on one of the early greatest hits collections , Through the Past Darkly :
When this you see , remember me / And bear me in your mind / Let all the world say as they will / Speak of me as you find … .
I like to think Salinger would like that , but I ca n’t say .
You ca n’t speak for other people .
R.E.M. came on the radio next – “ Driver 8 ” :
And the train conductor says / Take a break , Driver 8 / Driver 8 , take a break / We can reach our destination – but we ’re still a ways away … .
I wrote a letter to Salinger back in the early ’ 80 ’s when he was appearing in the news with some regularity for suing people for talking / writing / thinking about him – or so it seemed .
Reconstructing the letter took my mind off R.E.M. momentarily :
Dear Mr. Salinger ,
I know you wo n’t answer this letter but I thought I ’d write anyway .
I do n’t blame you for suing people who try to drag you ( or at least your life ) out into the public eye when you want to be left alone .
I ’m a novelist myself ( as yet unpublished ) and I have some ambivalence about success myself .
I thought you explained your position on this pretty well at the end of Catcher in the Rye .
Maybe people should be satisfied with that ….
That is n’t the entire letter , but it ’s the gist of it .
I got a terse reply in return from a literary agency in New York that acknowledged that I ’d written their client .
I like to think Salinger told them to write me because he felt a kindred spirit .
Raise High the Roof Beam , Carpenters .
Maybe all Salinger needed was to take a break .
Then , when he got through with his break , he did n’t know how to come back .
Maybe he did n’t know how to explain that he needed to take a break , and maybe he did n’t know how to explain that he wanted to come back .
Telling people what you really feel is hard .
Overcoat weather again , you know ?
So I did my errand in town and headed for home – and what should come out of the radio but David Bowie ’s “ Fame ” ?
… bully for you / chilly for me / Got to get a rain check on …pain … .
I thought of Salinger – and of how lonely his life must have been – alienated from not just all the people he loved but from the public , too , simply because he did n’t want fame .
His fame brought him in the end – pain and little else … .
And I remembered that famous line I referred to in my letter , that line from his magnum opus .
I wondered if he took the advice of his most famous character , Holden Caulfield :
Do n’t ever tell anybody anything .
If you do , you start missing everybody … .
Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
Scores of bodies were found in a mass grave outside the capital city of Port - au - Prince on Friday , a sign of Haitians ' desperation three days after a 7.0 - magnitude earthquake devastated the impoverished nation .
At least 100 bodies were discovered by a CNN crew in one open pit outside Port - au - Prince , with several other pits half - filled or completely covered over with earth , presumably full .
The bodies were brought to the site by dump trucks , still accompanied by the remnants of what loved ones used to move them -- pieces of plywood , makeshift shrouds and in one case , an old refrigerator .
Elsewhere , bodies were being shoved into old crypts in the city 's existing cemeteries .
Haiti's Minister of Civil Protection said Friday that the government estimates more than 50,000 people were killed , with the number possibly closer to 100,000 .
There is not yet an official count of the dead from the quake .
Despite the death and destruction , hundreds of people , mostly women , took to the streets in an area of the capital on Friday , singing and chanting as they marched down the street -- a sign of resilience amid huge mounds of rubble .
It is not the first time such a display has been observed .
Singing and clapping has been heard well into the night in a large square that thousands of people have made home after the earthquake , a CNN crew reported .
Meanwhile , a crucial 72 - hour window elapsed Friday afternoon -- the time to free those who still may be alive trapped under the remains of buildings .
An 18 - month - old baby was pulled from the rubble Friday , seemingly unharmed .
Get the latest developments in Haiti
Still , those rescued were n't out of danger as hospitals lacked proper supplies to treat some of them .
An 11 - year - old girl rescued Thursday -- an effort CNN captured on camera throughout the day -- died later that night from her injuries after a first - aid station said it could n't treat her severe leg wound , her family said .
Aid workers continued to trickle into the country Friday , trying to provide water and food to survivors in the capital , which still was being rocked by aftershocks Friday .
The quake toppled many of Port - au - Prince 's buildings , and U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon estimated Friday that it left as many as " 50 percent of buildings in the worst - hit areas damaged or destroyed . "
Many of the capital 's 3 million people are without access to food , water , shelter and electricity , he said , and crews are working " to save as many lives as possible . "
Haitian President Rene Preval identified three priorities in the recovery effort -- get the government back up and running , clear the roads and sanitize the city of the scores of corpses scattered about its streets , he told U.N. television Friday
There were small signs of progress in food and water distribution by Friday afternoon .
A few fire trucks and tankers were seen distributing water .
A U.N. distribution center also was set up -- guarded by Bolivian U.N. peacekeeping troops -- where some 10,000 plates of cooked chicken and rice were handed out to a patient line of survivors .
Elsewhere , a U.N. food convoy was rushed by dozens of hungry people who clamored to reach the handouts of nutritional biscuits and water - purification tablets .

Ban announced Friday that he will travel to Haiti on Sunday .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also announced Friday that she will visit the quake - battered capital on Saturday , the first major U.S. official to do so .
President Obama spoke for about a half - hour with Preval on Friday , pledging the " full support of the American people , " including long - term help .
The relief effort has been challenged by the destruction and the need for more supplies , the U.N. secretary - general said , citing blocked roads and limited capacity at the capital 's one - runway airport .
The Federal Aviation Administration ordered a ground stop on all U.S. flights into Haiti Friday because of a lack of ramp space .
Haiti aid efforts hampered in critical hours
But , Ban said , aid flights are arriving , and food and medical supplies are beginning to be distributed in Port - au - Prince .
" Although it is inevitably slower and more difficult than any of us would wish , we are mobilizing all resources as fast as we possibly can , " Ban said Friday , announcing an appeal for $ 550 million .
The United Nations announced Friday that at least 37 of its personnel had died -- 36 with the U.N. mission and one with the World Food Programme .
More than 300 are still unaccounted for .
U.N. entities in Haiti employ more than 12,000 people .
Preval said that he has been touched by the friendship of the American people .
He expressed his condolences for the loss of American citizens in Haiti .
The State Department has identified at least six U.S. deaths so far and a spokesman said Friday that toll " will go up . "
Despite relative calm , CNN reporters witnessed some sporadic looting and violence Thursday afternoon .
Watch how texting is helping to raise money for Haiti
" If help does n't come quickly , it probably will ( get worse ) , " Agnes Pierre - Louis , manager of her family - owned hotel , the Le Plaza in downtown Port - au - Prince .
" We 're not hearing anything from the government .
We 're not seeing any foreign aid yet . "
But Lt. Gen. Ken Keen , deputy commander of the U.S. Southern Command , said forces have not " seen a great deal of insecurity . "
The priority now , he said , is cranking up rescue and relief efforts to stave off restiveness .

Winter time is flat time .
I am reluctant to use rim liners to avoid flatting because it seems when I did flat I ’d have that much more to clean and realign .
I ’m a roadie riding 700X23 Vittoria ’s Open Corsa 290 TPI tires .
What is the consensus with you guys of a good - feeling , puncture - resistant tire for rural riding in the winter ?
And happy New Year !
— Posted by wyman mccuil
A great choice for you would be the Continental 4 Season .
Try going to a 700 × 25 ; the higher volume will help to give you a slightly more pleasant ride and will also give a larger footprint so , theoretically , better traction .
These are exceptionally durable tires with great puncture resistance and are the tires of choice for many of our employees who spend a lot of time on their bikes year - round .
I ’m planning a long ride this summer .
I ’m worried about popped spokes .
I ’ll be fully loaded .
Would you suggest new and improved wheels ?
I ’ve got regular 32 spokes now .
If yes , how would you go about it ?
Have someone build me some new wheels or buy something already made ?
— Posted by Peter French
For touring or fully loaded commuting we usually recommend a good 36 - hole rim laced up to a reliable hub .
You should look at something like a Mavic Open Pro and an Ultegra hub .
If your local bike shop has a good wheelbuilder that you feel you can trust , I ’d go this way .
Ride them locally for a while then bring them in to be retensioned if necessary , and you should have a wheelset that you can trust for a long time .
I cannot easily park one of my many bikes near my office at 51st and Madison .
I wish to use a bike to go a short distance from Roosevelt Island over the 59th Street Bridge to my office , which will take about 30 minutes maximum .
Would you recommend a folding bike , and if so which and at what cost ?
I need something basic and have no other plans to use the folding bike other than to take it with me to my office .
— Posted by Rob
I ’m seriously considering purchasing a folding bicycle for both commuting and recreation .
What , in your estimation , is the best bike for my money ?
I ’ve seen prices range from $ 200 to more than $ 2,000 .
I ’m not a serious cyclist , and would ride mostly in the warmer months .
I ’m a petite woman , so size / weight is also a consideration .
— Posted by Carissa
Keep in mind that parking garages / lots in New York City are taking bicycles now .
Talk to some of the ones in the neighborhood that you work in to see what the costs are .
This way your bike will be in a secure and hopefully indoor spot .
If you do decide to go the folding bike route do n’t think that you will be saving money by getting an inexpensive one because you have a short commute .
You do n’t want to be late for work due to an unreliable bike .
At Bicycle Habitat our most satisfied folding bike users are riding Brompton .
It is a premium product so you will spend a bit initially , but it is a great investment .
Can you recommend a good chain lube for cold - weather biking ?
Many of the products I have tried seem to thicken up when it gets very cold ( it gets cold in Milwaukee ) , and thus require relubrication frequently .

What ’s a good cold - weather ( zero to - 10 degrees ) lube for cables / housing , derailleurs and brakes ?
— Posted by Kent
How often do you have to lubricate the chain ?
I almost never do it .
What are the risks from not doing so ?
— Posted by Drew
For cold weather I really like ProLink Chain Lube .
This was developed for airplanes so it stays very slick in the cold without attracting too much grit and grime when applied properly .
I would try to stay away from lubes with Teflon additives because as the liquid evaporates you are left with sticky flakes that gunk stuff up .
How often to lube is a tough one to answer not knowing how often you ride or the conditions you ride in .
If it ’s frequently wet when you ride you will need to do it more often .
I think the most important aspect to lubing a chain is not to go overboard thinking that more is better , just the opposite is true , and make sure to wipe the excess off the outside of the chain as that will only attract dirt and dust .
When you do the chain also put a drop on anything else that moves — derailleur pivots , cables where they enter and exit the housings , brake pivots and do n’t forget the cable guides under the bottom bracket if your bike has them .
The risk of not lubing frequently enough is that you wear out the drivetrain parts much more quickly .
A good rule of thumb is , if it sounds like a flock of birds chasing you down the street , it ’s too late .
After I ride in rain or slushy sludge , what ’s most important to clean , and how ?
It ’s 2 F now .
Anything I can do about the bike getting harder to pedal in this ?

I try to bike to work every day , including in the winter .
What steps should I take for keeping my bike in good condition during the winter ?
I have a hybrid ( Trek ) and do n’t know much about the mechanics of the bike , so the simpler the better .
Thanks !

What are some tips for cleaning a bike indoors without staining surroundings with road grit , oily gunk and other splatters ?
— Posted by Mark
This seems to be a recurring theme throughout , so I figured I should lump these together .
Most of your cleaning needs can be taken care of with a rag moistened with a cleaner like Pedros Bike Lust .
I hesitate to recommend spraying the bike down when I do n’t know how well sealed your moving parts are or how well lubricated you keep your bike .
A thorough wipe down with attention payed to the area around the bottom bracket and lower headset bearing is a good place to start .
For overly greasy , gunky buildups wiping with a rag moistened with a good citrus cleaner first is a good idea .
After you are done cleaning make sure to lube your chain and cables .
See the previous answer for some ideas on what to use and what to lube .
The other thing that happens in the cold is the freewheel or freehub can get kind of sluggish and the grease inside firms up and it does n’t spin as smoothly as you ’d like .
Usually as you ride it heats up and gets better .
Scottish history lovers can get a unique view of their country ’s heritage at the National Museum of Scotland ( NMS ) – a team of experts has rebuilt a Pictish throne .
The wooden giant was created by master furniture maker Adrian McCurdy , who took his lines from ancient stone carvings .
Picts ruled Scotland north of the Firth of Clyde from the 4th to 9th century AD .
But they are best known for their mysterious rock art , which still baffles experts today .
The throne was commissioned by the museum alongside distillers Glenmorangie .
It will go on display next Tuesday ( December 1st ) at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre , before moving to the Glenmorangie Distillery in Tain , Ross - shire , next year .
It will visit a number of locations across the country thereafter .
A new book exploring Scotland ’s ancient past will be published in a book to be published in 2011 .
“ We ’ve learnt so much about the design , manufacture and use of these thrones . ”
David Clark , the NMS ’ archaeology keeper , hailed his researchers and the uniqueness of the throne .
“ There are no surviving examples of thrones from early historic Scotland , ” he tells the BBC , “ and during the process of recreating this piece we ’ve learnt so much about the design , manufacture and use of these thrones .
It ’s very exciting to see this type of throne brought to life for the first time in over a thousand years . ”
Scottish heritage has been frequently hitting the Heritage Key headlines for the past few months .
The long sought - after Lewis Chessmen will be coming back to the NMS on loan ; Torc Iron
Age gold has been found worth 1 million ; a rare Bronz Age burial has been discovered in the Highlands ; and prehistoric rock art has been found in Perthshire .
We still prefer King
Tut ’s throne – which you can still see right here at Heritage Key , thanks to the amazing photography of Sandro Vannini !
Would you visit the reproduction throne ?
Would you go out of your way to visit any replica artefact ?

The Reverend Gordon Parry said it was fitting to use " gifts from God "
A fruit and vegetable nativity scene depicting baby Jesus as a carrot has been given the church 's blessing .
Onions have also been used for the heads of Mary and Joseph by Tulleys Farm , of Turners Hill , near Crawley , West Sussex , leading to some criticism .
One visitor said it was " offensive " , while others were " overwhelmingly positive " , said owner Stuart Beare .
Local vicar
The Reverend Gordon Parry gave the nativity his backing , saying it was fitting to use " gifts from God " .
" One understands that people have sensitivities around this issue , " he said .
" However , Tulleys Farm are merely portraying the nativity in the context of their business .
" It seems fitting that they have chosen to use what Christians regard as gifts from God , ie vegetables , to create a symbol of God 's greatest gift , ie his son , Jesus Christ . "
Donations from the display will go towards the upkeep of St Leonard 's Church , in Turners Hill .
At one time an individual 's choice to smoke in public was based on purely personal considerations .
Either you felt like having a smoke or not .
Not so much any more .
Taking into consideration the greater effects of public smoking , many jurisdictions have created laws restricting it .
Attitudes are changing , and it is considered socially unacceptable to light up indiscriminately in public .
Is conspicuous consumption next on the list ?
The unintended effects of one billion people consuming 35 times more everything than the rest of the planet are monumental .
We are living in the second hand smoke of our smoldering scorched earth lifestyles .
We are destroying everything the enemy can use , and the enemy seems to be the very planet itself .
Not only do we see that there ARE limits to what nature can provide us , but we are nearing some of those limits .
We are witnessing the limits of atmosphere and ocean , forest and farmland , flora and fauna .
On a finite planet with an ever - increasing population , I can only see this going one way , and it is not a vision of excess .
There are current examples of consumption laws .
Some are health related such as restrictions on consuming cigarettes in public , while others deal with resource depletion such as rationing water in a drought .
My own community has water rationing every summer during the dry season and it is the main limiting factor in the development of this area .
Fines are associated with breaking consumption laws , and when we opt to hit people in the pocketbook you know we mean business .
Society reminds us in this way that our decisions are no longer bound by purely personal whims , and the greater good will be preserved .
Such " extreme measures " become ingrained in our lives and before long we adapt , and perhaps even wonder how things could have been the way they were previously .
It is what happens when you choose to live with less - you wonder what all that stuff you used to have was for .
You do n't miss it .
You welcome the empty space it has left behind .
According to the law of diminishing utility increasing consumption does not translate into increased happiness past a certain critical point .
It is possible that the less we consume , the happier we will become .
Will we need further laws to help us overcome the initial fear as we move toward a sustainable existence ?
Our current high - consumption lifestyle is leading to obesity , chronic stress , climate change , and a widening gap between rich and poor .
Are we going to limit our own self - destructive behaviour , or will we need to be dragged kicking and screaming to do the right thing ?
It 's not just personal anymore .
We all share the same planet .
Many American women are prescribed estrogen to combat the negative effects of menopause , such as bone loss and mood swings .
Now , new evidence from a Tel Aviv University study suggests that hormone replacement therapy might also protect them -- and younger women -- from schizophrenia as well .
Prof. Ina Weiner of Tel Aviv University 's Department of Psychology and her doctoral student Michal Arad have reported findings suggesting that restoring normal levels of estrogen may work as a protective agent in menopausal women vulnerable to schizophrenia .
Their work , based on an animal model of menopausal psychosis , was recently reported in the journal Psychopharmacology .
" We 've known for some time that when the level of estrogen is low , vulnerability to psychotic symptoms increases and anti-psychotic drugs are less likely to work .
Now , our pre-clinical findings show why this might be happening , " says Prof.
Weiner .
A hormonal treatment to address a behavioral condition
In their study , Weiner and Arad removed the ovaries of female rats to induce menopause - like low levels of estrogen and showed that this led to schizophrenia - like behavior .
The researchers then tried to eliminate this abnormal behavior with an estrogen replacement treatment or with the antipsychotic drug haloperidol .
Estrogen replacement therapy effectively alleviated schizophrenia - like behavior but haloperidol had no effect on its own .
Haloperidol regained its effect in these rats when supplemented by estrogen .
" When the level of estrogen was low , we could see psychotic - like behavior in the animals .
Moreover , the sensitivity to psychosis - inducing drugs went up , while the sensitivity to anti-psychotic drugs went down , " Prof .
Weiner says .
This is exactly what we observe in women with low estrogen levels , " she says .
" But we also found that estrogen , all by itself , combats psychosis in both male and female rats . "
Furthermore , in low amounts estrogen increases the effectiveness of anti-psychotic drugs .
Prof .
Weiner points out that the medical community is hotly debating the pros and cons of estrogen replacement as an add - on to conventional treatment in schizophrenia .
Detractors point to higher chances of cervical cancer and heart attacks in those who receive estrogen supplements .
But according to her study , which looked at very specific factors possibly related to schizophrenia , estrogen replacement therapy could have positive behavioral effects , she concludes .
Assessing the possibility for prevention
During the course of a woman 's lifetime , estrogen levels do not remain constant .
During her reproductive years , these levels are affected by the menstrual cycle .
There are also dramatic changes in the levels of estrogen just after a woman gives birth -- a change , which can trigger " post - partum blues , " and in extreme cases lead to clinical depression and psychosis .
As a preventative therapy , estrogen could be given to women at certain points in time when they are most at risk for schizophrenia , Prof .
Weiner suggests : in their mid-twenties and later during the menopausal years .
" Antipsychotic drugs are less effective during low periods of estrogen in the body , after birth and in menopause , " says Prof .
Weiner .
" Our research links schizophrenia and its treatment to estrogen levels .
Men seem less likely to begin schizophrenia after their 40s , which also suggests that estrogen is the culprit . "
A commenter at Immoral Minority , an Alaskan blog , digs up a newspaper clipping online :
So I visit the link that LoveAndKnishesFromBrooklyn provided , which comes from the " Neighbors " section of the ADN on July 7 , 1984 , and I read the following : Awards for the various competitions will be provided by the new Miss Wasilla , Katrina Mueller , at 6 p.m. at the Mat - su Resort Pavilion .
We already know that Palin did not win the Miss Congeniality in that contest either , as her Wiki profile claimed .
In the fictional Going Rogue , Palin says she did win the Miss Wasilla contest - but does n't specify what year , although every other source says 1984 .
I 'm not adding this to the " odd lies " roster until all the facts are totally clear .
It 's beyond trivial .
But it 's important to keep track of the insane amount of times Palin has just made stuff up .
It helps establish a pattern of deceit that helps us assess her other fantastic claims .
Update : IM has now established that Sarah Palin was Miss Wasilla 1983 , and a third runner up for Miss Alaska in 1984 .
Bonus pick of Palin wearing some sort of beauty pageant crown after the jump :

TSN 's Bob McKenzie polled a group of NHL scouts to come up with his Mid-Season Top 30 for this summer 's NHL Draft .
Lots of interesting information there .
1. Taylor Hall is still above Tyler Seguin , though someone said it could come down to the needs of the team picking first .
Of course , I think Carolina and Edmonton both probably need a scoring wing more than a center right now .
2 . At least a couple of scouts had either Erik Gudbranson or Brandon Gormley ahead of Cam Fowler .
I 'm not as familiar with Gormley , but there 's no way I 'd take Gudbranson over Fowler .
Gudbranson is really good too , but I can't see passing up on Fowler to take him .
3. Brett Connolly is really good , but I think a lot of him holding onto that top 5 spot will hinge on the Combine and how convinced teams are that his injury problems wo n't carry over into the NHL .
4 . There 's 3
Russians in the top 11 of the list , but I can't see three Russians going that high in the draft .
Some teams may take the gamble based on pure talent , but I think we 'll be hearing about " the Russian Factor " every 30 seconds during the draft this year .
5. Mikael Granlund slipped a little based on his very poor WJCs -- though I guess he was injured in the tournament .
I 'd still stay away from him .
Nino Neiderreiter made a huge jump up because of how he played at the WJCs .
6. Riley Sheahan is at 13 , which seems a little more realistic than where Central Scouting had him .
7 . If somebody can get Derek Forbort at 18th in the Draft , that seems like ridiculous value for that pick .
8. Tyler Pitlick at number 20 even one - ups where NHL Central Scouting had him .
I can't see him going much higher because I do n't know that he quite has the hands to be a big - time scorer , but outside of the top couple of guys , he 's probably one of the safest picks in the draft .
He 's got a lot of potential and brings a good effort every night .
9 . Watching the U17s last year , I would not have guessed Emerson Etem and Jarred Tinordi would be the top two rated prospects of that group , but both where raw , high potential guys , that appear to have really panned out .
10 . I still do n't think I 'd draft Brock Nelson as high as he 's rated , but I can certainly see why people would have him that high .
11 . Jon Merrill does n't even make the top 30 , which is a pretty big surprise to me .
If somebody walks out of LA with either Taylor Hall or Tyler Seguin and Jon Merrill , they 've got a pretty good base to start rebuilding with .
Meanwhile , the guys at The Pipeline Show started talking about the 2011 NHL Draft .
The book on next year still seems to be a few very , very good players , but not much depth , both for Americans and the draft in general .
The FBI is currently the subject of world ridicule after a widely circulated image of Osama bin-Laden , digitally updated for age , was withdrawn following the revelation by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that the actual photo was of Spanish lawmaker Gaspar Llamzares .
Llamzares is a leader of Spain ’s United Left Party and a communist .
The Spanish politician , according to Reuters , found the whole affair quite odd .
“ In the last few days I have seen the security services involved in some very strange things , some major failures , but I would never have believed they could have affected me so directly , ” he said .
Llamzares , a peace activist and critic of U.S. foreign policy is a member of Parliament and spokesperson for the United Left .
“ I am stupefied the FBI has used my photo – but it could have been anyone ’s – to compose a picture of a terrorist .
It affects my honor , my own image and also the security of all us , ” Llamazares said .
The FBI had claimed the image was the result of “ sophisticated digital profiling technology . ”
The “ sophisticated digital profiling technology ” turned out to be an ordinary version of Photoshop , the image - processing software .
The U.S. State Department has issued an apology to the respected Spanish legislator .
Llamzares has rejected the apology and demanded an investigation .
“ Apologies are not enough , ” he told a news conference at Parliament after the U.S. ambassador apologized via Spain ’s interior minister on Monday , the Huffington Post reported .
“ I want a thorough investigation into this disgraceful case , which not only causes concern but also worry and indignation over the behavior of the FBI , ” Llamzares said .
Press reports indicate the FBI obtained the photo from Google images , but Llamzares is doubtful about this .
“ He said he doubted the FBI had found his photo by chance on the Internet , ” the Huffington Post article said .
The communist leader wants to know if “ the FBI has a habit of keeping files on leftist politicians in the U.S. , Europe , Latin American or elsewhere . ”
Llamazares added , “ I am sure that in addition to incompetence , this is the sectarian and ideological use of law - enforcement , the heat of a preventive war . ”
The United Left Party is coalition of communist , socialist and workers parties in Spain .
It was set up in 1986 , as an election coalition consisting of the Spanish Communist Party , Progressive Federation , Party of the Peoples of Spain , Socialist Action Party , Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia , Humanist Party , Carlist Party , Republican Left and a number of independents .
After the United Left suffered electoral losses in 2008 , Llamazares resigned as its leader .
In 2009 he led a campaign to condemn the Pope for saying using condoms caused more harm than good in the fight against AIDS .

It takes a strange frame of mind to believe that demolishing a wooded encampment of homeless immigrant men and evicting them onto the streets during one of the coldest weeks of winter can be an act of prudence and compassion .
But that is how the town of Huntington , in Suffolk County on Long Island , describes it .
It looks more like something else : an exercise in needless cruelty , in wishing a problem away .
This month , the town decided to clean up a large , privately owned lot where a few dozen Latino day laborers had found shelter .
The lot , which is behind railroad tracks , is densely overgrown and well suited for an invisible encampment .
It was an open secret for years , the laborers occasionally but only half - heartedly rousted .
This time was different .
The owners were ordered to dismantle and clear out the debris , and a crew went in with chainsaws on Jan. 11 .
Some men lost all they owned .
Now they have no job , no bed , no place to stay all day , no way to get home .
But it is not the town ’s problem .
It has no homeless shelter , and is not about to open one .
Suffolk County has a shelter , but it does n’t let in immigrants without papers .
There is a hiring site with a trailer , but it closes at night .

Posing for their first day at their new nursery , these 16 panda cubs are clearly going to be a handful .
In these amazing images , the tiny pandas are shown their new home for the first time after being separated from their mothers .
The curious cubs were soon exploring their assault course home complete with umbrellas and balloons to welcome them on their first day .
Morning class :
The 16 panda cubs posed for a photograph with their keepers at Wolong National Nature Reserve , in Sichuan Province , south west China
It was the first taste of independence for the youngsters at the Wolong National Nature Reserve , in Sichuan Province , south west China .
Keepers at the reserve posed for a class photograph with their wide - eyed pupils and were helping the babies adjust to their new life under the gaze of visitors at the reserve .
Around 1,600 giant pandas live in the wild in China , mostly in Sichuan and the north western provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu .
Another 290 pandas are in breeding programmes in the country .

The New Jersey legislature is on the verge of approving a medical marijuana law that Gov. Jon Corzine has said he will sign .
But that prospect has not deterred the New Jersey Attorney General 's Office from throwing the book at John Wilson , a Somerville man who grew 17 marijuana plants to treat his multiple sclerosis .
Although there is no evidence that Wilson provided marijuana to anyone else , he is charged with running a " drug manufacturing facility " and faces up to 20 years in prison .
After turning down a plea deal that would have resulted in a sentence of a few years , he now finds that he is not allowed to tell the jury at his trial why he was growing the cannabis or even mention that he has M.S. , since those facts are irrelevant under current law .
Edward R. Hannaman , an attorney who serves on the board of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana New Jersey , notes that legislators who support the pending medical marijuana bill have condemned Wilson 's prosecution :
The state senators who sponsored our long - overdue and aptly named Compassionate Use Act passionately expressed their dismay over this prosecution , calling it " a severe , inappropriate , discompassionate and inhumane application of the letter of the law . "
Sen. Scutari went on to label it " cruel and unusual to treat New Jersey 's sick and dying as if they were drug cartel kingpins " and characterized it as a waste of taxpayer money .
Sen .
Lesniak observed , " Without compassion and a sense of moral right and wrong , laws are worth less than the paper they 're printed on . "
From the judge 's pretrial rulings in this case , I gather that New Jersey does not recognize a " medical necessity " defense against drug charges , which can be used even in states that do not explicitly allow medical use of cannabis .
An AIDS patient successfully used it in Texas last year , for example .
Perhaps a reader familiar with New Jersey law can explain why Wilson is not allowed to try a similar defense .
Wilson 's case is reminiscent of what happened to Richard Paey , a Florida M.S. patient who was convicted of drug trafficking for improperly obtaining prescription narcotics that he used to treat his own chronic pain .
In Paey 's case as in Wilson's , there was no evidence that he provided drugs to anyone else , and prosecutors offered what they considered to be a magnanimous plea deal .
Turned down by a defendant who did not believe he had done anything wrong , they treated him like a drug kingpin .
Paey received a 25 - year mandatory minimum prison sentence and was released after four only because he was pardoned by the governor .
Information about a December 14 rally and fundraiser for Wilson here .
Update : The Drug War Chronicle has more , including comments from Wilson , who says the best deal prosecutors offered him involved five years in prison .
According to the Chronicle , Gov. Corzine 's office " said it would wait until Wilson was convicted to consider a pardon . "

A San Francisco police officer was ordered out of John O'Connell High School for arresting an alleged gang member in connection with a double homicide without first consulting the principal .
Officer Joel Babbs , who is assigned to the department 's schools detail , thought he was doing his job Dec. 15 , getting a potentially dangerous suspect out of the Mission District school as fast as possible and without incident .
The 15 - year - old boy in question is one of three suspects arrested in connection with a double homicide at Papa Potrero 's Pizza on 24th Street in September .
Police suspect the killings were an act of revenge by gang members for an earlier slaying .
" For me this was a safety issue , " said Babbs , a 19 - year veteran of the force .
" Do you want your child sitting next to a double - homicide suspect ?
What if a rival gang decided to come after the guy and shot up the place ? "
However , O'Connell principal Rick Duber - who told us he believes in " intervention over suspension " - said he was upset that Babbs had not informed him of the planned arrest and had handcuffed the student in public .
" I am very concerned about ( Babbs ' ) actions , " Duber wrote in a memo to his school district superior the day of the arrest , adding that " his action today precludes any possibility of him ever returning to our campus . "
Police homicide Inspector Brian Delahunty says the youth " was n't the shooter " in the pizzeria killings , " but we do believe he held the victims down . "
He says he told that to Duber the morning of the arrest when he called the school to see if the 15 - year - old was there .
Duber told him the boy had been sent home a day earlier for being drunk in class and that he was n't in school .
Unbeknownst to Duber , however , the boy had shown up with his aunt that morning and had been readmitted .
After talking to Duber , Delahunty called Babbs at the school and told him to arrest the boy if he saw him .
Within the hour , Babbs saw the youth , got a school security guard to take him out of class and arrested him when he got to the lobby .
He cuffed the teen and took him to Mission Station for booking .
Babbs got a pat on the back from the cops , but when he returned to the school he was confronted by Duber , who accused him of going behind his back and booted him off campus .
Later that day , the principal fired off the memo to his boss , who suggested he calm down and work out his differences with Babbs .
And he has , sort of .
After the two and their respective bosses met , Babbs went back on the job - but on the advice of his captain , is staying off campus unless he is called upon .
On the carpet : An Oakland city staffer wound up in the emergency room with chest pains after being dressed down at a recent City Council meeting - one of several incidents that prompted Mayor Ron Dellums tofire off a letter to council President Jane Brunner demanding that such verbal abuse stop .
" It is intolerable that people should have to work in an environment where they feel intimidated and fearful of others in a position of power over them , " Dellums wrote in a Dec. 16 memo to Brunner and her fellow council members .
The heart scare was just part of it .
Another employee wrote to the mayor that a council member had so embarrassed her at a committee meeting that she " suffered sleepless nights and anxiety for several weeks , " before finally turning to therapy to calm her nerves before her council presentations .
City Attorney John Russo , who previously served on the City Council , agreed with the mayor - saying he's had outside legal counsel refuse to meet with council members in private for fear of verbal assaults .
" Behind closed doors , some council members are rude and haughty beyond acceptability , " Russo said .
The mayor has instructed department heads and staff to report all " inappropriate " council behavior to City Administrator Dan Lindheim .
If Lindheim " verifies that such abuse has occurred , that council member will not be permitted to interact directly with city employees , " Dellums said .
Brunner acknowledged that colleagues have gotten testy with staff from time to time , but said she was unaware of any formal complaints being lodged against the council .
" A lot of it is City Council members trying to get answers in public and not getting them , " she said .
" It 's difficult for staff to be on the stand , and some are more sensitive than others . "

Introduction :
Magic :
The GatheringTM is the first example of the modern collectible card game genre and can be played in real time by two or more players using printed cards or virtual cards over the internet .
Each game represents an exciting and often intricate battle between powerful wizards who attempt to defeat their opponents by using magical spells , items and creatures depicted on individual magic cards in the form of rules text and pieces of artwork .
Magic :
The GatheringTM is about literature — it revolves around fantasy story cycles and multiple worlds that are fleshed out in over fifty novels and numerous anthologies .
Magic is about art — its cards house over 10,000 pieces of original artwork that represent a generous cross-section of the fantasy art genre .
Magic is about math — its decks and sets are constructed around carefully calculated probabilities .
This , however , only begin to touch on what magic is all about ; perhaps most importantly magic is about playing a game with other people .
Since Magic players take on the role of wizards battling other wizards with the cards representing their spells the game may be about strategy , but it is as much about role - playing .
Few would argue that role - playing is a form of improvisational performance and Magic is likewise a form of performance .
In fact , in the realm of New Media , Magic in its current manifestations of Magic Online , Magic Workstation and OCTGN has beco me another facet of the global interactive games industry and thus a form of self - expression .
Playing Magic online has become a virtual performance in which players become immersed in a fantasy world where they can display their gaming prowess through victory or their creativity through uniquely crafted or thematic decks .
Magic , like many forms of New Media interaction , transcends traditional academic disciplines .
Magic : The GatheringTM Overview :
Magic :
The GatheringTM is a collectible card game which draws heavily from fantasy tropes found in anything from Tolkien and Lovecraft to Dungeons and Dragons .
Its player base overlaps with that of Dungeon and Dragons but on the other side of the spectrum , quite a few of its competitive players have gone over to professional poker .
The game 's attraction varies .
Mark Rosewater , a lead designer of Magic for many years and one of their website ’s journalists , describes three psychographic profiles .
Basically , people who play to win ( ruthlessly if possible ) , people who play for the satisfaction of big spells or big creatures , and people who play with card combinations in mind .
There is a forth type of player that may not play at all and this type of person is interested in the fantasy story lines and art more than the game .
However , players do not become attracted to the game for one of the above reasons but rather continue to play because of one of them .
Most people are initially attracted by a simple sense of fun ( balance of luck & skill ) and intrigued by the potential for creativity .
This potential for creativity is powered by the vastness of the game .
When Richard Garfield and a few of his fellow grad students designed 295 cards in August of 1993 the game was already very flexible ; the basic mechanics have not changed since that time although many additions and amendments have been made .
The game revolves around a deck of usually sixty cards and an initial hand size of seven cards .
Players begin a game with twenty life and lose when they have none remaining .
There are six basic card types and many subtypes .
These basic types can be divided into two supertypes - those cards that stay in play until something causes them to leave play ( permanents ) and those that leave play immediately after they are played ( spells ) .
The important idea , however , is that every card does something different .
Some cards represent a creature with a specific power and toughness and a special ability ; others may represent a spell that causes an opponents cards to become paralyzed .
The mechanism for playing all of these unique cards is that every card has a cost .
Most cards require that there are a certain amount of " land " cards in play in order to be played .
Generally speaking , stronger cards have higher costs .
The complexity of the game derives from the fact that every rule of the game can be altered if the text on the card being played says it does .
In other words , cards do n't just do simple things like take life or remove an opponent ’s cards from play but they can alter a player ’s maximum hand size or turn a spell into a permanent , etc .
This leads to hundreds of thousands of significant combinations of cards .
It was thought in the mid-nineties that designers would simple run out of ideas for new cards within a couple of years .
Time has shown that this is not the case and that seemingly as more cards are developed more design concepts arise .
This has lead to the current existence of just over ten thousand unique Magic cards – all of which constitute a pool of cards that players can choose from to create a deck .
Magic is more complicated than bridge or other card games .
Bridge is played with a fifty - two card deck , Magic is played with sixty .
With Magic , however , there are not just fifty - two cards to choose from .
As I mentioned , there are thousands .
It would be as if there were 800 separate suites instead of four and each suite interacted differently with every other suite .
Or perhaps a better analogy would be like having seven suites each with over a thousand cards where each cards has a specific purpose in the rules of the game ( I say seven for the five colors of magic cards plus lands and cards called artifacts ) .
It is probably humanly impossible to memorize every Magic card in existence and what each does , but it is possible to get a feel for where to look for certain abilities .
In fact , deck design can be so intimidating that many players choose to find a list for a preconstructed deck on the Internet and only make a few alternations of their own .
This is a perfectly viable way for beginners to make decks .
Today , online search engines specifically for Magic cards make finding the right card for a deck much easier than it was a few years ago .
The benefit of Magic is that of an exceptionally rewarding game .
Many of us these days spend a great deal of our free time playing games — mostly electronic games .
Many of these games are fun and habit forming but I think that Magic has more to offer than most .
Magic allows far more creative involvement than any electronic role - playing game I have ever played .
Course Overview :
In this course we are going to focus on building decks around certain fantasy themes and the imbedded power struggles therein .
We will explore a different broad theme each week and every student will be asked to make a deck within the restraints of that theme .
The student is encouraged to consider themselves as a wizard with certain characteristics when building a particular deck .
For example , if the student was building a deck as a necromancer it would make little sense for them to include healing spells in their deck — they would instead want to focus on how to make an effective deck with the living dead and cards that evoke disease .
We will still cover the mechanics and strategies of the game but within the context of thematic deck construction .
We will discuss balance and imbalance within the game and questions such as whether it is possible to make a beast - master summoner as powerful as a fireball wielding pyromancer or a mind control wizard .
Theme decks are required to be playable and students will be asked to describe how their deck functions .
Game play is encouraged but not required .
The goal of this approach is to explore Magic :
The GatheringTM as a strategy game while expanding on its role - playing and fantasy aspects .
We hope to also discuss why people play Magic , what their intentions are and where they derive enjoyment .
Imaginative creativity and analytical tactics will be delicately balanced .
This approach will hopefully be appealing to those that usually play competitively and especially accessible for those who have never played before .
Assessment
Attendance Students cannot miss more than two class meetings and receive a pass .
The class will meet once a week for 90 minutes .
Reading
The reading for this class comes mainly from websites .
The links are posted under the homework section of the syllabus .
Much of the reading is optional and only 30 minutes a week should be spent on reading .
Student will be notified when a reading is not optional .
Deck Creation and written submissions
You will be required to submit deck lists each week starting the second week of class .
A brief paragraph summarizing how your deck works and its thematic content .
Make sure to keep such summaries as simple as possible so that a beginner in the game could understand them .
This weekly assignment should take you approximately one hour .
Students are required to present a monologue , from the perspective of a wizard of their creation , for their final project .
Monologues will be presented in class on the final class meeting .
They must be 2 - 3 minutes in length , give a spirited account of the wizards friends , foes , strengths , and weaknesses , based on a deck theme , created by the student .
If you meet attendance requirements and submit 70 % of deck lists and paragraphs in a satisfactory manner then you will receive a pass in the class .

These days it seems the most popular person to be in the food system is the “ local farmer . ”
Farmers markets are popping up everywhere , and their size and popularity grow all the time .
Local food is trendy–even the First Family is in on it .
But as anyone who has ever raised grain or livestock can tell you , the farmer is not the only person in the chain of players from her farm to your fork .
In addition to producers , your food chain includes processors , distributors or transporters , and retailers .
In other words , to have a truly local food system , we also need local butchers , bakers and millers , local truck drivers , local grocers , and a community that supports them in all their efforts .
In the world of farm and food policy , we ’ve paid a lot of attention to production end of the food system .
It ’s an obvious place to start .
We have programs within the Farm Bill to develop new or “ beginning ” farmers , help them secure loans and down payments , and transition to organic agriculture .
But most products are n’t made to eat directly out of the field .
Even salad greens or apples , things we typically eat raw and straight from the field , must be washed and sorted before your local farmer will sell them .
As Tom Philpott pointed out in early November , the infrastructure for small - scale processing is woefully inadequate , having suffered decades of atrophy and consolidation — to the point where an otherwise profitable farmer can be driven out of business because she has no where to take her pigs for slaughter , her grain to be milled , or her tomatoes to be “ sauced . ”
Small - scale , certified community kitchens , like this one in Montana or this one in Tennessee , are beginning to fill some of this need .
There are a few mobile slaughter facilities gaining traction , but not enough to meet demand and too new to measure their long term viability .
Not many community colleges offer classes on how to humanely kill and butcher an animal anymore .
In the Midwest where I live , there used to be a local “ meat locker ” in every small town — now there are hardly any .
How will we supply the food system with local meat or local flour if there the nearest facility is too far away or does n’t exist at all ?
I believe the answer lies in the example we have set for ourselves with beginning farmers .
Society is beginning to see farming as a dignified and profitable profession again , and with that comes market demand for good farmers , respect for the profession , government programs to encourage new farmers , and training and educational opportunities .
We need similar opportunities for small - scale butchers , millers , bakers , and other types of processors .
Local food distribution has received even less attention than processing , and it is a complex piece of the food chain we ’ll have to get creative about if local food will be available in grocery stores .
In Nebraska , where I live , the distributor serving most of the rural grocery stores has a weekly buying minimum .
A grocer wo n’t even consider buying produce from a local farmer if it will put them below their minimum because the distributor levies a fine .
Challenges like buying minimums and aggregating products from multiple farms crop up when dealing with local foods .
Some models are attempting to overcome these challenges , but we ’ll need more ideas to fit the diversity of situations in which they arise .
Retailing healthy , affordable food has also gained attention lately in the term “ food desert , ” but it ’s an issue worth repeating .
We all need a grocery store nearby , unless you are one of the few that produce all your own food .
Without a grocery store , people will not want to live in our communities and neighborhoods , which makes them less vibrant and more vulnerable to failure .
Grocery stores are more than food retail , however — they are often the focal point of a town or neighborhood where people go to see friends , swap recipes , and catch up on local gossip .
Local ownership of a grocery is critical so that food dollars continue to circulate within the community .
Additionally , a locally owned grocery store is more likely to purchase from a local farmer than a store owned by an impersonal , profit - driven corporation .
In order to have more local grocers , we need to teach young people entrepreneurship in addition to community pride and loyalty .
Again , our treatment of beginning farmers gives us a good example of policy solutions to encourage more young people to enter the grocery business .
I used to think there were four distinct pieces to a local food system : production , processing , distribution , and retail .
Now I realize there is a fifth : community .
Without an involved community of customers who believe in what the local farmer , miller , distributor , and grocer is doing , none of them will last very long .
Community is important in another sense as well .
Most of the farmers who grow our food live in rural places , and they want to live in active , thriving communities too .
Therefore , if we care about local food systems , we should all be concerned with the survival of rural communities regardless of where we live .
Rural development is often the red- headed stepchild of the Farm Bill , receiving little attention and even less funding .
For local food to expand , we need to give respect and resources to rural communities and their residents .
If growing a local food system is our goal , it must begin with vibrant communities , then follow with genuine opportunities for careers everywhere in the food chain .
Expanding our policy solutions beyond producers will help the idea of local food move forward from a trend to a permanent fixture of our food system .

Northwest Airlines flight 253 , the target of an attempted terrorist bombing , sits on the runway in Detroit on December 25 , 2009 .
Intel agencies ' internal turf wars
American intelligence agencies have been blamed for failing in their mission to protect the country when they missed signals that could have nabbed the Christmas Day airplane bomber suspect .
Now the nation ’s spy chiefs are headed to Capitol Hill with another mission : Blame someone else .
“ You ’ve got an all - out war in the intelligence community , and the all - out war is not against Al Qaeda ; it ’s against each other , ” said one House Intelligence Committee member .

“ In times like this , the intelligence community starts using the tactics against each other that they should be using against our enemies , ” said New York Rep. Peter King , the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee .
The turf wars have been going on behind the scenes for weeks , but Wednesday three Senate committees will dig in with the first public hearings on the Northwest Airlines bombing plot , with several top officials testifying , including Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and FBI Director Robert Mueller .
Democrats can count on Republicans for sharp attacks , starting with the Judiciary Committee Wednesday morning .
“ In order to have dots to connect in the first place , we must fully equip our military and security agents with the tools they need .
Unfortunately , the Obama administration has been stripping these tools away , ” said Alabama Sen .
Jeff Sessions , the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee .
“ They have given terrorists Miranda rights instead of tough interrogations and have shipped foreign war criminals to American communities for civilian trial . ”
And when the House Homeland Security Committee starts its own investigation next week , President Barack Obama ’s counterterrorism adviser , John Brennan , will take some heat from Republicans .
Democrats will push back .
“ A one - size - fits - all approach is not necessarily the right way to react to such an incident , ” a Democratic Senate aide said .
At the hearings , Democrats will emphasize “ the need for a thoughtful — not just reflexive — approach to addressing these questions , ” the aide said .
“ The White House is trying to blame everyone .
Brennan ’s the guy that ’s supposed to be coordinating everything , but the White House itself is trying to finger other people , ” King said .
King and other lawmakers briefed on intelligence issues said there has been a three - way turf war among Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair , CIA Director Leon Panetta and National Counterterrorism Center Director Michael Leiter .
All three will be on Capitol Hill to testify Wednesday — and the White House is hoping they contain their infighting behind the scenes .
Brennan will brief lawmakers separately .
“ We will ask Adm .
Blair and Director Leiter why the intelligence community was unable to bring together pieces of intelligence held by various agencies to detect this plot and whether the DNI and NCTC have the authority to integrate the intelligence community into a single , integrated enterprise , ” Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman said in a statement .
Leiter ’s NCTC , an agency without the institutional clout of the CIA , is in the cross hairs of congressional investigators .
“ Until Dec. 25 , everybody would have said it was the big success of the Intelligence Reform Act — the big success is now kind of wilted .
They , I suspect , will be the big punching bag , ” said a terrorism expert who works regularly with lawmakers on policy issues .
The stakes in these hearings are high , and the Democrats have to walk a fine line between being tough investigators on the terror plot and not doing too much political damage to their president .
“ Any attack , and this administration is finished .
They ’re not going to get reelected .
Congress needs to start thinking about this , too .
If there is a big attack , it ’s not going to be restricted to the president , ” the terrorism expert said .
Getting the personalities in line before the spy chiefs talk in public has been a top priority for the White House .
“ There is a very heavy burden on the president to be very clear about who ’s in charge in the intelligence community .
The president ’s leadership here is crucial and has to be continuous .
If it is not , you run the risk of mission confusion and a decrease in effectiveness , ” said former Rep. Lee Hamilton , vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission .
King has been particularly critical of Brennan , complaining that the White House cut off all communication with Congress on Christmas night , that he has yet to receive any information and that the silence was at Brennan ’s request .
Privately , Democrats complained that King went on TV quickly after the attempted bombing , before lawmakers had been briefed .
Adam Comis , spokesman for House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson , emphasized that Brennan had been available to lawmakers , briefing House committees and members last week .
Leiter and Brennan wo n’t be the only ones on trial .
Napolitano — who appeared on TV the Sunday after Christmas and said “ the system worked ” — will get hammered by Republicans .
King said he wants to know what the Homeland Security Department ’s role is .
“ Napolitano was slow getting out of the gate and then was not a major player as things went along , so I want to know what she envisions the role of the [ department ] to be , ” King said .
One scapegoat unlikely to take much heat , despite some culpability : Congress itself , which passed the 2004 law that set up the new intelligence bureaucracy .
“ The vast majority of blame for Dec. 25 is with the new alphabet soup agencies , not the old ones .
And how does that look for Congress ?
They supposedly fixed all of this , solved it .
They ’re not going to say , ‘ Well , what we did was only a dog ’s breakfast or halfway done . ’
They ’re going to deflect blame off themselves , ” the terrorism expert said .
LAS VEGAS 
You ’ve heard of Amazon.com ’s Kindle .
And you probably know that Apple is likely to introduce a tablet computer this year .
Soon you may also be hearing about the Alex , the Que proReader and the IdeaPad U1 Hybrid .
Those products are part of a new wave of slender touch - screen tablets and electronic reading devices that dozens of companies , both well known and unknown , brought to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week .
Some of these gadgets allow people to read for long periods of time without eye strain and without killing the batteries .
Others focus on allowing their owners to surf the Web , watch video and play casual games without being tethered to a bulky laptop and its traditional keyboard .
“ There are a billion and a half Internet users on the planet today , and a lot of them are primarily using it for entertainment and social networking , ” said Glen Burchers , director of global consumer segment marketing at Freescale , a chip company hoping to power the new tablets .
“ The PC does a good job on a lot of things , but it ’s just not the ideal device for surfing the Internet or reading . ”
As the sun reawakens from an anomalously quiet period , keep track of solar flares , sunspots and coronal mass ejections with a new iPhone app that puts the real - time status of the sun in your hand .
" This is more than cool , " Dick Fisher , director of NASA 's Heliophysics Division , said in a press release .
" It 's transformative .
For the first time ever , we can monitor the sun as a living , breathing 3 - dimensional sphere . "
With the free 3D Sun app , you can set your phone to alert you when a new solar flare erupts , watch video of a solar prominence or a comet heading into the sun .
You can manipulate an image of the sun in three - dimensions with your finger .
The data is streamed to Earth by NASA 's twin STEREO spacecraft which monitor the sun from two different spots , one ahead of Earth in its orbit and one behind , giving stereoscopic images to give a sort of three - dimensional view , similar to the way our two eyes do .
The pair cover 87 percent of the sun 's surface , effectively giving us a view of the " dark side " of the sun .
This means anyone can see on their phone parts of the sun that even the most powerful telescopes on Earth can't see .
The STEREO spacecraft watch the extreme untraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum because the most exciting solar phenomena show up best at these wavelengths .
" That 's why the 3D sun looks false - color green , " said STEREO program scientist Lika Guhathakurta in a press release .
" These are not white - light images . "
The app was built by a team of programmers led by Tony Phillips , editor of .
The team plans to release 3D Sun 2.0 which will have higher - res images and data from more wavelengths .
This is the second free iPhone app NASA has released recently .
NASA 's first app brings you loads of space photos from the Hubble Space Telescope and other NASA missions , videos from NASA TV of science updates , mission activity , rocket launches and other events , mission status updates and live countdowns clocks .
And you can track the International Space Station as well .

Cybercrooks have adapted to the takedown of rogue ISPs by building more resilient botnets .
An annual security survey by MessageLabs found that the already high level of spam reached 87.7 per cent of email traffic during 2009 , with highs and lows of 90.4 percent in May and 73.3 percent in February respectively .
Junk volumes increased still further compared to the 81.2 per cent spam rate recorded by MessageLabs in 2008 .
Compromised ( zombie ) machines accounted for more than four in five ( 83.4 per cent ) of an estimated global volume of 107 billion junk mail messages sent out every day during 2009 .
The shutdown of botnet - hosting ISPs - such as McColo in late 2008 and Real Host in August 2009 - has forced hackers to re-engineer botnets so that the reins of command and control system can be picked up within hours , instead of the weeks of confusion that followed the McColo shutdown .
Paul Wood , MessageLabs
Intelligence senior analyst at Symantec , explained : " Hackers have re-engineered malware to make it less vulnerable to disruption .
Trojans used to be hard coded with an IP address but now they use domain name rotate using fast flux to calculate next domain or P2P techniques .
As a result command and control channels are now more resilient . "
MessageLabs , a web and email filtering service owned by Symantec since last year , reports that 10 heavyweight botnets ( including Cutwail , Rustock and Mega - D ) control a combined zombie hoard of at least five million compromised computers .
Cutwail was the worst of he bunch and blamed by MessageLabs for 29 percent of all spam or 8,500 billion junk mail messages between April and November 2009 .
The global credit crisis , world events and news stories provided the themes of many junk mail runs and malware attacks during 2009 .
Malware writers were quick to seize on interest generated by the swine flu epidemic and deaths of celebrities , including singer Michael Jackson and actor Patrick Swayze , for example .
Cutwail was also used to send out spam email contaminated with infected attachments carrying the Bredolab Trojan dropper , disguised as an innocuous ZIP file .
Machines infected with Bredolab were used to run botnet agents or spyware on compromised machines .
Spam runs punting Bredolab - infected messages rose steadily throughout 2009 to reach an October peak of 3.6 billion Bredolab contaminated emails .
However the average virus in email level dropped to one in 286.4 emails ( 0.35 percent ) this year , compared to one in 143.8 emails ( 0.70 percent ) last year .
MessageLabs explains the decline by suggesting that virus writers are churning out a greater number of malware variants , but using smaller virus - contaminated spam runs with each strain .
MessageLabs stopped more than 21 million different types of spam campaigns in 2009 , more than twice the number recorded in 2008 .
It also logged a 23 per cent increase in malware variants between 2008 and 2009 .
MessageLabs analysts blame the wider availability of malware creation toolkits for the increase .
The infamous Conficker worm haunted the threat landscape during 2009 .
An estimated six million machines are infected by the malware .
However this vast cybercrime resource has remained dormant throughout the year , possibly because the hackers who created it were far more successful than they originally intended and know anything they do with the uber - botnet now is likely to bring a great deal of unwelcome attention .
During 2009 the average number of new malicious websites blocked each day by MessageLabs rose to 2,465 , compared to 2,290 for 2008 , an increase of 7.6 per cent .
However , four in five of the web threats blocked by MessageLabs came from malicious code planted on legitimate domains , rather than new domains set up purely to sling malware .
The volume of phishing attacks blocked by MessageLabs was one in 325.2 ( 0.31 percent ) emails for 2009 so far , compared to one in 244.9 ( 0.41 ) in 2008 .
More details on the malware and spam landscape can be found in MessageLabs annual report here . ®
Einstein once said , “ The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources . ”
The same could be said of intelligence .
What they do n’t tell you is that the “ smart ” people of the world are , in most cases , just better at researching and learning things than everyone else .
But researching is a learned skill , not something you ’re born with .
And while some people might be predisposed to learn things more easily than others , it ’s generally not enough to make a measurable difference .
By learning how to research , you can quickly and fairly easily become knowledgeable about just about anything .
And with the Internet , almost anything you could ever want to know is at your fingertips .
You just have to learn how to access it .
It ’s all there , online , for free .
Here are the techniques I ’ve used to find pretty much anything online .
Start with Wikipedia
Whenever you try to learn something new on the Internet , start with Wikipedia .
A wealth of information is there , covering practically every subject in an easy - to - use , easy - to - understand format .
The main reason to start with Wikipedia is that it gives a good overview of most topics .
Sure , any given page is bound to have some inaccuracies ( as is the case on most user - generated websites ) , but most of the content is generally reliable .
And when the accuracy of certain information is questionable , it ’s usually tagged as such .
The key to using Wikipedia as a source , though , is in how you make use of the information .
You have to pay attention to a number of things on a Wikipedia page aside from the main content .
First of all , read the introduction to the page .
This is where you ’ll usually find a quick description of the topic , along with alternate and related terms .
Skim the content to find the parts of the article that you need to know about most .
Some articles are short and do n’t have a list of contents .
Others are several thousand words long .
Reading the entire thing is usually unnecessary .
Just skip to the sections that are relevant to you .
Next , check the references and related resources .
The references is a great place to get in - depth information on your topic .
These links often include scholarly journals and articles and other respected sources .
The related sources section includes external links to in - depth information .
These websites often include professional associations and organizations devoted to the topic as well as general websites with good topical information .
Move on to Google
Once you ’ve built a good foundation through Wikipedia , move on to a Google search ( or whatever search engine you prefer ) .
Having read a bit on Wikipedia , you should know the main terms and keywords associated with the subject you ’re researching .
Start your general search with these terms .
When researching something , I always open a new window in Firefox .
For each link I visit in a Google search , I open a new tab so that I can keep my original search results page open .
And if I click on additional links on pages that I have opened , I do n’t have to go back through 10 or more pages to return to my original search .
Go Multimedia
Text is n’t the only educational content on the web .
Video , podcasts and slideshows are out there to explain pretty much anything you can imagine .
The advantage of so much multimedia content being available is that it caters to people with different learning styles .
Some people learn well by reading .
Others learn better by hearing an explanation or seeing a demonstration .
And still others learn by doing ( which is where step - by - step tutorials — either video , audio or text — come in handy ) .
If you learn best by watching demonstrations , then head on over to YouTube , Odeo , Vimeo or any of the many other video websites and start typing the keywords that you found on Wikipedia .
Make sure , though , whenever you deal with user - generated content to verify the information against reputable sources .
One often - overlooked resource for videos is the archive from the TED ( Technology , Entertainment , Design ) conferences .
TED videos are available for free on the official website and cover ( as you might expect ) technology , entertainment and design .
While many of the videos focus on broad concepts rather than the nitty - gritty , they ’re still a great resource to expand your horizon .
And the lectures are given by leaders in their fields , so the information is generally reliable .
Check Out Free Educational Resources
A ton of colleges are now putting their course materials online , accessible for free .
MIT offers its entire catalog as open courseware , with lecture notes , resources and syllabi .
Other two - and four - year colleges are following suit .
You ’ll also find purely web - based open education initiatives that cover subjects you might not find at a traditional college .
These free courses offer a ton of organized information on any given subject .
Some colleges offer their lectures in audio and video format .
Princeton , for example , offers some of its lectures through iTunes , as does the University of Virginia , Duke , Emory , Yale and Stanford .
In fact , iTunes has an entire section devoted to educational podcasts called iTunes U. Non-educational organizations are also represented , including the Library of Congress and Wall Street Journal .
The educational podcast market is n’t monopolized by iTunes , though .
Odeo has an education category with 466 channels and more than 67,000 episodes .
Participating colleges and universities include Oxford University , the University of Melbourne and MIT .
Look for Tutorials
Depending on your topic , you may be able to find tutorials .
For pretty much any practical skill ( and a whole lot of unpractical ones ) , you can find an online tutorial that teaches you how to do it .
You can find tutorials through search engines ( just add “ tutorial ” or “ instructions ” to the end of your keyword search ) .
You can also find them on these websites :

We here at PopSci love our Iron Man suits , and so we 're happy to see longer - lasting versions in the works .
After all , it'd be a shame for our robotic warfighters to run down when the Energizer Bunny keeps going on its dinky batteries .
On Tuesday afternoon , I caught up with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs in his office , and the conversation turned to President Obama ’s decision last year to appear on both The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Late Show with David Letterman .
Gibbs was insistent :
I actually , truth be told , was shocked that basically [ David ] Axelrod and I were the first two people in the history of the republic to decide to put the President of the United States on Leno and Letterman .
It was two of the easiest decisions that we had to make .
Tons of people are watching it , and different types of people .
So I asked the natural follow up , “ Do you want to do the Daily Show ? ” Gibbs did not hesitate .
“ I think the President would love to , just maybe not Colbert . ”
He went on to explain : “ I have yet to see a politician best Stephen Colbert in an interview on his show , ” Gibbs said , laughing .
“ I mean , he ’s really , really good . ”
So there you have it .
My role as matchmaker is now complete .
Jon Stewart , you should make a phone call .
Gibbs is on the record .
The President of the United States wants to do your show .
As for Stephen Colbert , tough luck .
But I wonder , Stephen , are you just going to sit there and take that sort of treatment from the commander in chief ?
If he ca n’t face you , how prepared is he to handle , among other things , the international hug - a - horrible cute bear threat ?
UPDATE : Greg Sargent tracks down a Comedy Central spokesman who says Obama is welcome to either show “ anytime he wants . ”
Still no comment from Colbert regarding Obama bear readiness .
It 's cold in Kirkcaldy , freezing in Frankfurt and brass monkeys in Bryn Mawr ... a winter spell with weather that 's unusually - well - wintry .
But not everywhere ; in fact , other places in the Northern Hemisphere are seeing weather that 's unseasonably warm .
In Goose Bay in Newfoundland , it 's barely getting below 0C - bikini weather , relatively speaking , given that the average minimum for January is - 23C .
The cause of what one weather service refers to as these " upside down " conditions is an extreme of the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) .
Essentially , air pressure is measured at various places across the Arctic and at the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere - about 45 degrees north , roughly the latitude of Milan , Montreal or Vladivostok .
The difference between the average readings for the two latitudes gives the state of the Arctic Oscillation index .
A " positive " state is defined as relatively high pressure in mid-latitudes and relatively low pressure over the polar region .
" Negative " conditions are the reverse .
And what we have at the moment is an unusually extreme negative state .
The graph below comes from the US government 's Climate Prediction Center and shows the variability of the index from 1950 to 2009 .
The text on the graph is a little unclear as I 've had to shrink it a bit , but you can see at the bottom right the current negative conditions developing during December - and here 's the original .
Over at the New York Times , they 've compiled a different graph that shows how extreme these few weeks are turning out to be - unmatched since the early 1960s , a period that saw several winters in the UK featuring extended spells of cold , snowy weather .
What the negative AO conditions mean is that cold air spills out of the Arctic down to mid-latitudes , which this time round includes much of Europe , tracts of the US and China .
For the UK , this implies a higher chance of cold northerly or easterly winds .
But if you live in places that are usually cold at this time of year - such as Goose Bay - you 'll see a concomitant rise in temperatures compared with what happens during " positive " AO conditions , when the cold air is confined to more northerly latitudes .
A little more than a decade ago , I visited Yakutsk in Siberia which lies close to one of the candidates for the title of " coldest place on the planet " - the village of Oymyakon , which has seen the mercury plummet as low as - 71C .
I do n't know how balmy it is in Oymyakon right now but in Yakutsk itself , the daily minimum is a mere - 35C - that 's 10C warmer than the January average .
Despite the name " Arctic Oscillation " , there 's little discernible pattern to how the pressure difference varies , or what causes it - perhaps " Arctic Random Fluctuation " would be a better name .
Some researchers have linked an apparent increase in the average state of the index from the 1960s to the 1990s to man-made global warming , but you would have to say the jury is definitely still out .
( The AO is linked to another naturally varying phenomenon , by the way - the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) , the variability in the pressure difference between Iceland and the Azores - in fact , some hold that the NAO is just a sub- set of the AO . )
So the question of how long the unusually wintry UK conditions will last is really a question of how long the Arctic Oscillation will remain in its extreme negative state - and a week to 10 days seems to be the favoured timescale .
Corbis
BOTH Boeing and Airbus have trumpeted the efficiency of their newest aircraft , the 787 and A350 respectively .
Their clever designs and lightweight composites certainly make a difference .
But a group of researchers at Stanford University , led by Ilan Kroo , has suggested that airlines could take a more naturalistic approach to cutting jet - fuel use , and it would not require them to buy new aircraft .
The answer , says Dr Kroo , lies with birds .
Since 1914 , and a seminal paper by a German researcher called Carl Wieselsberger , scientists have known that birds flying in formation — a V - shape , echelon or otherwise — expend less energy .
The air flowing over a bird 's wings curls upwards behind the wingtips , a phenomenon known as upwash .
Other birds flying in the upwash experience reduced drag , and spend less energy propelling themselves .
Peter Lissaman , an aeronautics expert who was formerly at Caltech and the University of Southern California , has suggested that a formation of 25 birds might enjoy a range increase of 71 % .
When applied to aircraft , the principles are not substantially different .
Dr Kroo and his team modelled what would happen if three passenger jets departing from Los Angeles , San Francisco and Las Vegas were to rendezvous over Utah , assume an inverted V - formation , occasionally swap places so all could have a turn in the most favourable positions , and proceed to London .
They found that the aircraft consumed as much as 15 % less fuel ( with a concomitant reduction in carbon - dioxide output ) .
Nitrogen - oxide emissions during the cruising portions of the flight fell by around a quarter .
There are , of course , kinks to be worked out .
One consideration is safety , or at least the perception of it .
Would passengers feel comfortable travelling in convoy ?
Dr Kroo points out that the aircraft could be separated by several nautical miles , and would not be in the unnervingly cosy groupings favoured by display teams like the Red Arrows .
A passenger peering out of the window might not even see the other planes .
Whether the separation distances involved would satisfy air - traffic - control regulations is another matter , although a working group at the International Civil Aviation Organisation has included the possibility of formation flying in a blueprint for new operational guidelines .
It remains to be seen how weather conditions affect the air flows that make formation flight more efficient .
In zones of increased turbulence , the planes ' wakes will decay more quickly and the effect will diminish .
Dr Kroo says this is one of the areas his team will investigate further .
It might also be hard for airlines to co-ordinate the departure times and destinations of passenger aircraft in a way that would allow them to gain from formation flight .
Cargo aircraft , in contrast , might be easier to reschedule , as might routine military flights .
As it happens , America 's armed forces are on the case already .
Earlier this year the country 's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency announced plans to pay Boeing to investigate formation flight , though the programme has yet to begin .
There are reports that some military aircraft flew in formation when they were low on fuel during the second world war , but Dr Lissaman says they are apocryphal .
“ My father was an RAF pilot and my cousin the skipper of a Lancaster lost over Berlin , ” he adds .
So he should know .

In Melbourne Indian students are 2 1 / 2 times more likely than non-Indians to be beaten up or knifed .
Indian student societies claim they are less likely to report assaults than non-Indians .
If as appears likely that is the case the figure blows out even further .
Why are Indians so much more likely to be attacked ?
Let ’s go back a bit .
Education is one of our biggest export industries .
By bringing overseas students here we earn about $ 15 billion a year from them .
Indian students last year contributed $ 2.5 billion of that $ 15 billion .
Education providers and governments see overseas students as a cash cow and treat them like shite .
Some of the courses were and are shonks – nothing but get rich schemes for the ‘ providers ’ .
Gautam Gupta from the Federation of Indian Students of Australia says that there can be a hundred people cheating them .
From private and public education providers to real estate and migration agents , Indian students are their Eldorado in a time of restricted Government funding for higher education .
Some conservatives blame the victims .
They should n’t be working late at night ; they should n’t be carrying money or i-pods ; they should n’t be travelling on public transport .
Of course to survive as an overseas student in Australia working late and using inadequate public transport are often a necessity .
Now the right are arguing for an increase in police powers to ‘ protect ’ overseas students .
Some have begun to sing the praises of zero tolerance .
In Victoria for example the police now have unfettered search powers .
They can search anyone at anytime without having a reason .
They used these powers for the first time the other day at a Western Suburbs station in Melbourne near where an Indian student was murdered .
Maybe I am a little bit simple but does n’t that mean the very people likely to be the victims of violence , the Indians and other overseas students , will be the people subjected to these arbitrary and intrusive searches ?
This ‘ victims as perpetrators ’ approach will only anger many who are stopped and searched .
And what message does it send to the racists as they see the cops harassing non-whites ?
No doubt the next police raid will be in the super rich suburb of Toorak .
But of course corporate crooks do n’t carry spray cans .
They own the factories that produce them .
And that ’s the problem with more police powers .
They just reinforce and strengthen the society that produces and reproduces systemic racism , in this case against overseas students in all its forms – the rip offs , the poverty , the bashings .
Those who hanker for zero tolerance and shamelessly use Indian students as the current excuse for more police powers fail to mention a couple of points .
The United States , the home of zero tolerance , has 5 percent of the world ’s population and 23 percent of its prisoners .
The imprisonment rate among African - Americans is so bad that young black Americans are more likely to have been in jail than to go to University .
Increased police powers are about social control – to imprison and cower those who are the victims of capitalism and its inability to provide a decent life for all .
In some social democratic countries in Europe the crime and imprisonment rate is extremely low .
This is because they have low unemployment rates , high wages and spend large amounts on health and education and social safety nets .
Any examination of the ways to address racist violence in Australia has to begin with that sort of societal response – real measures to cut unemployment and increase wages and to spend more on inadequately funded health and education systems .
Hundreds of thousands of green jobs for renewable energy would be a good first step .
Government could remove the cash cow syndrome attached to overseas students by making education free for all .
All of this needs more money .
Tax the rich .
It ’s their system , make them pay for it .

The Supreme Court on Thursday opened wide the gates to allow more corporate and union money to finance political campaigns – and potentially influence politicians and lawmaking .
That ’s unfortunate , and means that the role of watchdogs tracking the money trail will be more important than ever .
It ’s not as if corporations and unions have so far had their wallets glued shut .
They can fund issue ads that are important to their interests .
And they ’re allowed to form political action committees that directly support candidates , as long as the donations are collected voluntarily from employees and union members .
But even members of Congress , whose energy is increasingly diverted to fundraising , have long recognized the potentially corrupting effect that big money can have on them .
More than 100 years ago they banned corporations from donating directly to federal candidates .
Thankfully , the justices upheld that ban Thursday , as well as disclosure rules about contributors .
But in a divisive 5 - to - 4 ruling , they overturned other important restrictions .
In time for this year ’s midterm elections , corporations and unions can now spend directly from their treasuries on ads to support or defeat candidates – as long as those ads are produced independently and not coordinated with a campaign .
They may also run ads right up until election day , instead of pulling them 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election .
Writing for the majority , Justice Anthony Kennedy grounded the ruling in First Amendment rights .
Corporations and unions – like individuals – have a right to free speech , the majority reasoned .
“ The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach , ” he wrote .
But Justice John Paul Stevens said in his dissent , “ The court ’s ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions around the nation . ”
Indeed , when voters say they want “ change ” in Washington , the influence of money on politics is the kind of thing they ’re talking about .
The high court has the final word , but not the only word .
Groups that track campaign fundraising will need to raise their voices when they find wrongdoing or worrisome signs – even as they have more money to watch .
Those groups include nonprofits ; the news media ; and the official watchdog , the Federal Election Commission .
Yet the traditional media are downsizing and the FEC , which has an equal number of Republican and Democratic commissioners , has a poor track record .
The FEC could be strengthened if its members were recommended to the president not by the Senate , which has a vested interest in a watchdog with no bark , but by an independent commission .
Transparency is now more important than ever , and so is beefing up the competition to corporate and union donations – small donors and public campaign financing .
The Internet has given small donors a much bigger voice , but that can be amplified even further by Congress .
Now is the time for lawmakers to pay serious attention to proposed legislation that would allow House and Senate candidates to choose to run for office without relying on large contributions , big money bundlers , or donations from lobbyists .
If candidates commit to raising a certain amount of small donations , they can qualify for competitive public funds for their campaigns .
Thus , candidates would divert far less energy to fundraising – which can take as much as 40 to 50 percent of the time of members of the House , who face election every two years .
And , candidates would be less beholden to monied special interests .
The Supreme Court has significantly altered the landscape of campaign finance .
The next election will reveal how the new arrangement works in practice .
Watchdogs must keep their eyes open .
The scene was not unlike 12 Angry Men ( or , in this case , 3 Shlubby Men , 1 Exasperated Woman , And A Dude On Speaker Phone From Arkansas ) : Armed with lists of their favorite movies of the decade , the five core A.V.
Club film writers spent days sequestered in a stuffy , un - air - conditioned room — okay , it was actually just a few hours , and we were comfortable — in an effort to forge consensus on the Top 50 films of the ’00s .
The result : A ranked list that is in no way arbitrary and will serve as the canonical standard for decades to come .
You ’re welcome .

50 . Oldboy ( 2003 )
Oldboy comes in the middle of Park Chan - wook ’s “ vengeance trilogy ” — three unrelated films about the obsessive , destructive pursuit of revenge — but it ’s the best of the lot .
Park ’s insane fable follows a man ( Choi Min-sik ) imprisoned in a single hideous room for 15 years by an unknown enemy , and then abruptly set free on a bloody mission to track down what just happened to him and why .
The results are downright operatic in their violence and outsized drama , but a dark thread of humor runs throughout , in scenes like the bravura , long - take hammer battle ( see our best scenes of the decade list ) and the moment where Min - sik sets out to determine whether a decade of martial - arts theory alone in an apartment can translate into real - world adeptness against a bunch of bullying punks .
Spoiler : It can .
If Min -sik was n’t capable of staggering acts of brutality , this film would be a lot shorter , and a lot less outrageous .

49 . Gerry ( 2002 )
After his dabbling in Hollywood ( or at least Indiewood ) projects hit bottom with Finding Forrester , director Gus Van Sant went through a kind of artistic detox that resulted in a series of dream - like minimalist films that cut against the grain and revitalized his career .
The first of a “ death trilogy ” that concluded with Elephant and Last Days , Van Sant ’s Gerry proceeds from a simple , seven - word premise : “ Two guys get lost in the desert . ”
Though Van Sant is making a statement about modern man ’s disconnection from nature , Gerry works mainly as a hypnotic and beautifully abstracted exercise in style , with carefully composed landscapes and soundscapes that draw receptive viewers into a unique headspace .
Each sequence has its own topographical marvels , but the film is also surprisingly hilarious at times , suggesting a cross between Samuel Beckett and Abbott & Costello .

48 . Crimson Gold ( 2003 )
Iranian cinema did n’t have as elevated a presence by the end of the ‘00s as it did in the ‘ 90s and early ‘ 00s , but that ’s through no fault of Jafar Panahi , who made three of the decade ’s best films .
Crimson Gold is arguably Panahi ’s fullest work , finding a world of meaning in Abbas Kiarostami ’s screenplay about a bulky pizza deliveryman ( played by Hossain Emadeddin ) trying to earn enough money to buy his girlfriend a wedding ring .
The key scene of the movie is an early one , where Hussein tries to make a delivery to a party but is stopped by the authorities , who are arresting anyone going in or coming out .
Emadeddin sits against a wall and grumbles to a teenage soldier that he ’s taking the punishment without getting any of the action .
Crimson Gold follows a narrative loop , starting at the end of the story and jumping back to show the events leading up to it , and Panahi underlines the circularity by cutting on motion and sound , bridging scenes in ways that make that make the movie feel like one continuous action .
But it ’s actually episodic , lurching forward through moments where Emadeddin is subtly ( and not - so - subtly ) humiliated .
Hussein makes a shushing noise when he walks because of his layers of slick jackets and coats , but he does n't walk or move much at all — mostly he sits stock still on his motorcycle or stands motionless at his customers ’ doors , quietly hoping someone will ask him to come in and rest .

47 . Moulin Rouge ! ( 2001 )
Baz Luhrmann ’s candy - colored musical is all about ridiculously joyous fusions : squeezing popular songs into energetic mash - ups and illustrating the whole thing with vivid colors and a CGI wonderland , he creates a world that rarely looks remotely real , and is never really meant to .
He recreates the traditional romantic melodrama and the traditional musical by recognizing and heightening the artifice in both , going for big , swooning moments and equally big , flashy setpieces .
His leads , Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor , play the conceit to the hilt as a poor writer and a famed courtesan who fall in love — the kind of love that seems like it should be written in flashing red capital letters — and villain Richard Roxburgh and his ambitious foil Jim Broadbent similarly give it their all in roles calculated more for comic effect than drama .
And yet the love story , so unashamedly broad in its execution , actually winds up being fairly touching , perhaps because it ’s so shameless .
Still , those who are n’t touched still get to enjoy the sheer gleeful spectacle of the thing , particularly as the crazed Roxburgh chases the squealing Broadbent around the room in a campy , gloriously ridiculous take on Madonna ’s “ Like A Virgin . ”

46 . Adaptation ( 2002 )
The major events of Susan Orlean ’s digressive , intimate nonfiction book The Orchid Thief make their way into its offbeat adaptation Adaptation : Meryl Streep plays Orlean , chasing the story of a crackpot Florida flower collector played by Chris Cooper , and the movie even includes some of the author ’s ruminations about passion and biology .
But director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman add an extra layer to the piece , by casting Nicolas Cage as Kaufman himself : a pudgy , balding neurotic who can only articulate that he wants to make a movie “ about flowers , ” though inwardly he ’s bursting with ideas about natural selection , mutation , chemical attraction and how it all applies to lumpen , insecure Los Angeles screenwriters .
The term “ adaptation ” also applies to the act of a weak entity developing into a stronger one , which Adaptation explores via the introduction of Kaufman ’s twin brother Donald , an affable guy who woos pretty women and effortlessly knocks out screenplays about sympathetic serial killers .
The first two - thirds of Adaptation plays much better than the somewhat spirit - deflating final third ( which becomes a dopey Hollywood version of the story ) , but philosophically the movie ’s all of a piece .
Jonze and Kaufman play around with the paralyzing multiplicity of their choices in life and art , and discover — ironically — that the rigidity of conventional storytelling can be liberating .

45 . Audition ( 2001 )
Given Takeshi
Miike ’s notoriety as the prolific source of extreme J- horror , newcomers to his work could be forgiven for spending the first hour of Audition thinking they ’d walked into the wrong theater .
Nothing shocking here , just a subtle , gently comic , even Ozu - like story of a widower who uses his position as a TV producer to “ audition ” actresses to be his girlfriend .
Then he finds a prim , mysterious young woman to play the part , and the movie shifts gears dramatically .
Beyond the mayhem and horrors that follow lies a female revenge tale that ’s simultaneously psychotic and righteous , as she executes a “ hell hath no fury ” scenario worthy of Medea .
Ideally , Audition should be watched with no knowledge of Miike or the twists to come , but even for the jaded horror junkie , it ’s as bracing and original as the genre gets .

44 . 4 Months , 3 Weeks And 2 Days ( 2007 )
The sudden emergence of Romania on the international scene was one of the great revelations of the ‘00s , and no film better typified the urgency and political bite of the movement than Cristian Mungiu ’s agonizing drama about two women seeking an illegal abortion during the Ceausescu regime .
Anamaria Marinca is especially fine as a friend who escorts her pregnant roommate through a harrowing series of obstacles , from a suspicious hotel clerk to a creepy black - market abortionist who extracts payment beyond money .
And this is before the procedure itself , which has its own set of dangers .
4
Months plays out like a thriller in real time , and tours unforgettably through an era where fear , paranoia , and repression prevailed over the citizenry .

43 . Brokeback Mountain ( 2005 )
It can be prohibitively difficult to separate the considerable aesthetic merits of Brokeback Mountain from the culture - wide wave of controversy , snickering jokes , and embarrassed tittering it unleashed upon its 2005 release .
Honestly , it was as if Americans had never seen a serious film about gay cowboys before .
Four years on , it ’s much easier to extract Ang Lee ’s tragic romance from the hype .
In a powerfully internal lead performance , Heath Ledger plays a tormented ranch hand who stumbles into a passionate affair with rodeo cowboy Jake Gyllenhaal while tending sheep one summer .
Over the next two decades , their forbidden bond looms over their doomed attempts to conform to society ’s narrow conception of masculinity .
Brokeback Mountain attains a devastating cumulative power as time , circumstances , and Ledger ’s profound ambivalence and self - loathing conspire to keep these two lovers apart .
Though the seemingly incongruous juxtaposition of cowboy iconography and homosexuality made Brokeback Mountain a pop-culture phenomenon , it endures as a powerful , universal story of love won and lost .

42 . L’Enfant ( 2005 )
Luc and Jean - Pierre Dardenne ’s social - realist thrillers are so stylistically distinctive — with their handheld close - ups , long follow - shots , and nerve - jangling plots — that “ Dardennes - like ” became an acceptable term of art among cineastes in the ’00s .
L’Enfant may be their most Dardennes - like movie : a harrowing slice - of - life that tracks the moment - to - moment existence of petty crook Jérémie Renier , his girlfriend Déborah François , and their newborn baby .
Flush with the spoils of a recent robbery , Renier treats his makeshift family to a spree , but when the money runs out , Renier brokers a business deal that is , at minimum , unconscionable .
By the end of the movie , he ’s alone , zipping through Belgian streets on a scooter , trying to elude the police and the people he ’s ripped off .
The title of L’Enfant could refer to Renier ’s baby , Renier himself , or even the gang of schoolboy robbers he recruits .
But beyond the film ’s metaphorical leanings , what lingers are the details grounded in everyday life , like the emphasis on what everything costs , and exactly how much money Renier has ( or does n't have ) to pay for it all .

41 . The Dark Knight ( 2008 )
Christopher Nolan redefined how deep a comic - book movie could cut with this sequel to his own Batman Begins in which good and evil battle for the soul of a city .
Except that good takes the form of a vigilante with often - questionable methods ( Christian Bale ’s Batman ) , and evil , in the form of the late Heath Ledger ’s stuff - of - nightmares Joker , has a nagging way of not being wrong beneath his madness .
Nolan ’s action scenes match the stunningly grand scale of the themes he raises by depicting a political landscape that ’s become corrupt and self - serving .
Advertisement
40 . City Of God ( 2002 )
Fans of The Wire ( you might have heard of that TV series via the writers at this site once or twice … ) would do well to seek out the Brazilian / French co-production City Of God , if they have n’t already — it does n’t entirely have the same top - to - bottom exploration of the drug trade , but in its focus on kids going in different directions in a Rio de Janeiro slum , it takes a similarly detail - oriented , uncompromisingly deep - focused angle , and it ’s even rawer and more visceral .
As two slum kids try to find their way in the world via their natural talents — one as a photographer , one as an uncompromisingly murderous drug dealer — directors Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund use their personal story to explore larger issues of the causes and effects of violence and the drug trade , from incidental collateral damage to the lives that go wrong early in the shadow of a society of corruption and ferocity .

39 . The Prestige ( 2006 )
Christopher and Jonathan Nolan ’s adaptation of Christopher Priest ’s novel The Prestige is a movie about magic that features a piece of misdirection so sly that many viewers miss it .
Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play rival magicians in Victorian London .
Bale ’s the solemn perfectionist , Jackman the ambitious , curious type always looking for shortcuts .
One man ’s secret becomes so obvious so early that some may feel disappointed ( or smug ) about predicting the twist , but while the Nolans hold the promise of superficial revelations in front of viewers ’ eyes , they ’re hiding something deeper and darker .
Like Memento and The Dark Knight ( and Insomnia and Following , for that matter ) , The Prestige is partly about the fragmentation of self , whether it be a division so severe that a magician ’s assistant ca n’t be sure which knot he ’s tied from performance to performance , or a division so subtle that a man ca n’t tell who he really is .
( Words to live by : “ They ’re all your hats . ” )
But The Prestige is also about the role technology plays in our alienation , as science makes possible feats that were charming as magic tricks , but horrific as reality .
And so here we are , whether we like it or not : the transported man .

38 . Spring , Summer , Fall , Winter … And Spring ( 2003 )
The festival circuit in the early ‘00s was awash in an unofficial “ cinema of cruelty ” movement , and one of its most active participants was Korean filmmaker Kim Ki-duk , whose films The Isle and Bad Guy punished audiences with horrific images they could never un - see .
Kim left shock behind with Spring , Summer , Fall , Winter … And Spring , a gentle Buddhist parable set at a temple floating in the middle of a mountain lake .
The story takes place over 30 years , as a boy grows to manhood under the guidance of a wise old monk .
The film 's lessons are plain , and deal with the close relationship between what can be shed in this life and what binds people to the world in spite of their best efforts to purify .
In the final section of the film , Kim himself plays the student , now an adult , still grappling with how to spend a life in service to other people without forming lasting emotional attachments .
This is a different conception of cruelty from Kim : a movie that contends , persuasively , that the very act of living is impossible .

37 . A History Of Violence ( 2005 )
David Cronenberg used to make films in which repressed instincts manifested themselves in physical form .
They were scary , but just as scary in its own way is this look at the persistence of bloodlust in a gentle man with no discernible past ( a revelatory Viggo Mortensen ) and the heartland whose wholesome , neighborly values he appears to embody .
Advertisement
36 . Pan ’s Labyrinth ( 2006 )
Guillermo del
Toro tends to get a little distracted by his fantasy visuals — in the Hellboy movies , for instance , he seems to be concentrating more on making the creatures look amazing than on telling a story that ’ll appeal to people not entirely caught up in his fairy - tale - with - teeth world .
Which is why Pan ’s Labyrinth is such a wonder :
It finds him again working at the top of his considerable game with the visuals , but also telling a story with some depth .
The ultimate moral about the escapist qualities of fantasy is more chilling than comforting , but again , del Toro ’s fairy stories have teeth , so it ’s no surprise that this allegorical tale of a child in 1944 fascist Spain goes in dark , ugly directions , and leaves the application of light up to individual viewers .
It ’s uncommonly ambitious and beautiful , but tragic as well .
And was there anything scarier in cinema this decade than the hideous Pale Man sitting at that food - laden table , just silently waiting for his victim to forget the rules of the game ?

35 . Waking Life ( 2001 )
With Waking Life , writer - director Richard Linklater returned to the freeform philosophical meanderings , laconic rhythms , and college - town sociology of his cult debut Slacker , only this time the proceedings are a whole lot more animated .
Literally .
Linklater filmed the film ’s spiritual seekers and amateur philosophers in digital video , then had Bob Sabiston and his team of animators trace and color the images through low - fi rotoscoping .
Like Slacker , Waking Life is informed equally by its creator ’s gentle humanism and insatiable curiosity about the world around him .
It ’s a trippy , mind - expanding journey through the world of ideas , populated by a motley assortment of free - thinkers , eccentrics , actors ( including Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy , reprising their iconic roles from Before Sunrise ) , and crackpots .
Linklater and Sabiston succeed in creating a hypnotic cinematic dream state that transformed a defiantly non-cinematic parade of monologues and abstract theorizing into a deliriously visual feast for the senses .

34 . American Psycho ( 2000 )
For a while , it appeared that Bret Easton Ellis ’ controversial bestseller might never make it onto the big screen .
Everyone from David Cronenberg to Oliver Stone to Stuart Gordon was bandied about as a potential director before the job fell to I Shot Andy Warhol director Mary Harron .
Working from a script she co-wrote with Genevieve Turner , Harron gives the film a Kubrickian sense of sleek , deadpan detachment , a glossy sheen perfectly in keeping with the vacuous , image - obsessed spiritual emptiness of its characters .
In a star - making performance , Christian Bale transforms Patrick Bateman , Ellis ’ yuppie mass murderer , into an unspeakably cruel , hilariously funny caricature of Tom Cruise ’s creepy , smiling , gung - ho All - Americanism .
He ’s a phantom impersonating a human being , a preppie monster who ’s the very image of upscale sophistication , but dead at his core .
Advertisement
33 . Punch - Drunk Love ( 2002 )
Leave it to P.T. Anderson to unravel the enigma that is Adam Sandler .
After years of playing rage - filled man-children in the lowbrow likes of Billy Madison and The Waterboy , Sandler Punch - Drunk Love is both an unexpected revelation and completely in keeping with his screen persona .
Anderson amps up the actor ’s silly naïveté and hair - trigger temper until they ’re as sharp and vivid as his bright blue suit , casting Sandler as a novelty plunger salesman who overcomes tremendous obstacles to pursue a gentle , patient woman ( Emily Watson ) who ’s uniquely capable of caring for him .
The discordant rhythms of the film , due in large part to Jon Brion ’s radical score , give Punch - Drunk Love a dark , nerve - wracking tension that defies romantic - comedy convention , yet there ’s an overwhelming sweetness to Sandler and Watson ’s relationship that brings it into the light .

32 . A.I. : Artificial Intelligence ( 2001 )
Realizing a long - in - the - works project left unfinished by the late Stanley Kubrick , Steven Spielberg may not have made the film Kubrick would have made , but he stayed true to his friend ’s obsession with how humans react when pushed to extremes .
The film does n’t focus on a single character challenged by isolation , war , violence , or jealousy , but turns instead to a creation whose very existence raises uneasy questions about what makes us human : a robotic boy who marks the edges of humanity by almost , but never quite , perfectly imitating his creators .
An outcast from a family ( and species ) where he never fit in , Haley Joel Osment ’s Danny travels the border country between humans and machines , finally finding the place where that border has no meaning , only to discover loneliness , isolation , delusion , and death .

31 . In The Mood For Love ( 2000 )
The semi-improvisational style of director Wong Kar - wai has often been likened to jazz , as he builds film universes out of colorful riffs and repetition , and intuitive , on - the - fly cinematography that captures small moments out of time .
With In The Mood For Love , his breathtaking tale of unrequited love in ‘ 60s Hong Kong , Wong ’s style perfectly captures the push and pull between the passion of would - be lovers and the strictures that ultimately keep their relationship from flowering .
Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung , two of the world ’s most glamorous stars , have unforgettable romantic chemistry as lonelyhearts whose spouses are cheating on them , but they refuse to do likewise .
The whole movie unfolds like a bittersweet memory , with a rich nocturnal atmosphere and a gorgeous soundtrack that expresses in sound and image the feelings they can not act upon .

30 . WALL -E ( 2008 )
The decade saw no shortage of documentaries explaining how we were ruining the planet , but none made the case as strongly as the first , wordless moments of WALL-E .
A wasted Earth lies nearly dead , and the images carry a stark beauty and a blood - stirring sense of loss .
Pixar ’s film opens with absolute devastation , then proceeds to depict a path to transcending it , as a robot , spurred by love , inadvertently begins to piece together what it means to be a responsible human .

29 . Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ( 2000 )
Watching Ang Lee ’s wu xia epic the first time through , it ’d almost be easy to miss the fact that it has a plot — the visuals are so stunning , and the fight scenes so cinematic that they overwhelm the senses .
The story , about a nobleman ’s daughter , a thief , two aging martial artists , and a stolen legendary sword , is a secondary concern .
It ’s also fairly standard for a traditional Chinese martial - arts saga .
But a terrific cast — headed by Chow Yun -Fat and Michelle Yeoh , but also depending heavily on the charm and physical prowess of Zhang Ziyi — makes this a personal story worthy of its breathtaking cinematography and choreography .

28 . Morvern Callar ( 2002 )
Could Lynne Ramsey ’s existential wallow be the coolest film of the decade ?
Based on the soundtrack , presented in the form of a mixtape a writer leaves his girlfriend upon committing suicide , the answer is unquestionably “ yes , ” with cuts ranging from contemporary acts like Boards Of Canada , Broadcast , and Aphex Twin to classic cuts from The Velvet Underground , Lee Hazelwood , and The Mamas And The Papas .
But Morvern Callar is n’t just attitude , in spite of a heroine ( played by a not - quite - detached Samantha Morton ) whose grief is n’t so easy to detect behind her dark sunglasses and propensity for mischief .
Ramsey , a former photographer who excelled at short films before making her feature debut with Ratcatcher , accumulates small , vivid , offhand moments to access the behavior of a woman who ’s dealing with loss in her own peculiar and sometimes unfathomable way .
The mixtape gives her misadventures a through - line and leads to an ending of unexpected transcendence .

27 . What Time Is It There ? ( 2001 )
A master of melan - comedy , Taiwanese director Tsai Ming - liang spent the decade doing minor variations on his patented fusion of deadpan comedy and urban alienation ( and an occasional dollop of musical fantasy ) , but never quite with the exquisite balance of What Time Is It There ?
Volleying between the rhyming destinies of a son ( Tsai alter - ego Lee Kang - sheng ) mourning his father ’s death and a young woman ( Chen Shiang - Chyi ) adrift on the streets of Paris , Tsai captures their loneliness and uncertainty without losing his sense of humor or mystery .
Shooting in single , static , exquisitely composed takes , he pays subtle homage to silent greats like Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton while revealing his usual strong affinity for characters who are unmoored from the world around them .

26 . The Incredibles ( 2004 )
Brad Bird ’s superhero story does n’t entirely have the tender nuance of Up , the childish glee of Ratatouille , or the stunning sweep of Wall - E , but it does have a crackerjack story ( written by Bird ) in which every character trait and every fleeting moment are all part of a well - honed machine that serves a precise purpose .
It ’s also exciting as hell , with expansive setpieces tuned into tightly controlled thrill - rides where only immense cleverness as well as superhero muscle can save the day from the latest threat .
What makes it exceptional , though — and noticeably a Pixar project — is that on top of being a terrific superhero story , it ’s also a terrific family story , in which five people with different problems learn how to overcome their flaws , see each other as people instead of obstacles , and use their natural talents and their love for each other to meaningful purpose .
With a lot of explosions .

25 . Together ( 2000 )
Swedish writer - director Lukas Moodysson has become disappointingly didactic over the past few years , but he used to be capable of warm , humanistic films like the shambling comedy Together , in which varying countercultural types convene in a commune in 1975 and spend more time debating the nature of their social experiment than they do actually living their principles .
Moodysson divides his attention between the bickering grown - ups and the impact their life of rigid idealism has on their kids , who dream of toy guns and hot sausages .
Nobody is too good or too bad in Together ; they ’re all just muddling through , the same as anyone .
At a time when we seem increasingly divided by our beliefs , it ’s useful to be reminded that no matter how much people posture in public , in private we all have something in common : we ’re all compromised .

24 . Yi Yi ( 2000 )
In Yi Yi ( A One And Two… ) , late Taiwanese director Edward Yang ’s gentle but unblinking look at life in turn - of - the - millennium Taipei , one era gives way to another like the changing of seasons .
A multi-generational saga concerned more with repetition and unseen connections than dramatic happenings — though the film has those as well — Yang ’s film puts together a universally recognizable picture of family life out of the particulars of a single place .
It ’s an abundant , humane film , but also a bittersweet one filled with the knowledge that the coming of the new invariably means the fading of the old .

23 . The Man Who Was n’t There ( 2001 )
The Coen brothers ’ predilection for ripping up genres and eras to reveal what ’s really behind them reached arguably its purest form with The Man Who Was n’t
There , a film - noir homage as much about the times that shaped noir as it is about dark shadows and stained men .
As stoic barber Billy Bob Thornton deals with an unfaithful wife and a murder rap , the Coens inject sci- fi paranoia , commentary on post - war American expansion , and contemplation of Heisenberg ’s uncertainty principle into their usual mix of dry comedy and pristine art direction .
The Man Who Was n’t
There effectively analyzes the underpinnings of noir and why the genre emerged when it did , but it ’s also unmistakably a Coen brothers movie , full of broadly drawn supporting characters and a chilly protagonist frustrated by what he ca n’t control .
( Thornton is a fastidious man , yet he ’s surrounded by clumps and strands of human hair , which never stops growing . )
The result is a film that some found too aloof and bizarre — one for the hardcore Coen - heads , in other words .

22 . United 93 ( 2006 )
Immediately after 9/11 , some cultural commentators predicted an end to big Hollywood movies about exploding buildings and mass murder , while others were certain that it was only a matter of time before one of the worst days in American history became fodder for one of those Hollywood fireball - fests .
Paul Greengrass ’ vérité approach to the subject turned out to be the right way to go , seeming not so much sensationalistic or jingoistic as merely considerate and thorough .
Greengrass recreates the events of the day one piece after another , prompting viewers to recall their own reactions to 9/11 .
What does this mean ?
What do we do now ?
How could this happen ?
United 93 touches on those big issues , but only inasmuch as they relate to the smaller details , from the military response to the terrorists ' anxiousness .
Greengrass does n't oversell the ironies ( like the title plane being delayed just long enough for the passengers to learn what was happening elsewhere , but not long enough to prevent takeoff ) and he does n't oversell the heroism of the passengers , who look alternately horrified and feral .
United 93 is a restrained but gut - wrenching piece of you - are - there filmmaking , and an explication of how the five years after 9/11 quickly evolved from shock to violence to exhaustion

21 . Zodiac ( 2007 )
David Fincher is notorious for his hyper - demanding , Kubrickian pursuit of perfection , where even the simplest shot can demand a hundred takes .
With that in mind , rarely have filmmaker and subject been as compatible as in Fincher ’s Zodiac , a mesmerizing procedural that follows the still - unsolved case of a Bay Area serial killer all the way down an obsessive - compulsive rabbit hole .
What begins as a gorgeous evocation of a region under the grips of a cryptic serial killer — the opening , from the fireworks on July 4 , 1969 to the haunting “ Hurdy Gurdy Man ” sequence that accompanies the first murder , is as good as it gets — becomes all the more fascinating once the case goes cold and only a miserable few ca n’t bring themselves to let it go .
It ’s an obsessive movie about the nature of obsession , made by a man who ca n’t distance himself from the puzzle any more easily than his bleary - eyed characters can .

20 . The Squid and The Whale ( 2005 )
Noah Baumbach reportedly wanted friend and writing partner Wes Anderson to direct The Squid And The Whale , but Anderson wisely turned the project down , arguing that only Baumbach was qualified to direct such a personal project .
Baumbach has played down the autobiographical aspects of his film about the messy divorce of elitist professor and has - been writer ( Jeff Daniels ) and his more successful writer wife ( Laura Linney ) in Reagan - era New York , but it certainly feels ripped from the most agonizing moments of its creator ’s past .
Baumbach is especially unsparing and uncompromising in his depiction of his surrogate ( Jesse Eisenberg ) , a pretentious young intellectual - in - training who has internalized the worst aspects of his father ’s sneering disdain for everyone he considers inferior .
( Which is to say , the sum of humanity ) .
Prominent among the film ’s many virtues is its brevity :
At 81 minutes , it ’s a little less than 70 minutes shorter than Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , and arguably the better film .

19 . The Lord Of The Rings : The Two Towers ( 2002 )
Really , the entire Lord Of The Rings trilogy should be on here as a collective entry ; seen back - to - back , the entire thing plays like a single immense , episodic film .
But we grudgingly decided that a ) that would be cheating , and b ) we could n’t cough up three slots on this list for it .
So by reluctant group consensus , we pointed to The Two Towers as the slight standout of the lot , if only for the David Lean - esque majestic sweep of the battle of Helm ’s Deep .
The whole Rings series is a tremendous cinematic accomplishment , but virtually no part of it offers the visceral thrill of that seemingly doomed last stand against an unimaginable force — or at least one that seemed unimaginable before Peter Jackson put it up on the screen in all its gritty glory .

18 . Mulholland Dr. ( 2001 )
Mulholland Dr. began as David Lynch ’s attempt to return to network television , the medium that left him embittered after his experiences with Twin Peaks .
He never got a chance to get frustrated a second time ; ABC declined the pilot he shot .
Where most directors would simply have walked away , Lynch reworked the material from Hollywood black comedy to a reality - warping tragedy that uses film - noir conventions and Lynch ’s effortless ability to find the surreal in the banal everyday to show a soul getting warped and corrupted under the blaring spotlights and the warm California sun .

17 . The Royal Tenenbaums ( 2001 )
Wes Anderson followed up his beloved breakthrough film Rushmore with The Royal Tenenbaums , a dazzlingly ambitious comedy - drama that filtered The Magnificent Ambersons and J.D. Salinger ’s stories about the Glass family through his unmistakable sensibility .
In a majestic lead performance , the great Gene Hackman plays the patriarch of an eccentric New York clan that had the misfortune of peaking early .
The Royal Tenenbaums is a masterpiece of production design — every detail is perfectly in place and realized down to a molecular level — but the perfectionist visuals always serve the story and the melancholy mood instead of the other way around .
Towering above it all is Hackman ’s lovable rogue , a charismatic schemer in the autumn of his life .

16 . Almost Famous ( 2000 )
Between the underwhelming box office and mixed reviews of Vanilla Sky and Elizabethtown , Cameron Crowe had a rough decade , but it began on a transcendent note with Almost Famous , a funny , sad , deeply humane autobiographical coming - of - age story inspired by the writer - director ’s experiences traveling with the Allman Brothers as a teen journalist for Rolling Stone .
Just as François Truffaut eschewed the kneejerk cynicism that pervades most films about filmmaking in favor of swooning affection in Day For Night , Crowe offers a clear - eyed but overwhelmingly romantic take on the well - wrought mythology of the touring rock band .
Crowe and his adorable surrogate ( Patrick Fugit ) are true believers who are able to see the glory and wonder in even a second - rate rock band like the film ’s fictional Stillwater .
Almost Famous populates its secondary cast with ringers who make the most of their minimal screen time , from Frances McDormand ’s ferociously protective mother to Philip Seymour Hoffman ’s Lester Bangs .
Crowe even coaxes a great performance from Jimmy Fallon as Stillwater ’s manager .
Almost Famous is the film Crowe was born to make , the ultimate expression of his passionate devotion to rock ’n ’ roll , and his deep affection for his characters .

15 . Y Tu Mamá También ( 2001 )
Alfonso Cuaron ’s road trip through contemporary Mexico sends a woman and two men— boys , really — in search of an unspoiled bit of paradise .
But like all road movies , it ’s more about journeys than destinations .
It ’s also a movie about the moments before things change — before paradise gets spoiled , adulthood starts to close down the possibilities of youth , or life gives way to death — which Cuaron and his cast capture with a playfulness that never works against the grave themes just below the film ’s beautiful surface .

14 . Talk To Her ( 2002 )
By the end of the ’90s , Pedro Almodóvar had already completed his transition from a creator of meaningful farces to a director of great dramatic weight .
But his work in the ’00s showcased the full extent of his gifts in a more somber mode .
The best of a decade of strong efforts , Talk To Her brings a plot filled with twists straight out of the pulpiest melodrama—its elements include matadors , comas , and what might be a miracle — but from those elements , it constructs a haunting examination of love , friendship , fate , unthinkable acts , fragile connections , and the way tragedy can unite as well as divide .

13 . Grizzly Man ( 2005 )
Obsessives and quixotic dreamers have long fascinated Werner Herzog , so he was perfectly suited to bring the tragic tale of Timothy Treadwell to the screen .
A spacy former heroin addict and actor whose career peaked when he almost got the Cheers role that launched Woody Harrelson to stardom , Treadwell decided to devote his life to living among grizzly bears in Alaska .
Treadwell set out to protect the bears he loved not wisely , but too well , but he was ultimately the one in desperate need of protection ; it ’s remarkable that Treadwell somehow managed to spend 13 summers with his beloved grizzlies before meeting a tragic , seemingly inevitable fate .
Drawing on more than a hundred hours of footage shot by Treadwell and his girlfriend , Grizzly Man builds into a devastating cautionary tale about the dangers of idealizing and anthropomorphizing wild animals .

12 . Before Sunset ( 2004 )
The perfect “ will they or wo n’t they ” ending to Richard Linklater ’s Before Sunrise seemed like exactly the sort of ambiguous question that most emphatically does n’t require an answer .
It takes roots in the viewer ’s imagination : Depending on who you are , romantic or cynic , you either believe that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reunited in Vienna exactly one year later , or that they would only have that one night together , and never see each other again .
And yet from their very first scene together in Before Sunset , everything feels right about the sequel — better , even — because the conversation that Hawke and Delpy continue so naturally 10 years later is now seasoned by the experiences they ’ve had in the interim .
Turns out that one night meant a great deal to both of them , but they are n't necessarily in a position to pick up right where they left off .
What follows is every bit as enchanting as the first film , but considerably more complicated and adult , too — and with its own tantalizingly open - ended denouement .

11 . Time Out ( 2001 )
The infamous true story that inspired Laurent Cantet ’s Time
Out concerned the terrible deceptions of a white - collar Frenchman who was leading an impossible double life — claiming to be a doctor working out of Geneva , Switzerland while in fact he ’d never graduated from medical school , had n’t had a job in two decades , and was living off a dwindling ( and bilked ) savings account .
When his scheme reached its inevitable end point , he slaughtered his entire family and tried to make it look like a house fire .
The small miracle of Time
Out is that it de-sensationalizes this real - life tragedy and brings it back down to the everyday .
By taking the murders out of the story , Cantet intensifies his focus on a man ( Aurélien Recoing ) who derives his entire sense of dignity and self - worth from the workplace , and gets walled in by denial .
His is still an extreme case — his desperate scramble to keep his lies afloat recalls William H. Macy in Fargo — but anyone who ’s lost a job can identify .

10 . Children Of Men ( 2006 )
The scenario of Children Of Men — a near - future in which humanity has lost its ability to bear children — is extreme .
The details , however , are not .
Alfonso Cuaron ’s adaptation of a P.D. James novel takes the turn of the millennium ’s most alarming political and social trends and follows them along a downward arc .
Religious radicals battle fascists as the opposition either retreats to marijuana - filled isolation , or echoes the extremism of their opposition .
It ’s a desperate , dying place , but the appearance of a thin sliver of hope drives the film ’s actions , and brings out the best and worst of everyone along the way .
Cuaron ’s gift for bravura filmmaking leads to some justly hailed setpieces , but it ’s the unsettling plausibility of his world that makes the film work , as well as its insistence — sometimes hard to pick up under all the bullets and bloodshed — that the worst of times do n’t have to bring out the worst of people .
And that if we ’re going to last as a species , they simply can’t .

9 . The New World ( 2005 )
Terrence Malick has long been captivated by how man strives to tame , shape , and live in the natural world , which makes The New World practically the filmmaker ’s thesis statement .
Here , Malick offers a deep submersion into “ the unspoiled America , ” set at a time when the settlers of Jamestown and the land ’s native inhabitants advanced incompatible conceptions of civilization .
The New World moves through three distinct phases , beginning with John Smith 's infatuation with the lifestyle of the Powhatan Confederacy , then moving to the colonists ' growing conflict with the natives , and ending with Pocahontas marrying John Rolfe and sailing to the ordered gardens of England .
Throughout , Malick treats the humans and their environment with equal interest , showing them all as part of an unstable order .
And throughout , Malick integrates every visual and audio element of the film into a meditation on one difficult question : “ Shall we not take what we are given ? ”

8. Capturing The Friedmans ( 2003 )
Moviefone co-founder Andrew Jarecki set out to make a documentary about popular New York children ’s party entertainers like sought - after clown David Friedman , but he stumbled upon a bigger , darker , and richer story that formed the basis of his mesmerizing 2003 documentary Capturing The Friedmans .
Friedman ’s brother Jesse and father Arnold had both been convicted of child molestation .
But is Jesse guilty , or merely a victim of the hysteria over child - molestation rings that swept the country in the ’ 80s and filled anxious parents ’ heads with gothic images of Satanic sex cults and trenchcoat - wearing predators lurking around every corner ?
Though he creates a sympathetic portrait of an upper - middle - class Jewish family in a state of crisis , and the collateral damage that invariably accompanies child - molestation accusations , Jarecki leaves the question of Jesse ’s guilt or innocence tantalizingly open .
The use of home movies shot by the Friedmans as Arnold and then Jess awaited trial gives the film an almost unbearable intimacy .
What began as a film about an unusually successful professional jester morphs into an American tragedy .

7. Kill Bill Vol. 1 ( 2003 )
Detractors have long accused Quentin Tarantino of being all style , no substance , a master craftsman with a pop-culture encyclopedia instead of a soul .
2003 ’s Kill Bill Vol.
1 , Tarantino ’s first film since 1997 ’s refreshingly mature Jackie Brown , would seem to validate that conception , but when you have style this audacious , inventive , and just plain fun , substance seems downright irrelevant .
Tarantino ’s giddy , overstuffed tribute to the movies that rattled his soul as a kid casts Uma Thurman as a professional assassin who goes bucking for revenge after her creepily paternal boss has her shot and left for dead on her wedding day .
Much badass motherfuckery ensues as Thurman goes after her former partners in crime , leaving a trail of destruction in her wake .
Tarantino ’s kung - fu adventure soars as pure cinema , a sustained adrenaline rush that skips giddily from one unforgettable setpiece to another while quietly laying the groundwork for its quieter , more substantive , and dialogue - heavy second volume .

6. Spirited Away ( 2001 )
All of Hayao Miyazaki ’s animated films are finely crafted artifacts , steeped in old - school craft and a sense of joyous wonder .
But Spirited Away may well be his magnum opus , first among comparable masterpieces .
The fable of a lost , fearful little girl finding her courage after she and her parents are trapped in the spirit world , it has the usual Miyazaki hallmarks , including a fascination with flight , a deep respect for people of sincere good heart , and scary villains who are n’t really villains when seen up close .
But even for a Miyazaki film , it ’s uncommonly beautiful , and uncommonly moving .
It ’s the rarest of things : an animated movie safe for kids but equally suitable for adults , with no pandering to either group .

5. Memento ( 2000 )
Here ’s how to tell that a movie is innovative and watertight :
Seen nearly a decade after release , Memento still feels experimental and daring , and it still holds up as a viewing experience .
Director Christopher Nolan , working from a story by his brother Jonathan ( later to be his writing partner on The Prestige and The Dark Knight ) , tells the story backward , starting with a killing that makes no sense out of context , then moving back through time to establish why that initial / final murder happened , and what it means in a tragic larger context .
Along the way , he reveals a lot about protagonist Guy Pearce , a man with a baffling memory condition that opens him up to monstrous errors in judgment — and yet the exposition is so deftly handled that it never feels forced , in the usual Hollywood “ people telling each other what they already know ” way .
In spite of its audacious structure , Memento manages to reveal its backstory more organically and smoothly than most linear films do .
On top of that , the small cast is fantastic , the mystery is genuinely compelling , and Memento gave us one of the most outrageously funniest film moments of the decade , summed up with the lines “ Okay , so what am I doing ?
Oh , I ’m chasing this guy ?
[ One gunshot later … ]
No , he ’s chasing me . ”

4. No Country For Old Men ( 2007 )
When Joel and Ethan Coen accepted the Best Director Oscar for No Country For Old Men , Joel thanked “ all of you out there for letting us continue to play in our corner of the sandbox , ” which was an apt way to describe a career that can progress from the goofy Intolerable Cruelty and The Ladykillers to an award - winning Cormac McCarthy adaptation .
With No Country , the ever - inscrutable Coens reached beyond themselves and connected with a wider audience , turning McCarthy ’s sparse , allegorical thriller into a finely tuned anxiety - delivery device .
They were ably aided by Javier Bardem , playing a grinning jack - in - the - box who springs out every time the Coens turn the crank just enough , and by Josh Brolin , playing a muttering hunter who seems to be having a running conversation in his head .
While those two chase each other ( and a suitcase full of money ) across the southwest , lawman Tommy Lee Jones stands off to the side , as the old man this newer , scarier country has left behind .
Rarely do the Coens seem overly interested in any reality but their own , but with No Country For Old Men , they tapped into the waking nightmare of our age of terror , and did so in a way that made impending doom feel viscerally exciting .

3. There Will Be Blood ( 2007 )
For a filmmaker with such a bold , unmistakable vision , P.T. Anderson has written and directed a remarkably eclectic array of films , covering everything from the hard - boiled world of professional gamblers ( Hard Eight ) to the porn industry of the ‘ 70s and early ‘ 80s ( Boogie Nights ) to the interconnectedness of humanity and the universality of suffering ( Magnolia ) to the romantic angst of a tortured man-child ( Punch - Drunk Love ) .
True to form , Anderson ’s bruisingly intense 2007 Upton Sinclair adaptation There Will Be Blood looks and feels nothing like any of his previous films .
It ’s a brawling , two - fisted indictment of conscienceless capitalism built around Daniel Day - Lewis ’ volcanic performance as a ruthless oilman who gains the world and loses what little is left of his soul .
Anderson has made a film at once epic and intimate , a character study of a man whose lust for money and power knows no bounds .
As long as we remain addicted to oil , Anderson ’s gut - punch of a film will retain extraordinary contemporary resonance .

2. 25th Hour ( 2002 )
In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 , filmmakers were rushing to digitally blot out any evidence that the Twin Towers ever existed on the New York skyline .
Not Spike Lee. New
York is his town , and he alone was committed to documenting it truthfully and poignantly , as an event that touched everyone ’s lives in that specific time and place and should not be papered over .
That sense of profound loss dovetails beautifully with David Benioff ’s story of a convicted New York drug dealer ( Edward Norton ) spending his final day of freedom before serving a seven - year sentence .
Lee connects his regret over the life he ’s led — compounded by the realization that the world will keep turning without him — with the vibrancy and resilience of the wounded city he at one point professes to hate , but loves with bone - deep transparency .

1. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind ( 2004 )
A film is many things , among them a defiance of mortality and a hedge against the fading of memory .
All films — from the best to the worst — say something about the way we thought and acted and felt at a particular time and in a particular place .
But they ’re also artful lies , constructed realities that bend the world into a shape guided by the obsessions of those who make them .
( Or the commercial interests of the marketplace , or a momentary whim . )
Advertisement
In this , they ’re much like memories , which act more subjectively and self - servingly than any film .
Painful rejections get blurred .
Estranged friends fall victim to careless erasures .
We ca n’t remake the past , but we constantly try to make it a place in which we ’re more comfortable living .
The Michel Gondry - directed , Charlie Kaufman - scripted ( from a story by Kaufman , Gondry , and Pierre Bismuth ) Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind takes this process to an absurd , moving extreme by positing a world in which technology facilitates our ability to smooth out our past , eliding over the events that hurt us , and removing the people who did the hurting .
It ’s a freedom that comes , as the leads played by Kate Winslet and a never - better Jim Carrey discover , at a considerable cost .
Advertisement
Though Kaufman is hardly a purely cerebral writer , his philosophical inquiries find an added emotional weight under Gondry ’s direction .
Portraying the fading and flaring of love in gargantuan bookstores and on railway lines , Gondry captures a moment that ’s quintessentially of the 21st century , and yet timeless .
In 2000 , the calendar rolled over to a new millennium .
With it came a symbolic break with the past , but our old passions and conflicts reasserted themselves seemingly at the stroke of midnight .
So it is with Eternal Sunshine ’s lovers , whose circular path brings them back together for an ending that ’s ambiguous but guardedly hopeful about the possibility of a future not necessarily doomed to reprise the hurt of the past , though it also may well revisit the same mistakes .
It ’s the rare film that shows us who we are now and who we ’re likely , for better or worse , forever to be .
Gore is n't quite as green as he's led the world to believe Correction :
In this column that appeared Aug. 10 on the Forum Page , writer Peter Schweizer inaccurately stated that former vice president Al Gore receives royalties from a zinc mine on his property in Tennessee despite his environmental advocacy .
He no longer does , as the mine was closed in 2003 .
Al Gore has spoken :
The world must embrace a " carbon - neutral lifestyle . "
To do otherwise , he says , will result in a cataclysmic catastrophe .
" Humanity is sitting on a ticking time bomb , " warns the website for his film , An Inconvenient Truth .
" We have just 10 years to avert a major catastrophe that could send our entire planet into a tailspin . "
ON DEADLINE : Your thoughts ?
Graciously , Gore tells consumers how to change their lives to curb their carbon - gobbling ways :
Switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs , use a clothesline , drive a hybrid , use renewable energy , dramatically cut back on consumption .
Better still , responsible global citizens can follow Gore 's example , because , as he readily points out in his speeches , he lives a " carbon - neutral lifestyle . "
But if Al Gore is the world 's role model for ecology , the planet is doomed .
For someone who says the sky is falling , he does very little .
He says he recycles and drives a hybrid .
And he claims he uses renewable energy credits to offset the pollution he produces when using a private jet to promote his film .
( In reality , Paramount Classics , the film 's distributor , pays this . )
Public records reveal that as Gore lectures Americans on excessive consumption , he and his wife Tipper live in two properties : a 10,000 - square - foot , 20 - room , eight - bathroom home in Nashville , and a 4,000 - square - foot home in Arlington , Va .
( He also has a third home in Carthage , Tenn . )
For someone rallying the planet to pursue a path of extreme personal sacrifice , Gore requires little from himself .
Then there is the troubling matter of his energy use .
In the Washington , D.C. , area , utility companies offer wind energy as an alternative to traditional energy .
In Nashville , similar programs exist .
Utility customers must simply pay a few extra pennies per kilowatt hour , and they can continue living their carbon - neutral lifestyles knowing that they are supporting wind energy .
Plenty of businesses and institutions have signed up .
Even the Bush administration is using green energy for some federal office buildings , as are thousands of area residents .
But according to public records , there is no evidence that Gore has signed up to use green energy in either of his large residences .
When contacted Wednesday , Gore 's office confirmed as much but said the Gores were looking into making the switch at both homes .
Talk about inconvenient truths .
Gore is not alone .
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean has said , " Global warming is happening , and it threatens our very existence . "
The DNC website applauds the fact that Gore has " tried to move people to act . "
Yet , astoundingly , Gore 's persuasive powers have failed to convince his own party :
The DNC has not signed up to pay an additional two pennies a kilowatt hour to go green .
For that matter , neither has the Republican National Committee .
Maybe our very existence is n't threatened .
Gore has held these apocalyptic views about the environment for some time .
So why , then , did n't Gore dump his family 's large stock holdings in Occidental ( Oxy ) Petroleum ?
As executor of his family 's trust , over the years Gore has controlled hundreds of thousands of dollars in Oxy stock .
Oxy has been mired in controversy over oil drilling in ecologically sensitive areas .
Living carbon - neutral apparently does n't mean living oil - stock free .
Nor does it necessarily mean giving up a mining royalty either .
Humanity might be " sitting on a ticking time bomb , " but Gore 's home in Carthage is sitting on a zinc mine .
Gore receives $ 20,000 a year in royalties from Pasminco Zinc , which operates a zinc concession on his property .
Tennessee has cited the company for adding large quantities of barium , iron and zinc to the nearby Caney Fork River .
The issue here is not simply Gore 's hypocrisy ; it 's a question of credibility .
If he genuinely believes the apocalyptic vision he has put forth and calls for radical changes in the way other people live , why has n't he made any radical change in his life ?
Giving up the zinc mine or one of his homes is not asking much , given that he wants the rest of us to radically change our lives .
