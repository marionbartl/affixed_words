Ernest Hemingway explained the problem many years ago .
The first thing politicians do to hide their mismanagement , he said , is inflate the currency ; the second thing they do is go to war .
Our currency has been inflated and we are at war .
The demonization of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , which you saw take place in New York City and on American television , is just the first step in preparing the country for a third war .
The president of Columbia , Lee Bollinger , disgraced himself .
Instead of introducing his invited guest speaker , he launched a tirade of abuse and insults .
Obviously , he was in hot water with some of Columbia ’s big donors for inviting Ahmadinejad and chose that petty , shabby way of trying to ingratiate himself to the school ’s angry sugar daddies .
All Bollinger succeeded in doing was making Ahmadinejad look good in comparison with him .
Whether you agree with Iran ’s president or not , he ’s the wrong guy to try to demonize .
First of all , he is not a dictator .
He is an elected president with very little power .
He has to get past the legislature , and the real power rests with the senior cleric , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Khamenei controls foreign policy and is commander in chief of all of Iran ’s armed forces .
The legislature rejected nearly all of Ahmadinejad ’s recommendations for ministers .
When he tried to allow women to attend soccer games , the clerics overruled him .
The claims that Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust and has called for the destruction of Israel are false .
He has called for regime change , which is something American politicians do every time they find a country whose policies they disagree with .
Regime change is a change of government , not genocide .
As for the Holocaust , he said it raised two questions :
Why put people in prison who question details of the official version , which is what several European countries do .
Why should the Palestinians be made to pay for it ?
Both are good questions .
How American politicians can call Iran a dangerous country and claim that it poses a threat to the U.S. is a mystery .
On second thought , it is not a mystery .
It just tells you that the politicians think you and I are so stupid that we will fall for the exact same parade of lies and exaggerations that was used to justify the war against Iraq .
Think for yourself .
Iran has no nuclear weapons , and its military is designed for defense .
It has no offensive capability  no air force , no navy to speak of .
Israel , on the other hand , is usually ranked as the fifth most powerful military state on the planet .
It has more than 200 nuclear weapons and a superb air force .
Iran has said it has no desire to attack Israel or any other country .
It has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and that it has no desire for a nuclear weapon .
The head cleric has issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons .
And there is not one shred of evidence that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon .
Just remember the lies told to you before Iraq : that Saddam Hussein was pursuing a nuclear weapon ; that he had enormous stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons .
The only thing he really had was oil .
That ’s why we went to war , and that ’s why the administration wants to go to war with Iran .
I ’ve heard some politicians say that Ahmadinejad has " blood on his hands . "
Well , our $ 40 billion worth of intelligence cannot even determine if he was involved in the taking of the American embassy back in 1979 .
As for blood , American politicians have far more Iranian blood on their hands .
We overthrew Iran ’s democratic government and installed the Shah and his secret police .
We sided with and assisted Saddam Hussein when he invaded Iran .
Tens of thousands of Iranians are dead because of America ’s foreign policy .
We truly have a corrupt and incompetent government in Washington .

Bang for Your Buck

Essential New Word of the Week : Earthbreast ( definition hint : golf obstacle )
Time to fess up : I ’m a logophile .
Some of you may not know what that means .
Well , it has the word “ logo ” in it , and it ends the same way as “ pedophile . ”
But if you think it means I want to have sex with the Cleveland Indians ’ Chief Wahoo or the Nike Swoosh , you ’re mistaken .
Do n’t get me wrong , that is one sexy swoosh , and I bet Chief Wahoo gives a mean blowjob with his enormous mouth , but “ logophile ” technically means “ word - lover . ”
So , yeah , I ’m what you would call a word - nerd .
Is n’t it great when hobbies that others might ridicule happen to rhyme with suitable insults ?
But I do n’t mind , because it ’s better than being a bird nerd , or a Greek freak .
Actually , if your hobby is Greek , you should be grateful if rhyming insults is the worst you have to suffer .
Knowing lots of obscure words and their meanings makes me feel smart , even if standardized testing and earning power suggests otherwise .
I might not make six figures , but I know what hirquitalliency means .
Also , and I shit you not , there are girls out there who are attracted to guys with big…vocabularies .
When I first learned that , I stopped using my pocket dictionary to fill out my underpants and started reading it .
“ I think enough time has passed that I can reveal that ‘ metrosexual ' is really just a synonym for ‘ neutered . ' ”
Apparently , logophilia is catching on , even among kids .
I just saw the 2006 National Spelling Bee , and it was a real eye - opener .
Why are there so many walking stereotypes in the spelling bee world ?
I ’m talking about dozens of Indian kids whose parents make them study for nine hours a day .
And Asian kids who play the violin in their 20 minutes of designated daily recreation time .
And almost everyone has a lisp .
It ’s creepy , is what it is .
C-R-E-A - P-Y < ding !>
Spelling , though , is a fairly mundane branch of language .
I ’m far more interested in meanings and origins .
Words can have different meanings in different years .
For example , if The Flintstones was conceived in 2006 instead of 1960 , you can bet that the theme song would n’t mention Fred and Barney having a “ gay old time ” .
Also , Pebbles would struggle with anorexia , and Wilma would be hooked on a brand of antidepressants with a hilarious pun name , like Rocksadril or Stonezaprine .
With this in mind , my mission this week is to examine some important words from years past .
How can I tell what word was important in a given year ?
Well , there ’s a group called the American Dialect Society , and part of their mandate is to choose a Word of the Year .
This proves my theory that nothing on Earth is worthwhile unless it is eligible to win an award .
I ’m hereby not making another bowel movement until there ’s some kind of a trophy I can bring home for my efforts .
I have no idea what criteria are involved in picking a Word of the Year , but I ’d like to think they inhale a bunch of helium and test how funny the candidates sound .
Here ’s what their website has to say , though :
Every year since 1990 the Society has voted on words that are most representative of the year gone by .
The chosen words or phrases do not have to be brand new , since few completely new words attain wide currency , but they do have to be newly prominent or distinctive .
The selection is serious , based on members ’ tracking of new words during the year , but it is far from solemn , since many of the words represent fads and foibles of the year .
Some less well known words are chosen because they are ingenious inventions .
Got all that ?
Serious , but not solemn .
Check .
So take a trip with me , and let ’s see how far humanity has progressed in past 16 years :
The year is 1990 .
Manuel Noriega surrenders to American forces in exchange for pimple cream .
The launch of the Hubble telescope allows us to peep out alien boobies , if there are any out there .
And the Word of the Year is “ Bushlips , ” meaning “ insincere political rhetoric . ”
Now , before George W. Bush was summoned to this world from the demon realm of Tsaggothua , we had to contend with his dad , a president known both for his doublespeak , and his atomic backbreaker finishing move .
As much as Clinton enjoys being the meat in a Bush sandwich , George Sr. was no picnic .
The best thing he ever did was vomit all over the Prime Minister of Japan .
Inscrutable bastard had it coming , no doubt .
The word “ Bushlips ” is derived from the now - famous soundbite “ Read my lips , no new taxes . ”
At least , I hope it is .
There ’s a small chance that it somehow refers to the state of Barbara Bush ’s labia , and if that ’s case , I ’m off to forcibly vomit .
“ Read my lips , no new taxes ” was catchy , clever , and also the biggest lie since Santa Claus told me he was only playing leapfrog with my mother .
There were plenty of new taxes during his administration .
As an unkillable mummy , I do n’t know if George Bush Sr. requires sleep , but if he does , I hope the memory of those six words keeps him up at night .
Two years hence , the Word of the Year was “ Not ! ” as in the side - splitting expression of disagreement popularized by Mike Myers ’ character Wayne Campbell .
Upon learning that fact , and as a member of the human race who shares some kind of genomic similarity to both Myers and the judges who picked “ Not ! ” I want you to know that I just punched myself … hard , in the face .
I encourage you to do the same .
It ’s so hard to believe , but 1992 really was a time when “ Not ! ” was a fresh gag ; a way to subvert a traditional English word order for great comedic effect .
You might go to school and say “ Sure , I ’d love a math test … NOT ! ”
And everyone would laugh and clap and admire you for your keen wit .
But try that shit in high school today , and you just might find that the security guards are being a little lax with the metal detector , so that someone can sneak in a lead pipe and beat your unfunny ass to death with it .
For whatever reason , many Words of the Year come from the world of computers .
In 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 , the winners were “ Information Superhighway , ” “ cyber , ” and “ World Wide Web , ” respectively .
This illustrates a very interesting point .
“ Information Superhighway ” was a clever little metaphor for the computer age , but weighing in at a hefty eight syllables , it ’s too unwieldy for popular use .
No one really uses it anymore .
World Wide Web , on the other hand , could be shortened to “ www , ” “ triple - dub , ” “ W3 , ” or simply “ The Web . ”
It ’s like a smorgasbord of abbreviations ; take your pick .
Accordingly , the term has endured .
Computer language needs to be brief ; do you think our robot overlords will have time for eight - syllable terms when they ’re liquefying baby humans for nutrition ?
“ Cyber , ” too , has fallen into general disuse .
It ’s not a very long word , but it does sound incredibly dorky .
Sure , in 1995 , you ’d hear it all the time , and not just in the Lazer Tag arena .
These days , it can be a funny prefix for words like “ pants ” and “ shampoo , ” but not even the scrawniest of American Gladiators would consider taking it as a name .
In any case , the mid-90 ’s was clearly a time when technological developments were springing up faster than acceptable ways to name them .
If you wake up tomorrow with an awesome idea for a midget - launching catapult , be sure you have a good name before it hits the market .
In 1996 , Dolly the sheep brought science one step closer to creating an invincible army of Scott Baio clones .
The Menendez brothers were found guilty of removing mattress tags and also , killing their parents .
And amidst all this anti-motherhood news , the ADS chooses to make “ Mom ” the word of the year .
Specifically , the suffix kind of Mom , as in “ soccer mom , ” which spun off forms like “ minivan mom , ” “ waitress mom , ” and “ glory - hole mom . ”
Moms are great ; you buy them flowers once a year , and they ’re happy .
Awarding the Word of the Year to “ Mom ” seems like a bit much , though .
At first I thought the ADS voting committee must have some serious Norman Bates / Oedipus issues to make this choice .
Then I found out that soccer / minivan moms became hugely significant voting demographics to both candidates in the 1996 presidential campaign .
That ’s why “ Mom ” won the award .
Though I still suspect the committee may have been bribed with delicious home - baked cookies .
The late 1990 ’s saw a return to computer - related words of the year , with just a splash of paranoia thrown in for good measure .
In 1997 , ‘ 98 , and ’ 99 , the words of the year were “ Millennium bug , ” “ e- , ” ( as in e-mail , e- business , and e-rection ) and “ Y2K . ” I know what you ’re thinking :
The first one is stupid , and the last two are n’t so much words as they are …letters .
I guess that sometime in 1998 , the American Dialect Society decided to keep things at a Sesame Street level of literacy ( probably around the time Jesse Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota ) .
The new millennium saw the return of politics for Words of the Year .
In 2000 , the Florida recount propelled “ chad ” to the coveted award .
That ’s probably a good thing .
With no disrespect to PIC ’s Chad , as a name , it evokes images of Teen Beat magazine boy band members and gay porno actors .
As a noun meaning “ tiny bits of paper punched out from data cards , ” it ’s potential is nearly limitless !
Linguists have barely even explored the subset of “ hanging chads ” yet .
2001 saw the award go to “ 9 - 11 . ”
There ’s not a lot that ’s intrinsically funny about that , and I think America was probably too grief - stricken to notice that 9 - 11 is really more of a number than a word .
However , if we acknowledge that , then the terrorists have already won !
I wo n’t let that happen .
Good choice , American Dialect Society !
I think the Words of the Year for 2002 were supposed to be “ weapons of mass destruction . ”
But nobody could find them to be sure .
In 2003 , the Word of the Year was “ metrosexual ” and finally , the ADS is making this a bit easier for me .
I think enough time has passed that I can reveal that “ metrosexual ” is really just a synonym for “ neutered . ”
Yeah , we get it .
You do n’t like guys , but you do like to moisturize and drink white wine spritzers .
Yes , there was a brief time when it was n’t enough to drink beer , weigh 250 pounds , grow body hair , make fart jokes , and cook exclusively on a grill , if you wanted to snag a woman .
You had to groom as if you were gay .
Department stores apparently sold $ 86 million worth of male grooming products in the first nine months of 2003 .
Now , the metrosexual movement has run its course , and the backlash has begun .
The Word of the Year winner has fallen so far as to top the annual Lake Superior State University “ List of Words Banished from the Queen ’s English for Mis - Use , Over - Use and General Uselessness . ”
Guys , this means if you go tanning or get your body waxed , you can longer rely on claims of metrosexuality to avoid that gay label .
Lake Superior State University says so .
In 2004 , the Word of the Year returned to politics by choosing “ Red State / Blue State . ”
It ’s cool that the best - known representation of the 2004 American political landscape also reads like the introduction to a Dr. Seuss book .
Red state , Blue State , False State ,
True State .
We end our analysis in the year 2005 , when George W. Bush was inaugurated for his second term as president .
And what of the Word of the Year , you ask ?
The ADS selects “ truthiness , ” a word popularized by Stephen Colbert meaning “ the quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes to be true , rather than concepts or facts known to be true . ”
We ’ve come a long way since Bushlips , baby .
Not !
Essential New Word of the Week :
Earthbreast [ ‘ erth brEst ] n : Sometimes the brain sees what its owner wants to see .
In cartoons and movies , if two characters are lost in the desert or stranded at sea , one will invariably morph into a talking hot - dog from the hungry point of view of the other .
Last week , magician and paranormal debunker James Randi ( pictured above left ) offered the makers of Pear speaker cables $ 1 million if they could prove in double - blind testing there was a difference between their $ 7,250 cables and ordinary Monster Cables .
Now , Adam Blake ( pictured above right ) , CEO and co-founder of Pear Cable , has called Randi 's offer " a fake " and a " joke " .
We 've contacted James Randi , asking if he'd like to get together with these Pear dudes for some double - blind testing .
We 've also contacted Adam Blake , asking if Pear planned to participate in Randi 's double - blind test .
After the jump , see the full text of Pear Cable 's accusations that Randi 's million - dollar offer is a hoax .
We 'll keep you posted if anyone responds .
Here 's Pear Cable CEO Adam Blake 's response received by Don , a member of the forum at DIY Mobile Audio :
Hello Don ,
Nice to hear from you .
Yes , by now we have heard about this challenge ( although we were never contacted directly ) .
Unfortunately , like most offers of $ 1 million this one is a hoax .
While James Randi is claiming to offer a $ 1 million dollar prize to differentiate between these speaker cables , by reading the official rules of the challenge , it becomes immediately clear that the offer is not valid .
One must be able to " demonstrate any psychic , supernatural or paranormal ability " in order to qualify .
Since there is a wealth of scientific information explaining the differences between speaker cables , the offer is not a valid one ( and James Randi knows it ) .
While we publish a frequency response plot demonstrating the differences between cables on our own website here : http://www.pearcable.com/sub_product...…, there are also independant measurements and data that can be found for example here :
http://www.audiodesignline.com/howto...leID=2…
In addition , the High School eductated James Randi who claims to have consulted unnamed experts on the matter makes unsubstantiated claims that our science is junk .
Unfortunately true experts do not agree .
For example , despite his claims that RFI is not a problem in speaker cables , according to publications by the Amateur Radio Relay League , RFI has been documented as a known problem that can exist in speaker cables .
In addition , according to the editor of Stereophile magazine John Atkinson , James Randi has completely fabricated the statements about Atkinson made in this " challenge " .
Furthermore , another audiophile who goes by the moniker " Wellfed " on the AudioAsylum forums , says he tried to take the challenge twice for what I consider a more dubious audio tweak ( the GSIC chip ) , but was denied the opportunity and was lied to by the Randi Foundation .
Finally , according to these forum posts : http://www.talkaboutaudio.com/group/...es/71… at least one person has tried to take the " challenge " previously to show that they could differentiate between loudspeaker cables and they were denied by Randi who said " Wire is not wire .
I accept that " .
So , at the end of the day we have claims made by a high school educated retired magician , which are refuted by independent studies and publications conducted by experts .
Most importantly , James Randi's " challenge " is backed by nothing .
Many audiophiles have already expressed interest in taking the challenge , but they are barred by the contest rules unless they are part of the media .
And , in the past , Randi denied audiophiles the chance to take the " challenge " with regard to differentiating between speaker cables .
At Pear Cable we publish objective measurements to demonstrate the improved fidelity of our cables .
In addition , we publish reviews and opinions that are based on both blind and non -blind testing .
In fact , the comments made by Richard from the Bay Area Audiophile Society on the Comice Silver Interconnects were the result of a blind test he conducted .
We have not yet put together an official response to this joke of a " challenge " , so we are not currently participating in the many conversations going on in audio forums as we speak .
In any case , I hope you find the above to be informative .
Sincerely ,
Adam Blake
George W. Bush has finally caught Richard Milhous Nixon .
It was a historic race but Bush has finally caught him from behind .
George Bush now stands at a 24 % approval rating in the latest Zogby poll .
That is the same approval rating that Richard Nixon had the day he walked out of the White House in shame .
This president is deeply , consistently and historically unpopular .
Yet , we still can't break through to the Washington bubble .
The country can't stand this president .
They think he is incompetent , uncaring and dangerous .
Meanwhile , Congress and the DC media elite still think the best solution is to move toward the president rather than away from him .
This boggles the imagination .
How can the Senate Democrats decide today to strike a deal with the president to give the telecommunication companies retroactive immunity for the laws that they have broken ?
How can they possibly think that agreeing with a president at 24 % approval rating is a good idea ?
Let alone , necessary .
Necessary ?
Are you kidding me ?
Meanwhile in the House , Democrats backed down from tougher FISA legislation because Republicans wanted to vote on an amendment saying that disagreeing with the president on this issue meant you were giving into Osama bin Laden .
Literally .
They wrote that into the amendment .
Have you seen anything so politically craven and pathetically obvious ?
And this actually worked .
It stopped the Democrats in their tracks .
You knuckleheads , why do n't you write an amendment back that says , " Giving away American citizens ' liberties and rights is exactly what Osama bin Laden wants most of all , so anyone who votes against our bill loves Osama ! "
If they 're going to be children about this , hit them back with what I learned in third grade , " I am rubber , you are glue .
Whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you . "
Come on , please do n't tell me that you 're still scared of these guys .
The Republicans in Congress are running for the hills .
They can't leave Congress fast enough .
Seventeen Republican Congressmen and Senators are hightailing out of town before they get their ass handed to them in the next election .
Hastert indicated today that he does n't even have the stomach to stay for the rest of his term ( and that 's saying a lot ) .
And Bush is at 24 % .
24 %!
He is polling as the most unpopular president of all time .
He 's caught Nixon as Nixon was heading out the door .
They should be having hearings on how to throw the bum out of office , not on how to cave in to him .
Do you have any common sense at all ?
Meanwhile , David Broder and David Ignatius are still writing columns about what a great idea it would be for the Democrats to compromise with the president .
The deans of the decrepit , useless DC media tell us that the best answer to the country 's great frustration is to go closer to the president , not farther away .
Are they nuts ?
The middle of this country does not lie between Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton .
The DC establishment is obsessed with civility and neutrality to the point that they are paralyzed into subservience .
And they disguise that subservience as so - called moderation .
Meeting Dick Cheney and George Bush halfway is not moderation , it is madness .
It is radicalism .
It is deeply unpopular .
It is terrible politics and terrible policy .
You can't argue that the halfway point between George H. W. Bush and the Democratic Congress of 1990 is the same place as the halfway point between George W. Bush and the Democratic Congress of 2006 .
The middle of the two parties is not always the right answer !
It depends on context , it depends on the situation , it depends on where the parties lie at the time .
But you need a brain to figure that out , not a slavish , thoughtless adherence to " neutrality " and " centrism . "
I am a centrist .
I lie between the George H.W. Bush administration and the 1990 Congress .
At this point , that place in the political spectrum is way to the left of the current Democratic party .
And it 's miles away from George W. Bush .
You 've already gone so far right , you 're about to fall off the map .
The American people are trying to warn you .
And the Washington bubble keeps on insisting on going further right .
When is this bubble going to burst ?
When are the people in charge of this country going to realize they have run this ship aground and the American people are frustrated and furious ?
If 24 % does n't do it , what will ?
Does the president have to be at 11 % ?
3 % ?
What will it take to wake up Washington ?
Stop following this man .
Stop caving in to him .
Stop listening to his silly threats .
Stop moving toward him .
Start moving away from him as soon as you possibly can .
The American people are waiting , in the real center of the country .

Captain
Ed notes that Iran has blatantly announced it is going to violate the Geneva Conventions , but no one in the press or the human rights community seems to notice .
Iran announced tonight that the 15 British sailors captured off the coast of Iraq would get indicted as spies .
...
Referring to them as “ insurgents ” , the site concluded : “ If it is proven that they deliberately entered Iranian territory , they will be charged with espionage .
If that is proven , they can expect a very serious penalty since according to Iranian law , espionage is one of the most serious offences . ”
But as Captain Ed points out , you can't charge uniformed men on a patrol boat with espionage .
The Iranians cannot try the men for espionage if they captured the sailors in uniform .
Article 46 of the Geneva Convention states this clearly : 2 . A member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict who , on behalf of that Party and in territory controlled by an adverse Party , gathers or attempts to gather information shall not be considered as engaging in espionage if , while so acting , he is in the uniform of his armed forces .
By gum , even the Nazis knew that , which is why they landed spies and saboteurs on American beaches in uniform .
Burger , Dasch , Heinck and Quirin traveled from occupied France by submarine to Long Island , New York , landing in the hours of darkness , on or about June 13 , 1942 .
The remaining four boarded another German submarine , which carried them down the Atlantic coast to Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida .
On or about June 17 , 1942 , they came ashore during the hours of darkness .
All eight wore full or partial German uniforms , to ensure treatment as prisoners of war should they be captured on landing .
Captain
Ed asks ,
" The indictment of British sailors in uniform as spies will violate the GC .
Can we expect the same level of outrage over this explicit violation as the supposed violations of the US government ? "
Commentary
No of course not .
As currently interpreted the Geneva Conventions only apply to individuals bent on destroying America .
Individuals who blow up elementary schools , kidnap children , attack churches and mosques , kill invalids in wheelchairs , plan attacks on skyscrapers in New York , behead journalists , detonate car bombs with children to camouflage their crime , or board jetliners with explosive shoes -- all while wearing mufti or even women 's clothing -- these are all considered " freedom fighters " of the most principled kind .
They and they alone enjoy the protections of the Geneva Convention .
As to Americans like Tucker and Menchaca or Israeli Gilad Shalit -- or these fifteen British sailors for that matter , it is a case of " what Geneva Convention ? "
We do n't need no steenkin' Geneva Convention to try these guys as spies .
That 's the way the Human Rights racket works .
Do n't go looking for any Geneva Convention in Somalia , Darfur , Basilan or Iran .
Try Guantanamo Bay .
Top Ten Most Powerful Cars -
They ’ve Got The Power

There is something about the power behind the wheel of a car that can bring on a rush of adrenalin .
Any car - crazy person will endorse that .
While each individual will draw up his or her own list of favorites when it comes to the top ten most powerful road cars , there ’s a generic list with today ’s market in view that everyone will more or less concur with .
Which cars , then , can feature in our top ten most powerful road car list ?
Money certainly counts , but a car comes second to a home , so here is a look at the most likely contenders : Ferrari

MESA , Ariz . ( AP )  School officials suspended a 13 - year - old boy for sketching what looked like a gun , saying the action posed a threat to his classmates .
The boy 's parents said the drawing was a harmless doodle and school officials overreacted .
" The school made him feel like he committed a crime .
They are doing more damage than good , " said the boy 's mother , Paula Mosteller .
The drawing did not show blood , bullets , injuries or target any human , the parents said .
And the East Valley Tribune reported that the boy said he did n't intend for the picture to be a threat .
Administrators of Payne Junior High in nearby Chandler suspended the boy on Monday for five days but later reduced it to three days .
The boy 's father , Ben Mosteller , said that when he went to the school to discuss his son's punishment , school officials mentioned the seriousness of the issue and talked about the massacre at Colorado 's Columbine High School , where two teenagers shot and killed 12 students , a teacher and themselves in 1999 .
Mosteller said he was offended by the reference .
Chandler district spokesman Terry Locke said the crude sketch was " absolutely considered a threat , " and that threatening words or pictures are punishable .

Demonoid.com , one of the most popular BitTorrent trackers has allegedly been taken offline by the Canadian Recording Industry Association ( CRIA ) .
Both the tracker and the website have been unresponsive for nearly 24 hours now .
As of now it is still unsure what exactly happened , but the popular Dutch news site nu.nl reports that the CRIA is responsible for the downtime .
TorrentFreak contacted some of the Demonoid administrators , but they are not sure what happened either .
It is certainly possible that Demonoid ’s Canadian ISP pulled the plug after being pressured by the CRIA .
The ISP said before that they would take it down if they would receive complaints .
Right now , the Demonoid server is still pinging , but the ISP could have firewalled the everything after they received some serious legal threats .
Deimos , the founder and the head admin of the site is unreachable and has not responded yet .
This is not the first time Demonoid suffers major downtime due to pressure from the anti-piracy lobby .
Demonoid had to move its servers from The Netherlands to Canada in June after The Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN filed a subpoena against Demonoid ’s ISP .
BREIN had asked the ISP to take Demonoid offline and hand over the administrator ’s personal details , but Demonoid relocated their servers before any harm was done .
Unfortunately , it now seems that Canada is not the “ safe haven ” as they expected it to be .
It is likely that Demonoid has to relocate again , for the second time in three months .
Demonoid tracks over a million . torrent files and is the second largest BitTorrent tracker after The Pirate Bay .
The shutdown of the site and tracker is a huge blow for the BitTorrent community that lost 2 of the most popular BitTorrent trackers ( TorrentBox was taken offline for US users a few hours ago ) within 24 hours .
More info soon !
Update : Still no response from Deimos , the CRIA or Demonoid ’s ISP .
Update : The CRIA and Demonoid ’s ISP refuse to comment to the allegations , they do n’t confirm or deny anything .
Update :
The tracker is back online .
Update : Demonoid Returns , Forced to Block Canadian Traffic

New Poll : Bush And Congress Both At Astonishing Lows
A new NBC / Wall St. Journal poll released this evening has President Bush at a horrible 29 % - 66 % approval - disapproval rating .
Congress , however , is even worse off at 23 % - 64 % .
Wow .
You 're polling behind Bush .
You know , I have to hand it to you , because I was pretty sure that was territory reserved for Big Time .
How does that capitulation bill feel now ?
Feel really great about not having to deal with that criticism you were so scared of when you sent King Bush his blank check for his war ?
You know what you should be afraid of ?
Abandoning the promises you made to the people who put you into the majority in the first place .
You promised us you 'd bring accountability to the White House , and end the war .
Well , some of you in the House are doing a good job sending out subpoenas and holding hearings ; that 's a good start .
But you .
Have .
Blown .
It . on the war , and now I have a very serious question : what do you intend to do about it ?
I want to believe in you again .
I really , really do .

Sheikh Muawiya Jebara , a senior member of the Salahuddin Awakening Council , and three of his bodyguards were killed as his convoy travelled near Samarra .
His death comes less than a month after the killing of the head of a similar group in neighbouring Anbar province .
Meanwhile , the Shia mayor of Iskandariya died in a separate bombing .
Abbas al - Khafaji , a member of the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council ( SIIC ) , and four of his bodyguards were killed when a roadside bomb exploded near their car at a checkpoint , police said .
A mixed Sunni -Shia town 40 km ( 25 miles ) south of the capital , Iskandariya lies in a centre of the Sunni insurgency known as the " triangle of death " .
Tribal alliance
The attack on Sheikh Muawiya Jebara occurred in mid-afternoon as he travelled to an area south - west of Samarra to support other members of the Salahuddin Awakening Council who were currently fighting al - Qaeda in Iraq .
Our troops consist of 3,000 fighters distributed across seven headquarters in the province
Sheikh Sabah al - Shammari
Salahuddin Awakening Council
The sheikh survived the initial blast , but died from head injuries shortly after arriving in hospital , his brother said .
The head of the Tikrit - based Salahuddin Awakening Council , Sheikh Sabah Mutashar al - Shammari , recently said the tribal alliance had conducted more than 100 operations against Sunni extremist militants .
" Our forces are working in co-ordination with the ministers of defence and interior , " he told the AFP news agency .
" Our troops consist of 3,000 fighters distributed across seven headquarters in the province . "
Last month , the leader of the Anbar Awakening , Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha , was killed in a bomb attack near his home in Ramadi .
US officials have pointed to the formation of the tribal alliances as one of the most positive developments in their efforts to reduce violence in Iraq .
MP detained
In other news , the US military said it had taken an Iraqi member of parliament into custody after he allegedly attended a meeting of suspected al - Qaeda members .
The MP was seized during a joint raid by US and Iraqi forces in the town of Sharqat , north of Baghdad .
The main Sunni Arab alliance in parliament , the Iraqi Accord Front , said the man was one of its members , Naif Jassim Mohammed .
The US military said the man was being questioned by the authorities , but was not formally considered to be a detainee .
Later , parliament agreed to let the Iraqi Accord Front replace another of its MPs with one of the country 's most famous football stars .
Ahmed Radhi , the only Iraqi player to have scored in the World Cup , replaced Abed Nasser al - Janabi , who was expelled from parliament in June after saying he was leaving politics to join the insurgency .
A Manhattan man is suing the makers of the energy drink Boost because the drink gave him a three day erection .
Christopher Woods claims that he has suffered " pain , shock and mental anguish " after drinking Boost in June of 2004 .
He started to drink the product in order to gain weight , but a day after drinking Boost , his pains began .
From the Post :
The suit says [ Woods ] used the " product in accordance with its intended use " - and soon had a very visible side effect .
He said the erection lasted for over three days , and his girlfriend " was in disbelief .
She could n't understand what was happening . "
" It was awful .
It was painful .
I would always wear jeans , but it was hard to go out , so I had to buy some sweatpants , " Woods said .
He said his 7 - year - old son asked him what was going on and " I did n't know what to tell him . "
He saw a doctor and underwent a " winter shunt " - a painful procedure where a needle is used to drain blood .
The suit says he experienced " persistent problems requiring a follow - up hospital visit " a week later .
Ottawa 's abrupt decision to cancel a preliminary inquiry into Canada 's most spectacular post - 9/11 terror allegations and instead move directly to trial raises new and troubling questions .
Everything about the case of the so - called Toronto 18 is shrouded in mystery .
Evidence raised in court , either at bail hearings or the preliminary hearing , is covered by a publication ban .
But this has n't prevented the public from knowing allegations against 14 adults and four juveniles that are so bizarre as to be almost unbelievable .
The Crown claims that at one point the alleged Islamic terrorists were plotting to cut off Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's head – but changed their minds because they were n't sure where Parliament Hill was .
It also claims some of the 18 attended a Keystone Kops - style military training camp at Washago north of Toronto where , it seems , they spent most of their time complaining about the cold .
Shortly after charges were levelled , the Star reported the government case rested on two informants .
One , whose name cannot be published , is said to have been paid $ 4 million by the government .
He was apparently a central figure in an alleged plot to make a fertilizer bomb .
A second informant , Mubin Shaikh , decided to go public .
Now you can't shut him up .
He 's been interviewed by the Star , the National Post , the Los Angeles Times , the CBC and most recently the BBC .
A former army cadet , Shaikh says he is the man who ran the alleged Washago terror training camp .
In spite of the publication ban , he 's been happy to tell the world everything he knows and much that he does n't – including his opinion of one of the alleged ringleaders ( " an effing time bomb " ) .
In one interview , Shaikh claimed the alleged plotters planned to start a Chechen - style Muslim resistance movement in Northern Ontario , a region of the country with few Muslims and even fewer Chechens .
In April , in a completely unrelated case , Toronto police charged Shaikh with assault and threatening bodily harm after he allegedly attacked two 12 - year - old girls .
He was in the middle of testifying in the terror case when the Crown shut down the preliminary hearing into the case of the 14 adults and announced it wanted to move directly to trial .
( Charges have already been stayed against three of the four juveniles , which means that they are effectively off the hook ) .
Defence lawyers for the alleged terrorists are ticked .
It 's hard to blame them .
The whole reason for a preliminary hearing is to determine whether there is enough evidence to warrant trial and , more important , to give the defence a chance to hear the Crown 's case .
Defence lawyers say they made concessions in return for the right to cross-examine witnesses like Shaikh .
Now they wo n't have a chance to test his widely publicized allegations until the trial .
By itself , a decision to avoid preliminary hearings and move directly to trial is not unusual .
The government has done so in other high - profile criminal cases .
But usually , the Crown makes up its mind at the beginning ; it does not normally change gears halfway through .
Which leaves us to ask :
Was something about to be revealed in court that the government did n't want anyone to hear ?
Was the Crown getting nervous about its informants ?
Is there some other reason ?
If I 'd attended the preliminary hearing , I might know the answers to these questions .
But then I would n't be able to report them .
So you 'll have to wait for the next leak – or the next overseas media interview with one of the government 's star witnesses .
Perhaps CNN will call up Mubin Shaikh .

Republican Presidential Candidate Calls For an End to Federal Income Tax and Less Concentration on Foreign Matters
Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul called for stricter adherence to the Constitution during an impassioned speech about his political ideologies on Feb. 13 at Georgetown .
The Texas congressman positioned himself as leader of a revolution that would tout a return to constitutional principles with a small federal government , no income tax and more concentration on domestic , rather than foreign , matters .
He blamed many of the country ’s problems on a willingness to ignore the founding fathers ’ intent and a willingness to weaken the Constitution with amendments .
“ We ’ve made one serious mistake — we ’ve ignored our Constitution , ” Paul said in a speech frequently punctuated by cheers and chants from the audience .
“ If you want to get back to the basics and restore the principles of this country and this republic , we have to obey the Constitution . ”
Though he is running on the Republican ticket , Paul identifies as a Libertarian , who advocate minimal government and social programs in favor of individual rights .
Freedoms are rapidly disappearing , Paul said , and Georgetown students should ask themselves one question :
What should the role of the government be ?
“ The founders asked themselves that question and came up with a pretty good answer .
They said the role of government should be one thing , to protect liberty , ” he said .
“ That should be the only purpose of government . ”
Freedom used to mean “ freedom for you .
You were in charge of your life and if you messed it up , it was your fault , ” he continued .
“ If there is one thing I hope to achieve in this campaign , it ’s to get people thinking what freedom is all about .
The purpose of freedom is for us to lead our own lives , to promote our own virtue … Government interest destroys everything . ”
He pinpoints the start of trouble when the government declared rights to include access to education , jobs and medical care .
“ What you have is a right to your life .
That ’s what you have , ” Paul said .
“ If that were fully understood , you ’d have a right to the fruits of your labor , and you would be able to keep everything you earn and not have to share it with the big government . ”
Paul came to Georgetown as part of the university ’s presidential candidate lecture series .
He is the second candidate to speak after Democrat Bill Richardson , who has since dropped out the race .
Enthusiastic supporters greeted Paul in Gaston Hall by chanting his name .
Much of Paul ’s base includes younger voters who have flocked to his Web site and set donation records — a $ 4.2 million take on Nov. 5 , 2007 is most a GOP candidate has raised on a single day .
The congressman said his message resonates strongly with Americans who want a different form of government that puts its citizens above foreign engagement .
Paul said military personnel are embracing that point in particular , and claimed he has received more donations from that group than all other candidates combined .
However , research from the Houston Chronicle found this is only from donors who self - identified as military personnel , something that is not required , and many donors are civilian employees .
In a wide - ranging speech that touched everything from the war in Iraq to abortion to tax policies , Paul reiterated that the current generation of Georgetown students will pay the price for what he called mistakes of the government .
He pointed to overspending , borrowing money from foreign governments and a financial strain on the middle class as unsustainable practices that will have significant fallouts .
While acknowledging he is not the front runner for the Republican nomination , Paul said his principles are stirring supporters ’ passion about what the United States could accomplish .
But the night was not without detractors .
To a mix of applause and boos from the audience , one Georgetown student questioned the candidate about racist and homophobic slurs that appeared newsletters published by Paul in the 1990s .
Though Paul has since said he did not write the articles in question , the student pushed to know why Paul did not denounce the writings years ago when first confronted .
The congressman said it was a mistake and blamed the comments getting published on time constraints during his time as publisher .
Paul also called himself “ probably the biggest champion of rights for everybody . ”
“ A true Libertarian , ” he said , “ is incapable of being a racist . ”

His list of donors is a classic :
Paul ’s third - quarter financial disclosure report is sprinkled with supporters whose self - descriptions of their occupations are unusual , to say the least .
Wade Talkington of Panama City , Fla. , who donated $ 1,000 to Paul , lists his occupation as “ tax slave to the Federal Govt . ” Erik Hovden of Olalla , Wash. , is the “ Head slacker in Chg ” at Simpson LLC , and housewife Pamela Schuberg of Moorpark , Calif. , a $ 2,300 donor , lists her employer as “ our children . ”
Donald Cowles lists himself as self - employed and his occupation as simply “ Capitalist . ”
On the opposite end , David Cameron of San Jose , Calif. , lists his employer as “ Looking for Work ” and his job as “ Unemployed . ”
Still , Cameron has given a total of $ 1,900 to the campaign .
Griswold Draz of Wellfleet , Mass. , a $ 500 donor , is a self - described “ curmudgeon , ” and Andrew Maul of Pittsburgh , Pa. , is a “ Citizen Fighting Tyranny . ”
Others are more coy .
James Harper of Vancouver , Wash. , a $ 600 donor , offered “ guess ? ; ) ” as his occupation .
Starchild , a San Francisco - based escort and exotic dancer who ended up on Paul ’s list as “ Star Child , ” contributed $ 300 .

“ WE'VE made vaccines from pus and poop , we make them now using eggs — so why not make them in live mosquitoes ? ”
So says Stefan Kappe , a researcher at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute .
To prove the point , his team is breeding millions of Anopheles mosquitoes ( pictured above ) and infecting them with malaria - causing parasites .
Not any old parasites , either .
Those he uses have had some of their genes knocked out to stop them breeding in humans .
Their destiny , like that of the “ attenuated ” viral strains grown in eggs , is to form part of a vaccine .
Once the parasites have had time to breed in the mosquitoes , the insects are killed and dissected under a microscope .
The gold inside them is their salivary glands , the parts richest in parasites .
These are extracted , processed and turned into what Dr Kappe hopes will become a successful vaccine .
By injecting this vaccine of pared - down parasites into uninfected individuals , he intends to provoke an immune response to malaria that will be strong enough to kill a real infection before it gets going .
Provoking such a response is , of course , the idea behind any vaccine , and there are various ways of doing it .
Dr Kappe 's looks promising in the laboratory , but has yet to undergo clinical trials .
Another method , however , has been on trial for several years by Pedro Alonso of the Barcelona Centre for International Health Research .
This week saw the publication in the Lancet of the latest results from those trials .
They look very promising indeed .
Surface and depth
The vaccine created by Dr Alonso and his colleagues has been tested on infants aged under five months in a region of Mozambique where the disease is endemic .
It did not provide complete protection , but the infection rate observed over the course of the subsequent six months was 65 % lower than in members of a control group , who were given a hepatitis B vaccination instead .
And it was also safe — an important consideration , since infants are both the people most vulnerable to malaria and those in whom it is easiest to provoke adverse reactions .
Unlike Dr Kappe 's vaccine , this one does not rely on injecting whole , attenuated parasites .
Instead , some of the proteins that adorn the parasite 's surface have been made in bulk .
The vaccine is thus , in effect , all surface .
Since the immune system can see only the surface of even a whole parasite , that is the only part it can learn to recognise , so a vaccine consisting of parasite surface and nothing else should be good at stimulating an immune response — and it is .
Dr Alonso 's paper , then , is a bit of good news in an area — global health — that is more usually associated with misery .
It is not , however , the only optimistic note as far as malaria is concerned .
A newish and very effective drug called artemesinin is now being deployed , and the campaign to distribute insecticide - laced bed nets through large parts of Africa is also showing signs of success .
A few people are therefore daring to whisper a word that has not been heard much in malaria circles since the 1960s : eradication .
On October 17th , the day Dr Alonso 's paper was published , someone dared do more than whisper the word .
Bill Gates almost shouted it at a conference on the disease which was organised in Seattle by his foundation .
The Gates Foundation helped to finance the trials in Mozambique and Mr Gates used their success to give a rousing speech to the gathered experts , challenging them to raise their sights .
Rather than continue with today 's strategy of merely controlling malaria , he argued that it is time for the world to aspire to exterminate it altogether .
This is not a new idea .
The last attempt to eradicate malaria began in 1955 ( coincidentally , the year Mr Gates was born ) and relied on a new wonder chemical called DDT to kill the mosquitoes .
For a time , it was successful , but then evolution struck back , as natural selection favoured the spread of insecticide - resistant genes .
Shortly afterwards , politics struck back , too , as the environmental movement successfully demonised DDT because of the damage it does to many other animals .
Given this history , cynicism about the idea of eradication is understandable .
Steven Phillips , chief medical officer of Exxon Mobil , a firm whose African operations are inevitably affected by malaria , argues that eradication is technically impossible and favours emphasis on “ bread and butter ” disease control .
But Regina Rabinovich and Tachi Yamada , the scientists responsible for running the Gates Foundation 's anti-malaria effort , argue that eradication was never seriously attempted in Africa in the past .
They think that today 's money , technologies and political will are strong enough to make eradication a realistic aspiration .
Dr Phillips is right , in the sense that even the finest vaccine cannot do much good if it does not reach villages in endemic areas .
However , things change — even in Africa .
A report released this week by Unicef , the United Nations Children 's Fund , suggests several countries , including Ghana , Tanzania , Benin and Gambia , are making progress in spreading artemesinin and bed nets .
Eradication would not be cheap .
A back - of - the - envelope estimate suggests it would cost about $ 9 billion a year for two or three decades to make and distribute the necessary vaccines , drugs and equipment .
But that compares with $ 3 billion a year indefinitely , merely to contain the problem — not to mention the economic damage done by the disease .
Big ideas have to await the right time to be realised .
But for malaria that time may be now .
Daily Howler : Stupid is as John Stossel does .
Here -- let ABC prove it
A S STOSSEL DOES !
Stupid is as John Stossel does .
Here — let ABC prove it : // link // print // previous // next //
TUESDAY , JANUARY 17 , 2006
AS STOSSEL DOES : How stupid is the public discourse about Americas public schools ?
Consider John Stossels amazingly stupid 20 /20 report .
The hour - long effort — titled How stupid is the public discourse about Americas public schools ?
Consider John Stossels amazingly stupidreport .
The hour - long effort — titled  Stupid in America —aired on ABC Friday night .
In fairness , Stossel raises a string of worthwhile questions in his addled report .
How well do American children read and cipher compared to kids from other countries ?
That s a question well worth asking — and Stossel asks it early on .
But then ,  Stupid in America also asks a series of worthwhile policy questions .
For example , would expanded school choice improve public ed ?
Early and often , Stossel swears that it would .
And Stossel asks other worthwhile questions during this remarkable program .
But alas !
The thing that makes this show remarkable is Stossels unyielding stupidity .
Its catchy title is supposed to refer to Americas pitiful , dumb-ass kids .
But just how stupid are American kids compared to those in rest of the world ?
Stossel makes his case in the following clip , part of his programs opening segment .
We apologize for the length of our excerpt .
But when someone produces work this stupid , it must be seen to be believed : STOSSEL ( 1/13/06 ) : Most Americans do n't know what stupid schools are doing to American kids .
We gave parts of an international test to some high school students in Belgium and in New Jersey .... What did the Belgian kids think ?
BELGIAN STUDENT ( videotape ) : Considering the tests we usually get here , this was kind of a piece of cake .
BELGIAN STUDENT ( videotape ) :
It 's very easy .
STOSSEL : The New Jersey kids were also confident .
How was the test ?
Easy ?
Hard ?
NEW JERSEY STUDENT ( videotape ) :
It was actually pretty easy .
NEW JERSEY STUDENT ( videotape ) : I think I did good .
STOSSEL : They have reason to be confident .
New Jersey students in general test above average .
And these kids attend an above - average New Jersey school .
But the Belgian kids cleaned their clocks .
STOSSEL ( to New Jersey students ) :
They got 76 percent correct .
You got 47 percent correct .
NEW JERSEY STUDENT ( videotape ) : I 'm shocked .
Because it just shows how much advanced they are compared to us .
STOSSEL : This boy got the highest score among the Americans , but did n't come close to the top scoring Belgians .
BELGIAN STUDENT ( videotape ) :
The test was so easy , I think if the kids in America could n't do this , they 're really stupid .
The test shows how much advanced they are compared to us ,  one New Jersey kid glumly says .
But while were talking about really stupid ,  lets review what Stossel says in this remarkable segment .
The test shows how much advanced they are compared to us ,  one New Jersey kid glumly says .
But while were talking about really stupid ,  lets review whatsays in this remarkable segment .
What does Stossel say in the passage weve quoted ?
He says he gave parts of an international test to these two groups of students — but he never says what the test was .
In the same vein , he never gives us any way to judge who these two groups of kids really are .
In the case of the American students , he says they attend an above - average school — but that , of course , doesnt mean that the students themselves are above average .
( Nor can we verify his claim about their school , since he never names it . )
And how about the Belgian students ?
How average ( or above - average ) might they be ?
There is absolutely no way to know .
Stossel says nothing about them or their school ; they may be the brightest students in Belgium , attending that nations most selective school .
In short , this episode is like a ludicrous parody of the way information is actually gained .
It s astounding to think that ABC News would even consider airing such nonsense .
Indeed , if its  Stupid in America  you want , the names of this shows producers — and its clowning correspondent — should go at the top of your list .
Indeed , how cosmically dumb is John Stossel — and how dumb does he take his viewers to be ?
For a bit of comic relief , lets consider where he goes as he continues this ludicrous segment .
Yes , the nonsense which follows was actually broadcast — broadcast by ABC News : STOSSEL ( continuing directly ) : Stupid ?
Really ?
Jay Leno 's routines make you think it 's true .
LENO ( videotape from the Tonight Show ) : And what state holds the Kentucky Derby every year ?
Think about it .
STOSSEL : The Tonight Show says these are not staged .
These are their real answers .
INTERVIEWEE : Kansas .
LENO ( videotape from the Tonight Show ) : Finish the name of this book : War and — INTERVIEWEE : Sex .
LENO : War and Sex !
 The Tonight Show says these are not staged ,  says Stossel .
But of course , these segments are selected — selected for airing because of their dumbness .
But then , thats also what happens when ABC News decides to air John Stossel .
says these are not staged ,  says Stossel .
But of course , these segments are — selected for airing because of their dumbness .
But then , thats also what happens when ABC News decides to air John Stossel .
How do American students compare to students in a country like Belgium ?
As weve said , thats an excellent question — but Stossels approach to this worthwhile question is an insult to the news process .
As any reporter would surely know , theres no way to answer a question like that by testing two small groups of kids in just two schools .
But then , such world - class clowning is manifest in almost every part of this ludicrous program .
ABC
News insults the public interest by airing a ludicrous show of this type .
And go ahead — search the dial .
See if anyone bothers to say so .
Sadly , its now assumed that our big news orgs are engaged in burlesques of this type .
AS ROBERTS DOES : Stupid is as Stossel does — and then , theres ABCs Robin Roberts .
On Friday mornings Good Morning America , Roberts previewed that evenings report .
Incredibly , she aired the very part of the program weve excerpted — the segment about New Jersey and Belgium .
And having viewed this clownish presentation , the half - witted anchor said this : ROBERTS ( 1/13/06 ) : I tell you , it stings to hear a kid from another country call one of our kids stupid . 
So why — we 're spending so much more money in the US .
Why are other kids smarter than ours ?
STOSSEL : Because those kids have a choice .
They can take the government 's money and pick their school .
In America we 're assigned to a school .
America is one of the few countries where it's a government monopoly , no choice .
That breeds mediocrity .
ROBERTS : Okay , John .
I know you 're going to have so much more .
And you know how to raise some eyebrows , I 'll give you that .
And you can see more of John Stossel 's report ,  Stupid in America : How We Are Cheating Our Kids " tonight on 20/20 at 10:00 PM
Eastern right here on ABC .
Poor Roberts !
It stung to hear our kids called stupid — especially when were spending so much money on our schools .
Poor Roberts !
It stung to hear our kids called stupid — especially when were spending so much money on our schools .
For ourselves , we had a different reaction .
Here was our question :
When were spending so much money on network anchors , how can they be so world - class stupid ?
Could any news professional fail to see the sheer absurdity of Stossels procedure ?
But Robin Roberts failed to see — or she was prepared to pretend .
But so it goes as our big news orgs — and their millionaire anchors — pretend to care about American schooling .
THE STOSSEL RULES : Those Jersey kids attend an above - average school , Stossel said — failing to say if the students themselves were above average academically .
But then , should we trust Stossel when he rates schools ?
Consider his silly , gong - show rating of Washington , D.C.s Wilson High .
It was a typical Stossel moment , in which a string of utterly clownish procedures commingled to produce preferred points .
In this instance , Stossel wanted to show how stupid things are even inside our best public schools .
So he aired footage in which students seem to be clowning inside a classroom at Wilson .
Once again , heres a clip of Stossel hard at work : STOSSEL : We wanted to tape typical classrooms .
We were turned down in state after state .
Finally Washington , DC , did allow us to give cameras to a few students they hand - picked at two schools they hand - picked .
One was this one , Woodrow Wilson High .
Newsweek says it 's one of the best schools in America .
Yet what the students taped was n't confidence - inspiring .
STUDENT ( videotape ) : This is Wilson High School .
We dance .
STOSSEL : Note that the teacher is in the class when he does this .
On that day , this teacher had his world geography class playing Monopoly .
STUDENT ( videotape ) : Right now we 're going to ask Mr. Reiner what Monopoly has to do with world geography .
TEACHER ( videotape ) : Like Monopoly , we have countries that do better than others , based on where you live .
STOSSEL : It was after finals , and I do n't know if Monopoly can help teach geography .
I do know this teacher did n't have much control over his class .
TEACHER : Phil , get off the desk and sit in your seat .
Ladies and gentlemen , listen up — STUDENT : Mr. Reiner ?
TEACHER : Raise your hand .
STOSSEL : It 's hard to believe you can learn much while this is going on ... And this is one of America 's best public schools .
But is that true ?
Is Wilson one of America 's best public schools ? 
Newsweek  Top Thousand — right ahead of Clarence High School of Clarence , New York .
Beyond that , theres no apparent reason to call Wilson one of the nations best public schools — unless you re playing the public for fools , as Stossel so casually does here .
How great are things at Wilson High ?
The schools overall test scores are defiantly average , despite the presence of high - powered school - within - a - school academies ( presumably , this accounts for the number of AP exams ) .
Meanwhile , heres part of GORE ( 11/17/05 ) :
We have considered moving [ out of Washington ] .
The idea was especially immediate to me the evening I attended the back - to - school night at Wilson Senior High School this fall .
As I went from classroom to classroom , I was dismayed at the state of the building .
Paint is peeling off the walls .
Each classroom had little to distinguish it from the rest .
There were no textbooks for three out of seven subjects .
As I walked down the halls , I had to tell myself over and over that I was not in a developing nation .
I would expect these conditions in a Third World country , but not in the nation 's capital .
Does that sound like one of the nations best schools ?
And this parent didnt seem to be dreaming .
Earlier in the year , Post reporter Valerie Strauss described appalling conditions at Wilson — conditions which had parents threatening to turn the school into a charter : STRAUSS ( 2/17/05 ) : Staff and parents at Wilson Senior High School have learned not to expect help from the District 's central school administration when a problem arises .
Multiple orders to fix the roof have been ignored , so water cascades into the building during thunderstorms .
The communications system works only sporadically , so sometimes nearly half of the school 's teachers have no e-mail access to contact parents or one another .
A desperate plea for copy paper had to be posted on a parent Internet listserve .
" Al Qaeda is better supplied , " quipped Chuck Samuels , co-chairman of Wilson 's Local School Restructuring Team .
The final straw came when the central administration ordered Wilson to cut $ 1 million from its budget last year because of a systemwide budget shortfall , forcing the school to lay off 15 percent of its teachers .
Such appalling conditions should be part of any discussion of American education .
But Stossel is a circus clown , maintained by one of our biggest news orgs .
He had funky footage from a Wilson classroom ( a final note on this footage below ) .
Result ?
He called Wilson one of the nations best public schools  — so he could claim that , even at the nations best schools , the inmates now run the asylum .
But is that true ?
IsWilson one of America 's best public schools ?
The Newsweek rating to which Stossel refers is based on one factor only — the number of AP exams taken by a schools students .
Judging by this single measure , Wilson ranks 318 on the Top Thousand — right ahead of Clarence High School of Clarence , New York .
Beyond that , theres no apparent reason to call Wilson one of the nations best public schools — unless you re playing the public for fools , as Stossel so casually does here .
How great are things at Wilson High ?
The schools overall test scores are defiantly average , despite the presence of high - powered school - within - a - school academies ( presumably , this accounts for the number of AP exams ) .
Meanwhile , heres part of a column by Hilda Labrada Gore , a Wilson parent , in the Washington Post last November : Does that sound like one of the nations best schools ?
And this parent didnt seem to be dreaming .
Earlier in the year , Post reporter Valerie Strauss described appalling conditions at Wilson — conditions which had parents threatening to turn the school into a charter :

Final note on that footage from Wilson .
As Stossel slickly notes - in - passing , this oddball footage occurred after finals . 
In short , this could be footage of the last day of school — a day when normal procedures are often abandoned .
( The students are wearing summer clothing . )
Meanwhile , is  Mr. Reider even a regular teacher ?
Theres no way to tell from this laughable piece .
But so it goes when Stossel plays his own board game — a board game known as  Stupid in America . 
So it goes when the millionaires at ABC News make a joke of American life .
They were castigated by a judge and police at a brief court hearing which was told that their " almost unbelievable " behaviour had turned the lesson of the Good Samaritan on its head .
Ms Lakinski , a 50 - year - old bent by a spine deformity and bullied for most of her life , had also been covered in shaving foam and kicked to " make her wake up " .
During the episode in July , which lasted almost half an hour , none of the group called an ambulance to help Ms Lakinski , who had collapsed while carrying shopping home and hit her head .
Only 20 minutes later , when Anderson , the phone - filmer Simon Whitehead and several others had dressed to go out to a nightclub , was a 999 call finally made .
Paramedics were unable to revive Ms Lakinski , but the call enabled police to trace one of the group , Scott Clement , which led to Anderson 's arrest at a local club within hours .
He admitted outraging public decency and apologised through his barrister at Teesside crown court for actions which he said he still could not explain .
The court heard that Ms Lakinski lived opposite a house in Raby Road which Anderson shared with another man , who had been smoking cannabis and drinking heavily with him all afternoon .
Anderson went out in shorts with a towel round his waist when he saw Ms Lakinski slumped on the pavement .
Sue Jacobs , prosecuting , said Anderson first kicked the helpless woman and when she groaned but failed to move or open her eyes , fetched a bowl of water and threw it over her .
" Apparently urged on by the fact that Scott Clement and Simon Whitehead found this amusing , you then stated that you were going to urinate on her .
Simon Whitehead cleared space on his mobile and recorded Anderson urinating all over Christine 's body . "
One of the group shouted : ' This is YouTube material . ' "
Judge Peter Fox , the recorder of Middlesbrough , told Anderson he had plumbed the depths of degradation and brought shame on the people of Hartlepool .
He said : " This court can do nothing to repair what you did , only pass a sentence that is right in all the circumstances - three years imprisonment . "
Anderson , unemployed after brief army service , has previous convictions for illegally importing cigarettes , obstructing a police officer and driving offences .
Blackwater PR firm aided Chalabi ; Works to polish AT&T's image Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 23 , 2007

The firm that " coached " Blackwater CEO Eric Prince for a Congressional hearing previously represented Iraq intelligence launderer Ahmed Chalabi and is now working with AT&T to repair their image in the wake of their involvement in President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The communications firm BKSH , a subsidiary of public relations giant Burson - Marsteller , is run by a man with extremely close ties to the Bush Administration .
The founder and current head of BKSH is Charlie Black , whose ties with the Bush family go back to 1972 , when he and Karl Rove were jockeying for control of the College Republicans in a campaign so dirty that George H.W. Bush , then head of the Republican National Committee , had to step in and sort matters out .
Black then worked for Ronald Reagan 's and George H.W. Bush 's presidential campaigns from 1976 to 1992 .
He served as an adviser to George W. Bush 's campaigns in 2000 and 2004 and is often quoted in news stories as an unofficial White House spokesman .
BKSH was representing Iraq exile Ahmed Chalabi as early as 1999 and continued doing so until the invasion of Iraq .
An international con-man found guilty in absentia in Jordan for bank scams , Chalabi is most widely known for being one of the key pre-Iraq war intelligence propagandists who supplied skewed information to support the Pentagon 's ultra-secretive Office of Special Plans and the now - discredited pre-war reporting of Judith Miller for the New York Times .
During 2004 , Francis Brooke of the Rendon Group , which had represented Chalabi since the early 90's , was working on contract in Baghdad for BKSH .
Then in the summer and fall of 2005 , Lincoln Group , which had been tasked by the Pentagon with providing pro-US stories to Iraqi media , was subcontracting the work to BKSH , as the same time as BKSH was registered to represent the government of Iraq as its US lobbyist .
Because of Black 's personal ties to the Bush administration , it seems reasonable to wonder whether his lobbying assignments might be selected as much to help his friends there as his nominal clients .
Black is currently working with AT&T in its lobbying campaign to be given retroactive immunity against lawsuits for having assisted the administration in its warrantless wiretapping program .

It 's going to take a generation to move these spineless Democrats out of office .
Unfortunately , that is our only alternative .
You can't vote for a Republican these days and the Democrats make you embarrassed to ever be associated with them .
Jack Goldsmith is one of the most conservative lawyers in the country .
He was the head of the Office of Legal Counsel for George W. Bush .
He is telling you that what the Bush administration did for years in its first term was definitely illegal ( that 's why he demanded changes in their practices when he was at OLC ) and strongly suggesting that what they are doing now might also be illegal .
So , what is the Democratic response ?
They are considering changing the law to make it legal in hindsight .
The equivalent would be if the Republicans tried to pass a law saying it was acceptable to lie under oath after they saw Clinton perjure himself in the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
Could you imagine ?
Of course , not .
Because the Republicans are fighters .
As loathsome as their policies have been for these last six years , at least I respect their willingness to fight for their side .
I also respected President Clinton when he fought back against them , whether it was when Newt Gingrich shut down the government or when they tried to remove him from office .
Read this New York Times article .
The Democrats are going to help Bush break the FISA law .
They are going to change the law so that he does n't have to get a warrant .
They are going to ignore the fourth amendment and current federal laws .
Why would you help the least popular president in history ?
Why would you allow him to keep breaking the law ?
The answer is at the end of the article .
Interest groups that are working closely with the Democrats explain their primary concern - being called weak on terror .
But do n't you see , you are weak !
Miserably weak .
Not because of any actions you might or might not have taken on the war on terror , but because you keep caving into an administration that has no political capital because you do n't have the nerve to fight for your principles .
How is it possible to have any respect for these Democrats ?
Every day , I struggle not to call them cowards and weaklings .
And every day they make it harder .
They are truly pathetic .
I 'm so tired of encouraging them to grow a backbone .
It 's a hopeless struggle .
I give up .
So , we have to pursue a new tack .
The long road of primary fights for the next decade or two until we clear out the losers out of this party .
The people trained and encouraged to lose by their consultants .
Let me tell you a quick story told to me by a former staffer of one of the Democratic leaders .
He said a consultant told this senator that the only way he could lose his senate seat was if he challenged the Republicans in any meaningful way .
His advice was to give in to them on every occasion , and specifically at the time , on the Alito nomination .
This particular senator did not give in on the Alito nomination ( nor did he put up any kind of effective fight , either ) .
But the message from the " Democratic " consultant was clear - you will never be challenged from the left , so always give in to the right .
There is only one way to change that way of thinking .
Challenge them from the left .
Because this group of Democrats is hopeless .
We need a whole new class of leaders .

The state Office of Elections will change how it calculates the number of ballots needed at individual polling places and consider keeping reserve ballots on hand at precincts after an Election Day failure that had 70 polling places on Oahu running short or running out of paper ballots and hundreds of frustrated voters waiting hours to vote .
Chief Election Officer Scott Nago appeared before reporters Wednesday , looking somewhat shaken , and apologized for the problem that caused long lines , hours - long waits and flaring tempers , as people queued up at the single electronic voting machine at each polling place .
" We acknowledge that the wrong amount of ballots were ordered for this election , " Nago said .
" This will not happen again . "
In all , 24 polling places on Oahu ran out of ballots Tuesday .
One on Kauai and two on Hawaii island also ran short .
Officials said the problem did n’t appear to be one of not enough ballots , but not enough ballots in the right places .
Nago said the state determined how many ballots would be needed using the same calculation it has used for years :
The total number of registered voters at each precinct , minus absentee voters , plus 25 percent .
Nago said 274,885 paper ballots were printed for the general election on Oahu , not counting absentee ballots .
In whole numbers that would have been plenty as 160,415 people islandwide voted at a polling place on Tuesday .
But an analysis of voter turnout shows that at the polling sites that ran out of ballots , the number of people casting votes for Hono­lulu mayor was 20 to 50 percent higher than in the primary election .
Precinct officials , voters and observers also say several problems may have contributed to the scope of the voting headaches :
» Reports from polling places that ballots were running low started rolling in around 10 a.m. , but there did n’t appear to be an efficient way of getting reserve ballots from the state Capitol building where they ’re stored , said Beppie Shapiro , president of the League of Women Voters - Hawaii .
Shapiro , who was an election volunteer at the Capitol Tuesday , said throughout the day precinct officials were calling to ask for extra ballots and were being met with little help .
" They were calling repeatedly , with greater desperation , " she said .
» It took hours , in some cases , for extra ballots to arrive at polling sites that had run out .
Mike Gallagher , 61 , who helped run the Kainalu Elementary polling place , said paper ballots ran out at 1 p.m. and reserves took about five hours to arrive .
Gallagher said at one point he even volunteered to go pick up ballots , but was told the ballots would be delivered .
" We were constantly on the phone with headquarters , " he said .
" It should n’t have happened , and the response was totally inappropriate .
They hung everybody out to dry . "
» The call center that precinct officials used to report problems had extraordinarily long waits during the worst of the problems .
Some officials were on hold for 45 minutes to an hour , only to be told someone would call them back .
» At Hokulani Elementary extra ballots arrived , but officials soon realized they were for the wrong precinct .
A few voters apparently used the incorrect ballots , but it ’s unclear if those voters filled out new ballots .
Nago said those ballots would not have been accepted by the electronic reader at the polling place .
» Precinct officials appeared to be trying anything to shorten lines .
Several allowed English speakers to use foreign - language ballots .
But that suggestion was not passed on to other polling places .
Nago said that most polling places that ran out of ballots were able to get replenishments , but those reserves in some cases came late in the evening .
Moanalua
High was the last to get reserves — at 6 p.m .
The last polling place to close was Waimanalo Elementary and Middle School , at 8:45 p.m. , nearly three hours behind schedule .
Some worry that the election problems will reduce voter turnout in Hawaii , which has historically been low .
Overall , voter turnout Tuesday declined from the presidential election four years ago .
About 62 percent of Hawaii registered voters — or about 436,000 people — cast ballots , according to the state Office of Elections , compared with 66 percent in 2008 , or about 456,000 people .
Shapiro said the League of Women Voters plans to ask for a full investigation of the problems , and also wants the Legislature to look at the issue .
She and others suspect that many people got to polling places , saw the long lines and opted to leave without casting a ballot .
" The major concern of the league is of the discouraging effect on people who tried to vote and found the process so inconvenient they gave up , " she said .
" I so fear voters who gave up wo n’t come back . "
Nago said his office will be conducting an internal investigation to figure out what went wrong — and how to prevent it from happening again .
He said the state will have to come up with a better calculation of how many ballots will be needed .
" The bottom line is we miscalculated , " he said .
Nago also noted that this year there was a change to the ballots themselves which did not allow polling places in the same vicinity to share if they ran low .
Instead , each polling place had a unique ballot .
Nago said where reserves are stored might also change , but he noted that the elections office also wants to make sure extra ballots are secured .
Tuesday ’s vote was also the first general election after reapportionment , which takes place every 10 years .
About one - third of voters statewide were assigned a different polling place because of reapportionment , and there were nine fewer polling places statewide compared with 2010 .
The Oahu general election problems dwarf those seen during the primary election in Hawaii County , when 13 precincts opened late .
State election officials took over operations after losing confidence in County Clerk Jamae Kawa­uchi .
But Tuesday , there did n’t appear to be any big problems in Hawaii County .
ICFPC で話題になった rope / cord ですが、特定の言語環境でしか使えないのはもったいない話です。そこで
Ruby の拡張ライブラリとして実装しようとしました。
rope とは 以下の特徴を持った文字列の実装です。 文字列と文字列の結合が速い ( O ( log n ) ) らしい
部分文字列の切り出しが速い ( O( log n ) ) らしい
部分の書き換えはできない
指定位置からの文字の取り出しは遅い ( O( log n ) )
でも一文字ずつ順にたどるのは実用上は O(n ) らしい 詳しい話はいなばさんの解説なり元論文なりを見てください
* 1 。
実装方針 Boehm GC 付属の Cord のコードを Boehm GC なしで動くようにする ( リファレンスカウントを実装する ) 。
Ruby 側のインターフェイスは String 互換 ( ただし破壊的操作と正規表現機能はなし ) ただ、C の文字列 ( ASCIZ ) に特化した機能や最適化が crosscutting concern になっていて手を入れにくすぎたのと、こまごましたスタイルがいろいろと気に入らなかった
( 笑 ) ので、コピペしつつも結局スクラッチから書いた感じです。
だからきっと遅い＆バグだらけ。 あと 、String 互換にする作業はとても面倒くさいので、テストするために必要だった極一部のインターフェイス
* 2 しか作っていません。
動作例 ( とてつもなく不公平な ) 速度比較。 $ time ./ ruby -e ' x = " ab " ; 24. times { x += x } ; p x.size ; p x[x.size / 2 , 10 ] ' 33554432 " ababababab " real 0m2.826s user 0m2.110s sys 0m0.680s $ time ./ ruby - rrope -e ' x = Rope.new ( " ab " ) ; 24.times { x += x } ; p x.size ; p x[x.size / 2 , 10 ] ' 33554432 " ababababab " real 0m0.037s user 0m0.020s sys 0m0.020s 約 78 倍の高速化です ( 笑 )
以下は ICFPC の DNA インタプリタの一部です 。ICFPC のドキュメントを割とそのまま写した感じに書きました。endo.dna を約 5 分半 * 3 で処理します。プロトタイプくらいには使えそうです
( でした ) 。 def replace ( env , tmpl ) prefix = Rope .new ( " " ) tmpl.each do | type , a 1 , a 2 | prefix += case type when : base then a1 when : asnat then asnat ( ( env [ a 1 ] || " " ) .size ) when : protect then protect ( a1 , env [ a2 ] || " " ) end end prefix end
今後の予定 String 互換にしたりバグだししたりしないといけません。が、なんとなく動いた時点で興味が薄れたことと、正規表現が使えない文字列に存在意義があるのか疑わしい気分になったことから、投げ出しそうな気分です。とりあえず絶賛開発中バージョンを以下に投げ捨てておきます。コメントはないし破綻しかけているコードですが、奇特で暇な方が引き継いだり、踏み台にして作り直したりしてくれるとうれしいです。

Political reporter , BBC News , Lib Dem conference
Sir Menzies said Gordon Brown had to defend civil liberties
The party leader accused Labour of " trampling " over freedom of speech and the presumption that suspects are presumed innocent until found guilty .
Sir Menzies urged ministers to respect the terms of the Human Rights
Act when making new laws .
He told delegates in Brighton he was " enraged " by the government .
' Liberty lost '
Sir Menzies called for an independent review of " how much liberty had been lost under Labour " .
The Lib Dems are promoting their opposition to government policies including introducing identity cards and increasing the length of detention without trial for some terror suspects .
Sir Menzies said : " Here in the UK the rights of British citizens have been relentlessly undermined by the most centralising , authoritarian and intrusive government in the post - war era .
These rights are not whimsical or self - indulgent .
They are substantial and necessary
Sir Menzies Campbell
" Freedom of speech , the right to privacy , the principle of innocence until proved guilty , freedom from detention without charge .
" There has been no right too precious , too hard - won or too long - standing for new Labour not to want to trample on it . "
Sir Menzies said the Conservative Party wanted to scrap the Human Rights act , while " shamefully , the government declines to defend it " .
He said : " The Human Rights Act not only complements our traditional liberties ; it guarantees many of them in law too .
" It guarantees the right to a fair trial and to freedom of expression , the right of assembly and association , and freedom of thought , conscience and religion .
" These rights are not whimsical or self - indulgent .
They are substantial and necessary . "
Sir Menzies questioned the UK 's right to " promote human rights if we disparage them here at home " .
He cited Zimbabwe as an example of the erosion of human rights , adding : " That is where the road ends - where human rights are trampled under foot . "
Sir Menzies said Gordon Brown should put the UK " at the forefront of an international campaign to end the tyranny and suffering in Zimbabwe " .
Every time we think we 've had our fill of these , somebody goes and one - ups the competition with a Dell - fueled inferno of doom .
Apparently this one is coming at us from Shanghai , and while we 're not sure what anyone is saying on the forum to which these pictures are posted , we 're guessing a chorus of " sucks to be you ! " and " recalled for a reason " is a solid guess .
Check after the break for a couple more pictures , including the stark beauty of the aftermath .

While researching Classic Computer Science Puzzles , our CEO Scott Stanfield turned me on to A.K. Dewdney 's The New Turing Omnibus : 66 Excursions in Computer Science .
This is an incredibly fun little book .
Sure , it 's got Towers of Hanoi , but it 's also got so much more :
The book is designed to appeal both to the educated layperson and to the student of computer science .
But how is that possible ?
The answer lies in the variety of treatments as well as topics .
Some of the topics are inherently easy or I have been lucky enough to stumble upon just the right expository mechanisms .
Some of the topics are inherently deep or complicated and there is no way around a certain rigor , including occasional mathematical symbolism .
For students of computer science , the 66 chapters that follow will give a sneak preview of the major ideas and techniques they will encounter in their undergraduate careers and some they may only encounter as graduate students .
For professors of computer science , my colleagues , the 66 chapters will amount to a sneak review .
Trying to remember how the Boyer - Moore string - matching algorithm went ?
It 's right there in Chapter 61 , Searching Strings .
As for your lectures , if you like to deliver your own material this book may be what you 've been looking for .
At one end of its spectrum of uses , The ( New ) Turing Omnibus may be ideal in bringing students from diverse backgrounds " up to speed . "
At the other end of the spectrum , you retain creative control but draw a few ( or many ) of your lectures from this book .
Finally , for educated laypersons , the book provides a brief roadmap of computability .
I have no idea why I had n't heard of this book , originally published in 1988 and updated with a second edition in 1993 , until now .
The New Turing Omnibus is is probably the single closest published equivalent to what I do on this very blog .
It 's a grab - bag of computing topics .
Each chapter is the equivalent of a short blog post examining a particular topic , peppered with tables , diagrams , and illustrations .
And the topics are n't presented in any particular order .
Browse and find something you like ; discard the rest .
Here 's a short excerpt from Chapter 33 , Shannon 's Theory - The Elusive Codes :
A complete table of contents for all 66 chapters of The New Turing Omnibus is enumerated at Everything2 .
I think there 's a very high probability that if you enjoy reading this blog on a regular basis , you 'll also enjoy this remarkable little book .
As promised , it 's a great way to keep practicing the fundamentals for professionals :
Bert Bates ( my co-author ) is a blackbelt level go player , one of the best amateur players in the state .
But when a visiting expert -- four belt levels above Bert -- showed up at the local go tournament , Bert was surprised to see the guy reading a book on fundamental go problems that Bert had read much earlier in his learning .
The expert said , " I must have read this at least a hundred times .
My goal each time is to see how much more quickly I can solve all the problems in the book than I did the last time . "
Some of the best athletes never forget the fundamentals -- whether it 's Tiger Woods practicing the basics , or a pro basketball player working on free throws .
A good musician might still practice arpeggios .
A programmer might ...
I do n't know , actually .
What would be the fundamentals that a good programmer might forget ?
I 'll have to think about that one .
But it 's not just a book for programmers ; it 's also got a broad , down - to - earth appeal .
It 's an intriguing collection of thought puzzles for laypeople with at least a passing interest in the field of computer science .
If you 'd like to see more , you can browse through a few pages of the book at Amazon .
A few more pages are available in Google books , but beware the randomly inserted " copyrighted image " placeholder instead of the many illustrations and diagrams throughout the book .

When most people imagine a scientist , they see a skinny , pasty white nerd , with thick glasses , no sense of fashion and an absent - minded , self - effacing personality .
But many scientist are just the opposite .
This is a list of the 6 most badass scientists that clash with this stereotype .
1 - Craig Venter : Craig Venter kicks ass .
Born in a military family , he was more known for his unruly behavior and his propensity to get in trouble than for his smarts .
Yet he still boasted a 142 IQ .
At 18 he dropped out of high school to become a surfer and a beach bum .
He then served in Vietnam , where he performed the triage of wounded soldiers .
It is probably there that he became Darth Venter , hatching his plan for world domination .
It is said that he fought 300 Vietcongs with his abs alone .
When he returned to America he got a BA and a PhD in 5 years .
He set his sights on sequencing genomes , and decided to fly solo .
Not only did he manage to sequence the first entire genome of an organism ( ) , but he did n't stop there and decided to tackle the human genome head - on with a company , for which he raised $ 1B in a single day on wall street .
The man has a gigantic ego , collects boats , and hangs out with celebrities .
He is also a gigantic pompous prick .
So having sequenced his own genome , he spends his time sailing around the world collecting microbial DNA , and dominating the field of synthetic biology where he plans to build the first trillion dollar organism that can pump oil and print money .
But you gotta give it to him , he is pretty badass .
2 - Feynman : Half - genius half - buffoon , Feynman is in a league of is own .
He helped build the first atomic bomb , laid the foundations of quantum mechanics and received a nobel prize for quantum electrodynamics theory .
But Feynman was a free spirit , trying marijuana , ketamine , lsd , sensory deprivation .
He was also a notorious womanizer , who famously would convince girls at bars to buy his drinks .
On his spare time , he liked to break safes , decode Mayan hieroglyphics , and party in the streets of Rio. 3 - Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov : Somehow this scientist is not as well known has he should be .
Sakharov was a thermonuclear physicist , and the father of the Russian Hydrogen bomb .
After giving the H bomb to Stalin he realized that giving that much power to politicians was foolish , because they would be crazy enough to actually use it .
He became a loud opponent of the regime and strongly criticized the way political prisoners were being treated .
Not only was he a brilliant scientist but he also had the balls to oppose the regime at a time when even the suspicion of being an activist would get you killed .
He did n't stop there either , he continued to oppose Nikita Khrushchev despite being offered brides , being threatened and denied food .
He was basically under house arrest , constantly guarded by KGB agents , and was n't able to go out to receive his Nobel peace prize .
Gorbachev finally freed him in 1986 , and he would die 3 years later .
4 - Dr. Duncan Steel : His name is Dr. Steel .
That would be enough right there .
But he also has an asteroid and a robot ( in an Arthur C. Clarke novel ) named after him .
He even introduced the Sex Pistols to their first gig !
Not only is he a very successful scientist who has worked for NASA and ESA , but he was also part of the Near - Earth Object Interception and Deflection committee .
That 's right , next to him , Bruce Willis would probably grow ovaries .
5- MC Hawking :
He is a badass cyborg , who rules the streets with an iron fist and does occasional drive - by's in his wheelchair .
Honestly the man is only able to wink , yet has been collecting trophy wives .
I should really practice my winking .
6- Meredith Charles Gourdine :
He was a blind rocket scientist , with 70 patents and a silver medal at the olympics .
Not bad I guess ...
Deep inside Toyota ’s car factory in Georgetown , Kentucky , is the paint shop , where naked steel car bodies arrive to receive layers of coatings and colors before returning to the assembly line to have their interiors and engines installed .
Every day , 2,000 Camrys , Avalons , and Solaras glide in to be painted one of a dozen colors by carefully programmed robots .

Georgetown ’s paint shop is vast and crowded , but in two places there are wide areas of open concrete floor , each the size of a basketball court .
The story of how that floor space came to be cleared–tons of equipment dismantled and removed –is really the story of how Toyota has reshaped the U.S. car market .
It ’s the story of Toyota ’s genius : an insatiable competitiveness that would seem un -American were it not for all the Americans making it happen .
Toyota ’s competitiveness is quiet , internal , self - critical .
It is rooted in an institutional obsession with improvement that Toyota manages to instill in each one of its workers , a pervasive lack of complacency with whatever was accomplished yesterday .
The result is a startling contrast to the car business .
At a time when the traditional Big Three are struggling , Toyota is thriving .
Just this year , Ford and GM have terminated 46,000 North American employees .
Together , they have announced the closing of 26 North American factories over the next five years .
Toyota has never closed a North American factory ; it will open a new one in Texas this fall and another in Ontario in 2008 .
Detroit is n’t being bested by imports : 60 % of the cars Toyota sells in North America are made here .
Toyota does n’t have corporate convulsions , and it never has .
It restructures a little bit every work shift .
That ’s what the open space in the Georgetown paint shop is all about .
Chad Buckner helped clear the space .
Buckner , 35 , has a soft Southern accent and an air of helpfulness .
He is an engineering manager in the painting department , where he arrived straight out of the University of Kentucky 13 years ago .
His whole career has been spent at Toyota .
As recently as 2004 , a car body spent 10 hours in painting .
Robots did much of the work , then as now , but they were supplied with paint through long hoses from storage tanks .
“ If we were painting a car red , before we could paint the next car white , we had to stop , flush the red paint out of the lines and the applicator tip , and reload the next color , ” Buckner says .
Georgetown literally threw away 30 % of the pricey car paint it bought , cleaning it out of equipment and supply hoses when switching colors .

Now , each painting robot , eight per car , selects a paint cylinder the size of a large water bottle .
A whirling disk at the end of the robot arm flings out a mist of top - coat paint .
When a car is painted –it takes just seconds –the paint cartridge is set back down , and a freshly filled cartridge is selected by each robot .
No hoses need to be flushed .
There is no cleaning between cars .
All the paint is in the cartridges , which are refilled automatically from reservoirs .
Cars do n’t need to be batched by color–a system that saved paint but caused constant delays .
Cars now spend 8 hours in paint , instead of 10 .
The paint shop at any moment holds 25 % fewer cars than it used to .
Wasted paint ?
Practically zero .
What used to require 100 gallons now takes 70 .
The benefits ripple out .
Not only does Georgetown use less paint , it also buys less cleaning solvent and has dramatically reduced disposal costs for both .
Together with new programming to make the robots paint more quickly , Buckner ’s group has increased the efficiency of its car - wash - sized paint booths from 33 cars an hour to 50 .
“ We ’re getting the same volume with two booths that we used to get with three , ” Buckner says .
“ So we shut down one of the booths . ”
If you want to trim your energy bill , try unplugging an oven big enough to bake 25 cars .
Workers dismantled Top Coat Booth C , leaving the open floor space available for some future task .
So what do Buckner and his crew do with a triumphant operational improvement like that ?
By way of an answer , he walks to the second area of open space , where the sealer - application robots used to sit .
They ’ve been consolidated , too .
Buckner points to another undercoating booth that the engineering staff is now working to eliminate .
Indeed , shutting down Top Coat Booth C liberated a handful of maintenance engineers –who turned their attention to accelerating the next round of changes .
Success , in that way , becomes the platform for further improvement .
By the end of this year , Buckner and his team hope to have cut almost in half the amount of floor space the paint shop needs–all while continuing to paint 2,000 cars a day .

Even at home , constant improvement is the rule : “ When I ’m mowing the grass , I ’m trying different turns to see if I can do it faster . ”
– Howard Artrip , Assembly Manager For Buckner , the paint - shop improvements are n’t “ projects ” or “ initiatives . ”
They are the work , his work , every day , every week .
That ’s one of the subtle but distinctive characteristics of a Toyota factory .
The supervisors and managers are n’t “ bosses ” in any traditional American sense .
Their job is to find ways to do the work better : more efficiently , more effectively .
“ We ’re all incredibly proud of what we ’ve accomplished , ” says Buckner , a little puzzled that his attitude might be considered unusual .
“ But you do n’t stop .
You do n’t stop .
There ’s no reason to be satisfied . ”
The Process Process
What is so striking about Toyota ’s Georgetown factory is , in fact , that it only looks like a car factory .
It ’s really a big brain–a kind of laboratory focused on a single mission : not how to make cars , but how to make cars better .
The cars it does make–one every 27 seconds–are in a sense just a by - product of the larger mission .
Better cars , sure ; but really , better ways to make cars .
It ’s not just the product , it ’s the process .
The process is , in fact , paramount–so important that “ Toyota also has a process for teaching you how to improve the process , ” says Steven J. Spear , a senior lecturer at MIT who has studied Toyota for more than a decade .
The work is really threefold : making cars , making cars better , and teaching everyone how to make cars better .
At its Olympian best , Toyota adds one more level :
It is always looking to improve the process by which it improves all the other processes .
There ’s a certain Zen sensibility to that –but also a relentlessly capitalistic , tenaciously competitive quality .
If your factory is just making cars , once a day the whistle blows and it ’s quitting time , no more cars to make that day .
If your factory is making a new way to make cars , the whistle never blows , you ’re never done .
Without fanfare , in fact , Toyota is confounding conventional wisdom about U.S. manufacturing .
Toyota is n’t outsourcing ; it ’s creating jobs in the United States .
It is n’t having trouble manufacturing complicated products here–it ’s opening factories as quickly as its systems and quality standards allow .
It ’s offering union wages and good health insurance ( to avoid being unionized ) , and selling the products its American workers make to Americans , profitably and more inexpensively than its U.S. competitors .
advertisement
So put aside everything you think you know about the current state of the car business in the United States .
Sure , Toyota enjoys some structural advantages in the form of lower health care and pension costs .
But the real reason it is thriving is because of people like Chad Buckner saying , “ There ’s no reason to be satisfied . ”
It ’s not just the way Toyota makes cars–it ’s the way Toyota thinks about making cars .
That thinking is hardly novel : Lean manufacturing and continuous improvement have been around for more than a quarter - century .
But the incessant , almost mindless repetition of those phrases camouflages the real power behind the ideas .
Continuous improvement is tectonic .
By constantly questioning how you do things , by constantly tweaking , you do n’t outflank your competition next quarter .
You outflank them next decade .
Toyota is far from infallible , of course .
In the past two years , recalls for quality and safety problems have spiked dramatically –evidence of the strain that rapid growth puts on even the best systems .
But those quality issues have seized the attention of Toyota ’s senior management .
In the larger arena , when the strategy is n’t to build cars but to build cars better , you create perpetual competitive advantage .
By the time you best your competitors , they are n’t just a bit behind you , in need of a reorganization and a sales surge to regain the lead .
They are a decade behind .
They just do n’t realize it .
The Story Of The Totes The Toyota factory in Georgetown sits on a piece of green ground as flat as a table .
The factory itself is low , yet so large it stretches to the horizon , no matter what side you approach it from .
There ’s space inside to play 100 football games , with room for fans on the sidelines .
A network of heavily trafficked streets runs through the place , with travel lanes in each direction .
Cars are the most complicated objects most people use routinely ; to watch cars get made is to pull back the curtain on raw human ingenuity .
At Georgetown , that ingenuity often appears in unexpected , and unexpectedly simple , ways .
Howard Artrip , 45 , is standing at the assembly line alongside a rack of blue plastic totes filled with sun visors and seat belts .
Just beyond Artrip and the rack of totes , a line of Camrys and Avalons pass by , freshly painted but hollow–no engines , no dashboards , no seats .
advertisement
Artrip , a manager in the assembly area , is telling the story of how the totes–ordinary Rubbermaid carryalls –solved a decision - making problem .
“ There used to be eight racks of parts here , ” he says .
The racks crowded the workstation , giving the worker ready access to all possible parts .
The operator would eyeball the car coming up the line , step to the racks of visors and seat belts , and , says Artrip , “ grab the right parts and run to the car . ”
He or she would step into the slowly advancing car , bolt belts and visors in place , step back onto the factory floor–and do it again .
All in 55 seconds , the unvarying time each slowly moving car spends at each workstation .
The problem was , there were 12 possible combinations of sun visors and nine variations of seat belts .
So just deciding which parts to snatch had become a job in itself .
In every shift , 500 cars passed the racks , each car needing four specific parts : 2,000 opportunities to make an error .
Even with 99 % perfection , five cars per shift got the wrong sun visors or seat belts .
The job–installing parts–had become cluttered with meaningless decision making .
So a team of assembly employees made a real decision .
Do n’t make the worker pick the parts ; let him focus on installing them .
The idea seems obvious in retrospect : Deliver a kit of presorted visors and seat belts–one kit per car , each containing exactly the right parts .
The team applied the simplest technology available , the blue Rubbermaid caddy .
“ We went just down the road to Wal - Mart and bought them , ” Artrip says .
Now , the line worker does n’t have to make any decisions at all .
Just grab the handle of the blue tote like a lunch pail and step into the car .
Media accounts often report that a typical Toyota assembly line in the United States makes thousands of operational changes in the course of a single year .
That number is not just large , it ’s arresting , it ’s mind - boggling .
How much have you changed your work routine in the past decade ?
Toyota ’s line employees change the way they work dozens of times a year .
In the case of the blue tote , the change came out of a routine analysis of dozens of assembly - line jobs at Georgetown .
When the simplification effort started three years ago , Artrip ’s team found 44 jobs where assemblers had to make 1 or 2 decisions as they installed parts .
They found 23 workstations that required between 7 and 11 decisions .
Any jobs requiring 7 to 11 decisions in 55 seconds were going to cause problems .
So dozens of jobs incurred small changes–grab the blue tote instead of choosing individual parts .
Now , 85 line jobs require just 1 or 2 decisions .
Not a single job requires 7 or more decisions .
The work is easier , the results are better .
advertisement
This is exactly the kind of work Artrip has spent more than half his career at Toyota doing : looking for ways to make the assembly line faster , simpler , safer–ways to make it easier to do the work perfectly .
Continuous improvement is not some add - on to the real work , it is n’t some special project Artrip has to do on top of his routine responsibilities , nor is he a guy who parachutes into the assembly line from an engineering building somewhere else .
It is what he comes to the factory every day thinking about .
It is n’t exhausting , it ’s exhilarating .
Artrip has been at Georgetown for 19 years .
The way he does his work is so compelling it has become part of his personal life .
“ When I ’m mowing the grass , I ’m thinking about the best way to do it .
I ’m trying different turns to see if I can do it faster , ” he says .
He has analyzed his morning routine .
“ I do the same standardized work in the shower every morning .
I have to get here at 6 a.m. , and I know it takes 19 minutes , including walking into the plant . ”
He smiles .
“ I ’ve maximized my sleep time . ” Problems First James Wiseman remembers the moment he realized that Toyota was n’t just another workplace but a different way of thinking about work .
Before joining the company , he had been a factory manager , first for a swimsuit maker , then for a steel - tubing manufacturer .
He joined Toyota ’s still - new Georgetown plant in October 1989 as manager of community relations .
Today , he ’s vice president of corporate affairs for all of Toyota manufacturing in North America .
At the swimsuit factory and the tube factory , “ there was always a lot of looking for the silver bullet , ” Wiseman says , “ looking for the big , dramatic improvement .
And I had the attitude that when you achieved something , you achieved it .
You enjoyed it . ”
He was steeped in the American business culture of not admitting , or even discussing , problems in settings like meetings .
In Wiseman ’s early days , Georgetown was run by Fujio Cho , now the chairman of Toyota worldwide .
Every Friday , there was a senior staff meeting .
“ I started out going in there and reporting some of my little successes , ” says Wiseman .
“ One Friday , I gave a report of an activity we ’d been doing ” –planning the announcement of a plant expansion – “ and I spoke very positively about it , I bragged a little .
After two or three minutes , I sat down .
“ And Mr. Cho kind of looked at me .
I could see he was puzzled .
He said , ‘ Jim - san .
We all know you are a good manager , otherwise we would not have hired you .
But please talk to us about your problems so we can all work on them together . ' ”
advertisement
Wiseman says it was like a lightning bolt .
“ Even with projects that had been a general success , we would ask , ‘ What did n’t go well so we can make it better ? ' ”
At Toyota , Wiseman says , “ I have come to understand what they mean when I hear the phrase , ‘ Problems first . ' ”
It ’s another cliché that is powerful if you take it seriously :
You ca n’t solve problems unless you admit them .
At Toyota , there is a presumption of imperfection .
Perfection is a fine goal , but improvement is much more realistic , much more human .
Not a 15 % improvement by the end of the quarter , a 1 % improvement by the end of the month .
The challenge , of course , is to make the rhetoric real , to make the presumption of imperfection integral to how people think and work .
Pete Gritton knows better than most how that happens ; he and his staff have hired all the Kentuckians who work at Toyota Georgetown .
He ’s vice president of HR and administration for Georgetown , and vice president of HR for Toyota manufacturing in North America .
“ We want people to be problem solvers , ” Gritton says .
“ Because every time there ’s a problem , we do n’t send out some guy in a white shirt with a clipboard . ”
New hires – 10 % of job applicants make it through screening tests that include a team - building exercise–are immersed in Toyota ’s process for process improvement .
There are daily work - group meetings , a written suggestion program , and longer - term problem - solving teams .
But everything is grounded in two hard realities .
First , of course , “ we have to make 2,000 cars a day .
We ca n’t vote about how to make each one , ” Gritton says .
“ We ca n’t stop every few minutes and change the process . ”
And then there is the most basic rule , the reason “ continuous improvement ” is not a matter of character or national culture or willpower , but is itself a kind of assembly line .
“ The rule here is that improving something starts after understanding the standard –understanding how we do it now , ” Gritton says .
“ If you do n’t understand what you ’re trying to improve , how do you know that your suggestion is an improvement ? ”
No one at Toyota Georgetown can talk about his work without explaining how it has just changed , or is about to change .
Chris Gentry , a supervisor for instrument - panel assembly , is showing how his area is about to be redesigned .
It was set up just this year to handle the 2007 Camry–but after working with it for most of a year , workers now see inefficiencies .
Some work will be moved back to an area where kits are assembled ; some movement of parts can be off - loaded to seven newly built transport robots .
Two jobs will be eliminated and the workers redeployed elsewhere ; 18 seconds can be shaved from the assembly process .
advertisement
“ We set it up for the model change , ” says Gentry .
“ Now we ’ll fix it .
We standardized it , now we ’re improving it . ”
It ’s not the instrument panel–it ’s the way you make the instrument panel .
In the 2007 Camry , there is a tiny change that drivers wo n’t notice .
The Camry ’s radiator support bar–a brace of steel running across the lower front of the engine compartment–is n’t installed when the body is first made .
It used to be , but it blocked access to the engine compartment .
Workers had to stretch and lean in to install engine wiring and components .
With the bar ’s installation held out until near the end of assembly , workers simply step into the engine compartment and get right up close to their work .
That idea ricocheted from the plant floor in Georgetown , up to Toyota ’s design team , and then out to Camry assembly plants around the world .
Once you see how woven into the work improving the work is , each particular improvement seem less interesting .
What ’s interesting is to compare how they think about work at Georgetown with everywhere else .
How come the checkout lines at Wal - Mart never get shorter ?
How come the customer service of your cell - phone company never improves , year after year ?
How come my PC gets harder to operate with each software upgrade ?
How come I do n’t know how many minutes it takes me to get from my doorstep to my office , so I can maximize my sleep ?
It ’s almost as if Toyota people see the world with special four - dimensional glasses ; the rest of us are stuck in 2 - D. In The End , There Is No End Lots of companies have tried to learn and use the methods that Toyota has refined into a routine , a science , a way of being and thinking .
Not least among those are … GM , Ford , and Chrysler .
For more than 20 years , in fact , Toyota and GM have operated a car factory together in California –the NUMMI project–that has allowed GM to study Toyota ’s methods up close .
And the Big Three have each gotten better at making cars :
In the past decade , GM and Chrysler have cut by one - third the hours they need to assemble a car .
But they all still trail Toyota .
No one knows that better than GM .
“ We ’ve made a whole lot of progress , ” says Dan Flores , a spokesman for GM ’s North American manufacturing operations –much of it by learning directly from Toyota .
“ Transforming a company the size of GM is a daunting task .
The culture of the plants does n’t change overnight .
But there has been a cultural change in the company–and that change continues . ”
advertisement
Without any fanfare at all , Toyota is confounding , if not defying , conventional wisdom about the current state of the U.S. economy .
Typically , though , the Big Three take an all - too - American approach to the idea of improvement .
It ’s episodic , it ’s goal - oriented , it ’s something special–it ’s a pale imitation of the approach at Georgetown .
“ If you go to the Big Three , you ’d find improvement projects just like you ’d find at Georgetown , ” says Jeffrey Liker , a professor of engineering at the University of Michigan and author of The Toyota Way , a classic exploration of Toyota ’s methods .
“ But they would be led by some kind of engineering group , or a Six Sigma black belt , or a lean - manufacturing guru of some kind .
“ They might even do as good a job as they did at Georgetown .
But here ’s the thing .
Then they ’d turn that project into a PowerPoint .
They ’d present it at every place in the whole company .
They ’d say , ‘ Look what we did ! ’
In a year , that happens a couple of times in a whole plant for the Big Three .
And it would get all kinds of publicity in the company .
“ Toyota , ” Liker says , “ is doing it in every single department , every single day .
They ’re doing it on their own ” –no black belts – “ and they ’re doing it regularly , not just once . ”
So you can buy the books , you can hire the consultants , you can implement the program , you can preach business transformation–and you can eventually run out of energy , lose enthusiasm , be puzzled over why the program failed to catch fire and transform your business , put the fat binders on a conference - room shelf , and go back to business as usual .
What happens every day at Georgetown , and throughout Toyota , is teachable and learnable .
But it ’s not a set of goals , because goals mean there ’s a finish line , and there is no finish line .
It ’s not something you can implement , because it ’s not a checklist of improvements .
It ’s a way of looking at the world .
You simply can’t lose interest in it , shrug , and give up–any more than you can lose interest in your own future .
“ People who join Toyota from other companies , it ’s a big shift for them , ” says John Shook , a faculty member at the University of Michigan , a former Toyota manufacturing employee and a widely regarded consultant on how to use Toyota ’s ideas at other companies .
“ They kind of do n’t get it for a while . ”
They do what all American managers do–they keep trying to make their management objectives .
“ They ’re moving forward , they ’re improving , and they ’re looking for a plateau .
As long as you ’re looking for that plateau , it seems like a constant struggle .
It ’s difficult .
If you ’re looking for a plateau , you ’re going to be frustrated .
There is no ‘ solution . ' ”
advertisement
Even working at Toyota , you need that moment of Zen .
“ Once you realize that it ’s the process itself –that you ’re not seeking a plateau–you can relax .
Doing the task and doing the task better become one and the same thing , ” Shook says .
“ This is what it means to come to work . ”

Grassroots gaming : College kids playing Halo ' 12/7 ' for Ron Paul Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday October 30 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Gamers say Paul seems like the only candidate who has ' read the Constitution '
It may not end up matching the haul of a thousand - dollar - a - plate dinner , but a new fundraising event on behalf of GOP presidential hopeful Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) is a lot easier to dress for : it 's three college kids playing a video game .
In one of this campaign season 's more creative grassroots efforts , students from an undisclosed southeastern university have committed to playing the massively popular Halo 3 video game for 12 hours a day , seven days a week -- " 12/7 " they brag -- and are broadcasting their marathon sessions live on the internet .
Visitors tuning in to watch the multiplayer carnage , a number now surpassing 35,000 people according to a counter on the players ' website , are encouraged to make a donation to Ron Paul 's campaign .
One of the Halo - playing crew , a gamer calling himself " J " who insists on anonymity for he and his cohorts , told RAW STORY that Paul was the only presidential contender in the bunch worth backing .
" He just seems like the only candidate who supports the Constitution -- like the only one who has actually read the Constitution , " said J , who is balancing his long hours of Halo with a part - time job .
Also sharing the workload during the long , noon - to - midnight span are fellow students Danielle , who also holds down a job as a health technician , and Mike , who " does n't work , " says an envious J. Battling away on a wide - screen TV in an off - campus apartment , the group has attracted a core group of watchers online who critique their play in an accompanying chat room and frequently become challengers themselves .
The game , the third installment of the Halo series , allows a combination of multiple players to link up via an internet connection to fight in a vast , futuristic world of fantastic weaponry and fierce alien invaders .
" It is kind of crazy , three people dedicating 12 hours a day to Halo , " J acknowledged .
" We try to entertain ourselves with alcohol . "
Although his candidacy is n't notching big - time numbers in national polls , the libertarian - leaning Paul has managed to parlay near - fanatical internet support for his campaign into some legitimate fundraising muscle -- $ 5 million in the third quarter of 2007 alone .
That figure puts him just behind Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) and ahead of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee in total money raised for the same time period .
" It seems like people voting for the first or second time in their lives are just excited about him , " J said , adding that he thought the natural audience for watching a Halo webcast would be full of potential Paul supporters .
" We figured teenagers , you know , 20 somethings would be interested . "
It 's too early to tell if the video game fundraiser will translate into significant real - world dollars for the Paul campaign , but the plan is creating a buzz among fans of a game that boasts 1.2 million players online .
' The negative people have been mainly Hillary supporters ' J says response from visitors to the site , the majority of whom seem to be lured in for pure gaming reasons rather than any real political interest in Paul , has been largely positive .
" Some people have been like , ' what 's a Ron Paul ? ' " he reports .
" The negative people have been mainly Hillary supporters . "
Although it 's clear the students have some other interests at heart in their endeavor beyond supporting a political candidate -- they 're also soliciting donations for a high definition TV tuner so viewers can watch a " perfect stream of game play " -- the gang plans to keep making good on its " twelve hour promise " to Paul for at least a few more weeks .
And the current fundraising plan could just be the beginning , according to J , who envisions a day when Congressman Paul himself could fire up an Xbox console and tear around in Halo 's sprawling digital universe .
" We could set it up like a charity event : us vs. Ron Paul , " he said , adding that possibility had been kicking around in the site 's chat room .
" People could pledge $ 10 for every kill Ron Paul makes . "
But Paul communications director Jesse Benton politely side - stepped the invitation Tuesday , telling RAW STORY that the candidate would need far too much practice time .
" I 'd be surprised if Ron has ever picked up a joystick , " Benton said .
" So I 'm not sure there would really be any kind of match there .
And it sounds like these guys are really good . "
Correction :
The first edition of this article incorrectly stated Ron Paul 's party .
He is a Republican .

EUGENE --
It 's unusual for foreigners who come to the United States for a vacation to be refused entry .
But Abdel Kader Laaredj is one of them .
And his family says they would like to know why .
Laaredj - Campbell , his wife -- who is a U.S. citizens -- and their two children flew into Portland from their home in Germany last month .
At the airport , U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials separated Abdel Kader Laaredj from his family , questioned him for hours , put him in a jail cell and then sent him back to Germany the next day , the Eugene Register - Guard reported .
" It shook our whole family , " said Anne Laaredj - Campbell , who is in Eugene now staying with her parents .
The trouble began the morning of June 13 , when the family got off their Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Portland .
They were planning to visit Laaredj - Campbell 's parents in Eugene , where Laaredj - Campbell grew up .
Laaredj - Campbell , a graduate of the University of Oregon , has U.S. and German citizenship because her mother is a German immigrant .
Her husband , an independent businessman who sells and buys cars and construction supplies , was born in Algeria and later immigrated to Germany where he became a German citizen .
The two fell in love while she was a graduate student at Freiburg University .
They had come to Oregon before , but that was in the summer of 2001 before the terrorist attacks and closer scrutiny of visitors at the nation 's ports of entry .
She and the couple 's two sons traveled on their U.S. passports .
Laaredj traveled on his German passport and a visa waiver , a process that allows people with machine - readable passports to enter the United States without a visa .
The visa waiver is used by those traveling for business or recreation who plan to stay less than 90 days .
The United States allows people from 27 nations to use visa waivers .
All they need to do is bring proof that they have no intention of immigrating .
The couple brought several documents , but they did n't help Laaredj .
When the couple arrived at customs in the Portland airport , he was taken to a room and asked questions about his family in Algeria as well as his marriage , his wife said .
He was handcuffed and taken to a jail where he spent a night in a tiny cell where the light stayed on for the duration and he was not allowed a phone call , she said .
The next day , he was put on a return flight to Germany without being permitted to see his wife .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection are prohibited from talking about individual cases , senior spokesman Bob Anthony said .
Generally , he said , people are deemed inadmissible for a variety of reasons .
They may be considered potential terrorists , they may be felons in another country , but with no international warrant , which means they can't be held in the United States .
It may be simply that their paperwork is not in order .
Laaredj - Campbell described her husband as a practicing Muslim who goes to prayer services at a mosque in their home in Freiburg .
He opposes terrorism and is not involved in political causes , she said .
But one of the mosques he attended was raided in the months after Sept. 11 .

TxDOT knows where you went and wants the why It hired a firm to film plates , send surveys — a move some call sneaky
AUSTIN — Did you drive on Interstate 35 in early September ?
Where were you going , and why ?
How many people were in the car with you ?
And by the way , how many people live in your house ?
The Texas Department of Transportation wants to know , and a company it hired may have videotaped your license plate , then sent you a survey to find out .
The survey is being done in the name of sound transportation planning .
Officials say the method has been used before in Texas and elsewhere .
But it has some feeling uncomfortable , and others crying , " Big Brother . "
Alliance Transportation Group Inc. , under a $ 781,588.53 contract with the state , mailed about 150,000 surveys to homes containing an explanation startling to some : " You are being asked to participate in these efforts because the license plate of a vehicle registered in ( your ) name was randomly recorded " during a highway trip .
" It almost feels sneaky , " said Alison Unger , an Austin communications professional who got the survey after traveling to San Antonio for Rosh Hashana .
Unger has no ill will toward TxDOT but is concerned about whether her personal information will be protected .
She said she likely would n't answer the survey .
Some were outraged about the survey after being videotaped by cameras tucked into orange barrels at 21 locations outside metro areas on I - 35 and nearby highways from north of Laredo , through the San Antonio area to north of Dallas , some 450 miles .
Similar surveys are expected next year in the Houston , Galveston , Beaumont and Port Arthur areas , although with changes incorporated to reflect concerns expressed by drivers .
" This is Big Brother - ish , " said Sal Costello , a fierce critic of TxDOT who founded a Web site — TexasTollParty.com — to fight the way toll roads were planned by the agency .
" It is an invasion of privacy . "
Jim Harrington , director of the Texas Civil Rights Project , said , " It 's one thing to study traffic patterns , but to ask all this personal information of people makes you wonder why they are doing it .
...
This is more than Orwell ever imagined . "
TxDOT spokeswoman Gaby Garcia said the information wo n't be shared or sold and will be disposed of in a secure fashion .
This is the first time the state has conducted a comprehensive transportation survey on the entire I - 35 corridor , and the information is vital to planning , she said .
" With the heavy traffic demand already on I - 35 , one of the state 's busiest interstate corridors , this survey will help us better forecast future demand and needed improvements , " Garcia said .
She said the survey is voluntary and that people do n't have to participate or answer all the questions .
Since the survey was mailed about three weeks ago after the Sept. 12-13 license - plate videotaping , about 3,000 people have responded , she said .
About 200 have called a toll - free number included with the survey , with most asking about its purpose and " a few callers unhappy that they received a survey , " she said .
Rep. Lois Kolkhorst , a Brenham Republican who has worked to stem TxDOT 's drive toward privately run toll roads , said something else caught her eye .
" With TxDOT continuing to spill forth that they have no money to build highways , I find it very interesting they have a lot of money to do mailings to 150,000 people and ad campaigns of $ 8 ( million ) and $ 9 million , " she said .
Civil engineering professor Chandra Bhat , of the University of Texas at Austin 's Center for Transportation Research , said such surveys have been used in many states .
The downside with a survey based on videotaping license plates , Bhat said , is that the data quality may not be as good and there can be a negative public perception : " Uncle Sam sneaking up , essentially . "
Garcia said the agency plans to let drivers know of the survey beforehand the next time : " It was by no means meant to be sneaky , " Garcia said .
" Lesson learned . "

There have been some very encouraging developments regarding the Fair Tax movement .
Brad Warbiany noted in this post that much of Mike Huckabee ’s second place showing in the Iowa Straw Poll can be attributed to his support of the Fair Tax .
The Americans for Fair Taxation group had a very large presence in Iowa but did not endorse any candidate in - particular .
While the Mitt Romney first place campaign bused in supporters and paid their $ 35 voting fee , the Americans for Fair Taxation did not pay the fee for their members to vote for candidates who support the Fair Tax but apparently still were a major factor in Huckabee ’s second place showing .
It seems that the other candidates have taken notice to the grass roots support for the Fair Tax as well .
In my previous post , I had listed Ron Paul , Duncan Hunter , and Sam Brownback as “ considering other tax reform ” ( read : on the fence ) and Mitt Romney , Rudy Giuliani , and John McCain among those opposed to the Fair Tax .
Since writing that post , I found the updated scorecard for the presidential candidates which show that some have changed position and others I misread their position ( Duncan Hunter is a co-sponsor of the legislation , not on the fence ) .
While Huckabee is perhaps the most vocal proponent of the Fair Tax , Ron Paul , John Cox , Tom Tancredo , potential G.O.P candidate Fred Thompson and Mike Gravel ( the only Democrat candidate who supports the Fair Tax ) either endorse the Fair Tax or have stated would sign it into law if passed by congress .
Even John McCain who has been on record as being opposed to the Fair Tax has apparently done a 180 to jump on board with the Fair Tax ( a last ditch effort to save his campaign perhaps ? ) .
By my count , that ’s 8 candidates who now support the Fair Tax !
Unfortunately , none of these candidates are considered ‘ top tier ’ at this point .
Rudy Giuliani , Mitt Romney , Sam Brownback , and the entire Democrat field ( except for Gravel ) are opposed to this bold legislation .
But who knows , if John McCain and some of the fence sitters could be convinced that the Fair Tax could be a winning issue , maybe some of these other candidates will also see the light .
There is still plenty of time between now and Super Tuesday for them to get the message if the momentum continues to build .

Saguaro Moon
Credit & Copyright : Stefan Seip ( Astro Meeting )
Explanation : A Full Moon rising can be a dramatic celestial sight , and Full Moons can have many names .
For example , tonight 's Full Moon , the one nearest the autumnal equinox in the northern hemisphere , is popularly called the Harvest Moon .
According to lore the name is a fitting one because farmers could work late into the night at the end of the growing season harvesting crops by moonlight .
In the same traditions , the Full Moon following the Harvest Moon is the Hunter 's Moon .
But , recorded on a trip to the American southwest , this contribution to compelling images of moonrise is appropriately titled Saguaro Moon .
California law may require websites to be accessible to disabled internet users , according to a ruling in a case against retail giant Target .
Despite recent improvements to the accessibility of Target.com , the case has now been certified as a class action .
Target was sued by the National Federation of the Blind ( NFB ) and one of its blind members , Bruce Sexton , under a federal law , the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) , and also under two state laws , the California Disabled Persons Act and the California Unruh Civil Rights Act .
The NFB and Sexton argue that Target.com is not accessible to blind internet users , in breach of these federal and state laws .
They complained that images on the site were missing alternative text upon which blind users rely ; keyboard controls do not work , meaning users must be able to work a mouse ; and headings are missing that are needed for navigation .
US District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in the Court for the Northern District of California had previously ruled that the inaccessibility of Target.com impeded full and equal enjoyment of goods and services offered in Target stores pursuant to the ADA .
She has now ruled that the case is eligible for class action status and she rejected an effort by Target to have the case thrown out .
The President of the NFB , Dr Marc Maurer , said last week : “ This is a tremendous step forward for blind people throughout the country who for too long have been denied equal access to the Internet economy .
All e-commerce businesses should take note of this decision and immediately take steps to open their doors to the blind . ”
Key questions in the lawsuit remain to be resolved , though .
A UK lawyer said that these will be vital in determining the ruling 's impact on other businesses in the US .
Improvements at Target.com
Since the case began , Target has made improvements to the site 's accessibility .
Target said that because it had made these changes , the claims against it are now " moot " .
Judge Patel disagreed .
While it was accepted that accessibility had improved , making it " more likely that a blind user could complete a transaction , " according to an expert for the NFB , it was noted that problems remain .
Judge Patel wrote , " even the most favorable understanding of these modifications would suggest that only one aspect of the claims has been fully addressed : keyboard accessibility . "
" Moreover , the continuous addition of new pages to Target.com argues against a finding of mootness , " she wrote .
State laws
Noting that the language of the California state laws is broader than that of the ADA , Judge Patel found that websites should be covered .
" [ The ] Unruh Act and the DPA reach Target.com as a kind of business establishment and an accommodation , advantage , facility and privilege of a place of public accommodation , respectively .
No nexus to the physical stores need be shown , " she said .
The Unruh Act provides that all persons in California are free and equal , and no matter what their disability " are entitled to the full and equal accommodations , advantages , facilities , privileges , or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever . "
The DPA guarantees that individuals with disabilities are entitled to full and equal access to various listed places , " and other places to which the general public is invited " .
Judge Patel defined the class action as eligible to represent " all legally blind individuals in California who have attempted to access Target.com " under the Unruh Act and the DPA .
However , key questions remain on each state law .
Previous cases have suggested that the Unruh Act only applies to intentional discrimination unless the case is premised on an ADA violation .
The NFB contends that disability discrimination is characterised by inaction , arguing that the previous ruling that saw a need to prove intention as inappropriate .
Judge Patel sympathised : " the legislative history of the [ Unruh ]
Act and its subsequent construction tilts in favor of [ the NFB 's ] preferred reading , " she wrote .
But she stopped short of ruling definitively on the need to prove intention or whether that intent existed in this case .
Another key question that remains unanswered is the meaning of " full and equal access " under the DPA in the context of a website .
What that means when setting the applicable standards " is still an open question , " wrote Patel .
e Bay may soon offer online banking .
It would seem .
This afternoon , while fielding questions about PayPal at Santa Clara University conference obsessed with " trust online , " chief information security officer Dave Cullinane seemed to indicate eBay is interested in extending the popular online payment system to its logical conclusion .
" What we 're trying to do is provide a trusted payment system that 's within the community that constitutes eBay Inc. , trying to be all things , but we are n't the bank yet , " he said , before adding " Did I say yet ? "
Cue audience laughter .
But you have to wonder .
Before joining eBay , Cullinane was the CISO at Washington Mutual , one of the largest banks in the US .
Or maybe we 're just having fun .
During his hour - long keynote , Cullinane stuck mostly to generalizations when discussing eBay 's security practices , but he had a few interesting things to say about his time with Washington Mutual .
At one point , he said , the bank spent a month as the largest phishing target in the country , and in fighting this ongoing problem , it has shutdown countless phishing sites surreptitiously installed on countless machines across the net .
" These things are incredibly sophisticated , and when they take over a computer , most [ users ] do n't know it , " he said .
" With every single phishing site [ Washington Mutual has ] shutdown , not one person was aware been aware that their machine was compromised and used for phishing .
That includes university servers and company servers and personal PCs and all sorts of things . "
More interesting is that most of the compromised machines were not Windows machines .
" The vast majority of [ the phishing sites ] we saw were on rootkit-ed Linux boxes , which was rather startling .
We expected a predominance of Microsoft boxes and that was n't the case . "
This pleased Microsoft 's head of Silicon Valley PR , who served as a conference sponsor .
Botnets are obviously a big problem for eBay as well , but Cullinane would n't quite say how big .
" We see botnet attacks that are massive in their size and scope .
We did a preliminary analysis and found over - I guess I 'm not supposed to say that , what the number is - but we found a huge number of bots aimed specifically at eBay , trying to do things specifically to us . "
The problem has become so bad that eBay operates under the assumption that every personal PC is infected , he says .
" With the desktop , we 're starting to run on the assumption that anyone who 's trying to contact us from their own personal desktop is probably coming from a compromised computer . " ®
So the latest craziness from the wingnutosphere goes like this :
Miniter -- who 's written from Baghdad before -- claims that even the CIA can't operate in and around Baghdad without the gun-toting Bklackwater guys , which may well be true , as it's been reported that the State Department has halted many of its outside activities , even in the supposedly safe Green Zone .
He also suggests that the people killed were not civilians but " civilians " , with quotation marks , and that entire anti-Blackwater campaign is some kind of Iranian plot to undermine the highly successful -- according to Miniter , anyway -- surge : According to exclusive information obtained by Pajamas Media ’s Washington editor Richard Miniter , the movement of key CIA station personnel in Baghdad has been all but shut down .
Are we witnessing Iran ’s counter - strike to the surge ?
Movements of key CIA station personnel in Baghdad — along with most State department diplomats and teams building police stations and schools — have been frozen for the second day in a row , according to a State department source who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
Essentially , the CIA , State department and government contractors are stuck inside the International Zone , also known as “ the Green Zone , ” in Central Baghdad .
Even travel inside that walled enclave is somewhat restricted .
The " surge " is going so well that not even the CIA can leave the Green Zone without a heavily armed mercenary escort ?
And it 's all Iran 's fault ?
Yeah , of course it does n't make any sense .
Did they ever make sense ?
And if you are wondering what the whole " civilians with quotation marks " thing is all about , it 's probably from this CYA memo sent out by Blackwater PR ( and passed on to me by an unsympathetic recipient ) :
Subject : Private and Confidential - Blackwater Proprietary I wanted to get you some facts regarding Sunday 's incident in Iraq :
As you have obviously seen in the media Blackwater DSS personnel were involved in an incident in Baghdad that has made International news .
These are the facts as we understand them :
Based on cables , incident reports , and witness accounts , Blackwater is confident that its independent contractors acted lawfully and appropriately in response to a hostile threat in Baghdad on Sunday .
Initial press accounts include countless inaccuracies .
For instance , the helicopters providing aerial support never fired weapons .
Furthermore , we have received no official word from the Ministry of the Interior regarding plans to revoke licenses .
The " civilians " reportedly fired upon by Blackwater professionals were in fact armed enemies .
Blackwater was escorting a US Embassy convoy when a roadside bomb disabled one of the armored vehicles in the convoy .
No one was injured .
Bombing occurred 25 yards outside our venue in Monsoor District
The embassy employees were immediately escorted away from the area .
Tactical Support Team ( TST ) requested
TST receives small arms fire in traffic circle near the initial explosion
TST command vehicle disabled by small arms fire
Blackwater personnel came under small arms fire when they were attempting to tow the disabled vehicle away .
They returned fire .
A vehicle approached at high rate of speed during the salvage operation and ignored warnings to stop .
The vehicle was fired upon until it stopped moving .
Another vehicle moved behind the stopped vehicle and began to push it toward the salvage operation .
That vehicle was also stopped .
We suspect the first vehicle contained explosives and was trying to get within range for detonation .
Blackwater personnel exited the area as soon as possible .
In cases like this , we do not stay around to investigate .
The press is reporting " civilian " deaths .
The reality is these people were trying to kill Americans .
They are insurgents and terrorists .
We did our job .
We protected embassy personnel against an attack meant to kill them .
The licensing issue is not a factor .
An MoI license is not required for the work we do for DoS .
The DoS continues to appreciate the work we do keeping them safe in a professional and extremely competent manner .
The Department of State greatly discourages us speaking with the press .

See ?
If they killed it , they were terrorists .
Even though they did n't stick around to double - check .
And they do n't need no stinking license anyway .
In any case , here 's today 's UN Security Briefing on Iraq ( PDF ) .
Lots more insurgent attacks which , er , proves that the surge is working because , um , the insurgents are desperate even though Blackwater killed them all while the CIA was hunkered down in the Green Zone afraid to get blown up .
And none of it would 've been possible without Drudge and the 101st Fighting Keyboardists .
Or something .
The villain in the new Star Trek film will be played by an Australian , but not ( as rumored ) Russell Crowe .
Trek ’s new bad guy will be played by Eric Bana , star of the 2005 Steven Spielberg film Munich .
According to Variety the 39 year - old Aussie has signed on to play a character called ‘ Nero , ’ but no other details have been provided .
In a strange coincidence Bana co-starred with Tom Hardy ( Shinzon – Star Trek Nemesis ) in the 2001 Ridley Scott film Black Hawk Down – making two Trek movie villains in a row from that movie .
Bana Smash Kirk
The new Star Trek will not be Bana ’s first foray into genre films as he starred in the 2003 Hulk film as the the ultimate guy you do not want to get angry … Bruce Banner .
Bana ’s career spanning thirteen feature films seems to give him plenty of experience to play the role .
He has played a stone cold bad guy ( Chopper ) , an epic warrior ( Troy ) , a Roman ( Romulas , My Father ) and a time - traveler ( The Time Traveler ’s Wife ) .
He won the Australian Film Institute Best Actor award for the title role in Chopper [ highly recommended for a rental by TrekMovie.com ] .
Bana is currently filming The Time Traveler ’s Wife , but apparently there is no conflict with the Trek shoot which starts in a month .
[ minor spoiler ]
A source tells TrekMovie.com that Nero is a Romulan .
The name fits with Trek ’s penchant for portraying the Romulan Empire as a futuristic version of ancient Rome .
A comedy Trek connection ?
Bana got his start in comedy and was a star on the Australian sketch comedy show Full Frontal .
That show actually gave Bana his first crack at playing a Star Trek character when they did a TNG parody and he played Worf ( turning the crab head into a real crab ) .
Unfortunately there is no available video , but here is a screencap from the opening credits featuring Bana as Worf .

Granted , we 've never had too much luck with those knockoff ink cartridges ourselves , but that does n't mean that printer ( and therefore , ink ) manufacturers are n't looking to halt sales of the profit stripping units in any way possible .
Aiding them in their quest is Cryptography Research Inc. , which is currently developing " chip technology aimed at helping printer manufacturers protect this primary source of profit . "
Essentially , the CryptoFirewall chips would make it harder for printers to utilize counterfeit or " off - brand " substitutes , which leaves consumers stuck sans a choice and left to pony up whatever they must in order to get that essay turned in the next morning .
The company claims that its technology will be ready to cripple new printers sometime next year , but hey , the hackers in the crowd are just salivating for yet another challenge .

The team says the bones show key differences
More details
Matthew Tocheri and colleagues tell Science magazine that the bones look nothing like those of Homo sapiens ; they look ape - like .
The announcement in 2004 detailing the discovery of Homo floresiensis caused a sensation .
Some researchers , though , have doubted the interpretation of the find .
These individuals - including the Indonesian palaeoanthropologist Teuku Jacob - have argued that the remains are probably those of a pygmy with the brain defect known as microcephaly .
Their study shows that the wrist bones of the Hobbit are primitive and shaped differently from the bones of both modern humans and even their near - evolutionary cousins , the now extinct Neanderthals ( Homo neanderthalensis ) .
The creature 's wrist lacks a modern innovation seen in both these other human species - a wrist that distributes forces away from the base of the thumb and across the wrist for better shock - absorbing abilities .
" What was very clear from my perspective looking at the Hobbit 's wrist bones is that it does not belong in the group that includes modern humans and Neanderthals .
It basically has the same type of wrist that we see in [ the ancient hominid ]
Homo habilis , that we see in Australopithecus ( the famous ' Lucy ' fossil ) and that we see in living chimps and gorillas today , " Matthew Tocheri told BBC News .
The 18,000 - year - old bones of the Hobbit were unearthed on the Indonesian island of Flores , in a limestone cave at a site called Liang Bua .
The scientists believe these 1 m - tall ( 3ft ) , small - brained people evolved a short stature to cope with the limited supply of food on the island .
The specimens were nicknamed Hobbits after the tiny creatures in JRR Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings trilogy .
Subsequent detailed study of LB1's brain case and the tools found with the bones also support the position that H. floresiensis was a species distinct from modern humans .

What is happening at Rosebud is all too common throughout Indian Country .
American Indian and Alaska Native youth 15 to 24 years old are committing suicide at a rate more than three times the national average for their age group of 13 per 100,000 people , according to the surgeon general .
Often , one suicide leads to another .
For these youths , suicide has become the second - leading cause of death ( after accidents ) .
In the Great Plains , the suicide rate among Indian youth is the worst : 10 times the national average .
Here at Rosebud , when six high school girls were approached at the Boys and Girls Club one recent afternoon for their reactions to the suicides , four said they had tried suicide .
The four compared notes on their methods — two slashed their wrists , two overdosed on pills — and their motives .
“ There are a lot of reasons , ” said Areina Young , a 16 - year - old cheerleader at Todd County High who overdosed on sleeping pills and codeine in February .
“ We have a lot of issues . ”
Plains reservations are among the poorest places in the country , with all of poverty ’s consequences .
But the why of the suicide phenomenon — why American Indian youth , why the Great Plains — is complicated , experts say .
The traumas Plains tribes have experienced over the last 175 years — massacres like the one at Wounded Knee , the decimation of their land and culture — are part of it .
“ Very generally , adolescence is a time of trouble for all youths , ” said Philip May , a professor of sociology at the University of New Mexico who has been studying suicide among American Indians for more than 35 years .
“ But in many American Indian communities , it ’s compounded by limited opportunities , historical trauma and contemporary discrimination .
The way the Lakota people and other Plains tribes have experienced history in the last 100 years has reduced the mental health factors that are available to them to cope . ”
Tribal leaders at Rosebud took a survey of Todd County students in March .
The students ’ biggest complaint was that they did not feel safe for fear of gangs .
They said that they had no refuge , that their parents were not present , and that they saw too much tragedy , alcoholism and hopelessness .

Are vapor trails from aircraft influencing the climate , and if so , should we worry ?
I 've always wanted to hate contrails , the " condensation trails " streaming out from behind jets .
They 're man-made .
They force lines on nature , which knows no lines .
They arise out of pollution , and they generate visual pollution — aircraft graffiti that can erase blue from the sky and light from the sun .
All good reasons to despise these artificial clouds .
But I do n't .
I 've always been drawn to them .
When I see one above , I like to run my eye along its length until I find the plane , a tiny silver toy .
I like to wonder at the blank space between the plane and the start of the contrail — emptiness full of potential — and then to see the churning new cloud as it forms , a tumbling cascade .
When the roiling slows and the newborn cloud settles into a contrail proper , I admire its perfection : a straight white line sharply etched against the blue .
Even when numerous contrails made fat by the wind crisscross the sky , I do n't mind .
Well , I might now .
After a lifetime of enjoying contrails , it came as a surprise to me to learn recently that something so ephemeral may not be a harmless by - product of the jet age but may in fact impact the climate .
This is of particular concern in well - traveled air corridors , where contrails by the hundreds can spread into man-made cirrus clouds that can both block sunlight from reaching the Earth and trap radiated heat from escaping to space .
Whether contrails cause a net cooling or a net warming , even whether their effect is something to worry about , remains unclear .
But with air traffic expected to double or even triple by 2050 , leading contrail researchers say the influence of these artificial clouds cannot be ignored .
Out of the blue A contrail will form behind a jet if , as exhaust gases cool and mix with surrounding air , the humidity is high enough and the temperature low enough for liquid water to condense .
The air needs to be supersaturated and the temperature generally below - 40 °F , something that typically occurs only in the upper troposphere , the atmospheric layer several miles up where airliners cruise .
Under those conditions , water vapor from the jet 's exhaust and secondarily from the atmosphere condenses into water droplets .
Within a few tens of feet behind the aircraft , these droplets freeze into the snow - white particles that bring the contrail to life .
How long a newly formed condensation trail sticks around depends on the ambient humidity .
If humidity is low , contrails will rapidly dissipate , looking like a comet 's tail .
The ice particles sublimate — meaning go straight from ice to vapor — and you 're back to blue sky .
If humidity is high , however , contrails can persist — and those are the ones that trouble climatologists .
A lingering concern
If conditions are right , newly formed contrails will begin feeding off surrounding water vapor .
Like vaporous cancers , they start growing and spreading .
In time , they can expand horizontally to such an extent that they become indistinguishable from cirrus clouds , those thin , diaphanous sheets often seen way up high .
These artificial cirrus clouds can last for many hours , and the amount of sky they end up covering can be astonishing : one study showed that contrails from just six aircraft expanded to shroud some 7,700 square miles .
Climatologists realized they had an unprecedented opportunity to scrutinize individual contrails .
What consequence might these jet - triggered clouds have ?
Well , most clouds fall into one of two categories .
High , thin cirrus clouds are normally warming clouds : they let sunlight through but are good at trapping heat radiating back upwards from the Earth .
Low , thick stratus clouds , on the other hand , are typically cooling clouds , because they tend to be more efficient at blocking and reflecting sunlight than they are at trapping radiated heat .
Contrails are initially thick , bright , highly reflective clouds , but over time they morph into wispy cirrus clouds .
Are they then warming or cooling clouds ?
For a long time , scientists did n't even have a baseline from which to begin to answer that question .
Studying contrails has always been difficult : they 're high in the sky and either so fleeting that they 're gone in minutes or so persistent that dozens or even hundreds can crisscross one another , making the study of individual contrails to get a baseline all but impossible .
Contrail hiatus
At least that was the case until September 11 , 2001 .
For the first time since the jet age began , virtually all aircraft were grounded over the United States for three days .
Even as they tried like the rest of us to absorb the enormity of the terrorist attacks , climatologists realized they had an unprecedented opportunity to scrutinize individual contrails , and several studies were quickly launched .
One study looked at the aforementioned contrails that grew to cover 7,700 square miles .
Those condensation trails arose in the wake of six military aircraft flying between Virginia and Pennsylvania on September 12 , 2001 .
From those isolated contrails , unmixed as they were with the usual dozens of others , Patrick Minnis , a senior research scientist at NASA 's Langely Research Center , and his colleagues were able to gain valuable insight into how a single contrail forms .
Those once - in - a - lifetime data sets are so useful that Minnis is about to analyze them again in an expanded study .
Another study that took advantage of the grounding gave striking evidence of what contrails can do .
David Travis of the University of Wisconsin- Whitewater and two colleagues measured the difference , over those three contrail - free days , between the highest daytime temperature and the lowest nighttime temperature across the continental U.S.
They compared those data with the average range in day - night temperatures for the period 1971 - 2000 , again across the contiguous 48 states .
Travis 's team discovered that from roughly midday September 11 to midday September 14 , the days had become warmer and the nights cooler , with the overall range greater by about two degrees Fahrenheit .
These results suggest that contrails can suppress both daytime highs ( by reflecting sunlight back to space ) and nighttime lows ( by trapping radiated heat ) .
That is , they can be both cooling and warming clouds .
But what is the net effect ?
Do they cool more than they warm , or vice versa ?
" Well , the assumption is a net warming , " Travis says , " but there is a lot of argument still going on about how much of a warming effect they produce . "
Ongoing debate
In a study published in 2004 , for example , Minnis and colleagues reported that contrails are capable of increasing average surface temperatures sufficiently to account for a warming trend in the U.S. between 1975 and 1994 .
But some climatologists believe Minnis and his colleagues may have overestimated the contrail warming effect .
Even if Minnis 's estimates are correct , other climate experts feel that any warming from contrails is not something to fret about .
In a study published in 2005 , James Hansen of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York , and colleagues ran models that increased the contrail coverage in Minnis 's study by a factor of five .
Even with this significant increase , Hansen 's team found that global mean temperature change was in the neighborhood of 0.03 °C ( 0.05 °F ) — a minute amount .
I too will be looking at contrails with a new eye , a jaundiced one .
" Aircraft are likely to be a significant factor in future climate , but probably not via their contrails , " Hansen told me .
" I think our main concern about aircraft will be their CO 2 emissions , not contrails , which are a pretty small climate forcing . "
Minnis counters that Hansen 's model , while on target on the global front , does n't account as accurately for regional temperature changes .
" In zones of greatest air traffic , like between 30° and 50° North , there 's a large bulge in the actual increase in temperature that 's not reflected in the models , " he says .
" Until they model that bulge , that thing 's still up in the air . "
For his part , Minnis intends to keep his eye on condensation trails and their aftereffects .
Taking action
So does Travis , who feels the fact that we can measure a change of any sort should be cause for concern .
Even a slight alteration of the daily temperature range , for instance , can have repercussions , he says .
" To you and I , that may seem like a nice comfortable - sounding scenario — the days are not as hot , the nights are not as cold — but for natural ecosystems , this could be a real problem .
For one thing , you need to have extreme temperatures to weed out the weaker species — it 's classic Darwinism . "
For this reason , Travis believes we should n't sit by and wait to see what happens with contrails .
" Anytime we can see an effect from something artificial like that , I think we want to try to do something about it , " he says .
The British government , for one , may be about to .
It 's considering requiring planes to fly at lower altitudes over Great Britain in hopes of promoting fewer contrails .
I too will be looking at contrails with a new eye , a jaundiced one — though I 'll admit if they were black as soot , it would be a lot easier .
Bio Mapping / Emotion Mapping by Christian Nold
2004 - ongoing Bio Mapping is revolutionary methodology and tool for visualising people 's reactions to the external world .
Over the last five years , over 2000 people have taken part in community mapping projects in over 25 cities across the globe .
In structured workshops , participants re-explore their local area with the use of a unique device invented by Christian Nold which records the wearer 's Galvanic Skin Response ( GSR ) , which is a simple indicator of emotional arousal in conjunction with their geographical location .
On their return , a map is created which visualises points of high and low arousal .
The unique methodology of this project involves working with groups of people to interpret and analyse the data and adding annotating onto these individual emotion tracks .
Through this process communal Emotion Maps of lots of people 's emotion data are constructed which are packed full of personal observations and highlight the issues that people feel strongly about .
Over the last years Christian Nold has used this unique methodology and tool in many diverse contexts from art , community development , science research , architectural planning and large scale political consultations .
Please get in touch if you would like to set a similar project in your area .
When we become aware of our own and each others unique body reactions to the environment we can create a better world !

Unfortunately , in recent years there have been so many people , companies and institutions who have tried to copy or imitate the Bio Mapping device and use it for banal , exploitative or anti-social purposes .
For this reason I would like to make it clear that the Bio Mapping device and Emotion Mapping concept are Copyrighted and Trademarked !

Patterns , Programs , and Links for Conway 's Game of Life
Update ( 11 - Feb -01 )
My email address is callahanp@acm.org .
Despite my inactivity on these pages , I still read this mail regularly and appreciate comments .
I do n't always remember to answer it , so send me a reminder if you do n't hear from me in a couple of weeks .
-- Paul
I should mention that while writing this page , I have generally assumed that the reader has at least heard of the Game of Life .
But if you have n't , please do n't let that stand in your way .
A brief explanation can already be found elsewhere on the Web .
Alan 's comments for the patterns are often terse ( well , it 's an awful lot of material to document ) and use a rather specialized terminology .
You may wish to refer to the illustrated glossary adapted from the one that Alan provided in his distribution A text version of the glossary is provided for those who are using a text - only browser , or who do not have a fast connection .
For an even more comprehensive list of Life terms , see Stephen Silver 's lexicon .
A Web - page implementation of John Conway 's Game of Life .
This one is , of necessity , slow and limited to a tiny cell universe , but it's an ingenious application of check boxes and it even runs in lynx .
Some patterns and Life implementations available in my ftp directory .
Alan Hensel 's zip - compressed archive of some of the world 's most remarkable Life patterns .
To see these in action , you need a fast Life simulator that works with Hensel 's format .
Some useful documentation is included along with the patterns .
Alan Hensel 's lightning - fast MS / DOS implementation of Life .
Conveniently enough , this program works with his pattern format .
Compressed source for Xlife 3.0 , an X - windows implementation of Life .
This accepts Hensel 's format as well , but expects pattern files to have a " .life " suffix .
A semi-official upgrade Xlife 3.5 at Achim Flammenkamp 's web site .
Enhancements are box cut - and - paste commands that I added but never released , and sub - pixel zooming by Achim for viewing extremely large patterns .
Stephen Silver 's comprehensive Life Lexicon .
X Motif source code I wrote for a 4 - color version of life .
The rules governing live and dead cells are the usual ones .
However a cell can be one of four different colors , and these colors change according to a majority rule .
This is distributed as a gzipped Unix tape archive .
My Java still life generator , which uses an iterative approach to find patterns that are stable under life rules .
David Bell 's definitive treatise on Spaceships in Conway 's Game of Life , originally distributed as a Usenet article in flat ascii text , but since converted by Joerg Heitkoetter into an HTML document available through the Web .
A Unix shell archive of David Bell 's search program that finds low - period oscillators and spaceships .
Many of the spaceships discussed in Bell 's article were originally found with just such a search program .
Note that this is the 5 Feb 94 release , which contains features not found in the older versions archived elsewhere .
The Usenet newsgroup comp.theory.cell-automata , which is devoted to the more general subject of cellular automata , but where Game of Life discussions are not unheard of .
My December ' 94 Usenet article containing C source code for a collision - enumeration program .
Unfortunately , my program is not very user - friendly .
It works with files and command - line arguments , and wo n't give you much of anything unless you know just what you are looking for .
It has , however , resulted in some surprising finds .
This is mainly of interest to the hardcore Life enthusiast with a lot of patience and a high tolerance for frustration .
Programs that can read patterns in Alan Hensel 's archive
Life32 for Windows
95/98/NT by Johan Bontes .
Alan Hensel calls this " by far , the best Life program for 32 - bit Windows ... extremely fast , powerful , and easy to use . "
I 've seen this demonstrated , and concur with Alan .
W - Life , ported by Glen Summers , for PC 's running MS - Windows 3.1 .
A decent port of Xlife to Microsoft Windows .
Note that this is a port of Xlife 2.0 , released in 1989 .
I do not have an up to date link for this software .
WinLife by John Harper , for PC 's running MS - Windows 3.1 .
Probably the best overall Windows Life program .
LifeLab by Andrew Trevorrow , for Macs -- Mac Plus to Power Mac .
Very powerful .
Autodetects gliders and oscillators , has sophisticated editing , does automated searches for new patterns .

People stand in line to see a prostitute 's bedroom at a shop window during the first - ever open day in Amsterdam 's red light district February 18 , 2006 .
About a third of Amsterdam 's red - lit windows for prostitutes will disappear from the city centre as one of the main brothel owners is set to sell his empire to a real estate company .
REUTERS / Paul Vreeker
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - About a third of Amsterdam ’s red - lit windows for prostitutes will disappear from the city centre as one of the main brothel owners is set to sell his empire to a real estate company .
A housing company is to buy 18 premises , currently featuring 51 windows , for about 25 million euros ( $ 35 million ) , Amsterdam city council said .
Last November , the city revoked the trading licences of 33 brothels because they were suspected of criminal activities including money laundering and drug dealing .
However , the brothel owners appealed successfully against the decision .
Tourist authorities acknowledge the 700 - year - old red - light district -- a maze of narrow alleys and canals lined with sex shops , prostitutes behind windows and marijuana - selling “ coffee shops ” -- is as much of a draw as other attractions such as the Van Gogh museum or the Anne Frank House .
Mayor Job Cohen said he had no plans to rid Amsterdam of prostitution but the concentration of sex in the city centre was too high .
After his 1979 - 85 service in Congress as a Republican and his 1988 campaign for the presidency as the nominee of the Libertarian Party , Ron Paul returned home to Surfside , Texas and devoted himself to a variety of pursuits , one of which was his self - published newsletter , The Ron Paul Political Report .
Founded in 1985 , the eight - page newsletter featured Paul 's extreme libertarian perspective on a number of different issues , notably crackpot theories about the Federal Reserve and the money system and a tireless advocacy of a return to the gold standard — a longtime Ron Paul hobby horse .
The Ron Paul Political Report would come to feature in the stable of " underground " publications and photocopied " zines " that fed the nascent " patriot movement " that arose in the early 1990s , spurred by anger over federal government actions in Waco , Texas and Ruby Ridge , Idaho , and by fear of a supposed " New World Order . "
Indeed , Paul changed the name of the newsletter to the Ron Paul Survival Report around 1993 in what we may presume to be an effort to tap into the survivalist sentiments then peaking among the radical right wing .
It is extremely difficult to track down content from the Ron Political / Survival Report today .
The Report only had about 7,000 subscribers , and Paul has — unsurprisingly — refused to release copies to the media .
Lexis / Nexis is of no help , as the obscure publication largely escaped the notice of major media publications during Paul 's hiatus from electoral politics .
What remains to us today comes almost entirely from secondary sources , such as quasi- samizdat publications and contemporaneous Usenet postings from sources like Google Groups .
These few fragments of a much larger body of work — almost all of which have been preserved by Paul 's supporters , not his opponents — give us an illuminating and frightening look into his demented , racist worldview .
The only complete article from the Ron Paul Political Report on the Internet that I am aware of is a 1992 piece titled " LOS ANGELES RACIAL TERRORISM , " on the subject of the so - called Rodney King riots in South Central Los Angeles in 1991 .
It is available to us today because it was posted to the talk .
politics.misc newsgroup on July 30 , 1993 by Dan Gannon , a notorious white supremacist and Holocaust denier , and archived by the Nizkor Project , an anti-revisionism organization that was active in cataloging hate speech on the early public Internet .
You can read Nizkor 's copy of the article here , and see a reposted version on Google Groups here .
Some relevant passages from the article ( emphasis mine ) :
Regardless of what the media tell us , most white Americans are not going to believe that they are at fault for what blacks have done to cities across America .
The professional blacks may have cowed the elites , but good sense survives at the grass roots .
Many more are going to have difficultly avoiding the belief that our country is being destroyed by a group of actual and potential terrorists -- and they can be identified by the color of their skin .
This conclusion may not be entirely fair , but it is , for many , entirely unavoidable .
Indeed , it is shocking to consider the uniformity of opinion among blacks in this country .
Opinion polls consistently show that only about 5 % of blacks have sensible political opinions , i.e. support the free market , individual liberty , and the end of welfare and affirmative action ....
Given the inefficiencies of what D.C. laughingly calls the " criminal justice system , " I think we can safely assume that 95 % of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal .
If similar in - depth studies were conducted in other major cities , who doubts that similar results would be produced ?
We are constantly told that it is evil to be afraid of black men , but it is hardly irrational .
Black men commit murders , rapes , robberies , muggings , and burglaries all out of proportion to their numbers .
Perhaps the L.A. experience should not be surprising .
The riots , burning , looting , and murders are only a continuation of 30 years of racial politics .
The looting in L.A. was the welfare state without the voting booth .
The elite have sent one message to black America for 30 years : you are entitled to something for nothing .
That 's what blacks got on the streets of L.A. for three days in April .
Only they did n't ask their Congressmen to arrange the transfer .
Reading the entire article will show that I have not taken these quotes out of context , though the article is definitely not for everyone : it 's a 3700 - word racist tirade that is frankly stomach - turning in its depiction of African - Americans as violent , unevolved savages and even rapists .
Without a doubt , it was articles like this one that prompted the Heritage Front , a Toronto - based neo -Nazi organization , to include the Ron Paul Political Report in its list of " Racialist Addresses and Phone Numbers . "
During Paul 's 1996 Congressional run , the Houston Chronicle unearthed some additional racial comments from his newsletter ( emphasis mine ) :
Texas congressional candidate Ron Paul 's 1992 political newsletter highlighted portrayals of blacks as inclined toward crime and lacking sense about top political issues .
Under the headline of " Terrorist Update , " for instance , Paul reported on gang crime in Los Angeles and commented , " If you have ever been robbed by a black teen - aged male , you know how unbelievably fleet - footed they can be . "
Paul , a Republican obstetrician from Surfside , said Wednesday he opposes racism and that his written commentaries about blacks came in the context of " current events and statistical reports of the time . " ... [ I ] n the same 1992 edition ... [ Paul wrote ] , " We do n't think a child of 13 should be held responsible as a man of 23 .
That 's true for most people , but black males age 13 who have been raised on the streets and who have joined criminal gangs are as big , strong , tough , scary and culpable as any adult and should be treated as such . "
Paul also asserted that " complex embezzling " is conducted exclusively by non-blacks .
" What else do we need to know about the political establishment than that it refuses to discuss the crimes that terrify Americans on grounds that doing so is racist ?
Why is n't that true of complex embezzling , which is 100 percent white and Asian ? " he wrote .
And the November 1 , 1996 issue of the alt - weekly Austin Chronicle offered some additional gems from Paul 's oeuvre , including his thoughts about his former House colleague , the legendary Barbara Jordan ( D - TX ) :
University of Texas affirmative action law professor Barbara Jordan is a fraud .
Everything from her imitation British accent , to her supposed expertise in law , to her distinguished career in public service , is made up .
If there were ever a modern case of the empress without clothes , this is it .
She is the archetypical half - educated victimologist , yet her race and sex protect her from criticism .
Years later , in an interview printed in the October 2001 issue of Texas Monthly , Paul changed his story about these and other racist comments : " I could never say this in the campaign , but those words were n't really written by me , " he said .
" It was n't my language at all . "
Unfortunately , this explanation does n't really withstand scrutiny .
The Ron Paul Political Report was an eight - page newsletter , not a 200 - page magazine ; whether he employed other writers or not , it beggars belief that Paul would not have had full control and approval over its contents .
Moreover , the L.A. riots article does in fact bear some evidence of having been written by Paul , at least in part .
( For example , the article relates the observations of one Burt Blumert , who is labeled " expert Burt Blumert " but who is actually just a gold coin and bullion dealer in San Francisco who happens to be a longtime personal friend of ... Ron Paul . )
Regardless , the fact remains that Paul suffered these words to be published under his name in his newsletter as a representation of his views , and his efforts to distance himself from them are more than a little bit disingenuous .
I understand how important , how visceral , opposition to the war is for a lot of people .
It is for precisely this reason that it is so important that Kossacks understand that , opposition to the war aside , Ron Paul is not our friend .
Syntax under pressure
According to the Doonesbury site 's feature " Say What ? " today , Lauren Caitlin Upton , the reigning Miss South Carolina , was recently asked on TV why so many Americans can't find their own country on a map , and her impromptu reply , dutifully transcribed by various sources ( though not yet checked aganst the original recording by Language Log staff ) , was :
I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation do n't have maps , and I believe that our education like such as South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like such as , and I believe that they should ... our education over here in the U.S should help the U.S or should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future .
Those who enjoy laughing at stereotypically pretty young women ( yes , Miss Upton does appear to be blonde ) for stereotypically lacking intelligence will get a few giggles out of this one .
And they will probably not reflect on whether they themselves have ever sounded similarly stupid when speaking spontaneously under pressure and under lights , in response to an unexpected question under circumstances that made them feel they are expected to talk .
There can be no doubt that the young woman in question had no idea what she was going to say , except that she knew she should try to mention maps and name a country or two and sound sort of interested in foreign affairs and education .
But I have a feeling I have occasionally blundered around in similar manner myself when faced after a conference presentation with a question I simply had no answer to .
Normally one can just say nothing , or " I have no idea " , if one has no idea .
But there are some circumstances in which all the attention is on you and you feel you have to provide some talk : being on TV , press conferences , classes where you 're the teacher , prime minister 's question time , job interviews , parole board hearings , question periods , and so on .
The one syntactic peculiarity ( as opposed to the general fluency meltdown ) that caught my eye was " the Iraq " , which occurred twice .
But this is a tricky topic ( no wonder so many Chinese , Japanese , Korean , and Russian speakers are utterly baffled over when to use the definite article and when not ) .
What Miss Upton was struggling with was the question of whether Iraq is a strong or a weak proper name .
Weak proper names need the definite article .
Strong ones do n't .
You may be clear about the difference , but large numbers of people think that Language Log is a weak proper name ( needing the ) , as we see from our mail every day .
( It is not true .
Language Log is a strong proper name : we do not prefix it with the definite article . )
The matter is not trivial or straightforward .
As noted in The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language , pp. 517 ff , there are a number of countries that have two different ways of being referred to , strong and weak , the weak forms being a bit more common in Britain and tending to be replaced by the strong forms :
strong weak ( no article ) ( with article ) Argentina the Argentine Ukraine the Ukraine Yemen the Yemen Lebanon the Lebanon Holland the Netherlands
There are some generalizations , but also many exceptions .
Cities , boroughs , and regions are usually strong ( like Amsterdam or New York or North Africa or Antarctica ) but a few are weak ( like the Hague or the Bronx or the Maghreb or the Antarctic ) .
And remarkably , to a rough approximation at least , numerical freeway names are weak proper names in Southern California ( " Get on the 55 " ) but strong proper names in Northern California ( " Take 17 South " ) .
Do n't laugh too hard at poor Miss Upton until you 've successfully answered a few geography quiz questions under TV lights , that 's what I 'm saying .
Addendum :
For those interested in checking the text , this blog post has a link to the video ( it 's on YouTube of course ) , and offers the following slightly different transcript ( slightly more disfluent ; and it agrees on * the Iraq ) :
I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because , uhmmm , some people out there in our nation do n't have maps and uh , I believe that our , I , education like such as uh , South Africa , and uh , the Iraq , everywhere like such as , and I believe that they should , uhhh , our education over here in the US should help the US , uh , should help South Africa , it should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future , for us .

That tinkle you hear these days is the sound of scales falling from the eyes of right - wing Washington pundits as they are oh - so - dismayed to discover that somehow , while they were n’t watching , the country fell into the hands of a systematically lawless , reckless , corrupt , and authoritarian circle of false conservatives .
But to keep their aplomb , they have to pretend that they were n’t wearing blinders in the first place .
What these leading spokesmen ( and they are men , for the most part ) of the conservative movement are not so eager to notice is that the power circle in question is one that , not so long ago , they celebrated as a triumphant expression of conservative ideas and values .
The euphemistic way to put this is that we are well into the season of conservative distancing .
The buck stops nowhere .
You can appreciate the conservative dilemma .
They have to wash their hands of the Bush catastrophe without taking any responsibility for it .
They have to try salvaging the notion of a vital , intelligent conservatism that was somehow , behind their backs , hijacked , sabotaged , and betrayed by an errant leader — the Bush who , unaccountably , squandered the luminous promise of Bush .
But Bush was not an accidental leader of the Republicans .
He was , and remains , their quintessence — their true representative , their embodiment .
His partisans celebrated him precisely as that .
In his contempt for reason , his wild foreign policy , his militarism , his love of plutocrats , and his disdain for democratic values and civil rights and liberties , he personifies most of the conservative movement .
He was what they wanted .
And they could n’t believe their good fortune when he showed up to carry their standard .
Even if he embarrassed them on occasion , they celebrated his shortcomings as a refreshing change from Bill Clinton .
No wonder his erstwhile cheerleaders are not willing to face their embarrassment .
They are not particularly interested in asking :
Did he change between the time they heralded him as a conservative hero and the time they threw up their hands deploring his errors ?
Was his stupendous malfeasance a sign , perhaps , that they missed something essential in his nature way back in the glory days when they welcomed him unquestioningly into their hearts ?
Does this not tell us all we need to know about their acuity ?
Much of the Democrats ’ success next year and in coming years will rest on their ability to convince Americans that George W. Bush was not a peculiarly terrible president but a predictably terrible one — predictably bad because his unheeding , bulldozer nature , and that of the vice - president he chose , were incarnations of the conservative movement ’s plutocratic disdain and autocratic willfulness .
To prepare for this exercise — one that will extend for years — it is useful to survey some leading right - wing pundits to see what they refused to see when the bloom was on their rose .
In this spirit , I offer a little sampling of befores and afters .
David Brooks Before
“ The core threat to democracy is not in the White House , it ’s the haters themselves . ”
— New York Times , 9/30/2003
“ Senior members of his administration are capable of looking honestly at their mistakes . ”

The Bush administration is “ drunk on truth serum , ” practicing “ honesty and candor . ”
— New York Times , 12/13/2003
“ Two years from now … Bush ’s [ inaugural ] speech , which is being derided for its vagueness and its supposed detachment from the concrete realities , will still be practical and present in the world , yielding consequences every day . ”
— New York Times , 1/22/2005
David Brooks After
“ Institutions completely failed us [ with Katrina ] — this follows Abu Ghraib , the failure of planning in Iraq , the intelligence failures , the corporate scandals , the media scandals . ”
— PBS NewsHour , 9/2/2005
“ Sometimes I ’d come away from off - the - record conversations and background briefings [ with administration officials on Iraq ] feeling my intelligence had been insulted , because even in private , officials would ignore realities that were on newspaper front pages . ”
— New York Times , 12/4/2005
William F. Buckley , Jr. , Before
“ George W. Bush is on a great roll .
His speech on Thursday combined everything needed at this near - decisive moment .
He gave our allies , Congress , and the public exactly that — what was needed .
And he engaged in a venture in diplomatic craft that will make its way into the textbooks of the future , in all the languages spoken at the U.N. Security Council . ”
— National Review Online , 2/7/2003
William F. Buckley , Jr. , After
“ President Bush ’s mistake was in going to war . ”
— National Review Online , 10/1/2004
George Will Before
“ Critics …say Bush is a modest man with much to be modest about , and that he lacks complexity .
But modesty is a political virtue and is especially desirable in the next president , who will replace the egomaniacal vulgarian [ Bill Clinton ] . ”
— Washington Post , 11/5/00
“ Bush ’s conservatism is more modest , which means more truly conservative , than Reagan ’s , because it is subdued by a more severe sense of possibilities :
It is hard to imagine Bush ever voicing , as Reagan frequently did , Tom Paine ’s thought , ‘ We have it in our power to begin the world over again . ’…
Bush ’s foreign policy is still embryonic , but already suggests conservative realism about the limited sway of power over events … .
Bush practiced the essential conservative virtue , prudence , in selecting two advisers — Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld — long on the sort of experience that produces prudence . ”
— Washington Post , 4/30/01
George Will After
“ This administration can not be trusted to govern if it cannot be counted on to think and , having thought , to have second thoughts .
Thinking is not the reiteration of bromides …. ”
— Washington Post , 5/5/04
“ Today , in Iraq , the president ’s policy — and that of his critics — is to hope for a miracle . ”
— Washington Post , 1/14/07
Realistically , it ’s almost impossible to believe that Bush is some kind of Manchurian President , intentionally screwing up and deliberately undermining the United States .
But sometimes , it ’s hard not to wonder .
Dan Froomkin , for example , did a nice job today describing Bush ’s disastrous dollar policy .
President Bush does n’t talk about the dollar much , but when he does , he ’s got exactly one thing to say about it : “ We have a strong dollar policy . ”
It ’s becoming increasingly clear , however , that Bush ’s “ strong dollar policy ” is driving the greenback into the ground .
The dollar is hitting record lows this week amidst fears that the mortgage - market meltdown will spread to other parts of the economy and as the Chinese make noise about moving more of their investments into euros .
But it is the underlying dynamics of the American economy — continued massive trade deficits and a whopping national debt — that have put the dollar in such a precarious position .
A true strong dollar policy , aimed at increasing the confidence of international investors , would require Bush to do a bunch of things he does n’t want to do .
For instance , he would have to stop borrowing so much money to fund his tax cuts and his wars .
He would need to encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates , rather than depend on it to keep propping up the domestic economy by decreasing them .
That sort of thing .
Instead , Bush just offers the strong - dollar line , without specifics , and moves on .
The famous gossipista Perez Hilton got into it last night with a paparazzo who accused the blogger of pilfering photos .
The incident occurred outside an Xbox 360 party at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery .
The photographer confronted Perez , accusing him of stealing photographs for his blog .
Q . Why do scientists need to know about this ?
A. Because not long ago , researchers from South Korea had to retract papers published in Science because the photographs used to prove that human stem cells had been cloned were effectively Photoshop - cloned , and not laboratory - cloned .
There have been other recent cases , too .
And today , in science , more and more , photographs are the data .
The Federal Office of Research Integrity has said that in 1990 , less than 3 percent of allegations of fraud they investigated involved contested images .
By 2001 , that number was 26 percent .
And last year , it was 44.1 percent .
Mike Rossner of The Journal of Cell Biology estimates that 20 percent of the manuscripts he accepts contain at least one figure that has to be remade because of inappropriate image manipulation .
He means that the images are not accurate reflections of the original data .
Rossner estimates that about 1 percent of the papers have some piece of image data that is downright fraudulent .
Q . Where does he get his figures from ?
A. Mike has a full - time person who looks at every image supporting accepted manuscripts .
Other biologists tell me anecdotally that many images in journals are regularly touched up to improve contrast or to remove little imperfections .
The journals are , in essence , doing the same things fashion magazines do .
Some of it is legitimate .
In other cases , they are crossing the line .
Q . Are there policy changes that you think scientists should be considering ?
A. I think it ’s very hard to define inappropriate manipulation .
Sometimes you can change 30 percent of the pixels in an image and it wo n’t fundamentally change anything .
At other times , you can change 5 percent of the pixels and it radically changes meaning .
I ’m not a purist .
I think there ’s room for cropping , adjusting , contrast enhancement , but I want to know what was done .
I think journal editors need to see the unadulterated , unretouched original images .

No.
2 , the scientific community as a whole needs to come out with a well - thought - out policy on what is and is n’t acceptable when it comes to altering photographs .
And this is something that must be refined , updated and changed as the technology changes .
The journals are probably going to have to hire more staff .
That will slow down the publication pipeline somewhat .
But the cost of these scandals is too high .
They undermine the public ’s faith in science .
Q. You make software to detect forgeries .
How do you design your programs ?
A. I think like a forger .
I spend a lot of time in Photoshop making digital forgeries to learn the tools and techniques a forger uses .
We ’ll make a composite photograph of two people and ask , “ How do you manipulate this photograph to make it compelling ? ”
By working backwards , we learn the forger ’s techniques and how to detect them .

Hi all !
Here 's the next cheat sheet I 've created - cheat sheet of sed , the Superman of stream editing .
It has come handy 101 times for me because sed is not what I use daily and after some time of not using the sed commands tend to fade away from my mind and I have to review them quickly .
This cheat sheet is ideal for that .
You can't really be a good hacker if you do n't know this tool .
I always love to think of various situations where knowing many , many different tools makes you the ultimate guru .
Suppose you had a situation where you were on a box which had some problems and the only tool available to you was sed , and you had to fix a configuration file problem really quickly or bad , bad things would happen .
If you never knew sed , you 'd be in deep trouble because it can't be learned from the man page , because it only lists all the commands and you have no understanding how the commands work .
When I first learned sed , I remember the joy when I understood how it worked , that it operated on input stream , output stream , pattern space and hold buffer .
Once you know this , the rest can be understood from the man page , but before that , I doubt it .
If you want to learn the sed editor I recommend this wonderful tutorial and these books .
This sed cheat sheet contains :
command line summary
command description , if they take single address or pattern , or a range of addresses , and what they modify ( input stream , output stream , pattern space or hold buffer )
command line argument summary
extensions
short summary of adderss range format

Here ’s * Something * You Can’t ( Quite ) Blame on America
M. Scott Taylor , an economist at the University of Calgary , argues in a new working paper that the epic 19th - century slaughter of American bison — with 10 to 15 million buffalo killed on the Great Plains in barely a decade — was driven by a technological advance and a profit motive that both came from Europe .
( Incidentally , this makes me wonder if a similar analysis has ever been performed on whale hunting . )
From the introduction of Taylor ’s paper :
This paper examines the slaughter using theory , empirics , and first person accounts from diaries and other historical documents .
It argues that the story of the buffalo slaughter is surprisingly not , at bottom , an American one .
Instead I argue that the slaughter on the plains was initiated by a tanning innovation created in Europe , and maintained by a robust European demand for buffalo hides .
These market forces overwhelmed the ability of a young and still expanding nation , just out of a bloody civil war , to carefully steward its natural resources .
Specifically , I argue that three conditions are jointly necessary and sufficient to explain the time pattern of buffalo destruction witnessed in the nineteenth century .
These are : ( 1 ) a price for buffalo products that was largely invariant to changes in supply ; ( 2 ) open access conditions with no regulation of the buffalo kill ; and ( 3 ) , a newly invented tanning process that made buffalo hides into valuable commercial leather .
WASHINGTON -- Boston has lost more than a quarter of its residents since the middle of the last century , according to estimates to be released today by the Census Bureau .
Boston is among 16 of the country 's 20 largest cities in 1950 that have shrunk , some by a lot .
This has happened while the nation 's population has nearly doubled , adding about 150 million people .
Boston lost 210,681 people -- to end up with a population of 590,763 last year , according to estimates by the Census Bureau , which is releasing 2006 population estimates for US cities .
The Associated Press compared those estimates with population totals from the 1950 census .
According to census information , Phoenix has overtaken Philadelphia as the nation 's fifth largest city , underscoring decades of population losses in America 's big industrial centers .
Detroit , Cleveland , Pittsburgh , St. Louis , and Buffalo .
have all lost more than half their population in the past half - century .
Philadelphia lost nearly a third of its residents , slipping to about 1.4 million people last year , according to estimates being released today by the Census Bureau .
Like many big cities in the Northeast and Midwest , Philadelphia has suffered through a decline in the nation 's manufacturing economy .
City officials , however , have vowed to rebound .
" Philadelphia is not going to disappear , " said Gary Jastrzab , deputy executive director of the city planning commission .
" We have a good quality of life here .
We have major universities , major health facilities , and a very active pharmaceutical industry . "
Phoenix was barely in the top 100 cities in 1950 ; it ranked 99th , with about 107,000 people .
Last year , it had 1.5 million .
Phoenix added 43,000 people from 2005 to 2006 , more than any other city , according to Census Bureau estimates .
It was followed by San Antonio ; Fort Worth , Texas ; Houston ; and North Las Vegas , Nev .
New Orleans , which is struggling to rebuild following Hurricane Katrina , lost the most people , about 228,000 .
The Census Bureau estimated the city 's population at 223,400 last year , a little less than half its size before the storm .
Americans have been migrating south and west for decades in search of better jobs and warmer climates .
They have also been moving to the suburbs and beyond , in search of bigger yards and houses , lower crime rates , and better schools .
In 1950 , nearly a fifth of the population lived in the nation 's 20 largest cities .
In 2006 , it was about 1 in 10 .
Many older cities are trying to reinvent themselves , relying on the universities , health centers and cultural attractions that have long been desirable , said William Frey , a demographer at the Brookings Institution , a Washington think tank .
" It used to be that the city was the whole regional economy .
Now , it is just the center , " Frey said .
" These cities certainly can be viable with smaller populations . "

Tupac Shakur All Eyez On Me
Nominated by Mark Ronson , producer
This was Tupac 's biggest record , and is seen by rap fans as the greatest latterday hip - hop album .
But I 've never got the cult of Tupac .
Sure , he was in a lot of pain but he never said anything particularly clever - Notorious B.I.G. was far superior .
People really related to the emotion in his voice , but it did n't resonate with me .
No one would doubt Tupac 's " realness " - he was shot nine times , for God 's sake , and he began recording this album hours after being released from prison - but it does n't compare to Biggie .
Dr Dre produced it , and I did n't rate his production , either .
Problem was , Tupac was so prolific .
He would write 50 songs in a weekend .
Maybe he knew he was going to die , so he recorded relentlessly .
I bought it at the time because it had one song on it that I 'd play in clubs , but one out of 20 is n't great .
In fact , there are 27 tracks on it - it started the trend of putting loads of songs on rap albums .
Tupac was n't up there with Dylan - Dylan was a brilliant poet .
Eminem is probably the Dylan of rap , whereas Tupac just sounded like he was whining .
Nirvana , Nevermind
Nominated by Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips
It 's better to be overrated than underrated .
Besides , it 's not the musicians ' fault Nevermind is overrated - it's the public 's , or the critics ' .
But you do n't find yourself ever longing to listen to it , because there were - still are , in fact - so many mediocre bands that sound like it , that you 're constantly experiencing it .
I never get out Nevermind and think : what great production , what great songs .
Nevermind had a poisonous , pernicious influence .
It legitimised suffering .
The sainthood of Kurt Cobain overshadows the album : Kurt 's lyrics , his attitudinising and navel - gazing , were hard to separate from the band 's image .
You can never just hear the record .
For me , Bleach and In Utero are superior .
Even the album cover seems cheap : that stupid dollar bill just seems to have been airbrushed in there .
If Alice in Chains had done it , we'd have thought it was a joke , but because it was Nirvana we thought it was oh - so - clever .
If you think you 're going to hear an utterly original , powerful and freaky record when you put on Nevermind , as a young kid might , Christ you 're going to be disappointed .
You 're going to think , " Who is this band that sounds just like Nickelback ?
What are these drug addicts going on about ? "
The Beach Boys , Pet Sounds
Nominated by Luke Pritchard of the Kooks
Of all the albums that get written about as " classics " , this one least deserves it .
Having said that , it contains one of the greatest songs ever written : God Only Knows , which is melancholic yet uplifting , pure yet fucked - up .
But the rest of the record is a total let - down - I felt that way from the very first listen .
Pet Sounds is a million miles away from Sgt Pepper or Dark Side of the Moon .
I do appreciate the lyrics , and I know it 's an album about getting older , but as a concept album , it does n't quite add up .
Good tunes , yes - Would n't It Be Nice is a great pop song - but most of the other tracks just do n't resonate for me .
I apologise unreservedly to everyone who loves every word and note , every last crackle , on this album , but that 's how it is .
Oh , and it 's got the worst sleeve of any major album , ever .
Feeding time at the zoo ?
I do n't think so .
The Stone Roses , The Stone Roses
Nominated by Eddie Argos of Art Brut
They 're totally overrated .
Plus they covered Scarborough Fair .
I do n't understand why people still play their music in nightclubs - it makes me really angry .
When I 'm drunk in a club I usually end up arguing with the DJ who 's playing them .
The Stone Roses were an awful , awful band .
They were uncharismatic , their lyrics are nonsensical and their music is dreary .
Also , we have them to thank for Oasis , although at least Noel Gallagher is funny and Liam is a bit of a pop star .
The Roses make me think of kids older than me swaggering around with bowl haircuts and affecting Manchester accents .
It makes my skin crawl .
And all their fans are so smug : " Oh , you do n't understand it . "
I do understand it !
It 's ridiculous that it regularly gets voted in at the top of those " greatest British album ever " polls .
They spawned a new thug - boy pop culture .
The Strokes , Is This It
Nominated by Ian Williams of Battles
The Strokes were just rich kids from uptown New York ; the children of the heads of supermodel agencies who formed a rock band and thought they deserved respect because of that .
Suddenly the downtown , older form of punk rock got co-opted by the system .
If ever there was a point where Gucci and rebellion were married together , it was right there .
The Strokes have , basically , been responsible for five or six years of a new form of hair metal , in the guise of something more tasteful .
Their music is post - 9/11 party music because it came out that week and everybody wanted to dance .
They 're seen as the rebirth of rock in the UK - but it's a very conservative , old - fashioned idea of rock for the 21st century .
As for their punk credentials , I 'm not going to say anyone 's more authentic than anyone else ...
But the Strokes are the new Duran Duran ; the new decadence for the new millennium .
Television , Marquee Moon
Nominated by Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand
People expect us to love Television the way they think we love Gang of Four and were influenced by them - but we do n't and we were n't !
Marquee Moon is one of those records that I thought I loved , but it was only after a few years I realised I did n't love the album , just the first 10 bars of the title track , which are pretty astonishing .
Those guitars that play off each other and the way the instruments go into wonderful places and the guitars are totally insane and that big cascade of drums - it 's incredible .
Then your attention wanders .
You know when a boring guy is explaining to you the technical spec of a car , the fuel injection system and the leather seats , and his voice becomes so much background noise ?
Once I took the needle off this record , I realised I had n't heard it at all .
But what annoys me is the way people pontificate over the album ; it 's one of those staples of student halls of residence .
People wax lyrical about it , but the reason it 's so popular is because it 's a prog rock album its okay to like .
Because the words " punk " and " New York " and " 1977 " are associated with it , it 's deemed cool .
Really , though , they 're a band who give guys who like 20 - minute guitar solos an excuse .
They were the Grateful Dead of punk , and I always hated all that jam - band stuff .
They have the ethos of a jam - band but the aesthetic of a New York outfit .
If anything , the Strokes took the look of Television , the aesthetic - and the Converse sneakers - and ignored the jam - band aspect .
They took those first 10 bars of Marquee Moon and did something great with it !
Tom Verlaine 's lyrics did n't have much impact on me .
I 'm always uneasy when singers in bands profess to be poets - they can veer into pomposity and pretentiousness .
But I 've got to be careful : I once said something about Jim Morrison and the Doors , about their pseudo - poetry , and immediately all these articles on the internet appeared saying , " Kapranos slams Morrison ! "
I 'm not slamming Television - I respect them .
But Marquee Moon is an album I admire more than enjoy .
The Beatles , Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Nominated by Billy Childish , prime mover of British garage rock
I was a big Beatles fan - I had a Beatles wig and Beatles guitar when I was four - so I know what I 'm talking about , but Sgt Pepper signalled the death of rock 'n'roll .
Rock 'n 'roll is meant to be full of vitality and energy , and this album is n't .
It sounds like it took six months to shit out .
The Beatles were the victims of their success .
This is middle - of - the - road rock music for plumbers .
Or people who drive round in Citroens - the sort of corporate hippies who ruined rock music .
I bought it the day it came out : it was ideal for a seven - year - old .
These days , well , it 's my contention that it represents the death of the Beatles as a rock 'n ' roll band and the birth of them as music hall , which is hardly a victory .
The main problem with Sgt Pepper is Sir Paul 's maudlin obsession with his own self - importance and Dickensian misery .
( Paul McCartney is the dark one in the Beatles , not John Lennon , because he writes such depressing , scary music . )
It 's like a Sunday before school that goes on forever .
It 's too dark and twisted for anyone with any light in their life .
Then again , when he tries to be upbeat , it rings false - like having a clown in the room .
The best thing about the album was the cardboard insert with some medals , a badge and a moustache .
But the military jackets they wore on the front made them look like a bunch of grammar - school boys dressed by their mummy .
When I was in Thee Mighty Caesars we did a rip - off of the sleeve for an album called John Lennon 's Corpse Revisited , featuring the Beatles ' heads on stakes .
This is n't the greatest album ever made ; in fact , it 's the worst Beatles album up to that point .
Live at the Star Club trounces it with ease .
Abba , Arrival
Nominated by Siobhan Donaghy , former Sugababe turned solo artist
I love the Beatles , the Beach Boys , Burt Bacharach , all those great pop melody - writers , but there 's something about Abba that I hate .
Maybe it 's going to parties with shit DJs for most of my childhood that has made me hate them .
Abba were forced on people from my generation , so there 's a natural resentment towards them .
Through my mum I discovered Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix , and if I 'd done that with Abba maybe I 'd have appreciated their brilliant pop songs .
On Arrival , the particularly annoying songs are Dancing Queen , Knowing , Me Knowing You and Money , Money , Money .
And if we 're talking about the reissue , you can add Fernando .
Nick Hornby may well say they 're part of the canon now , but I still do n't have to listen to them .
Yes , they wrote some of the catchiest melodies of all time .
But then , The Birdie Song is catchy , too .
Arcade Fire The Neon Bible
Nominated by Green Gartside of Scritti Politti
People who enjoy this album may think I 'm cloth - eared and unperceptive , and I accept it 's the result of my personal shortcomings , but what I hear in Arcade Fire is an agglomeration of mannerisms , cliches and devices .
I find it solidly unattractive , texturally nasty , a bit harmonically and melodically dull , bombastic and melodramatic , and the rhythms are pedestrian .
It 's monotonous in its textures and in the old - fashioned , nasty , clunky 80s rhythms and eighth - note basslines .
It is n't , as people are suggesting , richly rewarding and inventive .
The melodies stick too closely to the chord changes .
Win Butler 's voice uses certain stylistic devices - it goes wobbly and shouty , then whispery - and I guess people like wobbly and shouty going to whispery , they think it signifies real feeling .
It 's some people 's idea of unmediated emotion .
I can imagine Jeremy Clarkson liking it ; it 's for people in cars .
It 's rather flat and unlovely .
The album and the response to it represent a bunch of beliefs about expression and truth that I do n't share .
The battle against unreconstructed rock music continues .
Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon
Nominated by Tjinder Singh of Cornershop
This album is a sort of lab experiment , put together by scarf - wearing university types .
There 's a certain irony in a song like Money that takes pot -shots at greedy corporations , when this album made so much money .
There 's also irony in these super - wealthy elite prog musicians positing themselves against The Man , having a go at the machine .
The light shows , all the technology and white - coated technicians at their disposal , make them very much part of the machine .
I appreciated the early stuff Pink Floyd did with Joe Boyd , but this is a bloated concept album that made punk necessary .
It says , " What a crazy world it is ! " and " Everyone 's demented ! "
It 's meant to be imbued with the spirit of Syd Barrett , God rest his soul .
I 'm amazed that it 's up there in the pantheon , because I can't see any virtue in it whatsoever .
Lyrically , it 's banal and does n't say anything beyond " greed is bad " .
Radiohead are the 21st - century Floyd , which says it all really .
The Doors LA Woman
Nominated by Craig Finn of the Hold Steady
In America when you 're growing up , you 're subjected to the Doors as soon as you start going to parties and smoking weed .
People think of Jim Morrison as a brilliant rock 'n ' roll poet , but to me it 's unlistenable .
The music meanders , and Morrison was more like a drunk asshole than an intelligent poet .
The worst of the worst is the last song , Riders on the Storm : " There 's a killer on the road / His brain is squirming like a toad " - that 's surely the worst line in rock 'n ' roll history .
He gave the green light to generations of pseuds .
A lot of people told him he was a genius , so he started to believe it .
The Velvets did nihilism and darkness so much better - they were so much more understated ; what they did had subtlety , whereas the Doors had little or none : they were a caricature of " the dark side " .
I actually like Los Angeles , but the Doors represent the city at its most fat , bloated and excessive .
Morrison 's death does give rock some mythic kudos , but that does n't make me want to listen to the music .
In fact , if it comes on the radio , I change the station .
The Smiths Meat Is Murder
Nominated by Jackie McKeown of 1990s
I 'm a Smiths fan and I like most of their records , but this is the weakest link in the canon .
With the debut and The Queen Is Dead , you could cut up Morrissey 's lyrics and they could be pages from the same book .
For Meat Is Murder , he seemed to make a list of topics to write about .
It was a protest album , which defeats the idea of Morrissey as romantic .
The cool - guy cover with Meat Is Murder written on his helmet rams it down your throat .
The title track is offensive , not least because of the loud , gated drums and 80s production that you get on Huey Lewis and the News records .
Morrissey was obviously suffering from a loss of nerve or lack of faith when he wrote these songs .
It took him years to write the first album in his bedroom .
By the second album , he started panicking and pointing fingers at teachers at school and thinking up things like , " Oh , meat is murder and , oh , we 're going to get attacked by thugs in Rusholme . "
Barbarism Begins at Home is where the Smiths betray their jazz - funk session - guy roots ; it 's absolutely treacherous to listen to , even if it was brilliant fun to record .
You can just see the rolled - up jacket sleeves .
It 's everything Morrissey hated .
Meat Is Murder is Red Wedge music for sexless students .
It 's like being stuck in a lift with a Manchester University Socialist Workers ' Party convention .
Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band Trout Mask Replica
Nominated by Peter Hook , ex -New Order and Joy Division
Steve Morris , New Order 's drummer , was a great fan of his , but Beefheart was one of those things I found unlistenably boring .
I desperately wanted to like it because Steve loved it so much , but I had to admit defeat .
Ian Curtis found it easier to convert us to the Doors , put it that way .
Trout Mask was n't a work of untutored genius , it was untutored crap .
When you 're beginning as a musician , people try to educate you with music like this , but I never understood the allure of Captain Beefheart .
I certainly did n't last all four sides .
There are very few records I gave up on , apart from Lou Reed 's Metal Machine Music and Trout Mask Replica .
It sounded like somebody taking the piss .
But then , I 've never been a great fan of jazz , and this erred on the selfish side of jazz .
It sounds like you feel when you 've taken the wrong drugs , like going to your mate 's dope party on speed .
I 'd listen to it with my head in my hands .
Trout Mask was highly regarded by post - punk bands because of its idiosyncratic approach to rhythm and song construction - but those bands were full of shit , were n't they ?
I would n't have put it at the front of my record pile to impress people ; it would have been at the back with my Alvin Stardust and Bay City Rollers records that they sent me from the record club I belonged to at the time .
These days , I would rather listen to the Bay City Rollers than Beefheart .
What kind of heathen dislikes the Velvet Underground and Nico ?
Novelist and music lover Ian Rankin gives his reasons
This is a sacred cow but that does n't mean it can't be turned into hamburger .
You can start before you even listen to the music .
The front of the album bears the name Andy Warhol and a yellow banana - there 's no mention of the band whatsoever .
The back of the album says it was produced by Andy Warhol alongside the Velvets , so straight away I 'm annoyed .
It 's one of the worst - produced albums of all time - put it on a modern hi-fi and you 'll think : this sounds like shit .
It 's muddy , the volume comes and goes , the guitars are all out of tune , as is the viola .
John Cale is one of the great Welshmen , but the viola on Venus In Furs sounds like a Tom and Jerry sound effect .
And Nico's voice is flat throughout - she sings English the way I sing German .
Talk about looks being everything : she was a supermodel trying to sing in a rock band , but she could n't sing - she gave good dirge .
It all flags up that the Velvet Underground were just part of Warhol 's circus , his Factory ; just another product .
Once you start thinking about the Velvets being part of that , the notion of them waiting around for the man is ludicrous .
As far as introducing the idea of nihilism to rock , the first Doors album , which came out the same year , was far better produced , far darker , and more nihilistic .
Ditto the first Mothers of Invention album .
Those two were from the west coast ; the Velvets were from New York .
And this was New York trying too hard .
There 's a line in Venus in Furs about " ermine furs adorn imperious " .
Those are four words that should never appear in a rock song and here they are put together .
And the last two tracks are completely unlistenable : The Black Angel 's Death Song and European Son , which constitute 11 minutes and one fifth of the album .
Nevertheless , as Brian Eno said , almost no one bought this album but the ones who did put a band together , so it was important - as the beginning of the black raincoat brigade .
Forget about magnets on your fridge -- researchers are trying to make magnetic fields do the work of your fridge .
The first milestone in magnetic cooling has been achieved .
Between 5 and 10 degrees of cooling – this was the success criteria for the first milestone in a project involving magnetic cooling at Risø National Laboratory – Technical University of Denmark ( DTU ) .
And the figure is currently at 8.7 °C – this means that a refrigerator at room temperature ( 20 °C ) can be cooled to almost 11°C .
Of course , this is not quite enough to keep the milk cold , but the project ’s test setup also has only the one objective of conducting research in different materials , varying operating conditions and the strength of the magnetic field .
Size is not all that matters !
“ The setup is not the largest of its type , but the most important thing is that it ’s easy to exchange parts in the machine .
With the knowledge that we gain along the way , we will ultimately be able to build the very best magnetic cooling system , ” explains Christian Bahl , a postdoctoral student attached to the project for one year .
More than DKK 21 million in new funding has made it possible to appoint three PhD students this year to work on the MagCool project , and two more PhD students are to be appointed this autumn .
Christian Bahl will also be joined by another two postdoctoral students in 2009 .
How is a magnetic field used for cooling ?
Magnetic cooling technology exploits the fact that when a magnetic material , in this case the element gadolinium , is magnetised , heat is produced as a by - product of entropy .
The principle of entropy is that there will always be a constant amount of order / disorder in a substance .
When the magnet puts the substance in “ order ” , it has to get rid of the excess disorder – and this becomes heat .
Conversely , when the magnetic field is again removed , the substance becomes cold .

The heat is transferred to a fluid that is pumped back and forth past the substance inside a cylinder .
The end that becomes cold will be located inside the refrigerator and the warm end will be outside .
Why magnetic cooling ?
It is natural to wonder :
Why magnetic cooling ?
After all , there are decent and also relatively energy - efficient refrigerators on the market .
But there are three good reasons why this type of cooling has a future .
First , the technology is potentially more energy - efficient than the alternatives .
It only really uses energy to move the magnetic field to and from the magnetic material .
The model currently under development produces the magnetic field through a system of powerful blocks of magnets similar to those we use on our refrigerator doors , only stronger .
These do not get worn out , and thus do not need replacing , which is very good for the environment .
This leads to the second major benefit , namely the fluid , which could turn out to be just plain water .
Consequently , there would not be the same environmental impact as with today ’s compressor - based refrigerators .
The third great potential difference is the noise level .
Bahl expects their demonstration model , which should be ready in 2010 , to be practically silent .
The opportunities are obvious .
“ It is probably not realistic to think that magnetic cooling technology will be used in consumers ’ homes right away .
Manufacturers have spent too many years streamlining the prices of the existing refrigerators .
Initially , it will be about implementation in various types of niche applications – large - scale refrigerating plants , soda machines or places where a noise - free environment is important , ” says Bahl , adding , however , that he believes it will ultimately spread to the rest of society .
advertisement
On a global scale , there are at least ten other teams working on similar projects involving magnetic cooling , but the field has not yet become a major focus area .
The concept of magnetic cooling has been known for many years , but using the technology at room temperature is something relatively new .
Collaboration with industry
At Risø ’s Department of Fuel Cells and Solid State Chemistry , Senior Scientist Nini Pryds has received a grant of approximately DKK 14 million from the Danish Council for Strategic Research Programme Commission on Energy and Environment .
Along with the DKK 7 million that Risø and the three partners – DTU ’s Department of Manufacturing and Engineering Management , Sintex and Danfoss – are investing in the MagCool project , it will be possible to develop a prototype .
Sintex has the expertise in permanent magnetic fields , and the company is currently developing the model of magnets that will produce the powerful magnetic field for Risø ’s test model .
Another objective of the project is to determine whether this technology can pave the way for the super - efficient and environmentally friendly refrigeration machine of the future .
When George W. Bush was running for president in 2000 as a new kind of Republican  the caring kind  he had a ready answer for those skeptical of his moderate views on immigration .
“ Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande , ” he said , again and again .
He was standing up for immigrants who come here seeking better lives for their children , and he repeated the message so often that it stuck .
Now , like so much else in Mr. Bush ’s tattered slogan file , it ’s in danger of coming unstuck .
Negotiators struggling to draft an immigration bill in Washington are being pressured by the White House and Republican leaders to gut the provisions of the law that promote the unity of immigrant families in favor of strictly employment - based programs .
Details are still being sweated out in private , but a draft proposal circulated by the White House and the G.O.P. would eliminate or severely restrict whole categories of family - based immigration in favor of a system that would assign potential immigrants points based on age , skills , education , income and other factors .
Citizens would no longer be able to sponsor siblings and children over 21 , and their ability to bring in parents would be severely limited .
Unattached workers with advanced degrees and corporate sponsors could do all right , but not families , not the moms , pops , sons and daughters who open groceries and restaurants , who rebuild desolate neighborhoods and inspire America with their work ethic and commitment to one another .
The plan would also shut out hundreds of thousands of people who have applied for family visas under current rules and are patiently waiting because of long backlogs .
Brother Jules is angry .
He is looking at his watch in agitation and gripping a wrench tightly .
I 've arrived in Achel , one of Belgium 's six Trappist breweries ( the only other one in the world is just across the border in Holland ) , as part of a pilgrimage across the country to appreciate its fine beers and the monastic way of life .
Yet just over half - way through day one , I 've discovered that the monks ' secretive life also extends to road signs to their holy homes - there are n't any .
I 've been driving up and down pretty country roads , becoming increasingly lost , and it has made me late by an hour - and - a - half .
Brother Jules is less than impressed .
My interpreter , Lucien Jans , a guide from the nearby 16th - century castle Ter Dolen , where I will spend tonight , is using his best Flemish to calm Jules down .
Jans tells me that the monks lead such an ordered and secluded life that they do n't necessarily appreciate any difficulties in finding the place .
Brother Jules , a former baker who became a monk when his wife died eight years ago , was put in the brewery because he knows a thing or two about yeast - an essential part of the beer - making process - and his annoyance fades as he gets on to the intricacies of this .
Many of Belgium 's finest brews can't be bought outside the region in which they are made .
So a trip here is essential if you take beer seriously , and many Belgians treat beer much as the French treat wine .
Trappist beers are in a league of their own , rightly feted for their complex flavours .
The monks brew with an eye for quality rather than quantity , and this is what makes them so special .
A typical pils lager takes three days to brew , but a Trappist beer can take two to three months , with secondary fermentation taking place in the bottle .
Brother Jules tells me that the Trappist breweries still make only as much beer as will provide an income for their needs .
Once it runs out , that 's it .
Achel itself is the only Trappist monastery that has its brewery and cafe inside the abbey .
This means that in Achel you can sip your beer quietly while watching through large glass windows as Brother Jules , wrench in hand , goes about making beer .
It also has a well - stocked shop selling most Belgian beers , and their individual glasses .
Every so often you see Brother Jules run out to go to prayers - seven times a day , in fact .
The monks ' first daily commune with their maker is at 4.30 am , but visitors can join Brother Jules and the others at prayer in the abbey at a public service at 2.15 pm every day .
Belgium 's six Trappist breweries are spread across the country - three in northern Flanders ( Achel , Westmalle and Westvleteren ) , and three further south in Wallonia ( Orval , Chimay and Rochefort ) .
I took the Eurostar to Brussels and spent an evening sipping beer in Le Grain de Sable , a typically cosy and atmospheric Brussels bar , before heading north by hire car into Flanders .
I made a quick stop at Westmalle monastery , an hour - and - a - half north of Brussels .
The monastery itself does n't allow visitors , but its cafe , Trappisten , serves beer , and on request the manager will play a DVD about the making of the beer , presented by one Brother Augustine .
The Westmalle monks make a bottled beer called Extra for their own consumption , and it can be bought only at the Trappisten cafe .
The bottle does n't even have a label .
The monks also make cheese , which you can buy if you walk up through the fields and bang on the big wooden door of the monastery .
Brother Gatekeeper opens up and will invite you inside for a short while in order to exchange hard cash for a giant slab of their cheese , which , not surprisingly , goes down well with a draft of Westmalle .
Later that evening at Ter Dolen ( De Dool on road signs ) castle - which comes with turrets and an enormous romantic log fire - I learn that Belgians need little excuse to brew beer .
As if on cue , Jans presents me with a glass of the castle 's own beer , which they started brewing in 1992 for visitors and locals , and plies me and my girlfriend steadily with the beer until we stumble to bed .
Leaving Flanders the next morning , we travel south to Rochefort in the Ardennes , where the wooded hillsides and valleys offer a rustic playground for walkers .
A late afternoon stroll through the trees in their autumnal colours works up an appetite for even more cosy beer drinking later on .
The Rochefort Trappist brewery is not open to visitors , nor does it have a cafe .
But you can drive in and take a cheeky look around , spotting the big old - fashioned copper tanks through the windows .
I watch the barley malt being pumped down a wooden chute into an old - fashioned tractor .
The mist is rising and , as if on cue , an old monk treads slowly across the yard .
We stay in the Malle Poste in the centre of Rochefort and drink local beer in yet another atmospheric drinking den , the hotel 's candlelit cellar bar .
Our next stop , Orval , is the most accessible of the monasteries and the most impressive , with a complex of mustard - coloured buildings surrounded by forest .
There is an exhibition in an 18th - century cellar and the well , from which the water is drawn to make the beer , lies among the ruins of the original 12th - century abbey .
The monastery has a guesthouse for those interested in learning about monastic life .
But with prayers all day long and little conversation , it is only for the truly committed .
Next stop was the picturesque town of Chimay - two hours from Orval along country lanes .
The Abbaye Notre Dame De Scourmont is set on a gentle hill overlooking farmland and woods .
Visitors are free to wander the secluded garden in the middle of the Abbey and visit the church .
The nearby Auberge de Poteaupre serves , like Westmalle , beer that is made especially for the monks ' own consumption .
From here there are two options : head back to Brussels for the train home or , if you are very organised , make for Westvleteren , the smallest and most secretive of the Trappist breweries .
Just a few kilometres from the First World War Ypres Salient , it is a good base for a combined beer and history tour .
The beer itself is sold in just a few shops , and you can buy it in bulk only from the monastery door .
Recently , punters have had to start calling up to reserve their casks - hence the need for some forward planning .
Back in Brussels , I open the boot of the car and realise that my plan to stock up on the best of the beers has a significant catch .
I can't actually carry it all .
Transferring all the beer from the boot of the car to the Eurostar would be virtually impossible , involving an inordinate amount of expletives - and very sore arms .
Unless you plan to drive all the way here from the UK , bring a trolley to get your purchases home .
Abstaining is n't an option .
This beer is blessed , and the more you taste it the more reluctant you will be to leave any behind .

How do I dislike President George Bush ?
Let me count the ways .
Most of them have to do with his contented assumption that ' faith ' is , in and of itself , a virtue .
This self - satisfied mentality helps explain almost everything , from the smug expression on his face to the way in which , as governor of Texas , he signed all those death warrants without losing a second 's composure .
It explains the way in which he embraced ex-KGB goon Vladimir Putin , citing as the basis of a beautiful relationship the fact that Putin was wearing a crucifix .
( Has Putin been seen wearing that crucifix before or since ?
Did his advisers tell him that the President of the United States was that easy a pushover ? )
It also explains the unforgivable intervention that Bush made into the private life of the Schiavo family : leaving his Texas ranch to try and keep ' alive ' a woman whose autopsy showed that her brain had melted to below flatline a long time before .
Here is a man who believes the ' jury ' is still ' out ' on whether we evolved as a species , who regards stem cell research as something profane , who affects the odd belief that Islam is ' a religion of peace ' .
However that may be , I always agreed with him on one secular question , that the regime of Saddam Hussein was long overdue for removal .
I know some critics of the Iraq intervention attribute this policy , too , to religious motives ( ranging from messianic , born - again Christian piety to the activity of a surreptitious Jewish / Zionist cabal : take your pick ) .
In this real - world argument , there is a very strong temptation for opponents of the war to invoke the lessons of Vietnam .
I must have written thousands of words attempting to show that there is absolutely no analogy between the two conflicts .
Then , addressing the convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars last week , the President came thundering down the pike to announce that a defeat in Iraq would be - guess what ?
- another Vietnam .
As my hand smacks my brow , and as I ask myself not for the first time if Mr Bush suffers from some sort of political death wish , I quickly restate the reasons why he is wrong to join with his most venomous and ignorant critics in making this case .
1 ) The Vietminh , later the Vietnamese NLF , were allies of the United States and Britain against the Axis during the Second World War .
The Iraqi Baath party was on the other side .
2 ) Ho Chi Minh quoted Thomas Jefferson in proclaiming Vietnam 's own declaration of independence , a note that has hardly been struck in Baathist or jihadist propaganda .
3 ) Vietnam was resisting French colonialism and had defeated it by 1954 at Dien Bien Phu ; the real ' war ' was therefore over before the US even landed troops in the country .
4 ) The subsequent conflict was fought to preserve an imposed partition of a country striving to reunify itself ; if anything , the Iraqi case is the reverse .
5 ) The Vietnamese leadership appealed to the UN : the Saddamists and their jihadist allies murdered the first UN envoy to arrive in Iraq , saying that he was fit only for death because he had assisted in securing the independence of East Timor from Indonesia .
6 ) Vietnam never threatened any other country ; Iraq under Saddam invaded two of its neighbours and declared one of them ( Kuwait ) to be part of Iraq itself .
7 ) Vietnam was a victim of chemical and ecological warfare ; Iraq was the perpetrator of such illegal methods and sought to develop even worse nuclear and biological ones .
8 ) Vietnam neither sponsored nor encouraged terrorist tactics beyond its borders ; Iraq under Saddam was a haven for Abu Nidal and other random killers and its ' insurgents ' now proclaim war on Hindus , Jews , unbelievers and the wrong sort of Muslim .
9 ) There has for years been a ' people 's war ' fought by genuine guerrillas in Iraq ; it is the war of liberation conducted by Kurdish fighters against genocide and dictatorship .
Inconveniently for all analogies , these fighters are ranged on the side of the US and Britain .
10 ) The Iraqi Communist party and the Iraqi labour movement advocated the overthrow of Saddam ( if not necessarily by Bush ) , a rather conspicuous difference from the situation in Indochina .
These forces still form a part of the tenuous civil society that is fighting to defend itself against the parties of God .
11 ) The American - sponsored regimes in Vietnam tended , among other things , to be strongly identified with one confessional minority ( Catholic ) to the exclusion of secular , nationalist and Buddhist forces .
The elected government in Iraq may have a sectarian hue , but at least it draws upon hitherto repressed majority populations - Kurds and Shias - and at least the American embassy works as a solvent upon religious and ethnic divisions rather than an inciter of them .
12 ) President Eisenhower admitted that if there had ever been a fair election in Vietnam , it would have been won by Ho Chi Minh ; the Baath party 's successors refused to participate in the Iraqi elections and their jihadist allies declared that democracy was an alien concept and threatened all voters with murder .
13 ) The Americans in Vietnam employed methods ( ' search and destroy ' ; ' body count ' ) and weapons ( napalm , Agent Orange ) that targeted civilians .
Today , those who make indiscriminate war on the innocent show their hand on the streets of Baghdad and are often the proxies of neighbouring dictatorships or of international gangster organisations .
The above list is by no means exhaustive , but will do , I think , as a caution against any glib invocation of historical comparisons .
One might add that among the results of the Vietnamese revolution was an admittedly crude form of market socialism , none the less wedded to ideas of modernisation ; a strong resistance to Chinese expansionism ( one excuse for Washington 's invasion ) ; and a military expedition to depose the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia .
I cannot see how any self - respecting Republican can look at this record without wincing and moaning with shame or how any former friend of the Vietnamese can equate them with either a fascist dictatorship or a nihilistic Islamist death - squad campaign .
And now Bush has joined forces with anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan in making the two struggles morally equivalent .
It is true that the collapse of the doomed American adventure in Indochina was followed by massive repression and reprisal , especially in Cambodia , and by the exile of huge numbers of talented Vietnamese .
But even this grim total was small compared to the huge losses exacted by the war itself .
In Iraq , the genocide , repression , aggression and cultural obliteration preceded the coalition 's intervention and had been condemned by a small but impressive library of UN resolutions .
Thus , the argument from ' bloodbath ' , either past or future , has to be completely detached from any consideration of the Vietnamese example .
Bush made his speech just as French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner , a distinguished socialist and humanitarian , visited Baghdad and embraced some Iraqi and Kurdish freedom fighters , such as President Jalal Talabani , the leader of a party that is a member of the Socialist International .
It takes a special kind of political and moral idiocy to choose such a moment to wax nostalgic for America 's inheritance of a moribund French colonialism in Indochina .
If one question is rightly settled in the American and , indeed , the international memory , it is that the Vietnam War was at best a titanic blunder and at worst a campaign of atrocity and aggression .
But not all the ironies are at Bush 's expense .
Change only the name of the analogous country and it becomes fairly clear that in Iraq we are fighting not the Vietcong , but the Khmer Rouge , as the Vietcong eventually had to do on our behalf .
The logic of history is pitiless and Bush is not the only one who will find this out .

Global Revolution
Defining Revolution The Myth of Speed
" Quick change " is what many of us associate with political revolution .
Consider the drama of the French Revolution 's Women 's March on Versailles : a large mob reacted violently and rapidly to royal indifference .
Or , consider the bread shortages : peasants , both in the streets of Paris and the rural countryside , spontaneously rioted over a lack of food , political representation , and power .
Or , consider more modern symbols of revolution : students stepped in front of Chinese tanks in Tiananmen Square , imploring them to halt .
Despite the drama we associate with these events , Revolution is rarely a speedy occurence .
The Women 's March was a culmination of many years of sublimation , poverty , and increasing anti-royal sentiment as were the French peasant riots .
Even the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were responding to policies that dated as far back as Mao 's leadership , which formally began in 1949 .
Who Leads Revolutions ?
Another common misconception is that revolutions happen when ordinary people join together and rise up against authority .
For a revolution to really take hold , a large section of a population typically does need to feel a pressing need for societal change .
However , revolutions are historically led by people who are not " just plain folks . "
Revolutionary leaders usually possess something extra : additional education , connections to existing authority , a leadership position within the repressed community , or simply a profound charisma or oratory gift that helps them influence , persuade and lead .
This does n't mean that revolutionary leaders do not empathize with their followers ; indeed , many have lived the same struggles .
But this is not always the case .
In the French Revolution , The Jacobins , led by Maximilien Robespierre , initially based their actions on the populist sentiments of Jean - Jacques Rousseau and worked to make a better life for the poor .
However , Robespierre had not exactly experienced the struggle of those he represented .
He was highly educated as a lawyer , was a royal appointee at the original Estates General , and — perhaps most importantly — had a profound ability to write and deliver eloquent , fiery speeches .
A Messy Affair
Although many definitions of revolution refer to one government replacing another , the process is usually not nearly as tidy .
Revolutions are ambiguous , messy things , constantly " morphing " and undergoing revision and redefinition .
During the French Revolution 's approximately ten - year history , new political groups , parties , and factions constantly emerged .
And even within parties , splinter groups were quick to develop .
Not to mention , revolutions that are founded on violence rarely have smooth and easy transitions .
Instead , it is typical that revolutionary regimes , especially those with a bloody start , often have difficulties in settling and establishing new , lasting traditions .
For example , the violence applied to overturn France 's Ancient Regime eventually turned one revolutionary faction against another , resulting in thousands of deaths before the Revolution was declared officially over in 1799 .
Beyond Political Revolutions
The term " revolution " can refer to many types of massive change that affect society in profound ways .
For example , the British Agricultural Revolution , which happened between the 16th and 19th centuries , refers to a time of extraordinary agricultural output , mostly due to better farming methods and mechanization .
Does n't sound like it would have much impact beyond the fields ?
Not so : this upturn in agricultural success supported a huge population growth , which freed a lot of workers to leave farming and pour into the workforce , eventually sparking the Industrial Revolution and early 19th century international phenomenon , saw manual labor being replaced by mechanized tools , thus profoundly changing the way the world worked , traveled , and lived .
The concept of revolution also reaches into other areas of daily life .
The Italian Renaissance of the 15th century was a time when the way in which the Western world created art , wrote poetry , designed architecture , and even absorbed knowledge , was overhauled , kicking off what is often labeled as the beginning of the " modern " epoch .
Social revolutions include the Sexual Revolution , when the invention of the birth control pill in 1960 offered women access to reliable contraception .
Social scientists theorize that this pharmaceutical development impacted sexual behavior , attitudes , and more throughout the Western world , and redefined women 's views of education and career .
Finally , the computer on which you 're reading this was developed during the Digital Revolution , which refers to an ongoing transformation that began in the early 1980s .
The plummeting cost and rapid improvement of digital devices made these tools more widely available , affecting the way we do our jobs , entertain ourselves , and even communicate with one another .
Social websites are all the rage right now , and are not just hyped by the media ( MySpace and YouTube in particular ) , but there are also large amounts of money involved ( again , MySpace and YouTube ) .
But does the social model make sense for data analysis and visualization ?
And will users play and interact with data the way they do with other media ?
Two websites were launched recently to find out : Swivel.com ( defunct as of late 2010 ) and Many Eyes .
Here is a first review , looking at the two sites in terms of their founders , approach , social aspects , technology , capabilities , broad appeal , and ethics .
The Need
While the tools for creating charts and basic visualizations from data are available to everybody ( and for free too , thanks to projects like OpenOffice ) , there is still a lack of knowledge how to properly use them .
Most people have created a basic bar or pie chart before , but few realize how much you can do with even the few simple tools in Excel .
What is more , very little data is freely available .
If I want to put my sales data or the price of oil into context , where do I get the data from ?
The makers of Swivel make some good points about data being locked up , as does Hans Rosling ( in a totally different context ) .
How much more could we know if all that data was made available and easy to access ?
So social data sharing and visualization websites could have an enormous impact on the world , by giving many people access to a lot of data that would otherwise be hard or impossible to obtain .
And they can expose a lot of people to visualization that would not otherwise see good uses visualization techniques , and to learn from others how to make the most of them .
Visualization also needs to break out of the academic world and do something for real people with real data and real questions .
The existence of these sites , and the fact that money is being spent on them , means that visualization is growing up , and in a few years will hopefully be part of mainstream technology the way other electronic media are today .
Founders
Both websites are small ventures , and the differences in approach can be tracked back easily to the people who run them .
Swivel is clearly a business , with people working full - time on the site , venture capital , and a plan on how to eventually make money .
It was started by Dmitry Dimov and Brian Mulloy , two physics graduates , and is backed by venture capital from Cnet founder Halsey Minor .
They have a total of seven employees , and three advisors : Minor and a colleagues of his , plus a university professor at Berkeley who is working in databases and networks .
Swivel was founded in 2005 ( around the same time as YouTube ) , had a private beta for several months , and launched its public “ preview ” version of the site on December 6 , 2006 .
When I first heard of about Swivel , I immediately looked at their About page to see if I recognized any names .
I did n’t , and I was quite disappointed .
Visualization people are not exactly known for their business abilities , but I would have expected to see at least one familiar person to do some consulting for them .
This is especially important in the case of Swivel , whose makers seem to be completely unaware of the work that is being done in information visualization .
Many Eyes can be seen as the answer from the visualization side .
The site is run by IBM ’s new Visual Communication Lab , which includes three young but prolific visualization researchers : Martin Wattenberg , Fernanda Viégas , and Frank van Ham .
All three of them have made an impact in the visualization world , and are actively publishing at the relevant conferences .
The lab has a total of five people , who are not working full - time on the site , though .
The group ’s history is not easy to track , but Wattenberg started at IBM in 2002 , and Viégas and van Ham apparently joined him last year .
Many Eyes was launched January 23 , 2007 .
Many Eyes exists in a much more academic setting than Swivel , with less resources and no discernible business plan .
IBM can probably run the site for years without the need for profit , and they may even consider it more of a marketing effort and keep it like that .
One important question for Many Eyes is therefore its longer - term sustainability , especially if it gets more popular and requires more resources to run .
Approach
Uploading a data set is quite similar in Swivel and Many Eyes , with Swivel offering more options in addition to pasting a tab - separated file ( CSV upload and scraping off a website ) .
Many Eyes is more interactive here , extracting the column headers and seemingly understanding what is going on .
Swivel requires the user to input the data without too much help .
Once the data is uploaded the two sites start to differ .
While Many Eyes offers a simple “ visualize ” button for the new dataset , Swivel creates a number of visualizations automatically .
This mechanism is apparently central to Swivel ’s strategy : impress with numbers .
Swivel ’s start page now boasts over one million graphs , and the number is growing quickly ( around 15,000 per day ) .
These charts are based on only around 2,400 data sets , which means that there is an average of 450 graphs per data set .
Most of these are obviously useless , and the number of graphs is thus artificially inflated to an extent that is ridiculous .
It does explain the description of Swivel as “ YouTube for data ” though , a slogan that was used for a short time when it was launched .
But it also means that Swivel needs to be very careful if it wants to be taken seriously , since outrageous claims do not exactly build trust .
Many Eyes , in contrast , has fewer graphs than data sets , which seems much more plausible .
There seem to be a lot of data sets that were uploaded as tests or needed to be redone , but which were never deleted .
The signal - to - noise ratio is therefore much higher on Many Eyes .
Swivel ’s business model is to eventually sell subscriptions to its professional edition to users who want to use its capabilities on their own data and compare that data to all the public data on the site – but who do not want to share their data with the entire Internet .
The question of course is whether these users will trust Swivel with their valuable proprietary data , and see enough value in Swivel ’s own tools to take that risk ( cost probably wo n’t be an issue , at least not in comparison ) .
After all , they can always download the public data from Swivel and use it with their own tools .
Social Aspects
Both sites have interesting approaches to making data analysis more social .
Both allow users not only to upload and visualize data , but also to download the data that exists on the sites .
This is very useful , as it provides badly needed access to a huge variety of data .
Both sites also allow users to comment on graphs , though this is handled better in Many Eyes .
Since you can interact with the visualization , you can include a snapshot of what you were looking at when you submitted the comment .
That snapshot then becomes a link that will take another user to exactly the same configuration of the visualization , even including search terms ( e.g. , in a treemap ) .
There are also forums on Many Eyes , though they require a separate login name , and as of writing this they mostly contain spam .
Well - integrated forums would do wonders for both of these sites , though they obviously require a lot of work .
More structured / threaded comments would perhaps be a start , like the ones in Drupal .
Existing visualizations can be changed easily in Swivel .
There is an Edit
This button that allows you to change the style ( colors , etc. ) and graph types , and a Compare function that allows you to add other data .
Both allow you to save the result as a new graph ( or as the same one , if you made it yourself ) .
I do n’t really understand why these are separate functions , since adding new data might require changing some of the visualization styles to make sense of it .
But these are the functions that make it easy to create new things from existing graphs and data , and thus really take advantage of what has been done before .
Many Eyes is missing such a function , and only partially makes up for it through interaction and snapshots .
Adding data to an existing visualization requires the user to completely regenerate it from scratch first .
To throw out another buzzword , that is not very enabling .
Swivel also has tags and graphs can be rated by users .
Both are kind of obvious features of Web 2.0 sites , and their lack ( at least of the tagging ) is a definite loss for Many Eyes .
Tags provide easy and democratic means of navigation , and are basically a must for a highly interactive website .
Ratings are not nearly as useful or necessary , but they provide the mechanisms for the ever popular “ highest rated ” lists .
The interactivity and live snapshot ideas of Many Eyes combined with the editing and comparison features of Swivel plus a well - integrated forum would make for one killer of a data analysis website .
Technology
Swivel is built using AJAX , while Many Eyes uses Java .
The technology is a key factor in these websites , for both ease of access for the user and development effort for the developers .
Just looking at Swivel ’s graphs requires no more than a web browser that can display images , and that is clearly a plus .
Interaction is done through JavaScript , which , despite its quirks and overall ugliness , has become the tool of choice for interactive websites .
All images are generated on the server , which produces a potential bottleneck in the future ( and apparently already has , the site was incredibly slow at the beginning of January , but is now very usable ) .
But again , it works on most modern browsers without any effort on the part of the user .
Many Eyes ’ use of Java is understandable from an academic perspective , and also from the fact that this is done by IBM ( which has done a lot more for Java than Sun ) .
But it has also been called a “ brave decision ” by a user on the forums , and for a good reason .
As great as Java is for programming , its use in browsers is becoming a nightmare .
And while having Java installed could be taken for granted a few years ago , this is not longer the case .
Microsoft has done a lot of work towards that end , and users have gotten used to seeing interactive stuff in Flash , or using AJAX , rather than Java .
The makers of Many Eyes also mean it when they say that on the Mac , the site is “ best viewed in Safari ” : the mouse coordinates are off by quite a bit in Firefox and Camino , which is odd ( I have n’t seen that before ) .
But of course Java has one great advantage : interaction .
The interactive features of Many Eyes are wonderful , and would be a major nightmare to code in AJAX or Flash .
There is also a lot of existing code in Java that its makers are undoubtedly using , and so they were able to launch the site much faster .
Another aspect that should not be ignored is server load .
Having the client draw the images means a lot less server power is necessary to keep the site going .
Still , I think that Many Eyes will need to consider using either AJAX or Flash or be limited to a fairly small ( and shrinking ) potential audience because of its use of Java .
And that would be a real shame .
Swivel uses an open - source graphing library called Ploticus , which produces static graphics and also has the ability to generate image maps for interaction .
They seem to be very keen on not coding their own graphics , which strikes me as a strange limitation .
2D InfoVis is not exactly rocket science , and there is a lot of good literature out there on visualization techniques that are described well enough for a competent programmer to implement in very short time .
Swivel acknowledges that Many Eyes has a larger variety of graphical capabilities ( they call it “ Tufte on Steroids ” ) , which seems to indicate that they will want to stick with line and bar charts .
Many Eyes ’ makers have a much broader horizon on visualization , and quite obviously do all the programming themselves .
This leads not only to a much greater variety of visualization techniques and interaction ( see below ) , but also to the prospect of an expanding set of visualizations , and the implementation of cutting - edge work .
Capabilities
Swivel offers a total of four visualization techniques : vertical and horizontal bar charts , scatterplots , and line charts .
The data can be shown as absolute value , difference from the average ( in the data set ) , and as a percentage of the largest value .
The user can change the colors of the background and lines , which is a necessary feature to keep all the graphs from looking the same .
In contrast , Many Eyes offers more than a dozen visualization types , and that ’s not even counting bar charts twice .
There are zoomable maps of the world and the US ( for showing states ) ; standard line graphs , stacked line graphs , and line graphs for categories ( which can be hierarchical ) ; bar charts , block histograms , and bubble charts ; scatterplots and network diagrams ; pie charts , treemaps and change treemaps ( which are really just a different mapping of data onto treemaps ) .
Many Eyes ’ classification of visualization options is simple but very useful , and a great guide to show users what to try out to answer specific questions .
All of Many Eyes ’ visualizations are interactive , allowing the user to query exact numbers , zoom , etc .
This is especially useful ( and necessary ) in the case of maps and treemaps .
The ability to create live snapshots for comments is also an excellent feature that is worth mentioning again .
The resulting graphs look much nicer on Many Eyes , and are also easier to read .
The legends in Swivel ’s graphs are badly laid out ( why not align them ? ) , and the color spots next to the descriptions are too small too small to be clearly seen and matched with the colors of the lines .
In addition to the visualization , Swivel does some data analysis .
It calculates a measure of correlation for all possible pairs of data dimensions present in the graph , and shows them as bar graphs .
Like with the automatic creation of graphs from data , this feature creates a lot of unnecessary and often nonsensical information .
If the correlations were displayed in a matrix rather than as individual bars ( i.e. , using some fairly straight - forward information visualization ) , the presentation would make more sense and use up a lot less space ( for n data dimensions , they calculate correlations for all n*( n - 1 ) / 2 pairs , i.e. , for seven curves this makes 21 correlations ) .
Swivel warns the users that correlation does not equal causation , which is a good thing .
What Many Eyes is missing is mixing and matching ( or “ mashing up ” ) of parts of different data sets , not just one .
The navigation for this is a bit clumsy in Swivel , but the ability to put the data into a different context and compare it to other data makes the site a lot more interesting .
This feature is a real requirement if users want to make more of the data they have uploaded than getting it visualized .
Both Swivel and Many Eyes handle the comparison of numbers surprisingly badly .
When combining more than one data dimension , Swivel converts all numbers to percentages , and puts them on the same scale .
This does not make sense in many cases , and makes it impossible to read the real numbers when an interesting development is found .
Many
Eyes does not convert the numbers , but can only handle one scale , which is also rather limiting .
This is not some weird and unusual use case , but what real people do with real data all the time – and can easily do in Excel ( and there are even clever stacking techniques ) .
Both Swivel and Many Eyes should be able to handle two axes , and Many Eyes ’ interactive features should make it easy to use more than two .
What is also missing from both sites is the ability to mix different graph types .
This is especially useful when showing not just absolute values , but also rates of change .
There are good reasons to show the values as bar charts and the change as lines , for example .
And who knows , perhaps I want to add some more data as points ?
This should be fairly easy to do for Many Eyes , but may be a limitation of the Ploticus library Swivel is using .
While both sites can handle whole numbers and floats , Swivel also understands dates and handles them well .
Many
Eyes does not seem to recognize dates , but can deal with hierarchical categories and graphs .
In terms of capabilities , Many Eyes wins hands down .
Of course , Swivel ’s focus is a slightly different one , but they still need to provide some more useful techniques and cannot limit themselves to not even include pie charts .
Treemaps are also making inroads into the world of business intelligence , so users who are familiar with data analysis tools will expect to see more than just the bare minimum in visualization .
And besides , there are no data analysis capabilities other than the charts and the simple correlation calculation on Swivel yet .
The only big thing Many Eyes is missing is a way to combine data from different data sets into one visualization .
This is a big one , though , that they will need to address soon .
Broad Appeal
Both sites seamlessly fit into the whole social bookmarking / blogging world .
They provide HTML snippets to include graphs in blogs and on other websites , and Swivel also has a Digg It ! link on every graph page .
Swivel ’s embedding function allows for a lot of customization , including a “ Sparkline ” version ( which is just a scaled down version of the graph , and not very useful – true sparklines would be great , though ) .
Interestingly ( and slightly unnervingly ) , Swivel embedded images are “ alive ” , i.e. , the settings are not included in the code you paste into your page , but the images react to changes you make on the Swivel page – even after they have been embedded .
Many Eyes has a similar function that creates a very nice and compact thumbnail , but does not allow you to embed a larger snapshot of the visualization ( at least not directly ) .
The link simply points to the visualization , and does not take parameters or interactions into account ( like the comment thumbnail directly on the page does ) .
This seems to be the only category where Many Eyes wins in terms of simplicity , and where Swivel has a lot more options than are really needed .
Swivel also has topical charts , like one for Valentine ’s Day and one on taxes right now .
These make for easy link targets for blogs , and undoubtedly create a lot of hits on the site .
Swivel ’s style is also more like that of established social activity sites like Digg and Flickr than Many Eyes .
In a word , Swivel is simply prettier , and looks more modern .
Ethics
I had not expected to be writing about ethics in this review , but Swivel is doing a few things that deserve to be discussed in a bit more depth .
Among the featured graphs on Swivel ’s page right now is the one below .
It seems to show the number of people speaking a specific language at home , and their ability to speak English ( in American households ) , and there is a strong correlation between the two .
But while the blue bars show the percentage of people who think they speak English “ very well ” , the red bars simply show the rest .
The strong correlation between these two numbers is therefore not very surprising , since there is a simple mathematical dependency between them .
This is simply chart junk , and while Swivel can’t keep their users from producing meaningless charts , they are very unwise to promote this kind of nonsense on their front page .
The second issue I have are their inflated numbers .
Their claim of over a million graphs may be technically correct , but only a tiny fraction of these were generated by users , and most of them make no sense at all .
I understand that they are trying to create a buzz , and that they are fighting for media attention among such established hype targets as MySpace and YouTube .
But doing this with such questionable means cannot be in their best interest , and will hurt them in the long run .
To be fair , Swivel also scores some positive points in the ethics department .
They provide the means to include a data citation and URL where the data came from directly into the graph , thus adding both weight ( if the data comes from a reputable source , and not just somebody ’s imagination ) and credit to the original source(s ) .
Many
Eyes only shows that information on the graph ’s website , but it ’s missing when somebody posts a screenshot .
Swivel also warns its users that correlation and causation are not the same thing .
Conclusions
Swivel needs to tone down the hype and grow up .
They are not YouTube , and data visualization is n’t nearly as sexy and mass marketable as video sharing .
They can only live on the Digg crowd for so long , at some point they will need to appeal to more sophisticated customers that are actually willing to spend money .
Those will see through their marketing buzz and will demand more capabilities .
Playing with data is great , but it will only take them so far .
Many Eyes needs to rethink Java .
They undoubtedly have good reasons to use it , and in a perfect world they would be right .
In this world , however , Java is more a stumbling block than an enabling technology on the browser end today , and this will severely limit their reach .
One of their challenges will be to provide cutting - edge visualization tools in a way that people can actually use .
Easier editing and better interoperability between their already large number of visualizations should make the service much more attractive .
They should also present an idea where they are trying to go with this , if the site will exist for a longer time , or just disappear once IBM stops believing that anything can come of it .
So yes , there is a lot to criticize , and I am not shy about doing that .
Both websites are a great start , but have a long way to go .
It is great to see that social websites are not just used for sharing videos of sleeping kittens any more , but for collaboratively making sense of our world .
Warner Bros. are planning a live - action adaptation of DC Comics ' Green Lantern and have hired Greg Berlanti to co-write and direct , according to a report in The Hollywood Reporter .
The + Green+Lantern+in+action+in+the+DC+Comic+series .
The Green Lantern is one of DC Comics ' most enduring and popular characters .
Created in 1940 , the story revolves around test pilot Hal Jordan , who is charged with defending a section of the universe after he finds a powerful ring that gives him infinite powers , including flight and invisibility .
So who is Greg Berlanti ?
His only previous directing credit was the 2000 rom-com The Broken Hearts Club , although since then he 's worked regularly in TV , writing and executive - producing the likes of Dawson 's Creek , Everwood and Brothers and Sisters .
Co-writing the script will be Marc Guggenheim and Michael Green , who between them have written for the Superman / Batman , Amazing Spiderman , Wolverine and Blade comics .
Rumours surrounding a Green Lantern adaptation have been circulating for years , with Jack Black at one stage attached to a comedy version of the title .
However , according to reports , Berlanti met with DC execs last year and successfully lobbied to direct the project .
His pitch included 30 images of key scenes drawn up by a concept artist , as well as ideas for a franchise , with the first instalment being an origin movie detailing how Jordan became a member of the Green Lantern corps .
" To me this is the last great comic book movie that has n't been made , " Berlanti told THR .
" It was a comic book with a real mythology that you would see in a lot of the space operas and sci - fi books .
The best part about it , anybody can become one of the Green Lanterns because anyone can end up with that ring .
" The Green Lantern character is already set to make a big screen appearance in the forthcoming Justice League movie , although that will feature the John Stewart iteration of the character - who took over from Jordan in the 1970s .
Simply put , this is most creative abstinence billboard we ’ve ever seen .
I mean , what does being an engineer have to do with it ?
( Thanks , Jake )

October 31st , 2007
Please indulge me by re-reading this extended passage from Synthetic Environments for Analysis and Simulation :
Remember Russell
Tice , the NSA SIGINT officer who had knowledge of a special access NSA operation that was so disturbing that he tried to tell the U.S. Congress about it ?
What was Tice talking about here :
Tice said his information is different from the Terrorist Surveillance Program that Bush acknowledged in December and from news accounts this week that the NSA has been secretly collecting phone call records of millions of Americans .
“ It ’s an angle that you have n’t heard about yet , ” he said .
An angle that we have n’t heard about .
Since everyone and his dog knows about the mass surveillance , what could that angle be ?
More recently , Tice said that the NSA intercepts of civilian traffic is “ the tip of the iceberg ” and says , again , that there is something else , something we still do n’t know about .
Here ’s part of the interview between Tice and Reason :
REASON : What prompted you to step forward now ?
Tice :
Well , I ’ve known this for a long time and I ’ve kept my mouth shut …
REASON : You ’re referring to what James Risen calls “ The Program , ” the NSA wiretaps that have been reported on ?
Tice :
No , I ’m referring to what I need to tell Congress that no one knows yet , which is only tertiarily connected to what you know about now .
Ok , so the outrage that Tice was willing to ruin his life over is only “ tertiarily connected ” to the operation we already new about .
Tice continues :
In my case , there ’s no way the programs I want to talk to Congress about should be public ever , unless maybe in 200 years they want to declassify them .
You should never learn about it ; no one at the Times should ever learn about these things .
The surveillance side of this is the chickenfeed .
There ’s something far more sinister than the simple surveillance … an angle we have n’t heard about yet .
Tice never did tell his story to Congress about this different aspect of the program .
Well , my guess is that it has something to do with providing surveillance data for this SEAS World Sim thing , and that individual Americans are being watched and potentially targeted with it .
Tice ’s background seems to involve a lot of traditional electronic warfare , radar and ELINT stuff .
Maybe
Tice ’s deal involved the collection of the mobile phone GPS and / or triangulation data which would provide realtime spacial / geographic data to the SEAS system .
In other words , SEAS sees you .
They could bring up a map of a city and plot your path based on the information that your phone is exchanging with the mobile network .
— End Excerpt —
In summary , my thesis was that the NSA operation that Tice was involved with was related to tracking individual Americans , on the ground , in real time , using the mobile phone networks .
Ok , now , Wired ’s Threat Level just published a story about Hancock , an AT&T programming language that was designed for parsing large blocks of data for surveillance purposes .
Within the context of my theory above — about the operation Tice was involved with — look at this :
Programs written in Hancock work by analyzing data as it flows into a data warehouse .
That differentiates the language from traditional data - mining applications which tend to look for patterns in static databases .
A 2004 paper published in ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems shows how Hancock code can sift calling card records , long distance calls , IP addresses and internet traffic dumps , and even track the physical movements of mobile phone customers as their signal moves from cell site to cell site .
All of these tidbits …
It ’s all the same operation .
They have an unthinkable surveillance capability that includes all of your email , web , purchasing and telephone activity .
And , if I ’m right , they ’re keeping track of where you are and where you ’ve been .
Oh yeah , wave at the birdy .
I know .
It ’s too incredible .
Impossible , you might think .
What ’s impossible is trying to grasp what the intelligence agencies did with $ 43.5 billion just in 2007 .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Incompetence .
Inefficiency .
Ripoffs .
The usual $ 4000 toilet seat refrain .
Fine .
But if that ’s your perspective , what ’s your theory about the operation Tice was involved with ?
They got something for the billions of dollars spent on this crap over the last several years and I ’m pretty sure that it knows more about all of us than we can imagine .
There ’s no way the programs I want to talk to Congress about should be public ever , unless maybe in 200 years they want to declassify them .
You should never learn about it …
Via : Wired :
From the company that brought you the C programming language comes Hancock , a C variant developed by AT&T researchers to mine gigabytes of the company ’s telephone and internet records for surveillance purposes .
An AT&T research paper published in 2001 and unearthed today by Andrew Appel at Freedom to Tinker shows how the phone company uses Hancock - coded software to crunch through tens of millions of long distance phone records a night to draw up what AT&T calls “ communities of interest ” — i.e. , calling circles that show who is talking to whom .
The system was built in the late 1990s to develop marketing leads , and as a security tool to see if new customers called the same numbers as previously cut - off fraudsters — something the paper refers to as “ guilt by association . ”
But it ’s of interest to THREAT LEVEL because of recent revelations that the FBI has been requesting “ communities of interest ” records from phone companies under the USA PATRIOT
Act without a warrant .
Where the bureau got the idea that phone companies collect such data has , until now , been a mystery .
According to a letter from Verizon to a congressional committee earlier this month , the FBI has been asking Verizon for “ community of interest ” records on some of its customers out to two generations — i.e. , not just the people that communicated with an FBI target , but also those who talked to people who talked to an FBI target .
Verizon , though , does n’t create those records and could n’t comply .
Now it appears that AT&T invented the concept and the technology .
It even owns a patent on some of its data mining methods , issued to two of Hancock ’s creators in 2002 .
Programs written in Hancock work by analyzing data as it flows into a data warehouse .
That differentiates the language from traditional data - mining applications which tend to look for patterns in static databases .
A 2004 paper published in ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems shows how Hancock code can sift calling card records , long distance calls , IP addresses and internet traffic dumps , and even track the physical movements of mobile phone customers as their signal moves from cell site to cell site .
With Hancock , “ analysts could store sufficiently precise information to enable new applications previously thought to be infeasible , ” the program authors wrote .
Turkey has been building up forces on its border with Iraq
He said EU nations were not arresting or extraditing PKK members .
Turkey has regularly asked countries to do more against the PKK , which the EU regards as a terrorist group .
Mr Erdogan was speaking after talks between Turkey and Iraq ended without progress on Iraqi proposals to stop PKK attacks on Turkey from Iraq .
Turkey has warned it will not tolerate more cross - border raids and has massed troops along the border .
Hundreds of people held demonstrations in Turkish cities on Saturday , condemning the PKK and calling for action .
Mr Erdogan questioned the sincerity of EU nations on the PKK issue .
THE PKK Formed in late 1970s Launched armed struggle in 1984 Dropped independence demands in 1990s Wants greater autonomy for Turkey 's Kurds Leader Abdullah Ocalan arrested in 1999 Ended five - year ceasefire in 2004 Called a terrorist organisation by Turkey , the EU and US
Mountain meeting with PKK
" No EU country has extradited members of the PKK to Turkey , despite labelling it as a terrorist organisation , " Mr Erdogan said on Turkish TV .
He did not mention any European nation by name .
But he did refer to a recent disagreement with Austria over its refusal to arrest a senior PKK member who then boarded a plane to northern Iraq , AFP news agency reported .
Ground attack threat
Talks in the Turkish capital Ankara between Turkish and Iraqi officials were aimed at heading off military action by Turkey 's armed forces across their common border , after a series of attacks on Turkish troops by rebel Kurdish fighters based in northern Iraq .
But the talks ended without progress on Friday and no further meetings were planned .
The Iraqi delegation said the proposals put forward were practical , realistic and feasible , according to the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad .
The proposals included using multinational forces - presumably Americans - to monitor the border , the rehabilitation and strengthening of old Iraqi border posts , the closure of what it called illegal bases and steps to dry up the PKK 's finances , our correspondent says .
Turkey had said the Iraqi proposals would have taken too long to take effect .
Turkey wants the PKK 's mountain bases in the far north of Iraq closed and the leadership handed over .
Mr Erdogan is due to meet US President George W Bush in Washington on 5 November .
A senior Turkish general suggested that Turkey 's threat to launch a ground offensive into Iraq would not be carried out before that meeting .
" The armed forces will carry out a cross - border offensive when assigned , " NTV television quoted General Yasar Buyukanit as saying on Friday .
" Prime Minister Erdogan 's visit to the United States is very important , we will wait for his return . "
Turkish military and civilian leaders have also recommended economic measures against northern Iraq , which relies heavily on Turkey for food and electricity .
The PKK - which is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey , the US , and the EU - is thought to have about 3,000 rebels based in Iraq .
Still waiting for swap prefetch
It has been almost two years since LWN covered the swap prefetch patch .
This work , done by Con Kolivas , is based on the idea that if a system is idle , and it has pushed user data out to swap , perhaps it should spend a little time speculatively fetching that swapped data back into any free memory that might be sitting around .
Then , when some application wants that memory in the future , it will already be available and the time - consuming process of fetching it from disk can be avoided .
The classic use case for this feature is a desktop system which runs memory - intensive daemons ( updatedb , say , or a backup process ) during the night .
Those daemons may shove a lot of useful data to swap , where it will languish until the system 's user arrives , coffee in hand , the next morning .
Said user 's coffee may well grow cold by the time the various open applications have managed to fault in enough memory to function again .
Swap prefetch is intended to allow users to enjoy their computers and hot coffee at the same time .
There is a vocal set of users out there who will attest that swap prefetch has made their systems work better .
Even so , the swap prefetch patch has languished in the - mm tree for almost all of those two years with no path to the mainline in sight .
Con has given up on the patch ( and on kernel development in general ) :
The window for 2.6.23 has now closed and your position on this is clear .
I 've been supporting this code in - mm for 21 months since 16 - Oct - 2005 without any obvious decision for this code forwards or backwards .
I am no longer part of your operating system 's kernel 's world ; thus I cannot support this code any longer .
Unless someone takes over the code base for swap prefetch you have to assume it is now unmaintained and should delete it .
It is an unfortunate thing when a talented and well - meaning developer runs afoul of the kernel development process and walks away .
We can not afford to lose such people .
So it is worth the trouble to try to understand what went wrong .
Problem # 1 is that Con chose to work in some of the trickiest parts of the kernel .
Swap prefetch is a memory management patch , and those patches always have a long and difficult path into the kernel .
It 's not just Con who has run into this : Nick Piggin 's lockless pagecache patches have been knocking on the door for just as long .
The LWN article on Wu Fengguang 's adaptive readahead patches appeared at about the same time as the swap prefetch article - and that was after your editor had stared at them for weeks trying to work up the courage to write something .
Those patches were only merged earlier this month , and , even then , only after many of the features were stripped out .
Memory management is not an area for programmers looking for instant gratification .
There is a reason for this .
Device drivers either work or they do not , but the virtual memory subsystem behaves a little differently for every workload which is put to it .
Tweaking the heuristics which drive memory management is a difficult process ; a change which makes one workload run better can , unpredictably , destroy performance somewhere else .
And that " somewhere else " might not surface until some large financial institution somewhere tries to deploy a new kernel release .
The core kernel maintainers have seen this sort of thing happen often enough to become quite conservative with memory management changes .
Without convincing evidence that the change makes things better ( or at least does no harm ) in all situations , it will be hard to get a significant change merged .
In a recent interview Con stated :
Then along came swap prefetch .
I spent a long time maintaining and improving it .
It was merged into the - mm kernel 18 months ago and I 've been supporting it since .
Andrew [ Morton ] to this day remains unconvinced it helps and that it ' might ' have negative consequences elsewhere .
No bug report or performance complaint has been forthcoming in the last 9 months .
I even wrote a benchmark that showed how it worked , which managed to quantify it !
The problem is that , as any developer knows , " no bug reports " is not the same as " no bugs . "
What is needed in a situation like this is not just testimonials from happy desktop users ; there also needs to be some sort of sense that the patch has been tried out in a wide variety of situations .
The relatively self - selecting nature of Con 's testing community ( more on this shortly ) makes that wider testing harder to achieve .
A patch like swap prefetch will require a certain amount of support from the other developers working in memory management before it can be merged .
These developers have , as a whole , not quite been ready to jump onto the prefetch bandwagon .
A concern which has been raised a few times is that the morning swap - in problem may well be a sign of a larger issue within the virtual memory subsystem , and that prefetch mostly serves as a way of papering over that problem .
And it fails to even paper things completely , since it brings back some pages from swap , but does n't ( and really can 't ) address file - backed pages which will also have been pushed out .
The conclusion that this reasoning leads to is that it would be better to find and fix the real problem rather than hiding it behind prefetch .
The way to address this concern is to try to get a better handle on what workloads are having problems so that the root cause can be addressed .
That 's why Andrew Morton says :
To attack the second question we could start out with bug reports : system A with workload B produces result C. I think result C is wrong for < reasons > and would prefer to see result D .
and why Nick Piggin complains :
Not talking about swap prefetch itself , but everytime I have asked anyone to instrument or produce some workload where swap prefetch helps , they never do .
Fair enough if swap prefetch helps them , but I also want to look at why that is the case and try to improve page reclaim in some of these situations ( for example standard overnight cron jobs should n't need swap prefetch on a 1 or 2 GB system , I would hope ) .
There have been a few attempts to characterize workloads which are improved by swap prefetch , but the descriptions tend toward the vague and hard to reproduce .
This is not an easy situation to write a simple benchmark for ( though Con has tried ) , so demonstrating the problem is a hard thing to do .
Still , if the prefetch proponents are serious about wanting this code in the mainline , they will need to find ways to better communicate information about the problems solved by prefetch to the development community .
Communications with the community have been an occasional problem with Con 's patches .
Almost uniquely among kernel developers , Con chose to do most of his work on his own mailing list .
That has resulted in a self - selected community of users which is nearly uniformly supportive of Con 's work , but which , in general , is not participating much in the development of that work .
It is rare to see patches posted to the ck- list which were not written by Con himself .
The result was the formation of a sort of cheerleading squad which would occasionally spill over onto linux - kernel demanding the merging of Con 's patches .
This sort of one - way communication was not particularly helpful for anybody involved .
It failed to convince developers outside of ck-list , and it failed to make the patches better .
This dynamic became actively harmful when ck- list members ( and Con ) continued to push for inclusion of patches in the face of real problems .
This behavior came to the fore after Con posted the RSDL scheduler .
RSDL restarted the whole CPU scheduling discussion and ended up leading to some good work .
But some users were reporting real regressions with RSDL and were being told that those regressions were to be expected and would not be fixed .
This behavior soured Linus on RSDL and set the stage for Ingo Molnar 's CFS scheduler .
Some ( not all ) people are convinced that Con 's scheduler was the better design , but refusal to engage with negative feedback doomed the whole exercise .
Some of Con 's ideas made it into the mainline , but his code did not .
The swap prefetch patches appear to lack any obvious problems ; nobody is reporting that prefetch makes things worse .
But the ck - list members pushing for its inclusion ( often with Con 's encouragement ) have not been providing the sort of information that the kernel developers want to see .
Even so , while a consensus in favor of merging this patch has not formed , there are some important developers who support its inclusion .
They include Ingo Molnar and David Miller , who says :
There is a point at which it might be wise to just step back and let the river run it 's course and see what happens .
Initially , it 's good to play games of " what if " , but after several months it 's not a productive thing and slows down progress for no good reason .
If a better mechanism gets implemented , great !
We 'll can easily replace the swap prefetch stuff at such time .
But until then swap prefetch is what we have and it 's sat long enough in - mm with no major problems to merge it .
So swap prefetch may yet make it into the mainline - that discussion is not , yet , done .
If we are especially lucky , Con will find a way to get back into kernel development , where his talents and user focus are very much in need .
But this sort of situation will certainly come up again .
Getting major changes into the core kernel is not an easy thing to do , and , arguably , that is how it should be .
If the process must make mistakes , they should probably happen on the side of being conservative , even if the occasional result is the exclusion of patches that end up being helpful .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
One of the genes that protects us from cancer may also help delay ageing , according to a new study published on Wednesday .

One of the genes that protects us from cancer may also help delay ageing , according to a new study published on Wednesday .
REUTERS / National Cancer Institute / Handout
The findings could also one day lead to new drugs that prevent or fight cancer while extending healthy youth and lifespan , said Manuel Serrano , a researcher at the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre , who worked on the study .
Serrano said researchers genetically engineered mice to have an extra copy of a key cancer - fighting gene called p53 and found it also played an important role in delaying ageing .
“ Everyone agrees that the ageing is produced by the accumulation of faulty cells , ” Serrano said .
“ In other words , p53 delays ageing for exactly the same reason that it prevents cancer . ”
The study was published in the journal Nature .
Previous cancer studies have shown that p53 can actually cause premature ageing symptoms by killing too many cells when it goes into overdrive , but Serrano said his research strictly regulated the gene so that it turned on only when needed .
The gene -- and another that regulates signals to p53 -- did their normal job of producing a protein that kills damaged cancer cells .
But the researchers found that mice with an extra copy of the genes actually lived longer even when stripping out the impact of having less cancer .
“ This is the first anti-cancer gene tested for its effect on ageing , ” Serrano said .
“ The mice lived 16 percent longer in their average lifespan . ”
The p53 gene , when working properly , makes sure that damaged cells destroy themselves and do not divide uncontrollably to cause tumors .
If the gene is mutated or inactivated the control mechanism does not work .
ANTI -CANCER ROLE KNOWN
The role of p53 in cancer has been known for many years and Serrano said he and his team simply applied this knowledge to the problem of ageing and targeting damaged cells .
“ The expectation is that having more p53 , mice will have a stricter quality control for cells , hence less cancer and less ageing , ” he said in a telephone interview .
Serrano also said that other research has shown that mice and worms that eat less have slower metabolisms and live longer .
But his study offers evidence that the mice can benefit from the extra copy of the genes without having to be starved .
While the study opens up possibilities for drugs based on p53 that delay ageing , researchers will need to find the right balance in boosting the gene to prevent potentially harmful effects , he said .
“ There are a number of chemical compounds that have been developed by the big pharmaceutical companies and these compounds are able to boost p53 in the organism , ” he said .
“ These compounds are being tested now for their possible anti-cancer activity and hopefully in the light of our study also for their possible anti-ageing activity . ”
Rove fingered five of the US Attorneys slated for dismissal RAW STORY
Published : Monday May 14 , 2007 Print This Email This The Washington Post continues to break news on the US Attorney firing scandal , which has largely vanished from the rest of the US media .
According to the Post story , slotted on page A4 , nearly half of the US attorneys slated for removal were targets of Republican complaints that they were lax in prosecuting voter fraud , " including efforts by presidential adviser Karl Rove to encourage more prosecutions of election - law violations , according to new documents and interviews . "
" Of the 12 U.S. attorneys known to have been dismissed or considered for removal last year , five were identified by Rove or other administration officials as working in districts that were trouble spots for voter fraud -- Kansas City , Mo. ; Milwaukee ; New Mexico ; Nevada ; and Washington state , " writes the Post 's Dan Eggen and Amy Goldstein .
" Four of the five prosecutors in those districts were dismissed . "
Excerpts : #
It has been clear for months that the administration 's eagerness to launch voter - fraud prosecutions played a role in some of the firings , but recent testimony , documents and interviews show the issue was more central than previously known .
The new details include the names of additional prosecutors who were targeted and other districts that were of concern , as well as previously unknown information about the White House 's role .
The Justice Department demanded that one U.S. attorney , Todd P. Graves of Kansas City , resign in January 2006 , several months after he refused to sign off on a Justice lawsuit involving the state 's voter rolls , Graves said last week .
U.S. Attorney Steven M. Biskupic of Milwaukee also was targeted last fall after complaints from Rove that he was not doing enough about voter fraud .
But he was spared because Justice officials feared that removing him might cause political problems on Capitol Hill , according to interviews of Justice aides conducted by congressional staff members .

Yesterday , I wrote a quick diary about a potential security issue that some Tyler customers faced [ 1 ] .
Some people reacted to my diary with interesting comments in our forums .
Two of them were interesting and deserve some review .
« Sometimes their techs will install the Bomgar jump client on your servers when they are troubleshooting issues .
They do n't remove it , it is left to the local entity to remove it or at least disable the service until it is needed again . »
Or
« A lot of vendors , especially in the local government sector expect customers to install these clients and leave them on .
They are truly offended when you tell them no , same on the SCADA side of things . »
When you are outsourcing some tasks to a third - party ( read : an MSSP , an integrator , ... ) , it ’s very important to keep an eye on what they do and how they do it .
The installation of remote access tools ( some of them are very close to a malicious backdoor ) or specific accounts is a key point to allow them to perform their day - to - day job .
But it does not mean that they can do whatever they want .
When I read « it is left to the local entity to remove it or , at least , disable it » , it means that a process must be implemented to follow this .
The main risks are to detect an attacker using the third - party network to pivot into your organization or to detect their credentials used by attackers from unknown locations .
That ’s why Tyler asked its customers to reset all passwords related to their remote activities .
Here are some tips to increase the operations security when working with third - parties .
Know « who ’s behind the keyboard » .
Are the third - party employees on the payroll , dedicated to you ( read : they know you and your business ) .
Are they also contractors ?
Are they located in the same country as yours ?
When it 's not mandatory , do not keep the remote access open 24x7 .
All access requests must be approved following a procedure .
Do not grant full access to your infrastructure .
Restrict the third - party rights to the minimum resources to perform its job ( least privilege ) .
Keep segmentation in mind .
Restrict its access to a jump host that will be used to enforce more security controls .
Keep logs of who did what , when , why , and from where .
Log everything , all connections , all commands .
Example : Detect an unforeseen connection from an unusual location outside the business hours .
Keep an inventory of your partners and installed software .
Force them to upgrade them and audit the settings .
Enable security settings available in the deployed tools
Example : Enable MFA , activate client - side certificates , provide security tokens .
Finally , do n’t be afraid to say « No » and explain why you do n’t agree with their requirements .
They will work on YOUR platform which hosts YOUR data .
You ’ll be responsible in case of a data breach !
This list is not exhaustive .
If you 've implemented other specific controls when working for third - party organizations , please share !

THE last time Irene Pepperberg saw Alex she said goodnight as usual .
“ You be good , ” said Alex .
“ I love you . ” “ I love you , too . ” “ You 'll be in tomorrow ? ” “ Yes , I 'll be in tomorrow . ”
But Alex ( his name supposedly an acronym of Avian Learning Experiment ) died in his cage that night , bringing to an end a life spent learning complex tasks that , it had been originally thought , only primates could master .
In science as in most fields of endeavour , it is important to have the right tool for the job .
Early studies of linguistic ability in apes concluded it was virtually non-existent .
But researchers had made the elementary error of trying to teach their anthropoid subjects to speak .
Chimpanzee vocal cords are simply not up to this — and it was not until someone had the idea of teaching chimps sign language that any progress was made .
Even then , the researchers remained human - centric .
Their assumption was that chimps might be able to understand and use human sign language because they are humanity 's nearest living relatives .
It took a brilliant insight to turn this human - centricity on its head and look at the capabilities of a species only distantly related to humanity , but which can , nevertheless , speak the words people speak : a parrot .
The insight in question came to Dr Pepperberg , then a 28 - year - old theoretical chemist , in 1977 .
To follow it up , she bought a one - year - old African Grey parrot at random from a pet shop .
Thus began one of the best - known double acts in the field of animal - behaviour science .
Dr Pepperberg and Alex last shared a common ancestor more than 300 m years ago .
But Alex , unlike any chimpanzee ( with whom Dr Pepperberg 's most recent common ancestor lived a mere 4 m years ago ) , learned to speak words easily .
The question was , was Alex merely parroting Dr Pepperberg ?
Or would that pejorative term have to be redefined ?
Do parrots actually understand what they are saying ?
Bird brained
Dr Pepperberg 's reason for suspecting that they might — and thus her second reason for picking a parrot — was that in the mid-1970s evolutionary explanations for behaviour were coming back into vogue .
A British researcher called Nicholas Humphrey had proposed that intelligence evolves in response to the social environment rather than the natural one .
The more complex the society an animal lives in , the more wits it needs to prosper .
The reason why primates are intelligent , according to Dr Humphrey , is that they generally live in groups .
And , just as group living promotes intelligence , so intelligence allows larger groups to function , providing a spur for the evolution of yet more intelligence .
If Dr Humphrey is right , only social animals can be intelligent — and so far he has been borne out .
Flocks of , say , starlings or herds of wildebeest do not count as real societies .
They are just protective agglomerations in which individuals do not have complex social relations with each other .
But parrots such as Alex live in societies in the wild , in the way that monkeys and apes do , and thus Dr Pepperberg reasoned , Alex might have evolved advanced cognitive abilities .
Also like primates , parrots live long enough to make the time - consuming process of learning worthwhile .
Combined with his ability to speak ( or at least “ vocalise ” ) words , Alex looked a promising experimental subject .
And so it proved .
Using a training technique now employed on children with learning difficulties , in which two adults handle and discuss an object , sometimes making deliberate mistakes , Dr Pepperberg and her collaborators at the University of Arizona began teaching Alex how to describe things , how to make his desires known and even how to ask questions .
By the end , said Dr Pepperberg , Alex had the intelligence of a five - year - old child and had not reached his full potential .
He had a vocabulary of 150 words .
He knew the names of 50 objects and could , in addition , describe their colours , shapes and the materials they were made from .
He could answer questions about objects ' properties , even when he had not seen that particular combination of properties before .
He could ask for things — and would reject a proffered item and ask again if it was not what he wanted .
He understood , and could discuss , the concepts of “ bigger ” , “ smaller ” , “ same ” and “ different ” .
And he could count up to six , including the number zero ( and was grappling with the concept of “ seven ” when he died ) .
He even knew when and how to apologise if he annoyed Dr Pepperberg or her collaborators .
And the fact that there were a lot of collaborators , even strangers , involved in the project was crucial .
Researchers in this area live in perpetual fear of the “ Clever Hans ” effect .
This is named after a horse that seemed to count , but was actually reacting to unconscious cues from his trainer .
Alex would talk to and perform for anyone , not just Dr Pepperberg .
There are still a few researchers who think Alex 's skills were the result of rote learning rather than abstract thought .
Alex , though , convinced most in the field that birds as well as mammals can evolve complex and sophisticated cognition , and communicate the results to others .
A shame , then , that he is now , in the words of Monty Python , an ex-parrot .
In a shock finding , astronomers using CSIRO 's Parkes telescope have detected a huge burst of radio energy from the distant universe that could open up a new field in astrophysics .
The research team , led by Assistant Professor Duncan Lorimer of West Virginia University , reports its discovery today in the online journal Science Express .
The radio burst appears to have originated at least one - and - a - half billion light - years [ 500 Mpc ] away but was startlingly strong .
" Normally the kind of cosmic activity we 're looking for at this distance would be very faint but this was so bright that it saturated the equipment , " said Professor Matthew Bailes of Swinburne University in Melbourne .
The burst was so bright that at the time it was first recorded it was dismissed as man-made radio interference .
It put out a huge amount of power ( 10exp33 Joules ) , equivalent to a large ( 2000 MW ) power station running for two billion billion years .
" The burst may have been produced by an exotic event such as the collision of two neutron stars or be the last gasp of a black hole as it evaporates completely , " Professor Lorimer said .
The burst lasted just five milliseconds .
It was found by David Narkevik , an undergraduate at the West Virginia University , when he re-analysed data taken with the Parkes telescope six years ago .
Although they 've found only one burst , the astronomers can estimate how often they occur .
" We 'd expect to see a few bursts over the whole sky every day , " said Dr John Reynolds , Officer in Charge at CSIRO 's Parkes Observatory .
" A new telescope being built in Western Australia will be ideal for finding more of these rare , transient events .
" The Australian SKA Pathfinder , which is going to be built by 2012 , will have a very wide field of view - - be able to see a very large piece of sky -- which is exactly what you want for this kind of work , " he said .
Meanwhile , the researchers will comb archived data from the Parkes telescope for more radio bursts .
The discovery of the radio burst is similar to the discovery of gamma-ray bursts in the 1970s , when military satellites revealed flashes of gamma- rays appearing all over the sky .
One kind -- the so - called long - period bursts -- was eventually identified as the explosion ( supernova ) of a massive star with the associated formation of a black hole .

Almaz Atambayev says he has recovered from his illness
Almaz Atambayev said he was unconscious for two days after someone tried to poison him when they handed him a glass of water in his office on 11 May .
Mr Atambayev said he had had death threats over a nationalisation plan .
President Kurmanbek Bakiyev appointed him in March to try to curb political turmoil in the central Asian state .
Semiconductor plant
The presidential medical office said the diagnosis on the prime minister was " acute toxic hepatitis " .
It said : " According to the results of the investigation , it can be surmised ... that toxins of unknown origin entered the patient 's body . "
Mr Atambayev had blamed " some government official " for the poisoning .
He said he had recovered and had no intention of resigning .
Mr Atambayev linked the incident to his attempt to nationalise a semiconductor plant in Jalalabad .
The government took over the Soviet - built plant in April and Mr Atambayev said he wanted to turn it into Kyrgyzstan 's Silicon Valley .
Kyrgyzstan has suffered political upheaval for a number of years .
President Bakiyev replaced Askar Akayev , who was accused of corruption , in 2005 .
But he has suffered growing unrest amid claims of cronyism and of failure to fight corruption .
Mr Bakiyev appointed Mr Atambayev , a moderate opposition politician , to replace Azim Isabekov in March .

" Hot " colours indicate where the skull is stressed
Enlarge Image
Scientists who have studied the extinct creature 's skull in detail say it had a relatively weak bite - compared with , say , a modern lion .
And although those fangs must have been amazing killing implements , they made for a very restricted hunting strategy .
The scientists report their work in the journal PNAS .
They say the sabretooth in many respects was a one - trip killing machine .
While it would have been a ruthlessly efficient hunter of big game , it was simply over - engineered for taking small prey - and that would have made it extremely vulnerable when times got hard .
" It 's one of the golden rules of palaeontology , " observed Colin McHenry of the University of Newcastle , Callaghan , Australia .
" Specialisation is short term - success but it is long - term risk ; because as soon as the ecosystem becomes destabilised , you 're the first candidate to go extinct .
It 's the generalists that get through , " he told BBC News .
Long debate
The team used a technique known as finite element analysis to study the skull of the sabretooth ( Smilodon fatalis ) , which ranged across North America thousands of years ago .
CT ( X - ray ) scans were taken of the tiger 's remains to construct a high - resolution digital model in a computer .
This simulation was then loaded with forces to see how the skull , jaw , teeth and muscles would have coped with the mechanical stresses and strains experienced during predation .
A model of a modern lion ( Panthera leo ) was developed for comparison .
Once the densities of its favoured large prey dropped below critical levels - it was doomed
Dr Steve Wroe , UNSW
The beast 's predation strategy has long been a matter of contention , with some arguing that it leapt at prey with fangs bared ; others that it used its sabres like ice - picks to climb on top of other animals ; and some who argued that it would inflict grievous injuries by slashing out with its canines .
Bear - like
What seems clear from the research is that the sabretooth would not have taken down prey like today 's lions , which try to asphyxiate their victims with a clamp - like bite to the neck .
The lion can maintain a strong clamp for several minutes
Enlarge Image
For one thing , the scientists say , the sabretooth did not have the bite force to do this .
At about 1,000 Newtons , it was biting with a third of the force an equivalent - sized lion can on the African savannah today , and the Smilodon would probably not have been able to sustain a clamp for the time required .
" The sabretooth was bear - like ; it was massively strong - huge forequarters , powerful limbs .
It was not an animal that was built for running ; it was built for wrestling other animals to the ground , " explained Mr McHenry .
" I think it was using its huge limbs and thumb - claws to wrestle large animals to the ground , and then when it 's got them there under control , that 's when the teeth come into play , and there 's one instantly fatal bite to the neck , severing the airway and carotid arteries to the brain .
Death is more or less instantaneous . "
The computer work suggests this " coup de grace " was delivered largely from the neck muscles , the extra leverage driving a deep puncture wound .
Specialised hunter
The team concludes that the sabretooth's " design " would have left it exposed in a changing ecosystem .
If its preferred prey was reduced in number , it would have had difficulty adapting to its new circumstances .
" The specialised morphology of Smilodon would have allowed it to kill big prey more efficiently - but it was massively over - engineered for the purposes of taking smaller prey , " said Dr Wroe .
Unlike with modern animals , there is no observational data
Enlarge Image
Sabretoothed animals lived from about 33 million years ago to around 9,000 years ago .
In common with many great Ice Age beasts , Smilodon fatalis disappeared from North America at the time humans were known to be operating on the continent with a new and efficient spear technology .
The story of its demise , though , is most likely a complex one , and most scientists would acknowledge that a changing climate was probably a factor in its extinction .
One recently proposed idea even suggested an asteroid or comet strike over North America 13,000 years ago could also have made conditions intolerable for some animals .
OK -- let 's review why I 'm so damn pissed off at the Democratic Leadership .
Speaker Pelosi -- one of your members said that Bush " just likes to blow things up . "
And then it was reported that you were n't gong to back his play .
What is God 's name are you afraid of ?
Rush " I have a pimple on my ass so I do n't need to go to Vietnam " Limbaugh ?
Sean Hannity calling you a name ?
Getting bad press ?
Leadership is about leading -- which means standing up to the idiot inhabiting the White House using this thing called the Constitution like toilet paper .
For God 's sake , show some spine .
And Senator Reid -- one of your fellow Senators has decided to place a hold on a bill granting blanket immunity to the telecom industry .
There is evidence that telecoms were spying on Americans before the " 9/11 changed everything " arguments even entered national discourse .
You might want to consult this quaint document called the Constitution , especially the Fourth Amendment about search and seizures requiring probable cause .
And before I get the , " you do n't understand the stakes involved because you are a mighty member of Congress and I am but a lowly citizen " garbage , let me remind you that I am your boss -- not the other way around .
So -- before we go any further , let me provide you with some inspiration .
The Dems in Congress need to start acting like this :
And this
And this
And stop acting like this :
Its 328 pages were an intense study of the legacies of a war that had stretched the US military , riven world opinion and deeply divided American political life .
It was entitled The American Military and the Lessons of Vietnam .
In one passage , the young officer took on the idea that public opinion in the US could not abide a military quagmire .
' Vietnam was an extremely painful reminder that , when it comes to intervention , time and patience are not American virtues in abundant supply , ' Petraeus wrote in 1987 .
Now Petraeus is delivering another survey of an unpopular , divisive war .
Only this time his audience is not a college tutor : it is the whole world .
In less than two weeks , Petraeus will appear before the US Congress and deliver a report into the progress of the ' surge ' , the military strategy launched by President George W Bush that was designed to win the Iraq war .
It has been billed as a ' make or break ' moment that could either trigger the beginnings of an American withdrawal or build on the first signs of real military success .
And it will be scoured anxiously in London , where the political debate about the timing of a withdrawal of the remaining British forces is gathering pace .
In America , both sides of the political divide are breathless in anticipation .
The Democrats await any hint of criticism .
The Republicans have prepared a PR barrage of ' good news ' to try to turn public opinion back behind the war effort .
White House officials hail Petraeus as a ' warrior scholar ' who finally gets what is needed to win in Iraq .
They see him as a man who can save the Bush presidency .
But the reality is far more complex .
The brutal truth is that the Petraeus report is unlikely to change a thing when it comes to policy on the ground : the surge and the war will go on .
Its true importance lies in how it will be used politically : by the White House , by leading Democrats such as Senator Hillary Clinton , by Republican presidential hopefuls such as Rudy Giuliani .
And not least by Petraeus himself .
For the highly media - savvy general has political ambitions of his own .
This is his moment to shine .
A story often told about General David Howell Petraeus concerns a brush with death at Kentucky 's Fort Campbell in 1991 .
During a training exercise , a soldier tripped and accidentally fired his rifle .
The bullet hit Petraeus in the chest .
Yet he refused to leave the exercise , only relenting when a more senior general ordered him carried away on a stretcher .
Even then - with the bullet missing his heart by inches - he managed to get himself discharged early from hospital after he did 50 push - ups in front of his doctor , just a few days after being shot .
The anecdote leaves little doubt that Petraeus is tough and driven .
He was born in 1952 to Dutch American parents - his father , Sextus , was a seaman - and he grew up in the upstate New York town of Cornwall .
It lies almost in the shadow of West Point , America 's military academy , where Petraeus duly gained admission .
He excelled at high school and then graduated in the top 5 per cent of the West Point class of 1974 .
He also married the superintendent 's daughter .
From there he carved out a successful career culminating in the rank of general .
A reputation as a ' Washington general ' was wiped out by two tours of duty in Iraq .
First he led his unit in the 2003 invasion of Iraq , and then won plaudits for pacifying the northern city of Mosul in 2004 .
Then he took charge of the retraining and rebuilding of Iraq 's army , again winning praise for swiftly and decisively bringing on the scheme .
He then co-authored the military 's new manual of counter - insurgency before , at the start of 2007 , being appointed to command US forces in Iraq .
' He 's a straight talker and he 's very highly thought of militarily , ' said Professor Donald Goldstein , a military expert at the University of Pittsburgh .
Petraeus fits a lot of energy and focus into his 5ft 9in frame .
He is famed for his five - mile runs , carried out even on Baghdad 's hottest days .
One subordinate called him the ' most competitive man on earth ' .
But his macho army bluster is also tempered by a keen intellect .
His Princeton PhD is no accident .
He is flexible too : he knows the war in Iraq is rarely just about bombs and bullets .
In Mosul , one of his most famous catchphrases on the subject of bringing peace to the city was ' money is ammunition ' .
Yet he is not without critics .
Some say he is overly fond of the media and has skilfully crafted an almost flawless public persona of the skilled tactician .
Others say his focus is not just about the facts on the ground , but about his own advancement .
' He is a sycophant incarnate .
He 's a smart guy , but he 's playing politics in this , ' said Larry Johnson , a former CIA anti-terrorism official .
They also point out that Petraeus 's record in Iraq can be criticised .
The peace he brought to Mosul proved shortlived , and there is now a criminal investigation into missing supplies and weapons that involves officials close to Petraeus .
His time in Iraq has seen the emergence of death squads and heightened sectarianism .
' This has all happened on his watch , ' said Johnson .
But what will his report say ?
First , some media spin needs to be cut through .
Petraeus has been used as an impressive , patriotic figure on which to hang such an important study .
That suits both the White House and Petraeus himself .
But his tough persona masks a more nuanced approach from the administration .
In fact , the Petraeus report will be a mix of analyses from Petraeus and the US ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker .
Its exact wording will have heavy influence from White House officials .
For those hoping that the report will contain a damning indictment of the war or prompt any meaningful troop reduction - or full withdrawal - there is almost certain to be deep disappointment .
' It is frankly delusional for anyone to think it is going to change policy , ' said Charles Pena , a senior fellow at think - tank the Independent Institute .
' They [ Petraeus and Crocker ] have no choice but to try to implement administration policy . '
And that policy is showing some signs of success .
The military surge of troop numbers pushed by Bush has had an impact .
The report will probably point to success stories in former hotbeds of Sunni insurgency such as Ramadi , Tal Afar and Mosul , where the security situation has been brought under some degree of control .
In these areas , strategic alliances with Sunni tribes have seen former insurgents working with the US against Islamic jihadists .
' There has been progress militarily .
It is fair to say that , ' said Professor Rick Stoll , a defence and warfare expert at Rice University .
A taste of what Petraeus 's presentation might look like has already been given .
On a recent trip by Democrat and Republican politicians to Iraq , he sat down , armed with charts and Powerpoint slides , to illustrate the advances made by the surge .
An account of the meeting by Democrat Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky gives the lie to anyone expecting a military withdrawal from Iraq .
She revealed to one newspaper that Petraeus told her America would be in Iraq in some way ' for nine to 10 years ' .
While the surge has changed the nature of the conflict , it has not yet brought it much closer to an end .
As the brutal Sunni insurgency has tailed off , it has been replaced by Shia violence .
The report is likely to note that the war has now become a fight between Shia militant groups and the US military .
By last July , according to US officials , Shia fighters accounted for 73 per cent of attacks on coalition forces .
That has been matched by a total failure of the Iraqi political process and a collapse of relations between the majority Shia - represented by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki - and the US .
The surge 's aim was to ' buy time ' for reconciliation between Iraq 's warring sectarian factions , but instead the feuding blocs have grown more violently apart .
' No one wants to talk about reconciliation .
No one wants to listen , ' said one official recently returned from Iraq .
' The only reconciliation that is taking place is between the US military and some Sunni insurgents .
That is not going to solve Iraq 's problems in the long run . '
So that will be the twin messages of Petraeus and Crocker .
The military aspect of the surge is starting to turn the tide .
But the political opportunity it was designed to create is being wasted by the Iraqis .
If that sounds familiar , that is because it is the official White House stance on Iraq .
' He is going to say that , from a military standpoint , it is going well , but , from a political standpoint , it is difficult and the Iraqis have to stand up for themselves .
That is what Bush says , ' said Goldstein .
But if the contents of the report appear predictable , its impact is harder to ascertain .
One thing is clear : it is unlikely to precipitate any rush significantly to withdraw US forces .
It will allow the White House to claim that its strategy is working and that to halt the surge - as most Democrats wish to do - would be to snatch victory away from their troops .
Most experts believe that the White House will keep US troop levels at the current force of about 160,000 until at least April .
Then to maintain the surge the army would need to extend its current rotation period from 15 months to 18 months .
That is seen as too much of a burden by many military leaders .
Therefore it is widely predicted that the US presence in Iraq could be down to pre-surge levels of 130,000 troops by September next year .
That could be presented as the beginning of a withdrawal , but it is hardly the sort of conflict - ending momentum that many Democrats - and much of the American public - seem to want .
However , there is little political pressure on Bush to change policy in Iraq .
He does not face re-election and the Democrats have shown that they are unwilling to do the one thing that could end the war : cut off funding .
Again , the Petraeus report will not provide them with motivation to harden their stance .
' The President has called the Democrats ' bluff .
They do n't have the stomach for defunding , so there is no political pressure on the White House , ' said Pena .
But that is not true for any of the presidential candidates .
They are all feeling the heat .
For the Democrats , the Petraeus report is likely to contain enough bad news for them to continue their largely symbolic push for a troop withdrawal , but it will also have the risk that they will look as if they are undermining the first signs of success on the ground .
For Republicans , it poses the opposite problem .
The top - tier candidates , such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney , have seen what happened to the campaign of John McCain , the most vocal supporter of Bush 's surge policy : his support has almost collapsed .
Yet the Petraeus report is likely to force them to toe the White House line more tightly and in the face of much public hostility .
Or it could cause them to go against the White House , following a pro-withdrawal line and opening up huge splits in the party itself .
Those chasms are already becoming evident , with some top Republican figures , such as Senator John Warner , already calling for troop withdrawals to begin this year .
But above all the political squabbling will be Bush .
No matter what happens , he will be President for all of 2008 .
And he shows no sign of any significant change of tack .
Despite being billed as a watershed moment , the only real prospect of a reversal of Iraq policy will come in January 2009 , when a new President walks into the Oval Office .
The brutal fact is that there remains no meaningful end in sight for the US involvement in Iraq .
Vietnam proved that the difference between when a war becomes unpopular and when it ends can be many years .
In July 1967 , the public approval rating of the Vietnam war dropped forever below 50 per cent , yet America did not leave Vietnam totally until 1975 .
A similar process could be repeating itself in Iraq .
Petraeus - as a keen student of history - would probably privately think that a tragedy .
In his PhD thesis 20 years ago , he wrote : ' Vietnam was a painful reminder for the military that they , not the transient occupants of high office , generally bear the heaviest burden during armed conflict . '
That is a trenchant analysis .
But it was written by the Petraeus of Princeton .
The Petraeus of next month is a general playing the highest political stakes of his career in front of the eyes of the world .
He is unlikely to be so candid again .
Iraq benchmarks
Iraq has failed to meet all but three of 18 congressionally mandated benchmarks for political and military progress , according to a draft of a Government Accountability Office report to be presented to Congress on Tuesday .
Achieved :
The protection of the rights of minority political parties in the Iraqi legislature .
It is the only one of eight political benchmarks to have been met , the report says .
However , the report does not concern itself with attacks on these parties outside of the legislature .
Failed :
In other areas , the political process is judged to have been a failure , including the continued non-passage of legislation on constitutional reform , new oil laws and de-Baathification .
Observers say the parliament rarely has sufficient members in attendance to have a quorum to consider legislation .
Mixed progress :
On the security front , Iraq has met on two benchmarks .
Despite the surge , violence remains roughly at the same levels .
However , the number of Iraqi army units capable of operating independently has dropped from 10 in March to six last month .

A new category of drug has shown promising results for HIV / AIDS patients who failed to respond to other treatments , a study to be shows .
Especially when combined with other medications , raltegravir — the first in a new class of anti-retroviral drugs called integrase inhibitors — dramatically reduced the presence of the HIV virus and boosted immunity in clinical - trial patients , according to the study in the British journal The Lancet .
Integrase inhibitors act by targeting and disrupting an enzyme that facilitates the insertion of the HIV virus into the host ’s cellular genome .
In clinical tests on 178 patients with advanced HIV infections that had proved resistant to standard treatments , raltegravir “ showed unprecedented levels of virological efficiency , ” virologists Pedro Cahn and Omar Sued wrote in a commentary in the same journal .
The treatment “ achieved virological suppression even in patients with limited options , ” they wrote , predicting that the new drug would “ have a major role in salvage therapy , ” the term used to describe last - ditch efforts to save those with highly - compromised immune systems .
“ Clearly , we are in a new era of anti-retroviral therapy , ” they added .
There are three types of enzyme needed for HIV to replicate , namely reverse - transcriptase , protease and integrase .
Up to now , no drug has successfully inhibited integrase enzymes .
A team of researchers at Merck Research Laboratories in Westpoint , Pennsylvania , led by Beatriw Grinsztejn , divided the 178 patients into four groups during clinical trials .
Each of three groups were given different doses of raltegravir , ranging from 200 to 600 milligrams , and the fourth group received a placebo .
All four also took a basic “ background treatment . ”
After 24 weeks , the amount of HIV genetic material in the blood dropped below a measurable threshold ( 50 copies per millilitre ) in 65 percent of the patients taking raltegravir , nearly five times as many as the placebo group .
Immune system responses were also dramatically improved .
“ If no long - term unexpected side - effects or resistance issues emerge , raltegravir will have a major role in salvage therapy , particularly in combination with another new drug , ” Cahn and Sued concluded .

LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) - Britney Spears launched her highly anticipated comeback at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday , drawing ridicule by dressing up as a stripper and miming her new single .
The 25 - year - old singer , whose professional achievements have been overshadowed by her personal crises in recent years , performed “ Gimme More ” in a black sequined bikini and knee - high boots .
No longer boasting the buff body that helped drive her to international superstardom almost a decade ago , the mother of two moved sluggishly around the stage at the Palms casino , often with the support of a troupe of dancers .
At one point , the camera panned to rapper 50 Cent , sitting in the audience , who looked bewildered by the action on stage .
“ She blew it , ” gossip columnist Perez Hilton told Reuters .
“ Everybody knows Britney lip -syncs , but that ’s because she dances so much .
She barely even danced in this .
It was so bad .
It was painful .
It was embarrassing .
And I loved it ! ”
Comedian Sarah Silverman also showed no mercy .
She took to the stage when the performance was over , declaring that the singer ’s young children were “ the most adorable mistakes you ’ll ever see . ”
It was not the only excitement at the two - hour show .
Tommy Lee and Kid Rock , both former husbands of model Pamela Anderson , got into a fight while Alicia Keys was performing .
“ There were no fists , they were just holding each other , grabbing each other , ” Tom Higginson , singer of the pop band Plain White Ts , told Reuters .
“ Security had to break them up . ”

Almost lost in the shuffle was the fact that Spears ’ former boyfriend , Justin Timberlake took home four statuettes , including male artist of the year .
Along with R&B singer Beyonce , he led the field with seven nominations .
Beyonce won a single award -- most earth - shattering collaboration -- for her duet with Colombian pop singer Shakira on the tune “ Beautiful Liar . ”
R&B singer Rihanna won the top prize , video of the year , for her smash hit “ Umbrella . ”
That tune also won for monster single of the year .
Hip - hop singer Kanye West went home empty - handed after receiving five nominations .
He was also not thrilled that Spears took the plum opening slot .
“ I ca n’t believe she would perform .
She has n’t had a hit record in years , ” the outspoken hip - hop star improvised during a performance the night before .
Spears released her last studio album in 2003 , the commercial disappointment “ In the Zone ” -- and West has recorded three albums in that time .
She has been working on a new album for more than a year , although it is not known when it will be released .
MTV brought the show to Las Vegas for the first time , hoping to reverse a sharp slide in viewership for its awards bash .
Last year ’s ceremony in New York drew 5.8 million viewers , down from 8 million in 2005 and 10.3 million in 2004 , according to Nielsen Media Research .
By contrast , the Grammys drew just over 20 million viewers in February .
Stewart Dimmock 's high - profile fight to ban the film being shown in schools was depicted as a David and Goliath battle , with the Kent school governor taking on the state by arguing that the government was ' brainwashing ' pupils .
A High Court ruling last week that the Oscar - winning documentary would have to be screened with guidance notes to balance its claims was welcomed by climate - change sceptics .
The Observer has established that Dimmock 's case was supported by a powerful network of business interests with close links to the fuel and mining lobbies .
He was also supported by a Conservative councillor in Hampshire , Derek Tipp .
Dimmock credited the little - known New Party with supporting him in the test case but did not elaborate on its involvement .
The obscure Scotland - based party calls itself ' centre right ' and campaigns for lower taxes and expanding nuclear power .
Records filed at the Electoral Commission show the New Party has received nearly all of its money - almost £ 1 m between 2004 and 2006 - from Cloburn Quarry Limited , based in Lanarkshire .
The company 's owner and chairman of the New Party , Robert Durward , is a long - time critic of environmentalists .
With Mark Adams , a former private secretary to Tony Blair , he set up the Scientific Alliance , a not - for - profit body comprising scientists and non-scientists , which aims to challenge many of the claims about global warming .
The alliance issued a press release welcoming last week 's court ruling and helped publicise Dimmock 's case on its website .
It also advised Channel 4 on the Great Global Warming Swindle , a controversial documentary screened earlier this year that attempted to challenge claims made about climate change .
In 2004 the alliance co-authored a report with the George C Marshall Institute , a US body funded by Exxon Mobil , that attacked climate change claims .
' Climate change science has fallen victim to heated political and media rhetoric ... the result is extensive misunderstanding , ' the report 's authors said .
Martin Livermore , director of the alliance , confirmed Durward continued to support its work .
' He provides funds with other members , ' Livermore said .
In the Nineties , Durward established the British Aggregates Association to campaign against a tax on sand , gravel and rock extracted from quarries .
Durward does not talk to the media and calls to the association requesting an interview were not returned last week .
However , he has written letters to newspapers setting out his personal philosophy .
One letter claimed : ' It is time for Tony Blair to try the " fourth way " , declare martial law and let the army sort out our schools , hospitals and roads . '
He later clarified his comments saying he was merely pointing out that the army had done a ' fantastic job ' in dealing with the foot and mouth crisis .
He has also asked whether there has been a ' witch - hunt against drunk drivers ' .
Dimmock also received support from a new organisation , Straightteaching.com , which calls for politics to be left out of the classroom .
The organisation , which established an online payment system for people to make contributions to Dimmock 's campaign , was set up by Tipp and several others .
Its website was registered last month to an anonymous Arizona - based internet company .
Tipp , who is described on the website as having been a science teacher in the Seventies and Eighties , declines to talk about who else is backing it .
' There are other people involved but I do n't think they want to be revealed , ' he said .
He said he thought his organisation could bring more cases against the government .
' There are a lot of people who feel the climate change debate is being hyped up , ' Tipp said .
' To try to scare people into believing the end is nigh is not helpful .
We 've been contacted by other teachers who raised concerns .
There 's a lot of interest , especially from people in the US . '
DOVER , N.H. -
The stunning admission
by Democratic frontrunners Clinton , Obama , and Edwards that they might keep
U.S. troops in Iraq beyond 2013 " is tantamount to an announcement of a
permanent occupation that could cost U.S. taxpayers $ 5 trillion and
bankrupt any opportunity to address health care reform , education , jobs , or
any other domestic policy initiatives , " Presidential candidate Dennis
Kucinich said today .
DOVER , N.H. -
The stunning admission
by Democratic frontrunners Clinton , Obama , and Edwards that they might keep
U.S. troops in Iraq beyond 2013 " is tantamount to an announcement of a
permanent occupation that could cost U.S. taxpayers $ 5 trillion and
bankrupt any opportunity to address health care reform , education , jobs , or
any other domestic policy initiatives , " Presidential candidate Dennis
Kucinich said today .
In remarks prepared for a speech in New Hampshire tonight , Kucinich is
expected to challenge the credibility , motives , and fitness of the
Democratic frontrunners to serve as President " when they either voted to go
to war or voted to continue the war .
They took us into this war , and , with
every vote for continued funding , they have kept us there .
Now , they 're
telling us we may be there forever , diverting trillions of dollars from
desperate domestic needs to financing an illegal , immoral , and endless war .
It is time to end this war , and it is time to expose their hypocrisy . "
Kucinich noted that " Senators Clinton and Edwards were among the most
outspoken advocates in 2002 for giving President Bush the authorization he
wanted to invade and occupy Iraq .
And , until he announced his candidacy
this year , Senator Obama supported the war every time he voted to continue
funding it .
Whatever they say on the campaign trail , they have all voted in
support of this war -- repeatedly . "

" It is absolutely astonishing that these candidates have the audacity
to portray themselves as pro-peace and anti-war when their statements ,
their actions , and their votes reveal just the opposite .
They must be held
accountable and answerable for their roles in this illegal , immoral , and
disastrous war , and , that 's what I intend to do . "
Kucinich will be the keynote speaker tonight ( Friday ) at the North
Grafton County Democratic Party Annual John F Kennedy Dinner at the Peabody
Lodge in Franconia , NH .
Tomorrow , he will be in Durham , NH for an afternoon
" Conversation / Dialogue " with students and faculty at the University of New
Hampshire .
Kucinich is the only Democratic Presidential candidate who voted
against the war authorization in 2002 and every supplemental funding
appropriation since then .
In October 2002 , eight days before the House and Senate approved the
war - authorization resolution , Kucinich released his own analysis of
intelligence and information that accurately predicted subsequent events ,
discoveries , and consequences .
It pointed out that there was no connection
between Iraq and the events of 9/11 and that there was no credible evidence
that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
He led the fight in the
House against the war and rallied more than 120 other Congressman to oppose
the resolution .
Kucinich 's analysis also argued :
--" This language is so broad that it would allow the
President to order an attack against Iraq even when there is no
material threat to the United States . "
--" A unilateral attack on Iraq by the United States will cause
instability and chaos in the region and sow the seeds of future
conflicts all over the world . "
--" Unilateral action against Iraq will cost the United States the
support of the world community , adversely affecting the war on
terrorism . "
In an interview today , Kucinich said , " Any candidate willing to
continue risking the lives of our brave men and women in uniform , continue
destroying the lives of millions and innocent Iraqis , and continue
embracing the corrupt foreign policy that led us into Iraq and keeps us
there is not fit to serve as President of the United States of America . "
THE Pentagon has long indulged in highly polished technological systems that are the product of many years of bureaucratic wheel - spinning , grinding meetings and wish - list overkill .
But those soul - deadening procedures have come under intense criticism for turning creative people away from innovation for national security .
“ Innovations threaten the establishment , and the reaction is often to get rid of the person promoting the innovation , ” said Jay M. Cohen , the under secretary for research and development in the Department of Homeland Security .
Even when a military official advocates a new technological system , added Mr. Cohen , formerly chief of the Office of Naval Research , he or she runs the risk of being punished by resentful officers , protective of their turf .
The military ’s appetite for expensive , gold - plated systems still exists , but soldiers increasingly want their civilian technology partners to deliver solutions quickly to the field , even if the devices are far from perfected .
That is partly because changing conditions in the Iraq war have raised demand for new gadgets and gizmos , even in tiny batches .
“ This is a major shift in outlook , and I believe it is a permanent shift , ” said Mark Sherman , who oversees efforts by BBN Technologies of Cambridge , Mass. , a supplier of new technologies to the military since 1948 .
His advice to civilian innovators seeking military sales is this : “ Do it quick , and make it cheap because conditions change . ”
Baghdad Burning
... I 'll meet you 'round the bend my friend , where hearts can heal and souls can mend ...
So , no , CNN , his last words were not " Muqtada Al Sadr " in a mocking tone - just thought someone should clear that up .
( Really people , six of you contributed to that article ! )
Then again , one could argue that it was a judge who gave them that false information .
A judge on the Iraqi appeals court - one of the judges who ratified the execution order .
Everyone knows Iraqi judges under American tutelage never lie- that explains CNN 's confusion .
Muwafaq Al Rubai was said he was " weak and frightened " .
Apparently , Rubai saw a different lynching because according to the video they leaked , he did n't look frightened at all .
His voice did n't shake and he refused to put on the black hood .
He looked resigned to his fate , and during the heckling he looked as defiant as ever .
( It 's quite a contrast to Muhsin Abdul Hameed 's public hysterics last year when the Americans raided his home . )
It 's one thing to have militias participating in killings .
This is allegedly the democracy the Americans flaunt .
Is this how bloodthirsty and frightening we 've become ?
Is this what Iraq stands for now ?
Executions ?
I 'm sure the rest of the Arab countries will be impressed .
One of the most advanced countries in the world did not help to reconstruct Iraq , they did n't even help produce a decent constitution .
They did , however , contribute nicely to a kangaroo court and a lynching .
A lynching shall go down in history as America 's biggest accomplishment in Iraq .
So who 's next ?
Who hangs for the hundreds of thousands who 've died as a direct result of this war and occupation ?
Bush ?
Blair ?
Maliki ? Jaffari ?
Allawi ?
Chalabi ?
2006 has definitely been representative of Maliki and his government - killings like never before and a lynching to end it properly .
Death and destruction everywhere .
I 'm so tired of all of this …
It 's official .
Maliki and his people are psychopaths .
This really is a new low .
It 's outrageous - an execution during Eid.
Muslims all over the world ( with the exception of Iran ) are outraged .
Eid is a time of peace , of putting aside quarrels and anger - at least for the duration of Eid .
This does not bode well for the coming year .
No one imagined the madmen would actually do it during a religious holiday .
It is religiously unacceptable and before , it was constitutionally illegal .
We thought we'd at least get a few days of peace and some time to enjoy the Eid holiday , which coincides with the New Year this year .
We 've spent the first two days of a holy holiday watching bits and pieces of a sordid lynching .
America the savior …
After nearly four years and Bush 's biggest achievement in Iraq has been a lynching .
Bravo Americans .
Maliki has made the mistake of his life .
His signature and unhidden glee at the whole execution , especially on the first day of Eid Al Adha ( the Eid where millions of Muslims make a pilgrimage to Mecca ) , will only do more to damage his already tattered reputation .
He 's like a vulture in a suit ( or a balding weasel ) .
It 's almost embarrassing .
I kept expecting Muwafaq Al Rubaii to run over and wipe the drool from the corner of his mouth as he signed for the execution .
Are these the people who represent the New Iraq ?
We 're in so much more trouble than I ever thought .
And no- not the celebrations BBC are claiming .
With the exception of a few areas , the streets are empty .
Now we come to CNN .
Shame on you CNN journalists - you 're getting lazy .
The least you can do is get the last words correct when you write a story about an execution .
Your articles are read the world over and will go down in history as references .
You people are the biggest news network in the world - the least you can do is spend some money on a decent translator .
Saddam 's last words were NOT " Muqtada Al Sadr " as Munir Haddad claimed , according to the article below .
If anyone had seen at least part of the video they showed on TV , you 'd know that .
From the video that was leaked , it was not an executioner who yelled " long live Muqtada al - Sadr " .
See , this is another low the Maliki government sunk to - they had some hecklers conveniently standing by during the execution .
Maliki claimed they were " some witnesses from the trial " , but they were , very obviously , hecklers .
The moment the noose was around Saddam 's neck , they began chanting , in unison , " God 's prayers be on Mohamed and on Mohamed 's family … "
Something else I did n't quite catch ( but it was very coordinated ) , and then " Muqtada , Muqtada , Muqtada ! "
One of them called out to Saddam , " Go to hell … " ( in Arabic ) .
Saddam looked down disdainfully and answered " Heya hay il marjala… ? " which is basically saying , " Is this your manhood … ? " .
Someone half - heartedly called out to the hecklers , " I beg you , I beg you - the man is being executed ! "
They were slightly quieter and then Saddam stood and said , " Ashadu an la ilaha ila Allah , wa ashhadu ana Mohammedun rasool Allah … "
Which means , " I witness there is no god but Allah and that Mohammed is His messenger . "
These are the words a Muslim ( Sunnis and Shia alike ) should say on their deathbed .
He repeated this one more time , very clearly , but before he could finish it , he was lynched .
End of Another Year ...
You know your country is in trouble when :
The UN has to open a special branch just to keep track of the chaos and bloodshed , UNAMI .
Abovementioned branch cannot be run from your country .
The politicians who worked to put your country in this sorry state can no longer be found inside of , or anywhere near , its borders .
The only thing the US and Iran can agree about is the deteriorating state of your nation .
An 8 - year war and 13 - year blockade are looking like the country 's ' Golden Years ' .
Your country is purportedly ' selling ' 2 million barrels of oil a day , but you are standing in line for 4 hours for black market gasoline for the generator .
For every 5 hours of no electricity , you get one hour of public electricity and then the government announces it 's going to cut back on providing that hour .
Politicians who supported the war spend tv time debating whether it is ' sectarian bloodshed ' or ' civil war ' .
People consider themselves lucky if they can actually identify the corpse of the relative that 's been missing for two weeks .
A day in the life of the average Iraqi has been reduced to identifying corpses , avoiding car bombs and attempting to keep track of which family members have been detained , which ones have been exiled and which ones have been abducted .
2006 has been , decidedly , the worst year yet .
No- really .
The magnitude of this war and occupation is only now hitting the country full force .
It 's like having a big piece of hard , dry earth you are determined to break apart .
You drive in the first stake in the form of an infrastructure damaged with missiles and the newest in arms technology , the first cracks begin to form .
Several smaller stakes come in the form of politicians like Chalabi , Al Hakim , Talbani , Pachachi , Allawi and Maliki .
The cracks slowly begin to multiply and stretch across the once solid piece of earth , reaching out towards its edges like so many skeletal hands .
And you apply pressure .
You surround it from all sides and push and pull .
Slowly , but surely , it begins coming apart - a chip here , a chunk there .
That is Iraq right now .
The Americans have done a fine job of working to break it apart .
This last year has nearly everyone convinced that that was the plan right from the start .
There were too many blunders for them to actually have been , simply , blunders .
The ' mistakes ' were too catastrophic .
The people the Bush administration chose to support and promote were openly and publicly terrible - from the conman and embezzler Chalabi , to the terrorist Jaffari , to the militia man Maliki .
The decisions , like disbanding the Iraqi army , abolishing the original constitution , and allowing militias to take over Iraqi security were too damaging to be anything but intentional .
The question now is , but why ?
I really have been asking myself that these last few days .
What does America possibly gain by damaging Iraq to this extent ?
I 'm certain only raving idiots still believe this war and occupation were about WMD or an actual fear of Saddam .
Al Qaeda ?
That 's laughable .
Bush has effectively created more terrorists in Iraq these last 4 years than Osama could have created in 10 different terrorist camps in the distant hills of Afghanistan .
Our children now play games of ' sniper ' and ' jihadi ' , pretending that one hit an American soldier between the eyes and this one overturned a Humvee .
This last year especially has been a turning point .
Nearly every Iraqi has lost so much .
So much .
There 's no way to describe the loss we 've experienced with this war and occupation .
There are no words to relay the feelings that come with the knowledge that daily almost 40 corpses are found in different states of decay and mutilation .
There is no compensation for the dense , black cloud of fear that hangs over the head of every Iraqi .
Fear of things so out of ones hands , it borders on the ridiculous - like whether your name is ' too Sunni ' or ' too Shia ' .
Fear of the larger things - like the Americans in the tank , the police patrolling your area in black bandanas and green banners , and the Iraqi soldiers wearing black masks at the checkpoint .
Again , I can't help but ask myself why this was all done ?
What was the point of breaking Iraq so that it was beyond repair ?
Iran seems to be the only gainer .
Their presence in Iraq is so well - established , publicly criticizing a cleric or ayatollah verges on suicide .
Has the situation gone so beyond America that it is now irretrievable ?
Or was this a part of the plan all along ?
My head aches just posing the questions .
What has me most puzzled right now is : why add fuel to the fire ?
Sunnis and moderate Shia are being chased out of the larger cities in the south and the capital .
Baghdad is being torn apart with Shia leaving Sunni areas and Sunnis leaving Shia areas - some under threat and some in fear of attacks .
People are being openly shot at check points or in drive by killings …
Many colleges have stopped classes .
Thousands of Iraqis no longer send their children to school - it 's just not safe .
Why make things worse by insisting on Saddam 's execution now ?
Who gains if they hang Saddam ?
Iran , naturally , but who else ?
There is a real fear that this execution will be the final blow that will shatter Iraq .
Some Sunni and Shia tribes have threatened to arm their members against the Americans if Saddam is executed .
Iraqis in general are watching closely to see what happens next , and quietly preparing for the worst .
This is because now , Saddam no longer represents himself or his regime .
Through the constant insistence of American war propaganda , Saddam is now representative of all Sunni Arabs ( never mind most of his government were Shia ) .
The Americans , through their speeches and news articles and Iraqi Puppets , have made it very clear that they consider him to personify Sunni Arab resistance to the occupation .
Basically , with this execution , what the Americans are saying is " Look - Sunni Arabs - this is your man , we all know this .
We 're hanging him - he symbolizes you . "
And make no mistake about it , this trial and verdict and execution are 100 % American .
Some of the actors were Iraqi enough , but the production , direction and montage was pure Hollywood ( though low - budget , if you ask me ) .
That is , of course , why Talbani does n't want to sign his death penalty - not because the mob man suddenly grew a conscience , but because he does n't want to be the one who does the hanging - he wo n't be able to travel far away enough if he does that .
Maliki 's government could n't contain their glee .
They announced the ratification of the execution order before the actual court did .
A few nights ago , some American news program interviewed Maliki 's bureau chief , Basim Al - Hassani who was speaking in accented American English about the upcoming execution like it was a carnival he'd be attending .
He sat , looking sleazy and not a little bit ridiculous , his dialogue interspersed with ' gonna ' , ' gotta ' and ' wanna ' ...
Which happens , I suppose , when the only people you mix with are American soldiers .
My only conclusion is that the Americans want to withdraw from Iraq , but would like to leave behind a full - fledged civil war because it would n't look good if they withdraw and things actually begin to improve , would it ?
Here we come to the end of 2006 and I am sad .
Not simply sad for the state of the country , but for the state of our humanity , as Iraqis .
We 've all lost some of the compassion and civility that I felt made us special four years ago .
I take myself as an example .
Nearly four years ago , I cringed every time I heard about the death of an American soldier .
They were occupiers , but they were humans also and the knowledge that they were being killed in my country gave me sleepless nights .
Never mind they crossed oceans to attack the country , I actually felt for them .
Had I not chronicled those feelings of agitation in this very blog , I would n't believe them now .
Today , they simply represent numbers .
3000 Americans dead over nearly four years ?
Really ?
That 's the number of dead Iraqis in less than a month .
The Americans had families ?
Too bad .
So do we .
So do the corpses in the streets and the ones waiting for identification in the morgue .
Is the American soldier that died today in Anbar more important than a cousin I have who was shot last month on the night of his engagement to a woman he 's wanted to marry for the last six years ?
I do n't think so .
Just because Americans die in smaller numbers , it does n't make them more significant , does it ?
She was found malnourished and with four missing teeth during a Hamas raid on the hideout of a criminal gang .
Sabrina was returned to Gaza zoo - from where she was seized in November 2005 - and was being fed on minced meat to restore her strength .
Sabrina was only a few months old when she was kidnapped along with two Arabic - speaking parrots .
The director of the zoo offered a reward for her return , but there had been little word about her whereabouts and growing concern about her safety .
Sabrina 's captors were reported to be charging people 50 p to be photographed beside her .
The animal 's kidnapping was a story that Johnston himself covered before he was seized in March .
It was thought Sabrina was taken as a show of strength by the gang .
Her brother Sakher fought off the kidnappers .
At the time of her capture , Johnston told the BBC 's website that human abductions in the Gaza Strip usually ended with the victim being freed quickly and unharmed .
Johnston was released last week in good health after 114 days .
Sabrina was held for more than 20 months , and recovered only after an exchange of fire between Hamas militiamen and the gang .
As well as the two - year - old lioness , Hamas seized drugs and a weapons cache that had been the target of the raid .
There was no word on the Arabic - speaking parrots .
The releases of both Johnston and Sabrina have been credited to Hamas taking control of Gaza .
Sabrina was reunited today with Sakher at Gaza zoo .
" We will start a long , arduous treatment to ensure she can survive , " said the zoo 's vet , Soud al - Shawaa .
" She will only eat minced meat from now on so we feel sorry for her ...
They should punish the criminals who did this to her . "
Zoos have repeatedly been caught up in unrest in Gaza .
In 2004 several animals were killed when Gaza 's previous zoo , in the border town of Rafah , was destroyed by the Israeli army .
In the West Bank town of Qalqiliya in 2002 , three zebras died of tear gas inhalation and a giraffe was killed during a riot against Israeli security forces .
A reader writes :
What I 've never been able to understand about the torture debate is why people think that the highly specific ' ticking time bomb ' exception somehow invalidates the drafting of a law prohibiting torture .
Imagine , in a Rawls kind of way , that you were writing the laws of our society from scratch .
When you were devising speed limits , imagine if someone said , " Wait !
Someone , under certain specific circumstances , might need to speed home to help their wife in labor , or put out a fire .
We 'd better not prohibit speeding . "
Though I can't think of any situation that has ever actually happened where torture would be permissible , I can accept the possibility that it could come up .
But whoever , in that exceptional situation , makes the decision to torture , needs to stand in front of a judge and explain exactly why and how they did it .
Just like I would if I was busted for speeding , or murdered someone out of self - defense , or stole food to feed my family .
That 's how the law works .
Specific , situational exceptions do not invalidate general principles .
A new imaging technique developed at MIT has allowed scientists to create the first 3D images of a living cell , using a method similar to the X - ray CT scans doctors use to see inside the body .
The technique , described in a paper published in the Aug. 12 online edition of Nature Methods , could be used to produce the most detailed images yet of what goes on inside a living cell without the help of fluorescent markers or other externally added contrast agents , said Michael Feld , director of MIT 's George R. Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory and a professor of physics .
" Accomplishing this has been my dream , and a goal of our laboratory , for several years , " said Feld , senior author of the paper .
" For the first time the functional activities of living cells can be studied in their native state . "
Using the new technique , his team has created three - dimensional images of cervical cancer cells , showing internal cell structures .
They 've also imaged C. elegans , a small worm , as well as several other cell types .
The researchers based their technique on the same concept used to create three - dimensional CT ( computed tomography ) images of the human body , which allow doctors to diagnose and treat medical conditions .
CT images are generated by combining a series of two - dimensional X - ray images taken as the X - ray source rotates around the object .
" You can reconstruct a 3D representation of an object from multiple images taken from multiple directions , " said Wonshik Choi , lead author of the paper and a Spectroscopy Laboratory postdoctoral associate .
Cells do n't absorb much visible light , so the researchers instead created their images by taking advantage of a property known as refractive index .
Every material has a well - defined refractive index , which is a measure of how much the speed of light is reduced as it passes through the material .
The higher the index , the slower the light travels .
The researchers made their measurements using a technique known as interferometry , in which a light wave passing through a cell is compared with a reference wave that does n't pass through it .
A 2D image containing information about refractive index is thus obtained .
To create a 3D image , the researchers combined 100 two - dimensional images taken from different angles .
The resulting images are essentially 3D maps of the refractive index of the cell 's organelles .
The entire process took about 10 seconds , but the researchers recently reduced this time to 0.1 seconds .
The team 's image of a cervical cancer cell reveals the cell nucleus , the nucleolus and a number of smaller organelles in the cytoplasm .
The researchers are currently in the process of better characterizing these organelles by combining the technique with fluorescence microscopy and other techniques .
" One key advantage of the new technique is that it can be used to study live cells without any preparation , " said Kamran Badizadegan , principal research scientist in the Spectroscopy Laboratory and assistant professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School , and one of the authors of the paper .
With essentially all other 3D imaging techniques , the samples must be fixed with chemicals , frozen , stained with dyes , metallized or otherwise processed to provide detailed structural information .
" When you fix the cells , you can't look at their movements , and when you add external contrast agents you can never be sure that you have n't somehow interfered with normal cellular function , " said Badizadegan .
The current resolution of the new technique is about 500 nanometers , or billionths of a meter , but the team is working on improving the resolution .
" We are confident that we can attain 150 nanometers , and perhaps higher resolution is possible , " Feld said .
" We expect this new technique to serve as a complement to electron microscopy , which has a resolution of approximately 10 nanometers . "
Other authors on the paper are Christopher Fang - Yen , a former postdoctoral associate ; graduate students Seungeun Oh and Niyom Lue ; and Ramachandra Dasari , principal research scientist at the Spectroscopy Laboratory .
The research was conducted at MIT 's Laser Biomedical Research Center and funded by the National Institutes of Health and Hamamatsu Corporation .
The world of multi-core cpus we have just entered is facing a serious threat .
A security researcher at Cambridge disclosed a new class of vulnerabilities that takes advantage of concurrency to bypass security protections such as antivirus software
The attack is based on the assumption that the software that interacts with the kernel can be used without interference .
The researcher , Robert Watson , showed that a careful written exploit can attack in the little timeframe when this happens , and literally change the " words " that they are exchanging .
Even if some of these dark aspects of concurrency were already known , Watson proved that real attacks can be developed , and showed that developers have to fix their code .
Fast .
Watson presented his work at WOOT07 , USENIX Workshop on Offense Technology , the results of his research entitled " Exploiting Concurrency Vulnerabilities in System Call Wrappers " .
During the talk he showed how concurrency can be used to bypass security protections applied by so - called syscall wrappers .
A system call , briefly called syscall , is a basic function in the kernel that is called by a program .
For example , when you open a file it 's highly probable that the software you are using called the open ( ) syscall to open it .
A sycall wrapper sits between the kernel and the program itself , and analyzes which syscalls are called and their arguments .
A security wrapper might be configured to block access to some files , so in the previous example trying to open ( ) the file " secrets.txt " , it may stop the operation and return an error to the application .
We contacted Robert to learn more ...
How does the attack work ?
System call wrapping is a widely - used technique for extending kernel security , found in anti-virus systems and security policy enhancement frameworks such as the GSWTK , Systrace , and CerbNG systems I examine in the paper .
System call interposition allows code running in the kernel address space to " wrap " system calls , adding new security checks , replacing the values of arguments to virtualize name spaces , or to audit arguments for the purposes of logging or intrusion detection .
It 's a very flexible technique , and appealing to software authors because it does n't require changing existing kernel code , and allows control at the very well - understood system call interface .
This attack targets a weakness in the system call wraper architecture , in which system call arguments are separately copied by the system call wrapper and the kernel , allowing the attacker to " race " to replace the argument values between copies .
I was able to successfully bypass security in many system call wrappers by creating unmanaged concurrency between the attacking processes and the wrapper / kernel .
This was possible on both uniprocessor systems and multiprocessor systems .
The existence of some of these vulnerabilities has been known for years ( Ghormley 1998 , Garfinkel 2003 , Watson 2003 ) , and I approached the authors of many of these wrapper systems as early as 2002 to report the problems .
The contribution of this paper is in analyzing the vulnerability class , thoroughly exploring the attack space ( I identify two previously undiscussed classes of race conditions , one of which is more broadly applicable ) , and to explore exploit strategies , allowing us to reason about the effectiveness of this attack aproach .
It turns out that the approach is very effective indeed .
The paper [ PDF ] provides both a detailed discussion of the general class of concurrency vulnerabilities , and more concrete discussion of these specific vulnerabilities .
I 'd refer readers especially to the pictures and code in the slides [ PDF ] associated with the talk , which should make both the attack approach and simplicity of the exploits clear .
In less than 20 lines of C code , and using only standard OS calls for memory access and management , the wrapper protections were completely disabled .
You might think your anonymous online rants are oh - so - clever .
But they 'll give you away , too .
A federally - funded artificial intelligence lab is figuring out how to track people over the Internet , based on how they write .
The University of Arizona 's ultra-ambitious " Dark Web " project " aims to systematically collect and analyze all terrorist - generated content on the Web , " the National Science Foundation notes .
And that analysis , according to the Arizona Star , includes a program which " identif[ies ] and track [s ] individual authors by their writing styles . "
That component , called
Writeprint , helps combat the Web 's anonymity by studying thousands of lingual , structural and semantic features in online postings .
With 95
percent certainty , it can attribute multiple postings to a single author .
From there , Dark Web has the ability to track a single person over time as his views become radicalized .
The project analyzes which types of individuals might be more susceptible to recruitment by extremist groups , and which messages or rhetoric are more effective in radicalizing people .
The research comes with risks , according to the NSF .
Dark
Web also uses complex tracking software called Web spiders to search discussion threads and other content to find the corners of the
Internet where terrorist activities are taking place .
But according to [ Arizona 's ] Hsinchun Chen , sometimes the terrorists fight back .
" They can put booby - traps in their Web forums , " Chen explains , " and the spider can bring back viruses to our machines . "
This online cat - and - mouse game means Dark Web must be constantly vigilant against these and other counter - measures deployed by the terrorists .
The Arizona group has been at this sort of research for a while , now – sifting through more than 900,000 Islamist web pages .
Here 's a report Xeni filed last year for NPR on the Dark Web project .
And here 's a meaty blog post from Dancho Danchev on related projects .
Strangely , the Arizona AI lab 's website seems to be down right now .
But , thanks to the magic of Google , you can read a whole bunch of the the group 's " Dark Web " research papers here .
As the Star notes :

US Politics Time to Boycott Voting By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published October 01 , 2007
After many years of political disappointment , more progressives , liberals and conservatives – and certainly moderates and independents – know in their hearts that voting for Democrats or Republicans is a waste .
Just imagine if voter turnout was cut to 25 percent or less !
Let the whole world see Americans boycotting a broken and corrupt political system and rejecting what has become a delusional democracy .
To keep voting in an unjust political system makes us willing political slaves that the rich and powerful elites exploit .
Just leaving the major parties is not good enough and , besides , most Americans are not party members .
We need a bolder strategy .
We must humiliate the political elites in both major parties and the corporate interests that support both of them .
We can send a shock wave throughout the political establishment by not voting in the 2008 presidential election .
Stop playing THEIR game .
Take back control .
Take back YOUR nation .
Time to boycott voting .
This strategy is consistent with the thinking of Gandhi and King : peaceful resistance to political tyranny that can bring the corrupt system to its knees .
Ultimately , the most effective protest is through civil disobedience – to visibly and stubbornly refuse to respect what has become a corrupt , untrustworthy system .
Before it can be fixed it must be deconstructed and then rebuilt .
Taxation with misrepresentation means we need a Second American Revolution ; it must begin – not with violent action – but with massive withdrawal by citizens that have seen the light .
We have a good head start with about half of eligible voters already so turned off that they do n't vote .
Obviously that has not been sufficient to change the system .
Knee - Jerk Reactions
There will be negative , defensive knee - jerk reactions to this audacious strategy .
Let 's examine them :
Many will think that taking such action violates our responsibility as citizens .
But taking that responsibility seriously as engaged citizens in the Jeffersonian sense must reflect that there is still a valid contract between citizens and their government .
When we vote we have the right to a political system that respects we the people and gives us an authentic representative democracy .
We have a right to a constitutional republic operating under the rule of law .
But we have elected representatives that no longer have the public interest as their primary commitment , nor truly honor and respect our Constitution .
They have been corrupted by corporate and other special interests that fund their campaigns to get the laws , loopholes and largesse they want .
They have been corrupted by power and the perks of office .
They are political cowards and mostly intellectual midgets .
The two major parties have a stranglehold on our political system that no longer merits our participation in their crooked game .
Political parties are not part of our Constitution and the two - party duopoly has demonstrated that both Democrats and Republicans put their own interests above those of we the people , our nation and our democracy .
We can not vote our way out of our current , dreadful political system .
Whether you are on the political left or right , you will fear that not voting will help put in office people that support policies your abhor .
But decades of objective political reality tell us that even people from the party that we align with do not , when elected , fulfill their promises and our hopes .
Sadly , most Americans have become lesser - evil voters , deluding themselves that this is the best , least worse , yet awful choice .
Instead of feeling bad about voting for candidates that we know in our hearts are not worthy of our votes and public office , we must have the courage to say " enough is enough ; I will not play in this shameful game any longer . "
We must stop legitimizing and abetting our disgraceful government .
Many may fear that not voting sets a terrible example to children .
But is n't it more important to tell America 's children that true patriotism must reveal itself by rejecting a political system that no longer merits respect ?
Thomas Jefferson believed in periodic rebellion .
Now is the time for all good Americans to come to the rescue of their nation , peacefully by boycotting elections .
The small number of third party members may be screaming : yes , do n't vote for Democrats and Republicans ; come over and join us !
I have been a strong third party supporter , but we must face the painful truth .
The two major parties have so rigged the political system in their favor and against third parties that voting for third party candidates for federal office is a futile action .
Electoral Reforms
We must first boycott voting to create sufficient pressure to open the system to genuine political competition .
That requires a number of electoral reforms , possible if the nation gets its first Article V convention .
With reforms we can increase voter turnout to over 90 percent , as routinely seen in other democracies .
False patriotism may cause some to think that we must not show anti-American nations and terrorists that our government no longer has the trust of its citizens .
But that has already been widely disseminated by endless polls and surveys , including the recent Zogby poll that found a record - low 11 percent support for Congress .
Better to show our enemies that we have finally awakened and decided to re-assert our sovereignty and restore American democracy .
Loyalty to country , yes ; loyalty to government , no .
Our populist American insurgency must begin with a boycott of voting .
Proof that this extraordinary strategy can work is that by now diehard Democrats and Republicans reading this are squirming in discomfort .
So spread the word , if you have not deluded yourself about voting the nation into a far , far better place .
Time to boycott voting .
Join the picket line ; admit that none of the above is the only rational decision when the choices the two major parties give us for federal officials are not worth a dime .
Voting in a delusional representative democracy is as harebrained as voting even though you know votes will not be honestly counted – which many fear may be true .
We may have lost control of our government , but we still control our voting .
It 's time to walk away from the brainwashing and fiction that it really matters which Democrat or Republican you vote for in primaries and general elections for federal office .
Power elites want us to believe that .
They collude with the corporate mainstream media that make tons of money from campaigns and want you to stay glued to suspenseful horse races .
Loudmouth political pundits that narrate the races are democracy 's enemies .
We must stop watching and listening to the political entertainment designed to keep us obediently mesmerized , as if the game is honest .
Without an audience , these phony races and media circus will disappear .
The Primaries are a Sham
Do n't be fooled by the large number of candidates in the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries .
It is a sham – a scheme to keep spectators glued to the illusory competition .
Ron Paul has as much chance of being the Republican nominee as Dennis Kucinich has of being the Democratic nominee .
With power elites controlling both major parties , zero chance for them and the other minor candidates , regardless of their grassroots support .
Reflect on how both major parties accept lots of candidates in televised debates in the primary season .
But come the general election with prime time televised presidential debates they keep out third party candidates that desperately need that exposure to rally meaningful support .
Such is the hypocrisy and disdain of the two - party duopoly .
Come Election Day in 2008 we should party and celebrate ( with TVs turned off ) our populist boycott of voting and enjoy the camaraderie of fellow patriots .
We must help them resist any late urge to vote , because by then millions of dollars will be spent by many special interests to make us feel guilty and ashamed if we do not vote .
I can hear Paul Revere now :
The liars are coming !
The liars are coming !
All that advertising and pundit - screaming to herd us back into the voting booths will verify that our boycott strategy works .
With having the votes of only a small minority of the electorate , whoever becomes president will have no public mandate except major , systemic political reforms that satisfy the will of the people .
Either that or accept being the president of a fake democracy on the world scene .
Be brave .
Stick together .
Save voting for a reformed political system worthy of respect and participation .

The odds for this newborn female calf to grow into a successful deer partly depend on its parents ' genes .
A new study shows that if the father was a successful stag , the daughters chances for numerous offspring drop .
Like a secret ingredient to a signature recipe , " survival of the fittest " is a crucial part of the theory of evolution .
The fittest individuals survive to mate and pass on their genetic lineage , and the weaker creatures fail to pass on their wimpy genes .
But if that 's how it works , where do all the runts in nature come from ?
A new study of red deer populations , detailed in a recent issue of the journal Nature , suggests that a genetic tug - of - war related to sex may be responsible .
When red deer search for mates , each sex instinctively looks for different qualities .
Males seek out females that will produce the biggest , toughest sons , and females seek males that carry a genetic blueprint for the best offspring - creating daughters .
It turns out , however , that the genes that make a good male are n't the same genes that make a good female .
Such an evolutionary paradox creates weak members of each sex every generation alongside stronger members , and the " bad " genes do n't disappear because they 're inextricably tossed back and forth between the sexes , like a hot potato .
" The role of males is to gain control over female harems , so there 's strong selection going on for them to be competitive during the rut season , " said Katharina Foerster , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and co-author of the study .
Females , however , do n’t compete to mate .
" A fit female survives pregnancy and supports her calves , so her investment is over the whole year , " Foerster explained .
The bottom line : Both male and female traits work from the same set of genetic instructions — and that good genes for a male make a runty female , and vice - versa .
To discover the " antagonistic " genetic behavior , Foerster and her team used 34 years of data of a red deer population in the Isle of Rum , Scotland .
In total , data on 3,559 deer from eight generations were involved , along with mating observations and DNA evidence .
Foerster said it 's possible humans experience something similar .
" Theoretically , this can appear in any species , " she said .
But our complex mate - choosing behavior makes it hard for evolutionary scientists observe it .
The research helps explain why there 's so much variation in genes that biologists could n't previously account for .
" Nature is running towards an optimal solution , looking for the best puzzle pieces to play with , " Foerster said .
In the case of red deer and other animals , however , the piece for both a fit male and female does n't exist .
" I 'm not sure this is something successful evolution achieved , because it shows there ’s a constraint . "
Right wing on the march against Hillary eavesdropping allegations Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 16 , 2007

Print This Email This After spending two minutes vamping on Hillary Clinton in a diatribe that could n't have made GOP candidates smile more if they 'd written it themselves , Fox News hosts told their viewers that Republicans are planning to dredge up newly noticed scandals from Hillary Clinton 's past to smear the Democratic frontrunner .
Tuesday 's Fox & Friends discussed an article in The Hill about Republicans ' plans to paint Clinton as a hypocrite in the ongoing congressional debate over how to best legalize President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program because she is alleged to have listened in on secretly taped phone calls .
Clinton voted against a temporary measure in August that would have granted the president and National Security Agency sweeping new authority to eavesdrop on Americans ' conversations with limited oversight .
Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy introduced the story by misrepresenting that vote then pivoted to reminders of decade - old allegations of Bill Clinton 's infidelities .
" She has refused to allow our intelligence agencies to listen in on conversations being conducted by terrorists as a plot to blow us up , " Doocy said , repeating attacks aired by Republicans that critics of the administration 's surveillance are hindering the war on terror .
Democrats and Republicans agree that the NSA should have free reign in monitoring foreign - to - foreign terrorists ' conversations .
Clinton voted against the hastily passed Protect America Act , which critics said did not contain adequate judicial oversight of domestic surveillance .
But she voted for a narrower measure that would have addressed immediate " fixes " the administration said was needed to close a loophole in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The Senate is expected to introduce a new FISA update proposal this week , and the House is set to consider a measure that is sure to provoke a showdown with President Bush because it does not grant immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated warrantless spying on Americans .
According to The Hill , Republicans are planning to push the story that Hillary is hypocritical for not bowing to Bush 's demands for vast spy powers because she allegedly listened to surreptitious recording of political opponents during husband Bill Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign .
The claim was aired in a recent book by two Pulitzer Prize winning reporters .
Her Way , by Don Van Natta Jr. and Jeff Gerth , former New York Times reporters , says that Bill Clinton 's supporters would monitor cell phone frequencies and record conversations of political opponents .
The authors said Hillary Clinton listened to one of these apparently illegal intercepts , and so far her campaign has not denied the allegation .
Conservative blog Sweetness and Light reported the anecdote earlier this month .
" We do n't comment on books that are utter and complete failures , " Clinton 's Senate spokesman , Phillipe Reines , told The Hill , referring to Her Way 's low sales .
Doocy referred to the " illegally obtained " recording as " essentially a wiretap , " before diving in to the contents of the call .
" Apparently on the tape some people were talking about how there was another woman out there who may have had an affair with Bill Clinton , " Doocy said .
" There were probably a lot of those phone calls back then , in 1992 , " co-host Gretchen Carlson could n't resist chiming in .
" Yeeaaahh , " Doocy says ( emphasis his ) .
" You 're probably right . "

Charges are being dropped against Monica Montoya , the Good Samaritan whose case sparked controversy this summer when she was arrested after stopping to assist an injured pedestrian and then asked to translate for police at the accident scene in Roselle Park .
The 25 - year - old Dunkin ' Donuts shop clerk had paused to give the injured woman tissues after leaving her job early to catch a bus to pick up her 6 - year - old daughter from school in Elizabeth , when police asked her assistance in translating the Spanish spoken by the accident victim .
After helping police for about 10 minutes , Montoya has said she grew anxious about not being able to pick up her daughter on time .
The woman said she was knocked to the roadway by Police Officer Harold Breuninger and arrested as she walked toward a group of onlookers to borrow a cell phone to ask an acquaintance to pick up her daughter .
The Union County Prosecutor 's Office informed Roselle Park Municipal Judge Jeffrey Angelo in a letter dated Friday that it is " moving to dismiss the criminal complaint " charging Montoya with obstructing the administration of law and resisting arrest .
However , the prosecutor 's office did not find Montoya entirely blameless in the June 20 incident .
" Officer Breuninger charged Ms. Montoya with obstructing the administration of law because she refused to give him her name and address , " the prosecutor 's office stated in the letter drafted by Assistant Prosecutor Ann Rubin .
" However , under these circumstances , Ms. Montoya 's refusal to provide her name and address was not legally sufficient to establish the crime of obstructing . "
The letter continued that while " a person cannot resist an arrest , even if the arrest is unlawful , Ms. Montoya 's resistance was prompted in part by her concern for her child who she thought would be waiting for her alone if she missed her bus .
" Prosecuting Ms. Montoya for resisting arrest under these circumstances would only serve to discourage other citizens who decline to identify themselves for personal reasons from assisting the police , " the letter concluded .
" Good , " Roselle Park Municipal Court Administrator Maria Bruchal said today upon learning of the county prosecutor 's letter .
Court proceedings in the case resume Thursday , when Judge Angelo can grant or deny the motion for dismissal .

These analyses ( which are absurd to anyone with a basic knowledge of the oil&gas industry ) completely ignore the dynamics of what it takes to actually get a pipeline deal done , and what it means for relations between the parties involved .
Therefore they fail to understand the significance ( or lack thereof ) of announcements by energy companies or governments and wrongly interpret the geopolitical implications of both pipelines , and announcements of pipelines .
There are regularly stories in the media or in the blogosphere about various pipeline projects that are announced with much publicity , and are seen to have major strategic consequences , or conversely about projects that are more discreet but are seen as the " real " justification for various military or diplomatic acts .
For instance , the announcement last month of an agreement between Russia and several central Asian republics about a new pipeline was widely interpreted as a major move against European energy security .
Similarly , the war in Afghanistan has often been blamed on a long mooted Turkmenistan - Afghanistan - Pakistan pipeline .
In order to understand pipelines , it 's easiest to cut the task into smaller pieces , and see how these are required to be put in place and fit together .
But even before that , one fundamental question to ask whenever an article or anyone talks about a pipeline is : oil , or gas ?
The two are completely separate businesses , and are totally independent one from the other , but they are very often mixed up by uninformed commentators .
An article that includes a map that does not separate and identify the two networks , or that talks blithely about pipelines between two countries without identifying what resource is actually transported can safely be ignored as fundamentally clueless .
Beyond that first step , a cursory look at what is to be linked by any pipeline can allow to further eliminate many stories .
For instance , the article linked above about the Afghanistan pipeline talks throughout about oil , when the pipeline that was discussed for a while was a gas pipeline - for the simple reason that Afghanistan 's neighbor , Turkmenistan , has gas but little oil , and any oil pipeline would need to come from even further afar and involve more countries .
From now on , I will only be discussing gas pipelines .
The logic is mostly similar for oil , if a bit simpler ( I 'll comment on the differences where relevant ) .
With this point clarified let us address the components of a pipeline :
A supply of gas
A supplier of gas
A market for gas
A purchaser of gas
An entity operating the pipeline
Government authorisations for pipelines crossing their territory - for each country
A price for gas transport
An entity ( or more ) building the pipeline
An entity ( or more ) paying the pipeline
The fundamental point is that all of the relevant components and parties need to be present at the exact same time for the project to exist .
And by " being present " , I mean " irrevocably making binding commitments , representing large sums of money . "
And it is a surprisingly difficult job to bring all the parties to the table in that way at the right moment - which is why fewer pipelines than one would expect are built , and why few entities are actually able to pull it off .
And , as we will see , being able to pay for the pipeline is not quite enough .
A pipeline concept will usually come to life via 3 circumstances : ( i ) when a large supply of gas needs to be brought to the market , ( ii ) when a large enough market / customer not or insufficiently supplied needs gas , and ( iii ) when a large supply of gas and a large market are close enough that it might be worth linking them .
But that 's just a concept .
At that point , economics have not been examined , and parties even less .
The concept may be floated by analysts , examined by energy companies , pushed by entrepreneurs , or developed by politicians on any territory potentially involved .
This may already lead to punchy announcements by either of these .
What is important to understand is that at this point , the pipeline has no existence and no prospects yet .
What happens at this stage is a PR drive to try to give reality to the project and get serious players interested .
It may also be part of a campaign to favor one potential project over another , as companies and countries jockey to try to get their hands on potentially juicy assets - and also scare off competitors and alternatives .
If the concept looks potentially attractive ( basic economics look okay , the resource base is sufficient , there exists a need for transport capacity ) , more detailed studies will get funded to look a bit more closely at the engineering side and get a better handle of potential costs .
These studies will , again lead to further ( often triumphant ) announcements before and after the study , and fancy - sounding but , at this point , worthless , " memorandums of understanding " or similarly fluffy agreements will be signed in front of the media .
At this point , the pipeline is still nowhere near existing , and has not been subject to any kind of investment decision .
Let 's take a look again at the criteria for attractiveness :
The resource base
Enough gas must be available from the production area to fill up the pipeline .
Filling it up means using up the capacity for at least 20 years .
A 10 bcm/y ( billion cubic meters per year - 10 bcm /y is almost equal to 1 mmcfd - one million cubic feet per day ) pipeline will thus require a resource of at least 200 bcm ( or 7 Tcf - trillion cubic feet ) that needs to be transported .
This is not a trivial issue : many gas fields are called " stranded reserves " because they are not big enough ( or too far away ) to justify economically the construction of a pipeline to bring them to market .

This is not a trivial issue : many gas fields are called " stranded reserves " because they are not big enough ( or too far away ) to justify economically the construction of a pipeline to bring them to market .
The need for transport capacity
The gas resource must not have any other existing or obviously cheaper transport alternatives to be brought to market .
Any project where the gas is already using some other route , or could use another route , is unlikely to happen .
For instance , all the gas pipeline projects from Central Asia ( including the recently announced Russian one ) make no sense because a pipeline already exists and is not full - the mere existence of that available capacity is enough to undercut any alternative project and kill it .
A slightly more interesting situation happens when there is a real need for transportation capacity , but there are competing projects .
In that case , it is not necessarily the most economic that will happen , but that ( amongst those that are economically viable ) which first fulfills the condition stated above - bringing all the necessary parties together .
As the parties include the governments where the gas production takes place , and of the transit countries , it is necessary to convince these to come on board .
That 's where the PR / announcement wars will take place to try to make one project appear inevitable and align the necessary support of all the third parties behind it .
For so long as no firm investment commitment has been made , no project is actually inevitable , however strongly it may appear to have support .

For so long as no firm investment commitment has been made , no project is actually inevitable , however strongly it may appear to have support .
Basic economics look acceptable
This will come from a combination of the price of gas ( production costs plus taxes ) and the distance it needs to be transported , compared to the expected price on the destination market - which itself depends on whether the pipeline connects to a liquid market / network , to a single client or to other transport facilities ( LNG terminal , more pipeline transit ) which impose additional costs before the gas is actually sold .
A very rough estimate is that it costs 1 - 2 $ to transport a tcm ( thousand cubic meters ) over 100 km ( approximately - it costs 5 - 10 c to transport a MBTU over 100 miles ) .
The way these estimates are usually done is to start form the point of sale , deduct all transport and other costs to bring the gas there , and identify the " netback " that market provides at the point of production , i.e. the net amount that would end up in the producers 's pocket .
After the basic economic " smell test " has been run , the more detailed studies will give potential players a better grasp of the potential cost of the pipeline , and of the volumes of transit gas required to cover that cost in an economically sensible way .
Such a study will usually have been paid for by one or more potential parties along the gas chain ( a gas producer , a contractor , a government , a buyer ) , andmade available in more or less detail to possible partners .
What 's needed at that point is an entity able to drive the project to fruition .
Such an entity has to have a direct interest in getting the project done ( any of the above can play that role ) , but it needs something more , which is a lot rarer , and which explains why so many pipeline projects do n't become reality : that entity needs to be able to credibly convince others that the project will happen and thus that they can actually make their own commitment to it in the certainty that it 's not one - sided .
In other words , that entity needs to be an acceptable counterparty to all the other participants to the project - all those listed above .
That argument is enough to kill the notion that " China has billions of dollars , it can pay to build a pipeline ( from Turkmenistan or elsewhere ) " .
Money is not enough .
China cannot credibly convince the Turkmens that it will pay for the gas even if Kazakhstan blocks transit for some reason .
It cannot credibly promise to the Kazakhs that it will pay the transit fees even if gas is not delivered .
Because the amount at stake is not just the cost of the pipeline , it 's potentially the value of gas sales over 20 years .
And , more importantly , the Chinese themselves cannot trust the Turkmens to deliver the gas even if they have built the pipeline .
So , in practice , the leader the project is either a company or an entity that controls most of the chain ( say , Gazprom , which has the gas , the technical know how , the financial means and the ability to get approval for pipelines inside Russia ) , or a company that both has a stake in the pipeline and the track record to lead such projects - i.e. an oil major or , in a few cases , very large gas buyers like the aluminium smelting companies .
Absent these , a project is highly unlikely to ever happen .
But let 's see in more detail what the various commitments mean , who needs them , and how they can be credibly provided .
Let 's take the items listed above in the same order :

LOS ANGELES , Aug. 23 — The New Mexico attorney general has reopened an investigation into whether the CBS reality show “ Kid Nation ” violated the state ’s child - labor laws and other state regulations governing the welfare of children , a spokesman for the attorney general said on Thursday .
The spokesman , Phil Sisneros , said the attorney general , Gary K. King , ordered his department , which had halted its investigation of the show in late May after the production ended its two - month stay in the state , to “ go back and look at this and see if there were any problems ” with the program .
A parent of one child who appeared in the program complained about injuries and working conditions at the site .
Officials at two agencies — the New Mexico Children , Youth and Families Department and the Department of Workforce Solutions — also said that state law required that the show be reviewed and licensed but that CBS never contacted those departments before filming .
When you look at the ground beneath your feet , you ’re looking at matter created in the heart of stars at the end of their lives .
Some of the heavier elements were fashioned in the supernovae explosions of massive stars .
And in many cases , these elements went through several generations of stars .
So it was a tremendous surprise this week when astronomers discovered planets orbiting a metal poor star .
The discovery was made by a team of researchers from the University of Texas using the 9.2 - metre Hobby - Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory .
They found a system of two Jupiter - like planets orbiting a star that ’s so low in metals that it should n’t have planets at all .
But there they are .
The star is known as HD 155358 , and the planets were discovered using the radial velocity method , where the gravity from the planets pull the star back and forth with a velocity we can detect here on Earth .
This allows astronomers to calculate their mass and the length of their orbit .
One planet has an orbital period of 195 days and has 90 % the mass of Jupiter .
The other takes 530 days and has 50 % the mass of Jupiter .
They actually orbit so close to one another , that they must gravitationally interact .
They push each other around .
A commonly - held model of planetary formation requires that there are large quantities of heavy metals present in the protoplanetary disk .
Finding such a low metal star , but still with two planets around it , is an impressive find , and will give astronomers reason to reconsider their theories .

Aerospace manufacturers picked it up and used it widely in their ads during the next few months , and soon it was being quoted in many news and magazine articles .
Murphy 's Law was born .
The Northrop project manager , George E. Nichols , had a few laws of his own .
Nichols ' Fourth Law says , " Avoid any action with an unacceptable outcome . "
The doctor , well - known Col. John P. Stapp , had a paradox : Stapp 's Ironical Paradox , which says , " The universal aptitude for ineptitude makes any human accomplishment an incredible miracle . "
Nichols is still around .
At NASA 's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena , he 's the quality control manager for the Viking project to send an unmanned spacecraft to Mars .
' The little - known ninth law of thermodynamics states that the more money a group receives from the taxpayer , the more it demands and the more it complains . "
Thus wrote Matt Ridley in 1994 .
He was discussing farm subsidies , but the same law applies to his chairmanship of Northern Rock .
Before he resigned on Friday , the bank had borrowed £ 16bn from the government and had refused to rule out asking for more .
Ridley and the other bosses blamed everyone but themselves for this disaster .
I used to read Ridley 's columns religiously .
Published by the Telegraph in the 1990s , they were well - written , closely argued and almost always wrong .
He railed against all government intervention and mocked less enlightened beings for their failure to understand economics and finance .
The rightwing press loved him because he appeared to provide a scientific justification for the deregulation of business .
Ridley 's core argument , which he explains at greater length in his books , is that humans , being the products of natural selection , act only in their own interests .
But our selfish instincts encourage us to behave in ways that appear altruistic .
By cooperating and by being perceived as generous , we earn other people 's trust .
This allows us to advance our own interests more effectively than we could by cheating , stealing and fighting .
To permit these beneficial genetic tendencies to flower , governments should withdraw from our lives and stop interfering in business and other human relations .
Ridley produced a geneticist 's version of the invisible hand of the market , recruiting humanity 's selfish interests to dole out benefits to everyone .
Ridley , who has a DPhil in zoology , is no stranger to good science , and his explorations of our evolutionary history , which are often fascinating and provoking , are based on papers published in peer - reviewed journals .
But whenever a conflict arose between his scientific training and the interests of business , he would discard the science .
Ignoring hundreds of scientific papers that came to the opposite conclusion , and drawing instead on material presented by a business lobby group called the Institute of Economic Affairs , he argued that global temperatures have scarcely increased , so we should stop worrying about climate change .
He suggested that elephants should be hunted for their ivory , planning laws should be scrapped , recycling should be stopped , bosses should be free to choose whether or not their workers get repetitive strain injury and companies , rather than governments , should be allowed to decide whether or not the food they sell is safe .
He raged against taxes , subsidies , bailouts and government regulation .
Bureaucracy , he argued , is " a self - seeking flea on the backs of the more productive people of this world ... governments do not run countries , they parasitise them " .
I studied zoology in the same department , though a few years later .
Like Ridley , I am a biological determinist : I believe that much of our behaviour is governed by our evolutionary history .
I accept the evidence he puts forward , but draw completely different conclusions .
He believes that modern humans are destined to behave well if left to their own devices ; I believe that they are likely to behave badly .
If you belong to a small group of intelligent hominids , all of whom are well known to each other , you will be rewarded for cooperation and generosity within the group .
( Though this does not stop your group from attacking or exploiting another . )
If , on the other hand , you can switch communities at will , travel freely , buy in one country and sell in another , hire strangers then fire them , you will gain more from acting only in your own interest .
You 'll have an even stronger incentive to act against the common good if you run a bank whose lending and borrowing are so complex that hardly anyone can understand what is happening .
Ridley and I have the same view of human nature : that we are inherently selfish .
But the question is whether this nature is subject to the conditions that prevailed during our evolutionary history .
I believe they have changed : we can no longer be scrutinised and held to account by a small community .
We need governments to fill the regulatory role vacated when our tiny clans dissolved .
I can offer nothing more than speculation , but Ridley has had the opportunity to test his beliefs .
He took up his post - which was previously held by his father , Viscount Ridley - in 2004 .
Under his chairmanship , the Economist notes , Northern Rock " pushed an aggressive business model to the limit , crossing its fingers and hoping that liquidity would always be there " .
It was allowed to do so because it was insufficiently regulated by the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority .
When his libertarian business model failed , Ridley had to go begging to the detested state .
If the government and its parasitic bureaucrats had not been able to use taxpayers ' money to clear up his mess , thousands of people would have lost their savings .
Northern Rock would have collapsed , and the resulting panic might have brought down the rest of the banking system .
The £ 16bn bailout is not the end of the matter .
Last week the Treasury granted Northern Rock 's customers a new tax break .
Now one of the north - east 's leading businessmen , Sir Michael Darrington , is calling for the bank 's full - scale nationalisation in order to prevent further crises .
So much for the virtues of unregulated free enterprise .
Wherever modern humans , living outside the narrow social mores of the clan , are allowed to pursue their genetic interests without constraint , they will hurt other people .
They will grab other people 's resources , they will dump their waste in other people 's habitats , they will cheat , lie , steal and kill .
And if they have power and weapons , no one will be able to stop them except those with more power and better weapons .
Our genetic inheritance makes us smart enough to see that when the old society breaks down , we should appease those who are more powerful than ourselves and exploit those who are less powerful .
The survival strategies that once ensured cooperation among equals now ensure subservience to those who have broken the social contract .
The democratic challenge , which becomes ever more complex as the scale of human interactions increases , is to mimic the governance system of the small hominid troop .
We need a state that rewards us for cooperating and punishes us for cheating and stealing .
At the same time , we must ensure that the state is also treated like a member of the hominid clan and punished when it acts against the common good .
Human welfare , just as it was a million years ago , is guaranteed only by mutual scrutiny and regulation .
I doubt that Ridley would be able to sustain his beliefs in a place where the state has broken down .
Unless taxpayers ' money and public services are available to repair the destruction it causes , libertarianism destroys people 's savings , wrecks their lives and trashes their environment .
It is the belief system of the free - rider , who is perpetually subsidised by responsible citizens .
As biologists we both know what this means .
Self - serving as governments might be , the true social parasites are those who demand their dissolution .

Veteran CBS newsman Bob Schieffer offered a commentary Sunday on the upcoming report from General Petraeus on conditions in Iraq , observing , " When I ask a question and guests start laying out conditions ... I know that we 're headed down the old rabbit trail . "
" Excuse me for getting a little suspicious , " Schieffer said , pointing out that " the White House want [s ] the general to deliver the report to Congress behind closed doors while Cabinet officers do the talking in public .
And suddenly we 're told the general wo n't actually write the report , but that his thoughts will be included in a summary prepared by the White House . "
" This is the report the president has said over and over that he will use to decide where we go from here in Iraq , " concluded Schieffer .
" Maybe it 's because I 've been dragged down the old rabbit trail too many times by too many people with something to hide , but this does not sound like we 're headed to a straight answer . "
The following video is from CBS 's Face The Nation , broadcast on August 19 .
the coming age of enraging technology
Lousy design and poor failure scenarios are going to be the downfall of ubicomp systems .
I 've been on the verge of a screaming fit twice in the last two days , due to the wonderful digital technologies that are becoming pervasive in my life .
And at least twice more , I have just shaken my head in disbelief and shame at the ignorance of certain design engineers .
I 'm going to tell you about these experiences .
Screaming fit # 1 .
I go to my neighborhood gas station to fill up .
Swipe the credit card , start to pump , and nothing .
Wiggled stuff , pushed buttons , tried to restart the pump -- finally got 30 cents of gas to flow .
The station attendant comes out , asks me to try a different pump so I do , and the same thing happens , this time 25 cents .
He shrugs and says they must have run out of gas .
So I go down the street to another station , swipe the credit card -- DECLINED .
The Visa fraud detection algorithm detected a card theft in progress , and locked me out .
Unbelievable , I 'm incensed .
I do n't have my phone , so I steam all the way home and call Visa , where I have to endure a 5 minute automated transaction verification process before I can talk to a person .
I 'm sorry to say I was not very nice to her , but she cleared the lockout anyway .
She offered to let me explain to their security team just how lame their algorithms are , but I could n't see what good it would do , so I said goodbye .
Screaming fit # 2 .
I go to the united.com website to use online check - in for a flight .
It pulls up the right records from the database , but it says it can't find a valid e-ticket for the reservation , so I can't check in .
Fine , so I call the United reservation desk .
Actually it 's a voice response system , one of those you have to talk to .
Just knowing this , my BP starts to rise .
It asks for my confirmation # , but after three tries of spelling it out , it cannot figure out what I am saying .
It asks for flight date , flight number , airport and last name , and finally finds the reservation , but still wants me to follow one of its preprogrammed scenarios .
I ask for a human in every way I can think of , but I 'm stuck in a voice - response cul - de-sac .
Now I 'm yelling and cursing at a digital voice synthesizer , and it 's not helping anybody .
Finally it gives up and transfers me to a human , promising that all the info I gave it will be transferred to the person 's screen .
It was n't .
I 'm sorry to say , I was not very nice to that person either , nor to the next person they transferred me to .
After that it got worse before it got better , but you get the picture .
Oh , a possible silver lining to this story -- I was told by one of the agents that if you hit " 0 " or " # " 3 times , the system will send you to a human .
Remember that for next time .
Head shaker # 1 .
In our newly refurbished conference rooms , they installed automated control systems for the projector and the conference phone .
In order to use these appliances , you have to get up from the table , walk over to the corner of the room , and interact with a little touchscreen panel .
Turn on the projector ?
Walk .
Dial the phone ?
Walk .
Mute the phone ?
Walk .
Hang up the phone ?
Walk .
Stupid loser designers , what were you thinking ?
Head shaker # 2 .
Same newly rebuilt conference rooms .
Ethernet jacks installed into the tabletop , cables carefully shrinkwrapped and routed under the floor .
For a room designed to hold 12 people , there are 4 jacks .
And three of them are broken in some non-obvious , non user - serviceable fashion .
And we 're a freakin ' computer company , go figure that one out .
I hope ubicomp really does take a hundred years .
That way I 'll be spared the indignity of having to use it .
A reader notices something telling : the photographer responsible for the weeping Paris Hilton photographs today , Nick Ut , has a slightly different journalistic pedigree .
He took the Pulitzer - winning napalmed Vietnamese girl photograph .

CBS News : Violence suggests Iraq ' surge ' is failing
David Edwards
Published : Thursday April 19 , 2007 Print This Email This
A CBS News report suggests that President Bush 's ' surge ' strategy in Iraq is now failing due to a resurgence in bombings and sectarian killings in the capital city of Baghdad .
" At first it worked , " reported CBS News 's Martin Seemungal .
" Many militia men left the city or went underground , there were fewer bombings in central Baghdad , life was returning to the streets .
Now sectarian killings are on the rise and the bombers are back in the capital with a vengeance . "
Seemungal continued , " Sunni extremists are thought to be behind most of the recent attacks which targeted heavily Shiite areas .
The plan everyone here knows is simple : to ignite the all out civil war the surge was designed to stop . "
The lastest Associated Press report on Iraq notes , " A suicide bomber breached Baghdad 's heavy security presence again Thursday , killing a dozen people in a mostly Shiite district a day after more than 230 people died in one of the war 's deadliest episodes of violence . "
By mimicking a brick - and - mortar molecular structure found in seashells , University of Michigan researchers created a composite plastic that 's as strong as steel but lighter and transparent .
It 's made of layers of clay nanosheets and a water - soluble polymer that shares chemistry with white glue .
Engineering professor Nicholas Kotov almost dubbed it " plastic steel , " but the new material is n't quite stretchy enough to earn that name .
Nevertheless , he says its further development could lead to lighter , stronger armor for soldiers or police and their vehicles .
It could also be used in microelectromechanical devices , microfluidics , biomedical sensors and valves and unmanned aircraft .
Kotov and other U - M faculty members are authors of a paper on this composite material , " Ultrastrong and Stiff Layered Polymer Nanocomposites , " published in the Oct. 5 edition of Science .
The scientists solved a problem that has confounded engineers and scientists for decades : Individual nano - size building blocks such as nanotubes , nanosheets and nanorods are ultrastrong .
But larger materials made out of bonded nano - size building blocks were comparatively weak .
Until now .
" When you tried to build something you can hold in your arms , scientists had difficulties transferring the strength of individual nanosheets or nanotubes to the entire material , " Kotov said .
" We 've demonstrated that one can achieve almost ideal transfer of stress between nanosheets and a polymer matrix . "
The researchers created this new composite plastic with a machine they developed that builds materials one nanoscale layer after another .
The robotic machine consists of an arm that hovers over a wheel of vials of different liquids .
In this case , the arm held a piece of glass about the size of a stick of gum on which it built the
new material .
The arm dipped the glass into the glue - like polymer solution and then into a liquid that was a dispersion of clay nanosheets .
After those layers dried , the process repeated .
It took 300 layers of each the glue - like polymer and the clay nanosheets to create a piece of this material as thick as a piece of plastic wrap .
Mother of pearl , the iridescent lining of mussel and oyster shells , is built layer - by - layer like this .
It 's one of the toughest natural mineral - based materials .
The glue - like polymer used in this experiment , which is polyvinyl alcohol , was as important as the layer - by - layer assembly process .
The structure of the " nanoglue " and the clay nanosheets allowed the layers to form cooperative hydrogen bonds , which gives rise to what Kotov called " the Velcro effect . "
Such bonds , if broken , can reform easily in a new place .
The Velcro effect is one reason the material is so strong .
Another is the arrangement of the nanosheets .
They 're stacked like bricks , in an alternating pattern .
" When you have a brick - and - mortar structure , any cracks are blunted by each interface , " Kotov explained .
" It 's hard to replicate with nanoscale building blocks on a large scale , but that 's what we 've achieved . "

Wow , what an orgy of emotion was unleashed in New York City Monday , most of it rather nasty and negative , when President Ahmadinejad of Iran arrived to begin his Big Apple itnerary , which included a speaking engagement at Columbia University yesterday ( where its president rudely attacked his guest for several minutes as an introduction ) and a speech at the United Nations today , Tuesday September 25 .
AIPAC and other pro-Israel organizations brought out their phalanxes of troops and ratcheted up the propaganda machinery to try to will him off the planet , which did n't work , and they probably would have torn him to pieces if there had n't been lots of cops protecting the motor entourage to boot .
For Ahmadinejad is , you see , the Demon Persian of Tehran , this image largely based on the infamous statement attributed to him that Israel should be " wiped off the map " .
Unfortunately , it is hopelessly lost on those locked into total hatred of the man that this was never what he said .
The original , above diabolical phrase was actually a terrible translation of what he had recited in Farsi ( Persian language ) .
He had originally quoted an old Ayatollah Khomeini statement that I am now going to let Arash Norouzi enlighen us about from his article dated January 18 , 2007 .
Here is the original statement and Norouzi 's commentary .
( Reference : click here So , we have been brought to the edge of war with Iran based largely on , as with Iraq , Neocon - hyped bullshit like this .
To the global , maniacal Neocon movement , this of course does n't matter .
Any excuse will do to attack Iran .
The Cheney faction in the White House and the Israeli Right - wing , which basically controls Israel these days , both simply want a cowed and broken Iran smoldering in ruins , just as Rome continuously had it in for Carthage in ancient times .
Rome ultimately destroyed the entire city of Carthage after decades and decades of war and salted all its farming fields so crops would not grow again .
He was speaking in a BBC interview ahead of a state visit to the UK - the first by a Saudi monarch for 20 years .
He also said Britain failed to act on information passed by the Saudis which might have averted terrorist attacks .
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says Whitehall officials have strenuously denied this .
King Abdullah is expected to arrive in the UK on Monday afternoon ; his visit begins formally on Tuesday .
In the BBC interview he said the fight against terrorism needed much more effort by countries such as Britain and that al - Qaeda continued to be a big problem for his country .
BBC world affairs correspondent John Simpson says King Abdullah is annoyed that the rest of the world has largely failed to act on his proposal for a UN clearing house for information about terrorism .
Terror ' information '
Speaking through an interpreter , the Saudi monarch said he believed most countries were not taking the issue seriously , " including , unfortunately , Great Britain " .
" We have sent information to Great Britain before the terrorist attacks in Britain but unfortunately no action was taken .
And it may have been able to maybe avert the tragedy . "
I think it 's quite wrong that as a country we should give the leader of Saudi Arabia this honour
Vince Cable ,
Acting Lib Dem leader
Cable to boycott king visit
The Saudi leadership maintains that it passed the UK information that might have averted the London bombings of 2005 if it had been acted on .
An investigation by Parliament 's Intelligence and Security Committee ( ISC ) found no evidence of any intelligence passed on by the Saudis that could have prevented the 7 July 2005 bombings , the BBC's Frank Gardner said .
The king 's visit has provoked controversy over Britain 's relationship with Saudi Arabia .
A demonstration is planned outside the Saudi embassy in London later in the week in protest at the country 's human rights record .
And acting Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has announced he is boycotting the visit , citing the corruption scandal over Al Yamamah arms deal , and the Saudis ' human rights record .
" I think it 's quite wrong that as a country we should give the leader of Saudi Arabia this honour , " he said .
' Long - standing friendship '
Kate Allen , director of Amnesty International UK , urged Prime Minister Gordon Brown to tell the Saudis that their human rights record was " totally unacceptable " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
My jaw hit the floor when I read King Abdullah was accusing the UK of not doing enough about terrorism

She added : " Mr Brown 's message should be - reforms need to come , and they need to come quickly . "
The Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , has pulled out of a scheduled meeting with the Saudi delegation to spend time with his wife and their newly - adopted second son .
It is understood that Mr Miliband is returning from the United States , where he was present at the birth of Jacob .
He was replaced by Foreign Office Minister Kim Howells .
A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said that the decision to invite King Abdullah was a reflection of the " long - standing friendship " between the two nations .
Instance Features
Amazon EC2 instances provide a number of additional features to help you deploy , manage , and scale your applications .
Burstable Performance Instances
Amazon EC2 allows you to choose between Fixed Performance Instances ( e.g. M5 , C5 , and R5 ) and Burstable Performance Instances ( e.g. T3 ) .
Burstable Performance Instances provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline .
T Unlimited instances can sustain high CPU performance for as long as a workload needs it .
For most general - purpose workloads , T Unlimited instances will provide ample performance without any additional charges .
The hourly T instance price automatically covers all interim spikes in usage when the average CPU utilization of a T instance is at or less than the baseline over a 24 - hour window .
If the instance needs to run at higher CPU utilization for a prolonged period , it can do so at a flat additional charge of 5 cents per vCPU - hour .
T instances ’ baseline performance and ability to burst are governed by CPU Credits .
Each T instance receives CPU Credits continuously , the rate of which depends on the instance size .
T instances accrue CPU Credits when they are idle , and use CPU credits when they are active .
A CPU Credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute .
For example , a t2.small instance receives credits continuously at a rate of 12 CPU Credits per hour .
This capability provides baseline performance equivalent to 20 % of a CPU core ( 20 % x 60 mins = 12 mins ) .
If the instance does not use the credits it receives , they are stored in its CPU Credit balance up to a maximum of 288 CPU Credits .
When the t2.small instance needs to burst to more than 20 % of a core , it draws from its CPU Credit balance to handle this surge automatically .
With T2 Unlimited enabled , the t2.small instance can burst above the baseline even after its CPU Credit balance is drawn down to zero .
For a vast majority of general purpose workloads where the average CPU utilization is at or below the baseline performance , the basic hourly price for t2.small covers all CPU bursts .
If the instance happens to run at an average 25 % CPU utilization ( 5 % above baseline ) over a period of 24 hours after its CPU Credit balance is drawn to zero , it will be charged an additional 6 cents ( 5 cents / vCPU - hour x 1 vCPU x 5 % x 24 hours ) .
Many applications such as web servers , developer environments and small databases do n’t need consistently high levels of CPU , but benefit significantly from having full access to very fast CPUs when they need them .
T instances are engineered specifically for these use cases .
If you need consistently high CPU performance for applications such as video encoding , high volume websites or HPC applications , we recommend you use Fixed Performance Instances .
T instances are designed to perform as if they have dedicated high speed Intel cores available when your application really needs CPU performance , while protecting you from the variable performance or other common side - effects you might typically see from over - subscription in other environments .
Multiple Storage Options
Amazon EC2 allows you to choose between multiple storage options based on your requirements .
Amazon EBS is a durable , block - level storage volume that you can attach to a single , running Amazon EC2 instance .
You can use Amazon EBS as a primary storage device for data that requires frequent and granular updates .
For example , Amazon EBS is the recommended storage option when you run a database on Amazon EC2 .
Amazon EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an Amazon EC2 instance .
Once a volume is attached to an instance you can use it like any other physical hard drive .
Amazon EBS provides three volume types to best meet the needs of your workloads : General Purpose ( SSD ) , Provisioned IOPS ( SSD ) , and Magnetic .
General Purpose ( SSD ) is the new , SSD - backed , general purpose EBS volume type that we recommend as the default choice for customers .
General Purpose ( SSD ) volumes are suitable for a broad range of workloads , including small to medium sized databases , development and test environments , and boot volumes .
Provisioned IOPS ( SSD ) volumes offer storage with consistent and low - latency performance , and are designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases .
Magnetic volumes provide the lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types .
Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently , and applications where the lowest storage cost is important .
Many Amazon EC2 instances can also include storage from disks that are physically attached to the host computer .
This disk storage is referred to as instance store .
Instance store provides temporary block - level storage for Amazon EC2 instances .
The data on an instance store volume persists only during the life of the associated Amazon EC2 instance .
In addition to block level storage via Amazon EBS or instance store , you can also use Amazon S3 for highly durable , highly available object storage .
Learn more about Amazon EC2 storage options from the Amazon EC2 documentation .
EBS - optimized Instances
For an additional , low , hourly fee , customers can launch selected Amazon EC2 instances types as EBS - optimized instances .
For M6g , M5 , M4 , C6g , C5 , C4 , R6g , P3 , P2 , G3 , and D2 instances , this feature is enabled by default at no additional cost .
EBS - optimized instances enable EC2 instances to fully use the IOPS provisioned on an EBS volume .
EBS - optimized instances deliver dedicated throughput between Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS , with options between 500 and 4,000 Megabits per second ( Mbps ) depending on the instance type used .
The dedicated throughput minimizes contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other traffic from your EC2 instance , providing the best performance for your EBS volumes .
EBS - optimized instances are designed for use with all EBS volumes .
When attached to EBS - optimized instances , Provisioned IOPS volumes can achieve single digit millisecond latencies and are designed to deliver within 10 % of the provisioned IOPS performance 99.9 % of the time .
We recommend using Provisioned IOPS volumes with EBS - optimized instances or instances that support cluster networking for applications with high storage I/O requirements .
Cluster Networking
Select EC2 instances support cluster networking when launched into a common cluster placement group .
A cluster placement group provides low - latency networking between all instances in the cluster .
The bandwidth an EC2 instance can utilize depends on the instance type and its networking performance specification .
Inter instance traffic within the same region can utilize up to 5 Gbps for single - flow and up to 100 Gbps for multi- flow traffic in each direction ( full duplex ) .
Traffic to and from S3 buckets in the same region can also utilize all available instance aggregate bandwidth .
When launched in a placement group , instances can utilize up to 10 Gbps for single - flow traffic and up to 100 Gbps for multi- flow traffic .
Network traffic to the Internet is limited to 5 Gbps ( full duplex ) .
Cluster networking is ideal for high performance analytics systems and many science and engineering applications , especially those using the MPI library standard for parallel programming .

I have written before about my admiration for Web typography , and in that article I touched on the fact that many “ Web safe ” fonts ca n’t be applied to Linux .
Linux distributions each ship with their own font libraries , but I ’d like to focus on similar typefaces you can use within a font - family to help make your design bulletproof .
Like Windows & OS X , Linux does type too
I ’ve been a Linux user for some time now , and Linux is my platform of choice both at work and at home .
My distribution of choice is Ubuntu not because it ’s the most popular , but because I ’ve tried a wide variety of Linux versions , and Ubuntu works the best for me .
I say this because I ’m going to focus on the fonts that ship by default with Ubuntu , so there may be some discrepancy among distributions .
While the list of Web safe fonts we have come to know and love is relied heavily upon , it can be very beneficial to include similar default Linux fonts in your font - family as well .
What about msttcorefonts ?
msttcorefonts is a Linux package providing many Microsoft fonts for easy installation .
Personally msttcorefonts is one of the first packages I install when setting up a new Linux installation , but it ca n’t be assumed that every other Linux user does the same .
I ’m sure there are many people who choose not to install the package as well , leaving readers out to dry when a bulletproof font - family is not provided .
The fonts provided with msttcorefonts are as follows :
Andale Mono
Arial Black
Arial ( Bold , Italic , Bold Italic )
Comic Sans MS ( Bold )
Courier New ( Bold , Italic , Bold Italic )
Georgia ( Bold , Italic , Bold Italic )
Impact
Times New Roman ( Bold , Italic , Bold Italic )
Trebuchet ( Bold , Italic , Bold Italic )
Verdana ( Bold , Italic , Bold Italic )
Webdings
Taking into consideration Common fonts to all versions of Windows & Mac equivalents , there are a number of fonts often included in designs that readers running Linux will never see ( by default ) .

Using a fresh installation of Ubuntu , I took some time to find Linux typefaces that closely resemble fonts commonly used in Web design .
I have purposely left a number of fonts out due to their rarity in actual use .
The fonts you wo n’t find in the following screen shots are :
Webdings
Wingdings
Zapf Dingbats
Symbol
MS Serif
MS Sans Serif
While Linux does ship with a couple symbol - based fonts , I have chosen to exclude them due to character inconsistencies
Linux equivalents to common Windows and OS X Fonts
The following are n’t meant to be exact replicas of fonts from Windows or OS X .
They ’re merely a similar typeface to use as a last resort in your font - family for us Linux users .
Arial Charcoal Comic Sans MS Courier New Georgia Helvetica Lucida Grande New York Tahoma Times New Roman Palatino Linotype Verdana
I know some of the above examples are a stretch and certain flagship characters do n’t quite fit , but in my opinion they ’re pretty close .
That is much of the reason behind the existence of multiple equivalents for certain fonts .
I ’ll leave the final decision up to you and your good discretion .
There are still a few fonts to go over
Unfortunately there was a list of fonts to which I was unable to find a Linux equivalent :
Book Antiqua
Impact
Monaco
Lucida Console
Geneva
Lucida Sans Unicode
Trebuchet MS
Arial Black
While these typefaces do n’t have a similar equivalent in Linux , all is not lost .
You should always provide a very generic “ failsafe ” font at the end of your font - family in an effort to at least control whether your font is serif , sans - serif , or monospace .
Keep Linux
Web fonts in consideration
Many people find Linux to be an afterthought as far as target audience is concerned , but Linux is exponentially increasing in popularity as an alternative to other operating systems .
As a Linux user , it ’s easier for me to keep an eye on inconsistencies and try to compensate in the best way possible .
Web design should be bulletproof & your choice of type should be no different .
Judas ' cuff partially conceals the traitor 's infamous bag of money ; a close - up reveals more .
View Slideshow MILAN , Italy – A 16 - billion - pixel image of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper – said to be the world 's highest - resolution photo – went online Saturday , making the masterpiece available for scrutiny by art lovers everywhere .
White - robed Dominican monks opened the doors of their sacristy to unveil the high - res image of the painting on a giant screen just steps away from the real thing at the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie .
The digitized version , produced using special techniques designed to protect the fragile painting from damaging light exposure , gives anyone with an internet connection a chance to dig deeper into Leonardo 's techniques than ever before .
With the air of chiding an old friend , Leonardo expert Pietro Marani zoomed in on the cuff of traitor Judas to show the gold flake Leonardo applied .
" He went against his own better judgment here , " Marani said .
" We know he considered using real gold a cop-out , that he thought true artists should be able to make paint glitter like gold , but there it is . "
For a close - up on the workings of a genius , Marani recommended viewers search the Last Supper for the church bell tower and shrubs outside the windows , the patterns and wrinkles in the tablecloth , the reflection of an orange wedge in a pewter plate in front of Matthew and the perspective lines in the upper left - hand corner that lead ( imperfectly ) to Jesus ' eye .
Technicians at HAL9000 , a company specializing in art photography , faced a number of challenges in capturing the 15th - century depiction of the moment when Jesus tells his apostles that one of them will betray him .
Leonardo used oil and tempera paints on dry plaster , an experimental technique , and as a result , the Last Supper is now so faded and cracked it can't withstand exposure to bright light .
To protect the painting , HAL9000 worked with restoration specialists at Rome 's Istituto Centrale per il Restauro to develop a lighting system without the ultraviolet emissions and high thermal impact so hazardous to works of art .
Shot with a Nikon D2X digital SLR in just nine hours , the total impact of the digitization process was equal to just a few minutes of the soft lighting that normally illuminates the painting .
Back in their office , technical supervisor Mauro Gavinelli and his team stitched together 1,677 panoramic images of the 15 - foot - by - 29 - foot painting using two quad - core AMD Opteron processors , 16 GB of memory and a 2 - terabyte hard disk .
In the late 1400s , Leonardo painted the Last Supper , called Il Cenacolo in Italian , to provide monks at Santa Maria delle Grazie something to contemplate during meals .
Father Stefano Rabacchi , the current prior of the monastery , said that although the work was originally painted just for them , they are obliged to share it with the world today .
Some 320,000 tourists troop in every year to see it , often reserving tickets for a 15 - minute viewing months in advance .
Visitors pass through a decontamination chamber , 25 at a time , where some of the city smog is sucked from their clothes .
Concerns about the fading mural 's health were raised again when Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported Friday that PM10 levels in the church 's dining hall have tripled in the last two years , raising concerns about how long the work will ultimately stay open to the public .
An filtration system removes up to 70 percent of the pollution from the chamber , said curator Alberto Artioli , adding that doors wo n't close on the work any time soon .
For those not able or willing to come to Milan , will a virtual visit surpass the actual painting ?
" It 's exciting to see just how technology can show what you would n't normally be able to see , " said Vincenzo Mirarchi , HAL9000 's general manager .
" But it 's not meant to substitute for the real thing .
Seeing it on a computer screen will never be the same as standing in front of Leonardo 's work . "

Apple ’s iPhone , which goes on sale June 29 , gets oohs and ahhs for a number of reasons , a big one being the way its Safari Web browser displays pages just like the desktop version , then lets you run your fingers over the screen to zoom in and out .
Image
Taking a page — albeit a tinier one — from the iPhone ’s design is a new test version of the Opera Mini browser for cellphones .
There are two important differences :
The first is that people can get their hands on the free browser , officially named Opera Mini 4 beta , by visiting mini.opera.com , which also lists compatible phones .
The second is that most phones that can run the browser have considerably smaller screens than the iPhone and do n’t respond to taps of the finger ( though those with touch screens will ) .
Even so , a few minutes with the new browser on a Nokia 6682 smartphone was enough to see ( by squinting ) that it does in fact display Web pages the way they are meant to appear .
Pressing the center navigation button zooms in , and clicking on a link zooms in closer still , with pages appearing in a highly readable column format .
Keypad shortcuts make entering Web addresses easy .

Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .

Explanation :
Why does one half of Dione have more craters than the other ?
Start with the fact that Saturn 's moon Dione always has one side that faces Saturn , and always has one side that faces away .
This is similar to Earth 's Moon .
This tidal locking means that one side of Dione always leads as the moon progresses in its orbit , while the other side always trails .
Dione should therefore have undergone a significant amount of impacts on its leading half .
But the current leading half of Dione is less cratered than the trailing half !
A possible explanation is that some impacts were so large they spun Dione , sometimes changing the part that suffered the highest impact rate before the moon 's spin again became locked .
Pictured above , it is the top part of Dione that appears significantly more cratered than the bottom half .
Look out , everyone , the White House has a new catch - phrase .

Chances are , such optimistic thoughts are coming from two places in the brain that play an important role in enabling people to , as the old song says , accentuate the positive , New York University scientists said on Wednesday .

Chances are , such optimistic thoughts are coming from two places in the brain that play an important role in enabling people to , as the old song says , accentuate the positive , New York University scientists said on Wednesday .
Pinpointing the brain regions involved in optimism and positive thinking about the future , the researchers said , may also have shed light on what might be going wrong in people with depression .
The researchers used sophisticated brain imaging to track brain activity in 15 young adults -- seven men and eight women -- while they asked them imagine future scenarios .
They included getting a lot of money , winning an award , going to a birthday party or ball game or the zoo , being lied to , the end of a romantic relationship , going to a funeral and others .
When scenarios filled with optimism were imagined , two brain regions -- the rostral anterior cingulate and amygdala -- lit up with activity in the brain scans , the researchers said .
“ What ’s interesting is these two regions that we saw that were involved in projecting optimistic futures are also the same two regions that we see affected in depression , ” Elizabeth Phelps , an NYU professor of psychology and neural science involved in the research , said in a telephone interview .
It had been unclear what was going wrong in these two regions that might contribute to depression .
“ But our data would suggest that one of the things they ’re doing is making it hard to think about things optimistically .
Of course , one of the primary symptoms of depression is pessimism , ” Phelps said .
Phelps said the findings had the potential in the future to help guide new treatments for depression .
The research was published in the journal Nature .
OPTIMISM BIAS
The rostral anterior cingulate is part of the brain ’s frontal cortex that may be involved in regulating emotional responses .
The amygdala is an almond - shaped brain structure in the medial temporal lobe involved in emotion .
“ Understanding healthy optimism is important because optimism is related to mental and physical health and to success .
We can have people who are not necessarily depressed but have different levels of optimism , ” said another of the researchers , Tali Sharot of University College London who was at NYU when the study was conducted .
Phelps said the research team is not saying these are necessarily the only brain regions involved in optimism .
The researchers said they examined how the brain generates what some scientists call the human “ optimism bias . ”
“ Humans expect positive events in the future even when there is no evidence to support such expectations , ” the researchers wrote in the journal Nature .
“ For example , people expect to live longer and be healthier than average , they underestimate their likelihood of getting a divorce , and overestimate their prospects for success on the job market , ” they wrote .
Phelps said the researchers had a hard time getting the volunteers to think of purely neutral events in the future .
“ They tended to make them positive , ” she said .
“ We sort of stumbled upon this optimism bias that psychologists have talked about before . ”

Officials are searching for the driver of a white truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road on Sunday , near the time the Santiago fire started , Orange County authorities said Friday .
Chief Chip Prather holds a photo of a white truck similar to the one seen on Santiago Canyon Road .

" These people are not suspects at this time , " Orange County Fire Authority Chief Chip Prather said .
" They are persons of interest who were seen near the fire in a vehicle like this . "
The vehicle is a white , 1998 to 2004 Ford F150 pickup with chrome tubular running boards .
Prather said the information came from a lead called into the investigation 's tip line .
A $ 250,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the blaze .
Watch how residents feel about arsonist »
The Santiago fire , now 27,000 acres and still burning , was deliberately set , officials said Thursday .
Several mandatory evacuations remain in place for the Santiago fire , which has destroyed 14 homes and various other structures .
Late Friday afternoon , the blaze moved into Silverado Canyon , authorities said .
Sheriff 's deputies were evacuating residents in the fire 's path .
Watch the Santiago flames rage »
Authorities also suspect arson in the Rosa fire in San Diego County , which burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained .
There was no information on the investigation .
Elsewhere , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Office filed arson charges Friday against a 41 - year - old Sun Valley man who witnesses said set a fire in the West Hills neighborhood and walked away .
Catalino Pineda is one of five people who have been arrested in arson investigations this week , but none of them has been linked to the major wildfires raging across Southern California .
Pineda was arrested Wednesday after witnesses said they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside , police said .
The fire was quickly extinguished .
The witnesses followed Pineda to a nearby restaurant and called police , who arrested him .
Pineda was expected to be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior Court Friday , Deputy District Attorney Steven Frankland said .
He is charged with one count of arson of a structure or forest .
Pineda is being held on $ 75,000 bail and faces up to six years in prison if convicted .
In San Bernardino , east of Los Angeles , John Rund , of Hesperia , was arrested Wednesday on arson charges after a witness reported seeing him in brush near the starting point of a fire Tuesday , the sheriff 's department said .
That fire was quickly put out by passers - by .
Investigators are trying to determine if Rund , 48 , may have ties to other wildfires .
He is being held on $ 750,000 bail .
The San Bernardino County District Attorney 's Office on Thursday filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti , 47 , of Redlands .
A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire .
He is being held on $ 250,000 bail .
In San Diego County , the sheriff 's department this week arrested an adult and a juvenile allegedly seen by an anonymous tipster starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county .
In a written statement , the sheriff 's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava .
The Vista fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control , the statement said .
Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson , and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 11,675 - acre Slide fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor , sheriff 's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said .
More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed in the past week by Southern California wildfires .

" Vinegar Boy " , as told by Aaron 1 07-08-2006 , 06:44 AM
MadMike MadMike is offline Heavy Metal Admin Join Date : Jul 2006 Location : Enola , PA Posts : 5,010 " Vinegar Boy " , as told by Aaron The  Vinegar Boy Saga , as told by Aaron
Thursday , April 3
This is what happens when I swap work hours with the day shift - I get all their weirdoes !
About 2 pm today , in storms this woman who starts going totally apeshit at me and screaming incoherently while waving around a half - full bottle of malt vinegar .
I had no idea what she was on about and , before I could find out , the police arrived - but I had n't called them !
Now , I know nearly every cop within fifty miles of my site ( I call them all often enough ) , so when they come in , I greet them by name and they do the same back and tell me they 've been called here because of allegations I 've poisoned a small child .
Wuh ?
The crazy lady identifies herself as the kid 's parent and tells them I poisoned her lad .
To avoid describing twenty minutes of ranting and gibbering on the woman 's part , I 'll cut right to the chase .
I had sold a 1L bottle of malt vinegar to a kid ( about fifteen years old ) that morning and he had taken the bottle home and drunk half of it - yes that 's right , he had drunk vinegar .
Of course , he got sick as a dog and " redecorated " the walls and floor of several rooms .
[ No , I do not know why a teenager , who should be old enough to know better ( and be at school too , for that matter ) would drink half a litre of malt vinegar . ]
At this point the cops and I exchange looks and one said , " Damn Aaron , and we all thought you had finally snapped . "
Ha ha .
There 's always a comedian .
The woman demanded that I be arrested , but the police were n't buying it now that they knew the situation .
She eventually relented on her demands that I be be thrown in jail , but demanded an apology from me for " failing to tell her son not to drink vinegar . "
I said , " I do n't tell people not to stick the fuel nozzle up their nose and fill their brainpan with diesel either .
And do you know why ?
Because most people are n't that stupid ! "
End result : I refuse to apologize , and stand firm by my statements that her child is a moron .
She demands apology , threatens to sue for slander , and promises to return tomorrow when the manager is here .
And I thought the loons only came out after dark
I 'm curious to see what sort of reaction she 'll get from my half - wit manager if she comes back .
But knowing him , he 'll probably apologize to her , and make a new rule that all staff will have to tell people not to chug - a - lug vinegar
Monday , April 7
She came back in !
This time she apparently brought both the vinegar - drinker and her husband .
I got the call from my manager around noon today after they had been in to see him .
The story they gave him was , unsurprisingly , very different from how it happened .
In their revised version , the kid asked me whether or not you could drink vinegar and I said yes .
However , since we now have cameras that record sound ( I do n't know how I ever got along without them ! ) , the manager played back the transaction to them .
Apparently she now claims we edited out the sound
Despite all that , my worthless sack of shit manager caved in to them and apologized , and told me on the phone that he wanted me to write them a letter of apology .
THAT was never going to happen and , after an extended argument , with my manager using the " saying sorry does not mean you accept blame , it just means you 're sorry " speech , he 's decided to write one for me which he tells me I have to sign .
Well , that 's never going to happen either .
He can sign the damn thing himself if he wants , but there 's no way I 'll be apologizing to this stupid woman because of her stupid child .
So much for unwinding on my days off .
Tuesday , April 8
A lot of nasty stuff happened today .
My manager called me again today and told me to come in to work for a meeting .
He would n't say why , but I guessed it was either about Vinegar Boy or the recent hassles we 've been having with ' Sudsy ' , the drug dealer I had arrested , and his junky horde .
When I get in to work , I find my store manager ( SM ) , the territory manager ( TM ) , the stupid mother , and Vinegar Boy all there .
Can you spell ' ambush ' ?
My manager can .
We go out to the back office , and my SM and the TM tell me off in front of the idiot family for failing to exercise due care in selling a fifteen year old boy a bottle of vinegar .
The TM tells me to apologize immediately .
I ask , for what should I apologize ?
The stupid mother chose this moment to pipe up and screech , " I want you to say sorry for telling my son it was okay to drink vinegar - he could have DIED ! "
I reply that I never did any such thing , and told her that her son was either grossly in error or a liar .
Both my SM and the TM again say to apologize - and now they want me to say sorry for calling the kid a liar .
I say I have nothing to apologize for , and that I never told the kid it was okay to drink vinegar .
At this point I should point out that I managed to keep my temper under check for the entire time , even though I was extremely angry at being ambushed .
I figured there was a time and a place to unleash it , and that it could wait for a little while .
Then the TM says that they know I did tell Vinegar Boy it was okay , they have it on film ( technically , we have it on computer disk , but who 's quibbling ? ) .
I ask to see the replay and if , from that viewing I am seen to tell the kid it is okay to drink vinegar , not only will I apologize , I will donate my last month 's salary to the kid as restitution .
The mother goes off about how we edited the footage to remove my words and the manager started to get a bit shifty .
The TM looked curious about all this , and I thought that if the TM really had n't seen the footage , I might get out of this with my manager getting his lazy arse kicked right out of the company .
Silly me - like that was going to happen .
So , at the TM 's insistence , we watch the footage and sure enough , all I say to the kid is to greet him , tell him the price , count him his change , and a goodbye as he leaves .
The TM looked pretty angry and glared at my SM , but said nothing .
Nothing !
He then repeats his demands to apologize .
I was floored by this .
The TM saw I did nothing wrong , and still demanded I grovel to this sack of waste after he and my SM publicly abused me in front of her .
I refused to apologize ( again ! ) and this time , demanded an apology from both the SM and TM for ambushing me , attempting to humiliate me in front of a proven liar and for trying to get me to apologize to Vinegar Boy and his mother .
The TM told me to apologize , or I would be suspended for a week and written up .
I say , " Fine " and walk out with the stupid woman trailing me and gloating at how I got what I deserved .
As I get to the door , the SM comes out and says , " If you walk out the door , do n't bother to come back ! "
I did n't even pause .
When I got home , I had nearly a dozen messages from work on my machine , but I deleted them without listening to them .
I 've now changed the message on my machine telling my ex-SM that anything he has to say to me can now be done through the union and to stop calling my number - of course he has n't listened and has called me at least another fifty times since I got home .
When I had calmed down a bit , I called the site owner to see if he could take a look at what happened .
The owner of my site is a totally cool guy , he 's been in the fuel business since Henry Ford was a boy and is very clued - in .
But as he 's semi-retired now , it 's pretty hard to get into contact with him .
I did manage to catch his wife , so I explained things to her .
Tomorrow , I 'm going to my union rep to see about suing those sons of bitches till they fucking bleed .
But right now , despite how angry I am at what happened , there 's a big upswelling of sheer , unadulterated joy bubbling to the surface because I 'm free of that damn craphole , and I 'll be making my SM's and TM 's life hell for as long and as hard as is humanly possible .

Well , a lot 's happened in the last two days !
Yesterday :
- I decided to start listening to the messages on my machine again , both the store manager ( SM ) and territory manager ( TM ) left a large number of very unpleasant messages about how I should be disgusted with myself for leaving them in the lurch with the irate mother * , and that I was a ' bad ' employee and worthless sack of shit .
The list of personal and professional insults was quite long , and I got it all on tape .
Both the TM and SM told me that I was never welcome at the company again , and they will tell all the other petrol stations in the area about me .
* I did n't mention this in my last post , but when I left the store after the incident , Vinegar Boy 's mother followed me out saying how I " got what I deserved " .
As soon as I was outside ( and out of the range of our in - store cameras ) I let her have a huge blast of bile .
Not my best moment , and I 'm not proud of myself , as I do n't believe in using foul language in front of women .
But I forgot myself this once .
- Had meeting with union rep at 11 am and explained the situation .
Took the answering machine tapes with me .
He got a union lawyer on the phone then and there , and she came over in less than five minutes .
- Lawyer says I have a very good case , as the answering machine tapes alone indicate I was forced out of the job due to hostile working conditions .
She gets all the papers I need to sign and goes off to file them with the court .
- I get home and get swamped with phone calls from my coworkers asking what the hell happened .
The SM is telling them not only Vinegar Boy 's version of the story , but that I told the SM and TM to " get fucked " , so they had to fire me , but they all wanted to hear my version of events .
That last part , about swearing at them , is NOT true .
I held my tongue until I was out of the store .
- By 4 pm , the lawyer calls me to tell me she had already served my ex-manager ( at home , no less ) , the TM and head office with papers indicating intent to sue etc , and had subpoenaed ( if that 's the word ) the security camera footage from the sale that started it all , the initial incident with the mother , the first meeting between the manager and the mother , and the final incident where I walked out .
- 4:30 pm , I 'm now getting messages on my machine from the manager telling me he was joking about firing me and that he wants me to come into work as usual .
TM calls and leaves message that it has all been a huge misunderstanding , and he wants me to come in so we can work it out .
How spineless can you get ?
- 5 pm comes and I get a call from the owner who is very upset .
My ex-SM had left him a message after I walked out ( and before I left my message with his wife ) , which basically went along the same lines as the lies he was telling my coworkers .
But , as he had only just got home from interstate , he ended up getting the SM 's message , my message , and the union lawyer 's message all at the same time .
Ouch !
That 's gotta hurt .
We arrange to meet tomorrow after he has had a chance to look at all the footage .
Today :
- Another meeting with the union rep and the lawyer ( Super Lawyer ! ) .
Basically updating me on everything the lawyer did yesterday - which I already know - and detailing their own conversation with my ex-SM who is now apparently claiming it was all a huge misunderstanding on my part , and that he never told me to never come back .
The union guy told me he then started playing back one of the nasty messages the S.O.B. had left on my answering machine , and that my ex-SM hung up immediately .
- Meet owner .
He had reviewed all the tapes and , if anything , was even more pissed off than I was !
I find out what I 've suspected for a very long time - the manger was related to someone at head office .
In fact , he is none other than the territory manager 's nephew !
That explains a lot .
The owner tells me he only hired him because the TM promised to keep a close eye on him , and having a TM on your side can mean a lot of fringe benefits for a site owner .
But , the owner - great , GREAT guy that he is - decided that enough , was finally , enough .
HE GAVE MY EX - MANAGER 24 HOURS NOTICE !!!
This was totally unexpected !
For the first time in this whole stupid affair ( it started with a moronic kid drinking vinegar , for the love of all that 's holy ! )
I was stunned - but in a good way .
The owner has also issued a formal complaint to head office about the TM for his actions in the whole affair , because he left the company wide open for lawsuits , not only from me , but from the Vinegar Boy as well by playing along with the whole thing .
Now , the owner and I are n't really friends - we do n't know each other well enough for that - but we do understand each other very well .
We 've both been in the industry for longer than is probably good for us , and neither tolerates any bullshit .
Beside , I 'm the only person he 's ever hired who has lasted more than a month working the Thursday - Sunday graveyard shifts .
He told me that he understands my actions , and supports me 100 % , but asked me to hold off the court action until we get a response from the head office about what is going to be done about the TM .
I agreed - provisionally .
I told him that I would settle for nothing less than the TM being stripped of his post , issued with a written warning about his behaviour ( two of these and you get fired ) , and getting a public apology from him .
The owner told me he wanted to see that too .
So , for the time being we 've come to an agreement .
- I phoned my union guy and he was okay about it - besides , now that all the legal paperwork has been filed , nothing else was going to happen for a long time anyway , until a court date had been set .
Now I m waiting to see what head office will do .
If they let the TM off the hook , I m going for his throat .
But  and this is a big but  if they hang him out to dry like he deserves , I will consider the matter settled .
My anger is nt directed at the company per se , but at two individuals who did a very mean thing .
One of them has now lost his job and will probably never work in the industry again .
The other . well see .
You know , looking back over all of this , I cant help but to be struck by the sheer absurdity of it all .
What started with a kid who is so unimaginably stupid as to drink vinegar ends up with me walking out , my store manager getting fired and - whatever happens next - a lot of change is about to happen in my life .
I think of all the stuff Ive done at work , all the insane events Ive witnessed , all the insane people Ive dealt with , and all it took was a bottle of vinegar to change everything .
There s probably a lesson in that somewhere , but Ill be buggered if I can see it .
Friday , April 11
Not much happened today , just a couple of things to note .
My ex-ex - manger gave me another round of calls today and boy was he ever pissed - he still has n't learned not to leave nasty messages on answering machines .
The tapes on my machine are filling up so fast I had to buy a five pack from the local electronics store to keep up .
I had a lawyer from head office call me .
I let him speak to the machine , as I 've once again changed the message on my machine to say , " Any conversations regarding my previous employment should be directed to my lawyer at ******
It seems they want to set up a meeting .
Seeing as how the last meeting I went to for these people resulted in me being ambushed , I 'll let Super Lawyer Lady field this one .

Well , it 's been a very busy week for me , but I wanted to wait until I had something concrete before I posted again .
Though I 'm not superstitious by nature , I was worried that I might jinx things .
That said , I am now very happy to report that I have some very happy news .
I took copies of the answering machine tapes of my ex-manager to the union rep to hand on to Super Lawyer Lady for advice .
I 'm not too worried about anything he would do , as I 'm twice his size , but his rantings were really starting to annoy me .
Especially when he started ringing in the middle of the night .
Super Lawyer
Lady took the tapes to the cops and they apparently paid him a visit .
I also had to swear a statutory declaration about the calls and how they were getting harassing .
I now have a lovely written statement from the cops ( a Notice to the Victim ) .
And my ex-manager , if he ever calls me again or even comes anywhere near me , will be hit with an A.V.O. ( Apprehended Violence Order ) quicker than he can blink .
Since then , he 's been no more trouble , and I have an official document to show any future employers why I do n't have a reference from him .
Just this morning , I was driving along the road and had to pull over when I started laughing again over the sheer absurdity of it all .
I hoped throughout all this to settle things without having to go to the media .
But , if head office tried - even once - to screw me over , I would have started singing so loud they'd have bled from the ears .
I 've been doing everything I possibly can to retain the moral ( and legal ) high ground in all of this .
It is because of past nasty experience that I too keep a few months ' worth of pay in the bank .
I 've been screwed over before by bad management and bad managers .
More than once .
Here we go , back to the bizarre world that is my life :
>> Monday .
Had lunch with the owner .
As the Territory Manager ( TM ) , an agent of head office , was present at the ambush , any legal proceedings will focus on the company and not on him according to Super Lawyer Lady - he 's relieved , as am I .
I both respect and like the owner and did n't want any of this unpleasantness to rub off on him .
He fills me in on a whole bunch of stuff about my ex-store manager ( SM ) that I did n't even suspect , and some of which the owner 's only recently discovered himself from the manager of one of his other sites who 's pulling double duty at my work .
Allegedly ( okay I 've covered myself ) , the SM was incompetent beyond what I had ever thought , and perhaps even a bit shady .
All the paperwork he handled was a total mess , with errors all through it , and there may even be upcoming problems with the tax office because of it .
The returns are a total mess - i.e. , out of date stock and store - use items .
There are so many errors in them that over $ 2000 worth of stock has just vanished in the last five months .
Out of date items have been returned to the shelves ( I 've noticed this myself - and commented on it in the staff diary ) , but they have been credited to stock - keeping as well .
What this means is that the manager was allegedly getting refunds for unusable / out of date stock from the suppliers ( but not disposing of it or handing it over to them ) and then selling the stock !
None of the money from those transactions has yet been accounted for .
The owner has been reviewing as much of the security tapes as he can , and has noticed massive discrepancies in the hours when the SM said he was working and the hours he actually bothered to show up .
I 've complained for ages that the SM only worked , at most , four hours a day , and left piles of work for the staff to do that he was responsible for .
Seems he may have been allegedly lying when it came to writing up his hours and getting paid .
The list goes on and on .
What the SM did to me was just the straw that broke the camel 's back , so to speak .
But I live in hope that the owner will be taking his own legal action ( or possibly a baseball bat ) against my ex-SM .
>> Tuesday .
Another meeting with the union rep .
Head office has arranged a meeting to discuss what happened , and union rep , Super Lawyer and myself will be attending it on Wednesday .
We spend many hours going through it all again , and taking as many notes as we can on the events and all that has happened since .
If you think these post are long , you should have seen how many pages we filled up during our meeting .
I find another call from head office on my machine when I get home .
They now ask to set up a private meeting .
They call back and I let them speak to the machine again .
I call the union rep and play him the message .
He said it was a good sign .
In the evening , I get a call from Super Lawyer saying a tentative court date has been set for October .
I know the courts are clogged , but this is ridiculous !
I tell her about the new message from head office , and she also says it 's a good sign .
>> Wednesday .
Have brunch with manager today before the big meeting .
He tells me a bunch of old ' war stories ' from his days as a console operator and wishes me luck .
No more updates on the alleged mismanagement of my ex-SM .
The big meeting :
I rock up with union rep and Super Lawyer at head office in Melbourne .
Greeted by secretary and asked to wait .
An hour and a half later , we are still waiting .
Super Lawyer says this is a standard tactic .
We wait another half hour , then tell secretary we 're leaving .
We leave .
At this point , I was thinking about all the talk of " good signs " being BS and - I admit - feeling a bit down .
I thought I had put on my good suit for nothing , and that head office was going to try and screw me over and was just playing with me .
I chain - smoked nearly a whole pack of cigarettes on the drive back to the union rep 's office .
Back at the union rep 's office , he finds he has a message from head office .
Super Lawyer calls them back and really tears them a new one over the phone .
I mean , I 've seen some great rants and abuse over the years , but this lady totally blew me away .
Pity she 's married , I think I 'm in love .
Awesome does n't even begin to describe it - I 'm surprised the phone did n't melt !
I am SO glad she 's on my side .
We go back to head office .
After waiting for barely a minute we go in .
From this point on , I 'm afraid I can not be as detailed as I like about what happened .
When I started employment , I signed the standard non-disclosure agreement about certain aspects of the job ( which I 've bent more than a few times ) and Ive been told by Super Lawyer to stay mum , even with my family , about some of what was said .
I also signed a legally binding agreement this afternoon that prevents me from saying what happened in certain parts of the meeting and regarding certain aspects of this whole affair .
But what I can say is this :
The company admitted no wrongdoing and pointed the finger squarely at the TM and his nephew , my ex-SM .
They were n't very happy when I revealed that I knew about their relationship to each other .
By the way , " were n't very happy " is probably the understatement of the year .
Super Lawyer told them about the trial date and reminded them , in point by point detail , of everything that had happened so far , which could be verified by the security tapes and now also , by the owner and the site 's new manager .
A lot of legal talk went on about " abridgement of responsibility " ( I 'm still not quite sure what that means in context ) and what the legal consequences could have been if I had caved in .
I think she was basically pushing the point that by refusing to admit responsibility by apologizing , I effectively saved the company from huge potential lawsuits from the Vinegar - drinking family .
I think .
The TM has now been pushed into a non-administrative role recording fuel transportation details and gave me a ( semi ) public apology in the office area outside the meeting room and in front of the union rep , Super Lawyer , both lawyers from head office , the State Controller , the Human Resources Coordinator , and about ten assorted workers from adjoining offices who came to see what was going on with all the loud voices .
It was very satisfying to watch him turn a dozen shades of red as he read from his apology notes .
I hope it hurt .
A lot .
The bastard is still in the company , and even though he was n't issued with a written warning , I am content that he will never be in a position to abuse his power again .
The State Controller was very adamant about that and there are half a dozen witnesses to that effect .
That was all the formal stuff out of the way .
The next part of the meeting ( and the next two days ) dealt with what to do with me and once again , I can say very little about it .
It was accepted that I was not to be held any way responsible for the actions of Vinegar Boy , and that I acted " Admirably " under extreme duress ( I quite like that part ) .
My termination of employment has been rendered null and void , I 'm getting a 10 % raise , and am being moved to from part - time to full - time status , with all the health and holiday benefits that come with it .
Because of my position as Health & Safety officer , I 'm also receiving a 5 % pay increase for every hour I work , commensurate with my extra duties .
Previously , I did n't get anything for it except for two or three meetings a month , which I was paid standard rate to attend .
I 'm also receiving full back pay for all the hours I 've missed - adjusted to my new rate - since this exploded .
As for the legal case for being forced out of work due to hostile working conditions and the hundred - and - one violations of my worker 's rights , that has now been settled .
I REALLY can't say anything about that .

Thursday & Friday :
Meeting , meetings , meetings .
Mostly lawyers talking to each other in a language beyond my ken .
I sign this , I sign that , I do n't sign the other .
So , the end result :
Store Manager - out on his arse and may be charged by police .
Territory Manager - demoted , apologized , and now hated with a passion by his superiors because of what he caused them to have to do .
Me - returning to work next week and at a comfortably increased rate of pay and now with holiday and health benefits .
If I ever see the Vinegar Family , I intend to throw them out of the store while giving them a few choice words .
I doubt anyone at my site will want to serve them after what they caused .
I 'll be going in to work on Tuesday to meet my new manager ( please be a good one , please be a good one ) and I 'll ask about having their pictures put up behind the console and permanently banned .
If head office does decide to hold a grudge , I have Super Lawyer 's card and can always contact her through the union , so I should be covered .
Thursday , April 24
Well , I worked my first shift tonight since the ... incident ... and it feels like everything is finally back to normal .
Well , as normal as my work ever gets .
Had a whole bunch of customers ask where I had been - not that they missed me or anything , but now they knew they were n't going to be getting away with murder anymore .
And with my comfy raise , I hardly even got mad when two drunken yobbos vomited over the store window ( from the outside ) , and I had to hose them down to get them off the site ; or the junkie I caught trying to shoot up in the cleaning products aisle , or the gang of wannabe townies camped out by the car wash trying to browbeat customers into buying smokes for them , and who I kept taunting over the PA when they failed ( until the cops arrived to escort them all home ) ; or the strange lady who thought my petrol station was part of the airport , or the .. well you all know what my Thursday nights are like .

Author : Intel agencies morphed Iraqi defector 's lies into something from Walt Disney David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 17 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Los Angeles Times reporter Bob Drogin , who first broke the story of " Curveball , " the Iraqi defector who provided much of the false information about WMD's that was used to justify the US invasion of Iraq , appeared on CNN Wednesday to discuss his new book on the subject .
Drogin explained to CNN that Curveball was merely an Iraqi engineer who went to Germany in 1999 and started spinning stories about Saddam Hussein 's fleet of mobile biological weapons laboratories .
His claims could n't be verified , but " the Bush administration believed it , even though the CIA had never talked to him . "
According to Drogin , Curveball was lying to the Germans and inflating his own importance because " he was trying to get asylum " and wanted " to basically jump the line . "
Drogin said the real problems arose not from anything Curveball did , but with what became of his stories after they reached the US .
" It was analysis that was being passed from one agency to another agency and it kept changing , it kept morphing as it went .
So he told one story and by the time Colin Powell is up at the United Nations ... it was like it had gone to Walt Disney or something . "
Dorgin primarily blames the intelligence agencies -- and particularly George Tenet -- for the failure to detect Curveball 's lies , writing in his book that " Time and again , bureaucratic rivalries , tawdry ambitions and spineless leadership proved more important than professional integrity . "
" People who tried to raise warnings , tried to raise red flags , were pushed aside , were cast out , were treated like heretics , " Dorgin told CNN .
" It 's really sort of bizarre .
It 's a cult over there . "
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on October 17 , 2007 .

Turkey has been the strongest ally that the United States has had in the Middle East since the end of WW II .
The Marshall Plan started with Northern tier states like Turkey and Greece .
Turkey joined NATO and was a key player in the American victory in the Cold War .
As a secular government , Turkey stood against the rising tide of Muslim radicalism .
To the extent that Turkey is moderating its long - term secular militancy , and moving toward fair elections , it may be providing a model for a moderate , democratic Middle East .
Its economy is growing rapidly , foreign investment is in the billions .
Turkey is in short , almost everything the US could have asked for in the Middle East .
But the Bush administration has , during the past five years , increasingly thrown away this asset , and now is in danger of losing a close and valued ally altogether .
It is unclear what US interests are served by this repeated and profound damage inflicted by Washington on Turkey , or what Ankara ever did to us that we are treating them so horribly .
( The dismissive treatment in some ways began when the US promised Turkey $ 1 bn in aid to offset the damage to its economy of the Gulf War in 1990 - 1991 , but then Congress formally decided by the mid-1990s to renege on the pledge .
No one has ever explained why we stiffed them . )
The threat of a Turkish hot pursuit of PKK guerrillas into Iraqi Kurdistan is starting to have an effect on Kurdistan ’s economy and stability .
Inflation is high and some Turkish businesses that had won bids to operate in the Kurdistan Regional Authority ( KRG ) are going back home in fear of trouble .
Getting banks to underwrite economic enterprises is getting harder , which could result in a slowdown for Iraqi Kurdistan .
This area was the last in Iraq not to be hit hard by instability , but tensions are growing .
Imagine what things look like from a Turkish point of view .
Remember that Turkey is a NATO ally , that it stood with the US during the Korean War ( in which its troops fought ) , during the Cold War , and during Bush ’s war on terror .
Turkey gives the US military facilities , including the Incirlik Air Force base , through which large amounts of materiel for the US forces in northern Iraq flows .
First , the Bush administration insisted on invading Iraq and overthrowing the secular Iraqi government .
It thereby let the Salafi Sunni and the Shiite fundamentalist genies out of the bottle and created vast instability on the southeastern border .
It would be as though a US ally had invaded Mexico and inadvertently unleashed a Marxist peasant rebellion against San Diego .
Secular Turkey already felt itself menaced by the Shiite ayatollahs of Iran and by the rising Salafi and al - Qaeda trends , and the US made everything far worse .
Then , the US gave the Kurdistan Regional Authority control over the Kirkuk police force and unleashed Kurdish troops on the Turkmen city of Tal Afar .
( The Turks look on Iraq ’s 800,000 Turkmen as little brethren , over whom they feel protective , and do n’t want them dominated by Kurds ) .
The Kurds promptly announced their aspiration of annexing 3 further provinces , or at least big swathes of them , including the oil province of Kirkuk , and including substantial Turkmen populations .
Not only was that guaranteed to cause violence with the Arabs and Turkmen , but it would give Kurdistan a source of fabulous wealth with which it could hope to attract Kurds in neighboring countries to join it , a la German Unification after the fall of the Berlin Wall – except that this unification would dismember several other countries .
Then the Kurdistan Regional Authority gave safe haven to 3,000 to 5,000 Kurdish guerrillas from eastern Anatolia in Turkey who have been killing Turks and blowing up things , reviving violence that had subsided in the early zeroes .
Despite the US military occupation of Iraq , Washington has done nothing to stop what Turkey sees as terrorists from going over the border into Turkey and killing Turks .
Turkish intelligence is convinced that the camps in Iraqi Kurdistan are key to weapons provision for the PKK , and that funding is coming from Kurdish small businessmen in Western Europe .
PKK guerrillas have just killed 13 Turkish troops on Sunday and in the past few weeks have killed 28 altogether .
If guerrillas were raiding over the border into the United States and had killed 28 US troops I think I know what Washington ’s response would be .
The the US Congress abruptly condemned modern Kemalist Turkey for the Armenian genocide , committed by the Ottoman Empire , provoking Ankara to withdraw its ambassador from Washington .
I have long held that Turkey should acknowledge the genocide , which killed hundreds of thousands and displaced more hundreds of thousands .
The Turkish government could then point out that it was committed by a tyrannical and oppressive government– the Ottoman Empire– against which the Kemalists also fought a long and determined war to establish a modern republic .
I ca n’t understand Ankara ’s unwillingness to distance itself from a predecessor it does n’t even think well of –the junta of Enver Pasha and the later pusillanimity of the sultan ( the capital is in Ankara and not Istanbul in part for this very reason ! )
But no dispassionate observer could avoid the conclusion that the Congressional vote condemning Turkey came at a most inopportune time for US - Turkish diplomacy , at a time when Turks were already raw from watching the US upset all the apple carts in their neighborhood , unleash existential threats against them , cause the rise of Salafi radicalism next door , coddle terrorists killing them , coddle the separatist KRG , and strengthen the Shiite ayatollahs on their borders .
The Congressional vote came despite the discomfort of elements of the Israel lobby with recognizing the mass killing of Armenians as a genocide .
Andrew E. Mathis explains Abraham Foxman ’s intellectually bankrupt vacillations on this issue .
Foxman and others of his ideological orientation have been forced grudgingly to back off their genocide denial in the case of the Armenians by a general shift in opinion among the American public , and his change of position may have removed any fears among congressional representatives that the Israel lobby would punish them for their vote .
( Turkey and Israel have long had a strong military and diplomatic relationship , which the Israel lobby had earlier attempted to preserve by lobbying congress on Turkey ’s behalf with regard to some issues .
But the Israel lobby is now split between pro-Kurdish factions and pro-Turkish factions , and the pro-Kurdish ones appear to be winning out .
Richard Perle & Michael Rubin of AEI are examples of the pro-Turkish Neoconservative strain in the Israel lobby .
They are losing . )
In 2000 , 56 % of Turks reported in polls that they had a favorable view of the United States .
In 2005 that statistic had fallen to 12 % .
I shudder to think what it is now .

They were spat at , punched and shunned by their families .
Their crime ?
Falling in love with German prisoners of war .
As they celebrate their diamond weddings , two British war brides tell their haunting stories
With each step they took , hand in hand along the bomb - ravaged streets of Southampton , the sight of June Tull and her boyfriend incited insults and fury .
" Are n't our boys good enough for you ? " yelled one woman .
Another ran up to June and punched her .
Others spat in her face .
How could she , they asked , fraternise with the enemy when their own fathers , husbands and sons had been killed by the Germans ?
For 18 - year - old June 's boyfriend was German prisoner of war Heinz Fellbrich , 25 , a fact which was advertised wherever they went by the PoW 's brown uniform with orange felt patches he had to wear at all times .
" There was a lot of hostility towards us , " recalls June , now 79 .
" I could understand it because people had lost loved ones in the war , but all that mattered to me was that I loved Heinz .
" However , it was n't easy .
We tried to go to quiet places when we were together so people would n't see us .
" My father Frank was all right about it , but my mother was against the relationship .
She worried about what people would think . "
Especially when four months into the courtship - which began at the end of January 1947 - June , who was by this time sleeping with the enemy having written a " Dear John " letter dumping her Royal Marine boyfriend , became pregnant .
" I was scared stiff , " says June .
" Falling pregnant outside marriage was bad enough - but with a German PoW !
Scroll down for more
" I dread to think what would have happened if Heinz had n't wanted to marry me . "
Three months pregnant , June married Heinz on August 14 , 1947 , at the Civic Centre in Southampton - much to her mother Winifred 's chagrin .
June wore a blue suit borrowed from a friend , and other German PoWs had made Heinz a brown suit without the orange patches .
June was the first British woman to marry a German PoW following Clement Attlee 's postwar government 's decision to lift the ban on fraternisation and marriage - an event so controversial it made newspaper headlines .
At the reception at the Labour Hall , there was a German Oompah band - made up of other PoWs - and guests ate a simple buffet prepared the night before by June and a girlfriend , after her mother refused to help .
When they emerged , they were greeted by the pop of flashbulbs from newspaper photographers .
At 10 pm sharp , Heinz was back behind the barbed wire at the PoW camp - having been given permission to marry by the camp commandant - and June begged him not to slip out to meet her later , which would be punished by solitary confinement .
Their " wedding night " took place the following day at June 's home , when Heinz was allowed to visit his new wife .
He was released from the PoW camp one week before their eldest son Peter was born .
This week , June and Heinz celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary with 70 family members and friends at the Methodist Hall in Eastleigh , Hampshire , and today will fly to Hamburg to celebrate again with Heinz 's German family .
They have six children - four boys and two girls - 12 grandchildren and 15 great - grandchildren , and say they are as in love today as the first moment they caught sight of each other back in 1947 .
Theirs is a remarkable love story , especially when set against the intense hostility and bitterness towards the British women who fell in love with German PoWs .
" After our wedding we received two sackloads of hate mail .
" I did n't read it all because I knew what people would say .
But there was one lovely letter which said : " You can't choose who you fall in love with , just be happy , " says June .
" I refused to let it bother me and I 'm glad of that .
We have been incredibly happy .
" I do n't regret falling in love with Heinz , although for a long time we felt very isolated . "
Heinz adds : " The British people were much harder on June than they were on me , but once they got to know me , the fact I was German became irrelevant .
" Of course I was sorry for the suffering of the people who'd lost loved ones or their homes , but the German people had suffered , too .
It is the nature of war .
" Since falling in love with June , I have never once felt homesick for Germany .
" This is my home .
I like the people , the country and being here .
We have been very lucky . "
It was in late 1939 that the first prisoners of war arrived in Britain and were held in two camps .
Their numbers remained small as the Government was reluctant to accept PoWs while the threat of Nazi invasion was imminent - but by the end of the war there were more than 600 camps .
Each camp was given a number and was either a disused building , such as a factory , or was made up of specially constructed corrugated iron buildings known as Nissen huts .
More than 400,000 German PoWs were still being held in Britain in 1946 , the year after World War II ended , with Attlee 's government refusing to repatriate the Germans until well after the war was over .
During 1946 , up to one - fifth of all farm work in Britain was being done by unpaid German PoWs , and they were also employed on road works and building sites .
When the ban on fraternisation was lifted just before Christmas 1946 , many British people chose to put the war behind them and welcomed PoWs into their homes .
By the end of 1947 , around 250,000 German PoWs had been returned home .
The last were repatriated in 1949 , but approximately 24,000 decided to stay in Britain - either because they 'd met a British girl or because their home towns were now in Russian - held territory and they feared another spell of imprisonment in Soviet hands .
Some British women fared better than others , who were disowned by their families .
Perhaps it was because June had not lost her home or any relatives that she did not hold Heinz 's nationality against him .
The daughter of bus driver Frank Tull and the eldest of five children , June was working in a bottling factory when she first met Heinz shortly after the ban on fraternisation was lifted .
The fact that she and her family had to spend almost every night in an air raid shelter during the Blitz had no bearing on her feelings when she spotted the tall , handsome German .
" A couple of my girlfriends were seeing German PoWs , " says June , " and one day I cycled to the camp with them .
" While they were chatting over the fence to their boyfriends , I saw Heinz and said to my friend Amy : ' He 's a bit of all right . '
" She told her boyfriend , who brought Heinz over .
He was incredibly handsome and tall with wavy hair .
" He could hardly speak any English , but there was a spark between us . "
Heinz adds : " She was a lovely looking girl .
She still is . "
Prisoners of war were allowed out of the camp during the day but had to be back by dusk .
However , Heinz and his friends would dig a ditch under the barbed wire and crawl out at night to meet their sweethearts .
" At first we kept it secret .
I had a boyfriend who was stationed in Chatham , in Kent , with the Royal Marines , " says June .
" We would go for walks and hold hands and we fell in love .
When I plucked up the courage to tell my parents , my father said : ' Bring him home for lunch then , ' so I did .
My father made him feel very welcome , although my mother was n't so happy . "
Heinz , the eldest of nine children and the son of a farmer , had grown up in an East Prussian village near the Russian border and volunteered aged 20 , believing Hitler had been " good for the German people " .
A paratrooper with the Luftwaffe , he 'd almost lost a leg in 1942 when a soldier next to him stood on a landmine and was killed .
He spent a year in hospital before returning to the front line .
He gave himself up to Allied troops in Alsace , France , in 1945 when efforts to flee via the River Rhine using oil drums failed .
He was shipped to Boston and imprisoned in Pennsylvania but was sent to Britain a year later , ending up in Southampton .
After he was released from the PoW camp , Heinz , June and their baby son lived with her parents for six months until they moved out to one of the prefabs on the common which had been vacated after the American troops went home .
They then moved into a cottage , on the farm where Heinz had found work and in 1960 to a council house in Eastleigh , where they live to this day .
Heinz found great success erecting Dutch barns at farms all over the country .
" After a while the anti-German sentiment died down a bit , " June says .
Heinz adds : " I have been very happy here .
I have nothing bad to say about the British . "
Although proud of his roots , Heinz - like many German soldiers who initially thought emerging stories about the Holocaust were British propaganda - was later horrified by the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis .
June met Heinz 's family for the first time in 1957 , as for years Heinz had no idea where they were after fleeing East Prussia and only found them in Hamburg through the international Red Cross .
They welcomed his British bride .
It had been a hard road , but ultimately - once the war was over - the British generally were remarkably accepting and forgiving of the German PoWs who settled here .
Margaret Stratton , now aged 93 , shocked her community when she married German PoW Peter Roth , five years her junior , on May 22 , 1948 in Peterborough .
Hundreds of people lined the streets - more out of curiosity and disbelief than anything else .
" They could n't believe she had married a German , " recalls Peter , now aged 88 .
" But I struck lucky when I fell in love with Margaret .
People accepted me , not because I was German , but because I was Margaret Stratton 's husband . "
Margaret adds : " No one ever said anything to me , but I 'm sure people talked about me behind my back .
" After the wedding , I went to the local paper and paid them to print our marriage picture as I wanted everyone to know I did n't care what they thought . "
Margaret was the only child of a gardener and groom , who worked for the wealthiest farmer in the area .
When he died , the Strattons moved in with his widow , and Margaret 's mother Annie became her housekeeper .
A talented sportswoman , swimmer , artist , toy maker , actress and dancer who 'd raised money for the war effort by performing concerts , Margaret - whose father died when she was 16 - had decided not to marry as she had " such a wonderful life " , even though many young men were besotted with her .
It was in 1945 that Peter Roth , an uneducated soldier from the village of Erbach , near Frankfurt , was sent to work near the farm where she lived after being captured in Normandy in 1944 .
Margaret recalls : " When I first saw Peter , I said to my girlfriend : ' I know he 's German , but he has the most lovely face . '
There was just something about him . "
Peter was equally struck and that evening he stripped his camp hut 's garden of every flower - six snowdrops - and presented them to Margaret the next day .
In return , she gave him a cigarette and a piece of cake and so began a highly dangerous romance .
" The war was not yet over and fraternising between local women and German PoWs was forbidden .
" Heaven knows what would have happened to us if we'd been found out , " says Peter .
" In many ways Margaret saved my life .
I remember her saying : ' I do n't want to know anything about your past or what you 've done .
All I know is that I love you and that you are mine now .
That 's all that matters . '
As Christmas 1945 approached , Margaret wanted Peter to spend Christmas Day at her home with her and her mother Annie , who 'd already met him and instantly liked him .
Although the war was over , prisoners were not yet allowed to visit private homes .
Peter 's camp was 13 miles away , so Margaret paid local taxi driver Douglas Fiddieng 13 shillings to bring him to the farmhouse where they lived on Christmas Day .
As it turned out , the local police had been tipped off , but Margaret was so well loved in the community they decided to turn a blind eye .
Margaret says : " The police used to ask Peter to translate letters for them and years after we married the police sergeant told us he knew all about Peter visiting our house .
He should have arrested us . "
" The sergeant told Peter : ' I could not harm Margaret .
Her only sin was falling in love . '
We were lucky .
" I do n't regret marrying Peter .
We 've been very happy and next year celebrate our diamond anniversary . "

They have one daughter , Anita , 57 , two grandchildren and a great granddaughter .
But not everyone was happy at the time .
Peter says : " When I went back to Germany in 1949 , an old schoolfriend came up to me after church and said : ' I shall never forgive you for marrying a British woman .
' At the very least you should have married one of the German women now left on the shelf . '
I simply replied : " Go back to 1939 - if I 'd asked you to marry me you would have turned up your nose , so what has changed ? " '
After the war , Peter worked on a farm for a while , then in the parcel depot on the railways .
Today , he is the full - time carer for his wife , who is very frail .
They have a lifetime of happy memories .
" When our grandson was five he saw a war programme on the television and asked me : ' Granddad , who were the goodies in the war ? '
" I told him I would write down my life story and then he could decide for himself when he was older , " Peter says .
" The British like to think they are always ' the goodies ' .
" There is no doubt that the Nazis and the SS committed many atrocities , but I did n't fight for Hitler , I fought for Germany , my homeland , which had been treated so badly after World War I .
" I like to think that I am one of the ' goodies ' , too . "

1625 : And just as I say that Konstantin Zyrianov 's fizzing low shot is tipped onto the post by Paul Robinson .
That will be a boost for the much - maligned Spurs man .
1623 : Guus Hiddink is going berserk on the touchline .
The Russia coach clearly is n't happy with the way this game is going .
England keeper Paul Robinson is yet to make a save .
1618 : England 's marking again lets them down and Russia are allowed two shots on goal - but both are blocked .
A charging Wayne Rooney goes on the counter - attack , but can't get his pass away .
1616 : The England fans are belting out the national anthem and this time it is audible above the whistling of the opposition fans .
The game is a midfield battle at the moment .
1614 : " My heart skipped a beat there .
I wondered whether the Russian player had been tripped .
We must be very careful and pick up the runners . "
Former England manager Graham Taylor
1611 : A nervous moment for England as Aleksandr Kerzhakov goes down in the box under a challenge from Joe Cole but replays show it 's a very elaborate dive .
1607 : GT is right .
Russia have certainly started better , with England 's defence looking a wee bit shaky at the moment .
Aleksandr Kerzhakov has a shot from distance which hits Sol Campbell 's hand .
The Russian striker appeals but the Spanish ref says it 's ball to hand .
1605 : " Russia have started off at a tremendous pace .
Watering the surface just before kick - off has altered the state of the pitch . "
Former England manager Graham Taylor on BBC 5live
1601 : The broadcasting lines from Moscow are down , meaning Alan Green and chums are commentating on 5 live via telephone .
It 's like the 1970s all over again .
Brilliant .
1559 : Skipper Steven Gerrard rallies the troops before Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen get the game under way .

Former England midfielder Chris Waddle on BBC 5live
1556 : I think the national anthem has been played .
It was drowned out by booing from the Russian fans .
1551 : The water cannons retreat as the teams enter the stadium .
The Russian fans have unveiled what they claim is the biggest flag in the world .
Seriously .
They claim that at 130x80 m , it will go into the Guinness Book of Records .
1547 : It 's a 74,000 sell - out at the Luzhniki Stadium where they are firing what look like water cannons onto the artificial ( happy now ? ) surface .

1533 : The resident pedant at BBC Sport towers has pointed out that the pitch in Moscow is not actually plastic .
He says it 's an artificial turf composed of monofilament polyethylene blend fibres tufted into a polypropylene backing with a mixture of silica sand and cryogenic rubber infill , the fibres with an infill of silicone sand and rubber .
Well , OK , he did n't say that last bit , Wikipedia did .
1526 : Well done Ashal who texted in the correct answer .
Medina Cantalejo was the fourth official at the 2006 World Cup final and spotted Zidane 's headbutt .

1437 : England are the first to kick off at 1600 BST and we have news from Moscow that it 's 9C , an evening for long - sleeved shirts then .
If you want to share your experiences of Moscow in October or indeed playing on a plastic pitch , why not drop me a text on 81111 or get involved with 606 .
1430 : Never mind John Terry , my knees are locking at the prospect of what could be a momentous day for both England and Scotland .
England just need a win ... in Moscow ... on a plastic pitch ... while Scotland must win in Georgia and hope our old friends Lithuania take points off France .

Time for some demos ...
The most common website layout is the three column design .
It is also the most difficult one to get right .
The main page is in the center with a narrow column on either side .
This layout is quite popular with bloggers .
The main page comes first and then two columns are placed on the right of the page .
The two column layout is a simple clean design with a narrow left hand column that can be filled with a side menu and the main content page on the right .
This layout is exactly the same as the one above except with the side column on the right .
The double page liquid layout has two columns of equal width and is great for websites that read like a book .
Sometimes you may need to display some wide content like a large image , this layout has been designed specifically for this purpose .
The power and flexibility of the above layouts is extended by stacking any number of them together in any order to create an unlimited number of designs .
Overcoming cross - browser CSS issues
CSS can be tricky business particularly when you are trying to create complex liquid layouts for your websites ( the hardest of all ) .
To make matters worse , your design must work properly in a large number of browsers and operating systems .
This can be a real headache because the numbers multiply out into dozens of combinations that need checking .
CSS hacks are bad
Because every browser has its own quirks , many people use hacks to overcome the little problems that arise .
This has worked well ' til now but the number of browsers is growing and so too are the unexpected side effects of these hacks .
In many instances , a hack fixes a problem in one browser but creates a new bug in another .
Also when a new version of a browser comes out , any bugs that are now fixed will still cause problems because the old hacks are trying to fix a problem that 's not there anymore .
Only use cross - browser CSS
The solution is to keep things simple and only use CSS that works in all browsers .
One of the main things to avoid is horizontal margins , padding and borders on elements with a specified width .
This causes big problems for Internet Explorer because of it 's broken box model .
Unfortunately , we can't simply ignore IE because it's a widely used browser on the internet .
If only everyone used Firefox or chrome !

Gaming the Good Jesuit
this is so much fun it should be illegal -- but it's not On November 28 , 2005 , I posted something to Mystic Bourgeoisie titled The Disturbing Matter of Nazi Entailment .
Near the end of that piece , I wrote ...
The caption for the photo below ( from The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum ) reads : " Corpses of Auschwitz prisoners in block 11 of the main camp ... as discovered by Soviet war crimes investigators . " ... followed by this photo taken upon the postwar opening of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz .
Clearly , this is no laughing matter .
But bear with me .
Last night I was on the phone yakking with Dean Landsman about god - knows - what , and as we were talking I was ego - surfing Technorati .
Dean was telling me some hysterically funny story about threatening to kill his math professor 's dog with a baseball bat and the guy wetting his pants in fear .
( There were extenuating circumstances .
Like the guy saying he'd never passed a Jew in any of his courses and did n't plan to start now , even though Dean had aced the final .
[ And btw , the relevance of this detail to our present story is entirely synchronistic . ] )
But I was getting distracted by what I was looking at on my screen .
Why was some blog called " Good Jesuit , Bad Jesuit " linking to Mystic Bourgeoisie ?
I went there and saw it was a post about the " largest Planned Parenthood abortion facility " in Denver .
I searched the text , but found no references to myself , RageBoy , Mystic Bourgeoisie or anything remotely familiar .
Then I searched the HTML source .
Aha !
The guy ( I assume it 's a guy ) had used " my " Auschwitz graphic .
Here 's what the page looked like .
( You can click for a slightly larger version . )
Good Lord !
So I tell Dean about this when his story is finished .
I say , whoever these various Jesuits are , they did n't just use the same picture , they used MY picture .
They 're sucking it from rageboy.com where Mystic B is hosted !
[ NOTE : OK , so it 's not " my picture . "
But at least in my original post , the graphic linked back to where I got it at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum .
Except that I just checked my link to make sure , and it seems that someone over at USHMM switched around some pages so that my link now points to The Sugihara family in front of the Japanese consulate in Kaunas .
Bollocks !
Just forget I even mentioned it . ]
And Dean points out something that probably never would have occurred to me .
" You can change the picture , you know . "
OMG !
Why did n't I think of that ?
So this morning , I did .
This is what that same post at Good Jesuit , Bad Jesuit looks like at the moment .
( Again .
you can click for a slightly larger version . )
For those of you less familiar with the overall corpus of Pink Floyd 's prodigious oeuvre , here 's a better view ...
Of course , that graphic now has the filename auschwitz - corpses - clip.jpg , which is admittedly misleading -- and my Mystic B post about Auschwitz is now very confusing .
At some point , unless he 's completely asleep at the wheel , our boy over at Good / Bad Jesuits will realize what 's happened -- though he 'll probably think he 's been " hacked " ( no , you were STEALING ; look it up in your fucking Ten Commandments ) -- and go find his own corpses to illustrate his " Pro Life " views .
And naturally , that eventuality is why I took these screen snaps .
Could n't have something this rich going undocumented , now could we ?
And remember kids : A Christian Life Can Be a Fine Line ! ... Post - posting Addendum : I know I probably should n't have , but I could n't resist adding this extra goad to his post ...
Post - Partem Post - Toasties Addendum :
Well , it looks as if the first - round show is over .
Good Jesuit , Bad Jesuit realized he'd been pwned and took the graphic down altogether .
[ When I looked again , 20 minutes later , this absence had been replaced by a truly gruesome photo of an aborted late - term fetus ] .
However , the second round may be just getting started .
Doc Searls has weighed in with Fun with in - line graphics , and Shelley posts Really Hot Linking .
Plus , the Urban Dictionary offers this ...

Nearly two million children a year die for want of clean water and proper sanitation while the world 's poor often pay more for their water than people in Britain or the US , according to a major new report .
The United Nations Development Programme , in its annual Human Development report , argues that 1.1 billion people do not have safe water and 2.6 billion suffer from inadequate sewerage .
This is not because of water scarcity but poverty , inequality and government failure .
The report urges governments to guarantee that each person has at least 20 litres of clean water a day , regardless of wealth , location , gender or ethnicity .
If water was free to the poor , it adds , it could trigger the next leap forward in human development .
Many sub-Saharan
Africans get less than 20 litres of water a day and two - thirds have no proper toilets .
By contrast , the average Briton uses 150 litres a day while Americans are the world 's most profligate , using 600 litres a day .
Phoenix , Arizona , uses 1,000 litres per person on average - 100 times as much as Mozambique .
" Water , the stuff of life and a basic human right , is at the heart of a daily crisis faced by countless millions of the world 's most vulnerable people , " says the report 's lead author , Kevin Watkins .
Hilary Benn , international development secretary , said : " In many developing countries , water companies supply the rich with subsidised water but often do n't reach poor people at all .
With around 5,000 children dying every day because they drink dirty water , we must do more . "
Many countries spend less than 1 % of national income on water .
This needs to rise sharply , as does the share of foreign aid spent on water projects , the UNDP says .
It shows how spending on clean water and sanitation led to dramatic advances in health and infant mortality in Britain and the United States in the 1800s .
In the world 's worst slums , people often pay five to 10 times more than wealthy people in the same cities or in London .
This is because they often have to buy water from standpipes and pay a middle man by the bucket .
" The poorer you are , the more you pay , " says Mr Watkins .
Poor people also waste much time walking miles to collect small amounts of water .
The report estimates that 40bn hours are spent collecting water each year in sub-Saharan Africa - an entire working year for all the people in France .
And the water the poor do get is often contaminated , spreading diseases that kill people or leave them unable to work .
The UNDP estimates that nearly half of all people in developing countries at any one time are suffering from an illness caused by bad water or sanitation and that 443 m school days are missed each year .
There is plenty of water globally but it is not evenly distributed and is difficult to transport .
Some countries use more than they have due to irrigation , population growth and so on .
But many simply do not handle their water properly .
The Middle East is the world 's most " water - stressed " region , with Palestinians , especially in Gaza , suffering the most .
Climate change is likely to hit the developing world hardest , reducing the availability of water , lowering agricultural productivity and leaving millions hungry .
Changing weather patterns are already causing drought in countries such as Kenya , Mali and Zimbabwe , but wet areas are likely to become wetter still , causing devastating floods and loss of life .
It says governments need to get more water to people , either through the public sector or a regulated private sector .
The end , the UNDP concludes , is more important than the means .
CBS : Blackwater notified ' all immunities shall be cancelled '
An exclusive CBS report says that all private security firms in Iraq have been notified that " immunity from Iraqi law is about to end . "
The Iraqi interior ministry sent a letter to security contractors explaining that a soon to be ratified Iraq law will remove legal immunities , originally granted by former Coalition Provisional Authority head L. Paul Bremer in 2004 .
One contractor , distrustful of the Iraqi police , told CBS , " There 's no question it 's a disaster if this got passed . "
American officials expect that the law will not be ratified .
The following video is from CBS 's Evening News , broadcast on November 9 , 2007 .
« You Gotta Check This Out : Crayon Physics | Main | Come Fly With Warhawk »
By Lance Yerelian | September 22 , 2007
Like “ You Gotta Check This Out ” hopefully this will be a regular feature that presents podcast recommendations to our readers .
I am one of the lucky people who are allowed to listen to my Ipod while I work so in between music I always tune into videogame podcasts .
This week I will talk about the Cheap Ass Gamer podcast ( CAGcast ) of the site CheapAssGamer.com .
This podcast does n’t have the professional video game journalist types but still delivers on topics such as video game news , reviews , and previews from an average guy perspective along with a large dose of humor .
This is the ONLY video game podcast my girlfriend will listen to with me , and she actually looks forward to it .
The hosts , CheapyD and Wombat , write and produce this weekly podcast even though they live across the world from each other ( CheapyD in Japan and Wombat in New York ) .
When they are not talking about video games , the hosts give insight into Japanese culture ( some of the funniest stories you have heard due to CheapyD being a 6 ′ something white guy in Japan ) , video game advertising , and how to get free stuff from video game companies .
The hosts have a great chemistry with each other and their sense of humor and jokes ( like CheapyD or Wombat sometimes not knowing basic video game trivia ) will keep you laughing through the entire podcast .
Since creating CheapAssGamer.com CheapyD has appeared on Bloomberg TV , but is also well known for his popular PS3 unboxing video and his cameo in the Nintendo E3 Press conference during one of the video montages .
Listening to this podcast you feel that the fans on the forums have a great impact on the content and direction the podcast goes in .
The fans have such a large impact on the show that CheapyD and Wombat have even had live “ call in ” shows and live chat room sessions and usually have a long list of CAGbag questions from their forums at the end of every show .
This kind of attention to fan concerns and requests keep the show grounded to the plight of the average gamer .
Being so different from many of the other mainstream podcasts with its unique sense of humor and point of view , the CAGcast is a great podcast to listen to no matter what you are doing .
While there is not as much talk about great deals as there was in the early podcasts , the content they use now is much more enjoyable .
When my girlfriend looks forward to this show I can say with confidence that this is a show for the hardcore gamers , casual gamers , non-gamers , mothers , fathers , grandparents , firemen , etc .
Just watch the kiddies ears cause it contains some vulgar and graphic content .
You should be able to find a recent podcast of the front page of CheapAssGamer.com .
Recent Memorable Quote :
Wombat :
In Warhawk you do n’t get new guns you get new outfits and let ’s face it , I am an outfit whore when it comes to video games .
CheapyD : You ’re a woman
Womabt : Yeah , I am a big woman when it comes to video games .
CheapyD : You ’re a whorey slutty woman

“ The helicopters watched , and they thought it was a gathering and fired on it , ” Mr. Abadi said .
“ They fired rockets .
When people started to run , the helicopters ’ machine guns began shooting at the people who were running . ”
The American military had a different version of events , which took place in the Saha part of the Abu Dshir district .
A spokesman said that earlier in the evening American forces had twice observed episodes when two or three men fired mortars into the neighborhood to the north .
After the second episode , the military called for an airstrike .
“ We assess possibly two or three were killed or wounded , ” said Maj .
Brad Leighton , a spokesman for the multinational forces in Baghdad .
“ We were not able to get an accurate assessment , ” he added .
“ Collateral damage was not observed , but it is a possibility , ” Major Leighton said .
“ If some innocents were killed , we regret that . ”
The Abu Dshir district , a district that is majority Shiite , is largely controlled by the Mahdi Army , the militia loyal to the anti-American cleric Moktada al - Sadr , according to people who live there .
However , members of the Mahdi Army in Abu Dshir have been observing the cease - fire ordered by Mr. Sadr in August , neighbors said .
No one in the neighborhood appeared to be armed during a reporter ’s visit on Friday , although a few wore the black shirt and pants that the Mahdi Army often favors .
Our Crumbling America
A country that can't keep its bridges from collapsing is not going to be running the world very much longer .
That 's the interesting thing about the standard historical trajectory of imperial elites ... at a certain point they either ( 1 ) forget the power they can wield outside their country ultimately derives from a healthy society beneath them , or ( 2 ) understand that but decide they 'd rather be comparatively more powerful within a poorer society and less powerful outside .
To understand choice # 2 it 's useful to look at an extreme example , like Saudi Arabia .
Certainly it has the natural wealth to be able to oppose Israel effectively .
And you 'd assume their elites want to do that , given that they 're always screeching about it .
But effective opposition would require Saudi society to be internally far more democratic , educated and egalitarian .
So the Saudi princes have decided they 'd prefer their country to be a weak , poor backwater if that 's what 's required for them to each own nine palaces .
As William Arkin said about our new $ 20 billion arms sale to the Saudis :
U.S. officials say the United States will seek assurances from Saudi Arabia that it will not store its new Joint Direct Attack Munitions -- the satellite - guided bombs -- at northern air bases , where they could threaten Israel .
Israel need n't worry .
The Saudi military is even less dangerous than the gang who could n't shoot straight ... it's not just incompetence when it comes to the Saudi military .
The Saudi monarchy has methodically focused its military on pomp and equipment and spiffy uniforms , ensuring that it not acquire any real offensive capacity or the ability to operate as a coherent force .
It does not want a competent , independent military contemplating a coup .
The same thing is true in the rest of the Arab world .
For instance , at the beginning of the Six Day War in 1967 , as Israel was bombing Egyptian airfields , the Egyptian air defense system was actually turned off .
The Egyptian government had done this because they were more worried about internal enemies than Israel — they thought some rebel Egyptian military forces might be trying to shoot down the plane of the Defense Minister , and did n't want the rebels to be able to find out where it was .
Egyptian elites could have avoided this kind of internal conflict by having a democratic country with civilian control of the military , but who wants that ?
Far more enjoyable to be autocrats who turn off their air defense system RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE BEING BOMBED .
America 's elites are , at heart , the same way .
They 'd prefer to be emirs and kings running a shambling catastrophe of a country than moderately rich men in Sweden .
MORE ON THE BRIDGE COLLAPSE : From Rick Perlstein here and here , and from LeanLeft here .
Something is wrong with the United States .
I think most of us have noticed it .
There is a mortal rot in the country , made manifest by many little rots that are hard to integrate mentally yet are , I think , somehow related .
The change is grave , accelerating , probably irreversible , and fascinating .
Things are not as they were .
The United States is the most hated country on the planet , followed by , to the extent that there is a distinction , Israel .
So far as I know , there are no other contenders .
You can say  Who cares ?  as many will say , or  Screw ’em if they ca n’t take a joke ,  or  I ’d ratherh be feared than loved . 
All very droll .
Still , it is an interesting datum .
No country ever lives up to its own PR , but there was a time when America was widely admired .
Now , almost universally , it is seen as a rogue state .
And is .
This carries a price .
The US consulate in Guadalajara is part fortress , part prison , with barriers and cameras and bars and rentacops , and they take away a woman ’s lipstick if she is going to enter .
Maybe a country that fears lipstick needs to think .
The French consulate around the corner is wide open , like all others that I know of .
The French , Chinese , Japanese and so on are n’t hated .
(1) The US government now lives in its own , strange , insulated world .
(2) The United States is the most militarily aggressive country on the planet , followed closely by Israel .
I am aware of no other contenders .
Some of this combativeness is obvious — attacking Iraq for no good reason , occupying Afghanistan , threatening Syria and Iran , attacking Lebanon by proxy , bombing Somalia , putting troops in the Philippines to hunt Moslems .
The US is also looking for trouble with Venezuela , threatening North Korea , moving to contain China ( Does n’t a container need to be bigger than its contents ? ) , embargoing Cuba , pushing into Central Asia , increasing the military budget , and pushing NATO ever closer to Russia .
( How stupid can you get ?
Very .
Stay tuned . )
And the Pentagon now has Africom , African Command .
Africa is now America ’s business .
(3) Powerful domestic hostilities grip the United States .
Maybe you have to be outside of it really to see it .
I live in Mexico .
You can go for well , five years and counting , without hearing angry talk about this or that group .
In America , women hate men and men are getting sick of American women .
Blacks hate whites hate Hispanics .
 Affirmative action engenders intense hostility that does n’t go away .
It is n’t the normal friction found in any country .
It is serious antagonism quashed by federal force .
And the black - white - brown thing has very real potential for getting nasty .
This we do n’t talk about .
(4) A curious state of fear prevails in America , but it is a governmental creation , a calculated manipulative Disneyland .
Perhaps soon we will have Terror Mouse .
Recently I was in Washington .
Everywhere there were the artificialities of fear .
The steel pop-up barriers in the roads , the stop ’em - bombs steel poles on sidewalks , the endless warnings to report suspicious behavior on loudspeakers in the subway .
The searches of everything , the metal - detecting doorways even on buildings of county governments , of schools .
( Schools , for Chrissakes .
What is wrong here ? )
And of course the confiscation of shampoo at the airport .
This is nuts .
(5) The bullying of people entering the US .
Any country has the right to determine who enters .
Fine .
If you do n’t want them to enter , do n’t give them visas .
If you issue a visa , try to be courteous .
Violeta had a visa , issued by the consulate , both times when we went to the US .
Still she got bullied by the border Nazis .
It was ugly .
I am obviously not a Mexican , but I get the same hostile questioning as to where I am going , why I was in Mexico , and so on .
It is none of their business where I go in my country .
Or should n’t be , but there are no limitations on governmental powers now .
A friend , married to a Mexicana , again with a visa , got separated from her , and both got abusive questioning .
She came out crying .
America was not like this .
Now it is .
Compare this with the real world .
I land in Beijing — evil commie Beijing , right ?
Maybe twenty seconds to see whether my visa was valid , clonk of stamp , thank you , no baggage search , into a taxi .
Vi and I land in Paris , en route to Italy .
Glance at passport , yep , it ’s a passport , no stamp , no nothing , on we go .
Italy did n’t even look at our passports .
Grown-ups .
I am not ashamed of the United States .
It is a hell of a country .
Been there , done that , loved it .
In two weeks in DC with Violeta , although she is clearly not American , she was everywhere , always , treated with perfect courtesy and friendliness , whether on Cap Hill or Farmville , Virginia .
Americans really are good folk .
The government is n’t .
It ’s the gravest problem we face , both internationally and domestically .
(6) The Constitution really is going away , or has gone .
It never did work as well as it should have , but few things human ever do .
Habeas corpus is dead , right to an attorney , congressional right to declare war — it ’s not even worth listing the list .
Joe iPod in the burbs does n’t care because it does n’t affect him , yet .
Git them Hay - rabs , ai n’t no draft , plenty sushi .
Urg .
(7) The increasing , detailed , intrusive regulation of life , the national desire for control , control , control .
Everything is the business of some form of government .
Want to paint your shutters ?
The condo association wo n’t let you .
Let dogs in your bar ?
Never .
Decide who to sell your house to ?
Racial matter .
Own a dog ?
Shot card , pooper - scooper , leash , gotta be spayed , etc .
Have a bar for men only , women only , whites or blacks only ?
Here come the federal marshals .
What is n’t controlled by government is controlled by the crypto-vindictive mob rule of political correctness .
This was n’t always in the American character .
Add the continuing presence of police in the schools , the arrest in handcuffs of children of seven , the expulsions for drawing a picture of a soldier with a gun .
Something very twisted is going on .
How much of the public knows what is happening , or even knows that something is happening ?
I do n’t know .
But I do n’t think that it ’s going to go away .
In ten years it will be an entirely different place with the same name .
Almost is now .

OCTOBER 11-- The mother of a two - year - old Wisconsin boy shared a marijuana blunt with her child as friends laughed , filmed the child smoking , and asked , ' Hey buddy , are you stoned ? '
Krystle Leigh Weber , 20 , was charged yesterday along with two male friends with pot possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor ( Weber was also hit with a child neglect rap , also a misdemeanor ) .
According to a Circuit Court complaint , after a confidential source told police about the smoking incident , cops seized a cell phone from defendant Sean Held , 19 , and discovered three videos of the August incident .
On the clips , the boy is seen holding and apparently puffing on a blunt , and ' staggering around a bedroom in what appears to be a confused and altered state . '
In a police interview , Weber , who is pictured above in a Menomonee Falls Police Department mug shot , said that she initially rejected Held 's suggestion to have her son ' hit it , ' but eventually relented and agreed to let the two - year - old take a ' small one . '
The complaint notes that Weber told police that she ' knew what she did was wrong , and she would do anything to keep her son . ' ( 4 pages )
Bush , being a petulant prick again :
At a private reception held at the White House with newly elected lawmakers shortly after the election , Bush asked Webb how his son , a Marine lance corporal serving in Iraq , was doing .
Webb responded that he really wanted to see his son brought back home , said a person who heard about the exchange from Webb .
“ I did n’t ask you that , I asked how he ’s doing , ” Bush retorted , according to the source .
Webb confessed that he was so angered by this that he was tempted to slug the commander - in - chief , reported the source , but of course did n’t .
It ’s safe to say , however , that Bush and Webb wo n’t be taking any overseas trips together anytime soon .
Background :
This amusing Cold War pamphlet was issued in 1950 , accusing the United States of dropping potato beetles ( or Colorado beetles ) on East Germany .
Not only was the U.S. trying to ruin the East German potato crop , it was also trying to establish a market for a new pesticide .
There was , in fact , a serious potato beetle infestation in the GDR in 1950 , but the U.S. had nothing to do with it .
At about the seame time , the Czechoslovakians were claiming a similar American plot .
The BBC did a 2013 story on the topic , complete with interviews from East Germans at the time who say that they did n’t believe the charges , since potato beetles had been around for a long time .
These stories have a history .
During World War II , the Germans accused the Allies of dropping beetles from aircraft , and the British accused the Germans of the same .

STOP Yankee Beetles Crimes against Humanity
As the first reports that American planes were dropping Colorado or potato beetles ( called Yankee beetles by the people ) over the territory of the German Democratic Republic , even those who had never doubted the lack of conscience or scruples of American warmongers were reluctant to believe them .
People had still not forgotten the “ Open Letter ” written by the state bishop of Württemberg , Dr. Wurm , to the American occupation forces on 17 May 1949 .
The bishop stated that the bombing of thickly populated cities like Dresden , Darmstadt , Heilbronn , Pforzheim , and many others , when there was no military need and the victory of the Allies was assured , was a crime against humanity .
Tens of thousands of civilians were killed by such cold - blooded mass murder , above all old people , women , and children .
The wave of resistance and active opposition against the American government ’s preparations for war and its growing armaments increases every day .
An avalanche of signatures against the atom bomb increases .
Nonetheless , people who are fighting to prevent a third world war , who are fighting to maintain world peace , had doubts about the first reports .
Why ?
Because the extent and enormity of the American government ’s crimes , both those already carried out and those planned , exceeded their worst fears !
They are done in service of the Wall Street billionaires and American imperialists
Both private farmers and members of collectives have expressed their outrage at the most recent crimes of American air gangsters .
German and foreign journalists on an information tour of the German Democratic Republic had opportunity to visit the village of Schönfels near Zwickau on 17 June 1950 , one of the areas most attacked by potato beetles .
In a protest declaration , the German and foreign journalists stated : “ The unanimous testimony of the farmers who saw this problem in their fields is that the large number of Colorado beetles appeared a day after American planes flew over the area .
Colorado beetles are smaller than atomic bombs , but they are also a weapon of U.S. imperialism against the peace - loving working population .
We journalists who serve peace hereby condemn this new criminal method of the American warmongers . ”
This protest carried the following signatures : Wu Wen Tao ( New China News Agency ) , Ryszard Szymanski ( API Poland ) , Kamila Cwylenska ( Tribüne der Freiheit , Poland ) , Victor Schleß ( Czechoslovak Press Agency ) , Arrigo Jacchia ( Il Paese , Rome ) , Lydia Lambert ( Paris ) .
It was also signed by all participating German journalists .
The farmers assured the journalists that there could be no other cause for the infestation than from the American planes they had seen .
Potato beetles normally appear at the earliest in mid-July , but this time they appeared at the end of May .
If they had developed from larva , there would have been numerous signs of their activity .
There was no potato foliage at the time for them to eat .
The previous year , four potato beetles were discovered .
This year , it was 1300 .
The farmers were particularly struck by the fact that all the potato beetles they found were of the same size , which suggests they had been bred .
The unassailable proof for the intentions of a notorious gangster diplomacy , which has taken over plans for a total war of annihilation from German and Japanese fascism , is offered in the following pages .
It shows everyone the true face of the deadly enemy of progressive humanity and of world peace .
The current American government , which is using the most brutal fascist methods to silence those fighting for social progress and peace in their own country , wants to use the most terrible means of atomic bombs and bacteriological warfare to bring the whole world under the control of dollar imperialism .
The German people , and all those fighting for peace , demand that the American government , its hirelings and servants , along with the Bonn separatist government of the traitor Adenauer , be brought before the court for war crimes .
The next thirteen pages include a report from an investigative committee and a protest from the East German government on the matter .
The following section is titled : E 838 : The Sensational Background to the Potato Beetle Crime On Wednesday , 7 June 1950 , a Berlin radio commentator presented a sensational report that drew the attention of the entire world to the criminal spread of potato beetles by American planes over the territory of the German Democratic Republic .
The commentator stated : Today I received information that , under the code name E 838 , IG Farben in Leverkusen is committing one of the greatest crimes of the post - war period .
What kind of crime , and who are the criminals , you ask ?
The best answer as to the criminals comes in a film now showing in our theaters : DEFA ’s “ Council of the Gods . ”
The names are not important , since they are all the same .
The type of person is what is important — members of the system of international big capital .
You will also know that between 20 and 25 May , American planes dropped large numbers of Colorado beetles in the south and southwest of our republic .
These insects do terrible damage to potato plants .
Because of rainy weather and because of the necessary examination of the details , it took a while to make the connection between the sudden mass appearance of the potato beetles and the over - flights by the American planes .
Naturally , not every potato beetle infestation is the result of such a crime .
After our republic ’s information service announced this attack on our agriculture , a vehement campaign of denial began in the Western press .
However , across the ocean , Harpers Magazine had reported that the destruction of the agriculture of foreign countries has long been one of the most important areas of study by the U.S. general staff , and that there were already experiments to develop practical methods to destroy useful crops .
More discoveries were made .
In Zwickau beetles were found in the square in front of the railway station .
Near the dam at Sosa they were discovered in bathtubs inside houses , Although everyone knows that even the most eager and ambitious potato beetle normally avoids such areas , the Western press called the sudden appearance of this destructive swarm in our republic “ an entirely normal and natural phenomenon . ”
And with a considerable delay , there were reports of the sudden appearance of huge swarms of potato beetles in areas where they had not been seen before .
At the same time , however , a report from an American investigative committee leaked out that discussed the bad tactics and insufficient preparation of the whole potato beetle campaign , and also criticized the fact that the spreading of the beetles over the GDR had not followed the distribution plan .
The investigation by the government of the German Democratic Republic , and information that we have since learned , proves that his attack on our harvest was only a part of a much larger crime .
From the first , it was unclear why the pests had been dropped not in the middle of the republic rather near the borders , which carried the risk of infesting West German territory as well .
The code word E 838 , the designation of a new pesticide against the potato beetle developed by IG Bayer in Leverkusen , provides half of the answer .
It was a matter of big business for the American war minister and the stockholders of I.G. Farben , Johnson and his crew — both a war exercise and profitable business at the same time .
The Central Biological Institute in Braunschweig has already tested this new pesticide developed by German scientists .
This poison penetrates the shell of the insect , and with even the slightest movement kills the insects , larva , and eggs .
This product is the property of a newly - founded subsidiary of the Pittsbourgh ( sic ) Coke and Chemical Company and the Oeary Chemical Corporation , two large American chemical companies .
In order to be marketable , it needed a major test .
The big speculators on Wall Street , however , are not interested only in damaging our harvest , in making money with E 838 , with earning more from sales of American potatoes to replace those destroyed by the beetles ( also in West Germany ) .
There is more !
Our investigations prove beyond any doubt that it was a test of their plans for bacteriological warfare !
Bacteriological weapons are feasible only when their user has a way of dealing with the destructive effects .
When the Americans dropped the beetles in the south of our republic , thereby also endangering West German territory , they were primarily preparing for bacteriological warfare .
The goal was to test the distribution equipment , the influence of the wind and weather on the creatures , the accuracy of the drops , the effects on the “ enemy , ” the impact on one ’s own territory , and the effectiveness of defensive means .
They were also interested in business goals , in securing a market for potatoes on the world market .
Who does not remember the poison gas I.G. produced during the war and for Auschwitz ?
Hitler fascists had already gone beyond the traditional methods of testing on rabbits and guinea pigs , using people for their criminal experiments .
The war criminals of 1950 use still larger measures , as they would call them .
They are using whole regions in the east and west of our fatherland , along with the inhabitants , for their experiments , and as the battleground for the war they ar preparing .
It takes one ’s breath away to imagine the intellectual and spiritual condition of these supposed Christian citizens of the West who are capable of such inhumanity .
In my opinion , it would be right and good if the resolutions of our farmers won a world hearing , and if their demand was heeded that : the United Nations should take up the charges against the general staff and the government of the USA with regards to their potato beetle crimes .
Is such an American provocation on German soil a surprise ?
However surprised one may be , we should remember that it is only a link in a larger chain .
Just as the American warmongers want to carry out Hitler ’s plans with their atomic strategy , they have also taken over terrible Japanese imperialist plans for bacteriological warfare .
Above all , they have proved their intellectual relationships by protecting the Japanese war criminals condemned by the Soviet Union at Chabarowski , who had prepared and carried out bacteriological warfare .
They have not answered Soviet demand that the Japanese emperor Hirohito and his accomplices , who are guilty of the same crimes , be brought before an international criminal court .
American conduct of the cold war takes on ever hotter forms , as these developments show , the more the will of the peoples — all peoples — for peace shows itself .
The imperialists are enraged by the growing millions of signatures against the atomic bomb .
Their methods grow ever more ruthless , blatant , more open , typical of monopoly capitalism .
Their hysteria betrays their weakness !
The best defense is our burning , unforgiving hatred against such subhumanity , the watchfulness and determination of all Germans , of our workers and citizens , our farmers and our scientists , above all our youth , to free Germany from the plague of warmongers .
Our strength is our will for construction and peace , our friendship with the peace - loving world !
The next two pages claim that the U.S. had done similar things in 1944 and 1948 .
It concludes with three pages on fighting potato beetles .

Someone sent me a link to this blog entry at some random weblog that appears to be a new variation on the popular Evil Atheist Professor versus the True Believer student chain letter that ’s been making the rounds for years .
Previous versions were much shorter and attributed the student as being Albert Einstein , but this version has replaced making the student someone famous with making the fiction considerably longer .
This is n’t the only blog with this email up as of late and just about every site that has it marvels over what a great bit of logic it is .
Well I ’m hear to say it ’s a load of crap , but first I should start by relating the sad story in question :
A science professor begins his school year with a lecture to the students , “ Let me explain the problem science has with religion . ”
The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand .
“ You ’re a Christian , are n’t you , son ? ”
“ Yes sir , ” the student says .
“ So you believe in God ? ”
“ Absolutely . ”
“ Is God good ? ”
“ Sure !
God ’s good . ”
“ Is God all - powerful ?
Can God do anything ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ Are you good or evil ? ”
“ The Bible says I ’m evil . ”
The professor grins knowingly .
“ Aha !
The Bible ! ” He considers for a moment .
“ Here ’s one for you .
Let ’s say there ’s a sick person over here and you can cure him .
You can do it .
Would you help him ?
Would you try ? ”
“ Yes sir , I would . ”
“ So you ’re good … ! ”
“ I would n’t say that . ”
“ But why not say that ?
You ’d help a sick and maimed person if you could .
Most of us would if we could .
But God does n’t . ”
The student does not answer , so the professor continues .
“ He does n’t , does he ?
My brother was a Christian who died of cancer , even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him .
How is this Jesus good ?
Hmmm ?
Can you answer that one ? ”
The student remains silent .
“ No , you can ’t , can you ? ” the professor says .
He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax .
“ Let ’s start again , young fella .
Is God good ? ”
“ Er…yes , ” the student says .
“ Is Satan good ? ”
The student does n’t hesitate on this one .
“ No . ”
“ Then where does Satan come from ? ”
The student falters .
“ From God ”
“ That ’s right .
God made Satan , did n’t he ?
Tell me , son .
Is there evil in this world ? ”
“ Yes , sir . ”
“ Evil ’s everywhere , is n’t it ?
And God did make everything , correct ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ So who created evil ? ”
The professor continued , “ If God created everything , then God created evil , since evil exists , and according to the principle that our works define who we are , then God is evil . ”
Again , the student has no answer .
“ Is there sickness ?
Immorality ?
Hatred ?
Ugliness ?
All these terrible things , do they exist in this world ? ”
The student squirms on his feet .
“ Yes . ”
“ So who created them ? ”
The student does not answer again , so the professor repeats his question .
“ Who created them ? ”
There is still no answer .
Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom .
The class is mesmerized .
“ Tell me , ” he continues onto another student .
“ Do you believe in Jesus Christ , son ? ”
The student ’s voice betrays him and cracks .
“ Yes , professor , I do . ”
The old man stops pacing .
“ Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you .
Have you ever seen Jesus ? ”
“ No sir .
I ’ve never seen Him . ”
“ Then tell us if you ’ve ever heard your Jesus ? ”
“ No , sir , I have not . ”
“ Have you ever felt your Jesus , tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus ?
Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ , or God for that matter ? ”
“ No , sir , I ’m afraid I have n’t . ”
“ Yet you still believe in him ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ According to the rules of empirical , testable , demonstrable protocol , science says your God does n’t exist .
What do you say to that , son ? ”
“ Nothing , ” the student replies .
“ I only have my faith . ”
“ Yes , faith , ” the professor repeats .
“ And that is the problem science has with God .
There is no evidence , only faith . ”
The student stands quietly for a moment , before asking a question of His own .
“ Professor , is there such thing as heat ? ”
“ Yes , ” the professor replies .
“ There ’s heat . ”
“ And is there such a thing as cold ? ”
“ Yes , son , there ’s cold too . ”
“ No sir , there is n’t . ”
The professor turns to face the student , obviously interested .
The room suddenly becomes very quiet .
The student begins to explain .
“ You can have lots of heat , even more heat , super - heat , mega - heat , unlimited heat , white heat , a little heat or no heat , but we do n’t have anything called ‘ cold ’ .
We can hit up to 458 degrees below zero , which is no heat , but we ca n’t go any further after that .
There is no such thing as cold ; otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest - 458 degrees . ”
“ Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy , and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy .
Absolute zero ( - 458 F ) is the total absence of heat .
You see , sir , cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat .
We can not measure cold .
Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy .
Cold is not the opposite of heat , sir , just the absence of it . ”
Silence across the room .
A pen drops somewhere in the classroom , sounding like a hammer .
“ What about darkness , professor .
Is there such a thing as darkness ? ”
“ Yes , ” the professor replies without hesitation .
“ What is night if it is n’t darkness ? ”
“ You ’re wrong again , sir .
Darkness is not something ; it is the absence of something .
You can have low light , normal light , bright light , flashing light , but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it ’s called darkness , is n’t it ?
That ’s the meaning we use to define the word . ”
“ In reality , darkness is n’t .
If it were , you would be able to make darkness darker , would n’t you ? ”
The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him .
This will be a good semester .
“ So what point are you making , young man ? ”
“ Yes , professor .
My point is , your philosophical premise is flawed to start with , and so your conclusion must also be flawed . ”
The professor ’s face cannot hide his surprise this time .
“ Flawed ?
Can you explain how ? ”
“ You are working on the premise of duality , ” the student explains .
“ You argue that there is life and then there ’s death ; a good God and a bad God .
You are viewing the concept of God as something finite , something we can measure .
Sir , science can’t even explain a thought . ”
“ It uses electricity and magnetism , but has never seen , much less fully understood either one .
To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing .
Death is not the opposite of life , just the absence of it . ”
“ Now tell me , professor .
Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey ? ”
“ If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process , young man , yes , of course I do . ”
“ Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes , sir ? ”
The professor begins to shake his head , still smiling , as he realizes where the argument is going .
A very good semester , indeed .
“ Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on - going endeavor , are you not teaching your opinion , sir ?
Are you now not a scientist , but a preacher ? ”
The class is in uproar .
The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided .
“ To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student , let me give you an example of what I mean . ”
The student looks around the room .
“ Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor ’s brain ? ”
The class breaks out into laughter .
“ Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor ’s brain , felt the professor ’s brain , touched or smelt the professor ’s brain ?
No one appears to have done so .
So , according to the established rules of empirical , stable , demonstrable protocol , science says that you have no brain , with all due respect , sir . ”
“ So if science says you have no brain , how can we trust your lectures , sir ? ”
Now the room is silent .
The professor just stares at the student , his face unreadable .
Finally , after what seems an eternity , the old man answers .
“ I guess you ’ll have to take them on faith . ”
“ Now , you accept that there is faith , and , in fact , faith exists with life , ” the student continues .
“ Now , sir , is there such a thing as evil ? ”
Now uncertain , the professor responds , “ Of course , there is .
We see it everyday .
It is in the daily example of man ’s inhumanity to man .
It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world .
These manifestations are nothing else but evil . ”
To this the student replied , “ Evil does not exist sir , or at least it does not exist unto itself .
Evil is simply the absence of God .
It is just like darkness and cold , a word that man has created to describe the absence of God .
God did not create evil .
Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God ’s love present in his heart .
It ’s like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light . ”
The professor sat down .
This students statements are true , can you or can you not make night darker ?
Is it possible for it to get colder after absolute zero - 458 degree ’s F .
Can you feel , taste , see , hear , or smell your brain ,
If anyone can contest this please do .

The task looks as simple as a “ Sesame Street ” exercise .
Study pairs of Easter eggs on a computer screen and memorize how the computer has arranged them : the aqua egg over the rainbow one , the paisley over the coral one — and there are just six eggs in all .
Most people can study these pairs for about 20 minutes and ace a test on them , even a day later .
But they ’re much less accurate in choosing between two eggs that have not been directly compared : Aqua trumped rainbow but does that mean it trumps paisley ?
It ’s hazy .
It ’s hazy , that is , until you sleep on it .
In a study published in May , researchers at Harvard and McGill Universities reported that participants who slept after playing this game scored significantly higher on a retest than those who did not sleep .
While asleep they apparently figured out what they did n’t while awake : the structure of the simple hierarchy that linked the pairs , paisley over aqua over rainbow , and so on .
“ We think what ’s happening during sleep is that you open the aperture of memory and are able to see this bigger picture , ” said the study ’s senior author , Matthew Walker , a neuroscientist who is now at the University of California , Berkeley .
He added that many such insights occurred “ only when you enter this wonder - world of sleep . ”
Feingold to Bush : Stop misleading Americans on interrogation policy Nick Juliano
Published : Monday October 15 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This A Democratic senator well versed in US intelligence procedures has accused President Bush of " misleading " the American people about the harsh interrogation tactics the CIA uses against terror detainees .
Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee , wrote a letter to Bush urging the president to come clean with Congress and the public about the CIA 's methods , which critics say amount to torture .
" Your words and actions have prevented both Congress and the public from having the full , informed debate that this important topic deserves .
...
Americans deserve more than misleading statements and euphemistic references to ' alternative interrogation techniuqes , " Feingold wrote .
Feingold 's letter was in response to Bush 's comments after the New York Times revealed this month that his administration " provided explicit authorization to barrage terror suspects with a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics , including head - slapping , simulated drowning and frigid temperatures . "
Speaking from the Oval Office on Oct. 5 , the day after the Times story appeared , Bush repeated assertions that " this government does not torture people " and that interrogation techniques " have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of the United States Congress . "
Feingold took issue with Bush 's full - disclosure claim .
" This statement was misleading in at least three respects , " the Wisconsin senator wrote .
Feingold said the full Senate Intelligence Committee did not learn of the secret program for years after its implementation , and he accused the Bush administration of refusing to provide legal opinions on the program to the committee .
" Third , and perhaps most importantly , your statement implied that members of Congress have consented or acquiesced to the program or the techniques , " Feingold wrote .
" As senior Administration officials are well aware , I have vigorously opposed the program , and continue to do so .
The program is of highly questionable legality , it is inconsistent with our values as a nation , and it does not make our nation any safer . "
# Feingold 's full letter appears below : Dear Mr. President : On October 5 , 2007 , you spoke publicly about the CIA 's detention and interrogation program , which I strongly oppose .
In defending the program , you stated that " the techniques that we use have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of the United States Congress . "
This statement was misleading in at least three respects .
First , despite your reference to information being " fully disclosed , " most of the members of the full Senate Intelligence Committee were not briefed about the program until several years after the program was created .
Second , your administration continues to refuse to provide any legal opinions about the program to the Committee .
Third , and perhaps most importantly , your statement implied that members of Congress have consented or acquiesced to the program or the techniques .
As senior Administration officials are well aware , I have vigorously opposed the program , and continue to do so .
The program is of highly questionable legality , it is inconsistent with our values as a nation , and it does not make our nation any safer .
In fact , I believe that it may have the effect of exposing Americans - including military and other U.S. personnel to greater risk .
As I stated earlier this year , " detainees should never be interrogated except as authorized by the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations . "
I have detailed the bases for my strong objections to the CIA 's program in classified correspondence , sent shortly after I was first briefed on it .
More recently , I have stated my opposition publicly , although I am prohibited by classification rules from providing further details about my concerns in a public setting .
Your words and actions have prevented both Congress and the public from having the full , informed debate that this important topic deserves .
The program should have been briefed to the full Senate Intelligence Committee at the outset , and the continued failure of your Administration to provide the Committee with any relevant Department of Justice legal opinions is entirely unjustified .
Furthermore , while I strongly believe that the Army Field Manual should govern all interrogations , if you truly believed that the procedures authorized in that Manual were inadequate for certain terrorist suspects , you should have explained your position to Congress and the American people from the outset .
I hope that you will finally provide that explanation now .
Americans deserve more than misleading statements and euphemistic references to " alternative interrogation techniques . "
The threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates is our top national security priority .
Like all Americans , I believe that suspected terrorists should be detained and questioned , but I must strongly oppose a program that is based on such questionable legal , moral and national security grounds .
Respectfully , Russell D. Feingold U.S. Senator #

PEOPLE love to catalogue the traits they think characteristic of their species .
Some , such as language , are obvious .
Others , such as patience and a sense of fairness , are more subtle .
These traits , however , did not spring into existence fully formed .
They evolved — and to understand human evolution it would help to know their genetic underpinnings and the order in which they evolved .
One way of looking at these questions is to compare people with their closest relatives , great apes such as chimpanzees .
Another is to compare them with each other .
Three studies published this week , which take one or other of these approaches , have cast light on the evolution of both patience and fairness .
It turns out that patience is older than fairness .
It also turns out that although the propensity to be fair varies a good deal from one person to the next , that variation is rooted in genetics rather than culture .
The origin of virtues
The essence of patience is the ability to delay the gratification of an appetite in favour of a greater ultimate reward .
Past tests of the degree to which animals other than people can delay their gratification have focused on birds and monkeys .
Both groups can delay gratification if a bigger reward is on offer , but only for a few seconds .
Birds , however , are remotely related to humans , and even monkeys are not as close as apes .
In Current Biology , Marc Hauser of Harvard University and his colleagues compare chimpanzees and humans directly .
Both , it turns out , can be patient to a high degree .
In fact chimps are more patient than people .
The human participants in Dr Hauser 's experiment were allowed to choose a preferred food , such as raisins or chocolate .
The chimpanzees were simply offered grapes — which they usually like .
Otherwise the experimental conditions were identical .
The choice was between one unit of goodies immediately and three after two minutes .
Chimpanzees were nearly four times more likely to wait for the big reward than humans were .
This suggests not only that the trait of patience predates the split between humans and chimpanzees , some 4 m years ago , but that the trait seems more characteristic of chimps than people .
When it comes to fairness , though , it is a different story .
Economic theory has contrived a species it calls Homo economicus — a “ rational maximiser ” who grabs what he can for himself .
But , curiously , he makes no appearance in the ultimatum game , a classic economics experiment .
In this game , two players , a proposer and a responder , divide a reward .
It could be a cake .
It could be cash .
It could even be a bunch of grapes .
The game is so named because the proposition is an ultimatum .
The responder can either accept the division or reject it .
If he rejects it , both players receive nothing .
Homo economicus would accept any division in which his share was not zero .
But that is not what happens .
Scores of studies have run the ultimatum game across cultures and ages .
Universally , people reject any share lower than 20 % — apparently to punish the greed of the proposer .
People do not act like Homo economicus .
Instead , they are the arbiters of fairness .
To find out if chimpanzees share this sense of fairness , Keith Jensen and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , in Leipzig , designed a way for chimps to play the ultimatum game .
Their version started with a pair of trays far from the players ' cages .
Each tray had ten raisins divided in different ways between two pots — say eight and two , or five and five .
One chimp was allotted the role of proposer .
He could choose one of the trays , pulling it by way of a rope just halfway to the cage .
The other , the responder , could then choose to pull on a rod , bringing the tray close enough for both to get the raisins , one pot for each .
If the responder chose not to pull the tray closer within a minute , the offer was considered rejected , and the game concluded .
The result , which Dr Jensen reports in Science , is that chimps are simply rational maximisers —
Pan economicus , if you like .
Though proposers consistently chose the highest possible number of raisins for themselves , responders rarely rejected even the stingiest offers .
This is a telling outcome .
A number of researchers in the field of human evolution think that a sense of fairness — and a willingness to punish the unfair even at some cost to oneself — is humanity 's “ killer app ” .
It is what allows large social groups to form .
Without it , free - riders would ruin such groups , because playing fair would cease to have any value .
Dr Jensen 's previous experiments have shown that chimpanzees are willing to punish actual thieves .
But his new data add weight to the theory that the more sophisticated idea of fair shares , which underpins collaborative behaviour , appeared in the hominid line only after the ancestors of the two species split from one another .
Nor , according to the third of this convenient trilogy of papers , is a sense of fairness rooted in culture .
Rather , it is genetic — as it would have to be in order to evolve .
Paradoxically , discovering this relies on the fact that not everyone possesses it to the same degree .
As they write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Bjorn Wallace of the Stockholm School of Economics and his colleagues have shown this by playing the ultimatum game with twins .
They used the classic trick of neutralising the effect of upbringing and exposing that of genetics by comparing identical twins ( who share all their genes ) with fraternal twins ( who share half ) .
Each twin of a pair played the ultimatum game , both as proposer and as responder .
Dr Wallace found , in the case of identical twins , a striking correlation between the average division that each member of a pair proposed and also between what they were willing to accept .
In other words , their senses of what was fair were similar .
No such correlations were seen in the behaviour of fraternal twins .
Besides showing that a sense of fairness has a genetic basis , this result also raises a question : why should the sense of what is fair be so variable ?
It may be that in a population of the fair , the unfair prosper while amongst the unfair , the fair are better off .
The result would be an equilibrium in which various attitudes to fairness do just as well as each other .
But why , exactly , that should be the case is a subject for another day 's research project .
700 megabytes of internal email from MediaDefender , a group of entertainment industry enforcers , has leaked onto the net .
The emails detail MediaGuardian 's procedures , their internal response to being outed for posting a fake download site to entrap users , the plans to induce users to link to their entrapment site , and the way the company sought to insulate their clients in the motion picture industry from negative publicity arising from their entrapment efforts .
There 's plenty more there — 700 mb is a lot of mail — and I 'm sure we 'll see all kinds of interesting things in the coming weeks .
Unfortunately for Media Defender – a company dedicated to mitigating the effects of internet leaks – they can do nothing about being the subject of the biggest BitTorrent leak of all time .
Over 700 mb of their own internal emails , dating back over 6 months have been leaked to the internet in what will be a devastating blow to the company .
Many are very recent , having September 2007 dates and the majority involve the most senior people in the company .
Apparently this is not the first time that a MediaDefender email leaked onto the Internet .
According to the .nfo file posted with the Mbox file the emails were obtained by a group called " MediaDefender - Defenders " .

Video : Bush shows press corps how to blow off questions

On Wednesday , President Bush appeared at the dedication of the renovated press briefing room at White House .
As the reporters strained to get a few questions through his flow of jovial one - liners , Bush said , " Let 's do this .
Let me cut the ribbon ... and then why do n't you all yell simultaneously .
Like , really loudly .
And that way , you might get noticed .
I 'll , like , listen , internalize , play like I 'm gonna answer the question , and then smile at you and just say ' got it .
Thanks .
Thanks for such a solid , sound question . ' "
Bush then cut the ribbon , waved , and immediately left .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on July 11 .
The Bush quote cited above begins at 1:41 from the end .

Get ready fans and foes of Dan Brown : The Vatican has “ discovered ” a cache of documents from the Knights Templar .
For those of you who were spared the bad movie and worse prose ( via AP ) :
The military order of the Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon was founded in 1118 in Jerusalem to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land after the First Crusade .
As their military might increased , the Templars also grew in wealth , acquiring property throughout Europe and running a primitive banking system .
After they left the Middle East with the collapse of the Crusader kingdoms , their power and secretive ways aroused the fear of European rulers and sparked accusations of corruption and blasphemy .
The documents in question “ reproduces the entire documentation of the papal hearings convened after King Philip IV of France arrested and tortured Templar leaders in 1307 on charges of heresy and immorality , ” which includes “ a 14th - century parchment showing that Pope Clement V initially absolved the Templar leaders of heresy , though he did find them guilty of immorality and planned to reform the order , according to the Vatican archives Web site . ”
AP continues : “ Historians believe Philip owed debts to the Templars and used the accusations to arrest their leaders and extract , under torture , confessions of heresy as a way to seize the order ’s riches . ”
Okay , this is all juicy stuff but what I love best is this :
Only 799 copies of the 300 - page volume , “ Processus Contra Templarios , ” – Latin for “ Trial against the Templars ” – are for sale , said Scrinium publishing house , which prints documents from the Vatican ’s secret archives .
Each will cost $ 8,377 , the publisher said Friday .
An 800th copy will go to Pope Benedict XVI , said Barbara Frale , the researcher who found the long - overlooked parchment tucked away in the archives in 2001 .
The Da Vinci Code book was published in 2003 .
The movie came out in 2006 .
So the entire stupid “ is the Da Vinci Code right or wrong ” industry could have been , I dunno , at least arguing over the facts for the past four years had only the Vatican released this earlier .
And , though this is n’t strictly relevant , before he became Pope Benedict , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , known until 1908 as the Holy Office of the Inquisition .
Times : Giuliani seized control after 9/11 , acted as a ' benevolent dictator '
RAW STORY
Published : Sunday May 13 , 2007 Print This Email
This A story in tomorrow 's New York Times ( reg. req. ) is highly criticial of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 's handling of the recovery operation in New York City following 9/11 , claiming that his desire to downplay problems and return the city to a semblance of normality as quickly as possible has led to serious health problems for many of those who worked at ground zero .
The Times also charges that Giuliani sidelined experienced federal officials from FEMA , OSHA and the Army Corps of Engineers , placing the cleanup instead in the hands of " a largely unknown city agency " that offered " a generally slipshod , haphazard , uncoordinated , unfocused response to environmental concerns . "
According to the Times , " one Army Corps official said Giuliani acted like a ' benevolent dictator . ' "
Excerpts : #
An examination of Giuliani 's handling of the extraordinary recovery operation during his last months in office shows that he seized control and largely limited the influence of experienced federal agencies .
In doing that , according to some experts and many of those who worked in the trade center 's ruins , Giuliani might have allowed his sense of purpose to trump caution in the rush to prove that his city was not crippled by the attack .
Administration documents and thousands of pages of legal testimony filed in a lawsuit against New York City , along with more than two dozen interviews with people involved in the events of the last four months of Giuliani 's administration , show that while the city had a safety plan for workers , it never meaningfully enforced requirements that those at the site wear respirators , even long after the last survivor was rescued .
At the same time , the administration warned companies working on the pile that they would face penalties or be fired if work slowed .
Administration officials also on some occasions gave flawed public representations of the nature of the health threat , even as they privately worried about exposure to lawsuits by sickened workers .
" I would describe it as a conspiracy of purpose , " said Suzanne Mattei , director of the New York office of the Sierra Club , which has been critical of how the cleanup was handled .
" It was n't people running around saying , ' Do n't do this safely . '
But there was a unified attempt to do everything as fast as possible , to get everything up and running as fast as possible .
Anything in the way of that just tended to be ignored . "

Wife hears as Katy driver on phone killed by train Man 's wife listened as train crash happened
A Katy man was on his cell phone with his wife when he crashed into a freight train on Tuesday , according to the Texas Department of Public Safety .
Investigators said they are unsure whether Santiago Cadena , 33 , was trying to beat the train or did n't see it coming before the crash happened around 2:30 p.m .
Cadena 's wife told authorities that she overheard the wrenching , screeching crash , said DPS Sgt. Chuck Havard .
A west - bound Union Pacific freight train slammed into the cab of Cadena 's empty flat bed truck , splintering it into pieces .
The truck had been heading south on FM 2830 and crossed the tracks about a block from where the farm road intersects U.S. 90 in Raywood .
Sgt .
Havard said the train had sounded its horn and the crossing lights were flashing , but this intersection has no crossing arms .
Investigators are still checking the train 's speed but believe it was traveling about 30 mph .
Cadena was pronounced dead at the scene , authorities said .
Because of its weight and power , Havard said , the train was not damaged .
None of its cargo spilled and no one else was injured , he said .

Cheney op - ed : Greenspan 's economic assessment ' off the mark ' Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday September 19 , 2007
Print This Email This
In a rebuttal op - ed in the Wall Street Journal , Vice Pesident Dick Cheney takes on former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , who slammed Bush administration economic policies as fiscally irresponsible in a recent book , " The Age of Turbulence . "
" I think his assessment is off the mark , " Cheney writes , going on to characterize the economic downturn early in Bush 's first term as having begun in the final months of the Clinton administration .
" The Fed chairman told the president - elect and our team that America faced the real possibility of a recession in the wake of the collapse of the late 1990s technology sector bubble , " Cheney says in the Journal .
" Alan 's prediction proved correct :
In the final months of the Clinton administration , the nation began an economic slowdown that turned into a recession . "
Another economy - slowing factor , says Cheney , were the Sept. 11 attacks .
" Less than eight months into our administration the nation came under terrorist attack , " he said .
" The events of 9/11 are the defining moment of the era from the standpoint of national security ; they were equally significant from an economic perspective . "
" The combined effects of recession and national emergency could have been devastating for America 's economy , " Cheney continues , yet " President Bush 's tax cuts -- following through on a promise he had made to the voters -- resulted in a shallower recession , a faster recovery , and a platform for growth that remains sturdy to this day . "
Citing what he calls the " highest growth in tax receipts in consecutive years since 1981 , " the vice president said that even at Bush 's lower tax rates " the hard work and productivity of Americans is generating more tax dollars than ever before . "
Greenspan had also sharply critiqued government spending on Bush 's watch -- an observation Cheney says he " ca n't dispute , " although he goes on to argue that " President Bush has pressed hard to keep that spending under control -- and this year 's increase will actually be lower than the rate of inflation for the third year in a row . "
Recalling Greenspan 's argument that fiscal discipline is a " long - term obligation requiring honesty and a willingness to make tough choices , " Cheney insists that by that definition , " President Bush 's record is superb . "
Cheney closes on a light note , saying he enjoyed Greenspan crediting him in the book with " intensity " and a " sphinxlike charm . "

Local people accused the US soldiers of targeting civilians
The incident occurred on the road from the eastern city of Jalalabad to Pakistan when a suicide bomber targeted a convoy , sparking a fire fight .
US officials initially said 16 people had been killed .
They did not explain the lower , revised death toll .
Thousands of local people took to the streets , accusing the Americans of deliberately firing on the civilians .
Separately , Nato said two British soldiers had been killed in fighting in southern Afghanistan .
Spring offensive
The US military said a minibus containing explosives was driven at the convoy , injuring one soldier .
US troops were then attacked from several directions and returned fire in defence of the patrol .
The [ US troops ] opened fire on everybody , the ones inside the vehicles and the ones on foot
Tur Gul , injured civilian
UK soldiers killed
Thousands of people gathered to demonstrate against the shooting , shouting " Death to America , Death to Karzai " , referring to the Afghan president , and blaming the US patrol for shooting passers - by .
US military spokesman Maj William Mitchell said : " We certainly believe it 's possible that the incoming fire from the ambush was wholly or partly responsible for the civilian casualties . "
However , Mohammad Khan Katawazi , chief of Shinwar district , said the US troops treated everyone as a potential attacker even if they had no evidence .
One injured civilian , Tur Gul , told the Associated Press news agency : " They opened fire on everybody , the ones inside the vehicles and the ones on foot . "
" When we parked our vehicle , when they passed us , they opened fire on our vehicle , " said Mohammad Ishaq , 15 , who was also hit by bullets .
The BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kabul says there has been a huge increase in the number of suicide attacks over the past 12 months , but a coordinated ambush is relatively rare .
He says there have also been other demonstrations in the same province , Nangarhar , recently , mainly at opium poppy eradication by government officials .
The two British servicemen killed in southern Afghanistan died in the Sangin area of Helmand province on Saturday .
Twenty foreign soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan so far this year .
Nato fears that Taleban violence will escalate in several areas of Afghanistan as the winter snows thaw .
Nato commanders have said they need more soldiers to tackle the expected spring offensive .
Last Tuesday at least nine people were killed in a suicide bombing at the main US base in Afghanistan , Bagram near Kabul , during a visit by US Vice - President Dick Cheney .
The disease is AMI ( Acute Myocardial Infarct ) or in lay terms , a heart attack , and the background facts in this situation are not in dispute .
Every year some eight million people rush to a nearby Emergency Room ( ED ) believing they are experiencing life threatening chest pain .
About 8 % of all ED visits every year are for this reason .
Five million of this total are deemed to demonstrate possible cardiac etiology and are treated accordingly .
However , three million are deemed to be having non-cardiac pain and they are discharged without treatment .
And then at least 40,000 of those so released , subsequently die , often in an embarrassingly short period of time , of a heat attack .
We say that at least 40,000 die because these are the ones everyone is sure of .
No doubt there are more .
But for 40,000 , their deaths occur very close in time to the visit to the Emergency Room and their relatives raise a fuss , ask for records , file malpractice suits etc etc .
It ’s another story for another time but misdiagnosed AMI is in fact the leading cause of malpractice suits in the US .
Currently , however , almost none of these is ever successful .
The question for the reader though is a simple one .
Why did n’t these 40,000 , ( who after the fact , we now know , were literally dying in the emergency room ) get properly diagnosed .
I ca n’t speak for all of them but this is what happened to one of them , and based on what I am told by experts , it is not at all uncommon .
RLT are the initials of a 42 year old woman whose husband rushed her to an emergency room in a mid size city in upstate New York exactly a year ago tomorrow complaining of crushing chest pain .
She lived less than two minutes away from the ED and she was convinced that she was having a heart attack .
According to the hospital records her chest pain at time of admission was 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 .
Heart attacks in 42 year old women are not common .
But RLT was seriously overweight ( a BMI of 36 ) , was a long time smoker and drinker , was forced by a 20 year old industrial back injury into a sedentary life style and was post menopausal , and all of these things are factors that increase the risk of coronary heart disease despite her relatively young age .
The hospital records show that -
RLT was signed in at 8 04 PM
Was triaged very promptly at 8 06 ,
The ED Doctor was notified at 8 28
A 12 lead EKG was taken at 8 40 PM -- Result was " normal "
Blood for cardiac enzyme analysis was drawn at 8 51 – Results are shown below
And an X Ray of her chest was read at 9 46 .--
Heart was normal and was " not enlarged " .
She was discharged at 10 04 PM with a diagnosis of bronchitis .
Her doctor ’s final words to her were " See , I told you there was nothing wrong " .
And with those words to ring in her ears throughout all eternity , she died in her sleep five hours later of a heart attack .
The autopsy the next day , which fixed the cause of death as a heart attack , curiously noted that that the heart was found , in fact , to be enlarged ( weight 420 grams ) .
She was right .
The doctor was wrong .
How did this happen ?
And more importantly could it have been prevented ?
Should it have been prevented ?
What do you call the fact that it was not prevented ?
Unfortunate Medical Error ?
Or is it something worse ?
Should it be something worse ?
You be the Jury .
This is the part that can save your life .
It can save 40,000 lives every year .
Recommended Emergency Room practice ( Joint European Society of Cardiology / American College of Cardiology Committee ) for people who come to the Emergency Room complaining of chest pain is to -
Run a 12 lead EKG at admission and at least once again before discharge
Take a Chest X Ray , and examine it for fluid in the lungs and determine if the heart is enlarged or shows any other evidence of damage .
Draw blood at several intervals and test this for three enzymes that are known to be released into the blood stream , when part of the heart muscle has died due to a lack of oxygen .
The primary reason for running the EKG at least twice is because
In more than 40 % of the instances , where it is known ( after the fact ) , that an AMI has occurred , the initial EKG shows no abnormalities .
There is no other face that you can put on this piece of information .
A 12 lead EKG is run virtually every time someone complains of chest pain .
It is undoubtedly the most widely used diagnostic test for cardiac damage that there is .
Nonetheless , it only means something some 45 % of the time .
If the test is abnormal , the patient has a serious problem .
If the test is not abnormal , however , the information means nothing at all .
To be blunt , if you are actually experiencing an AMI , a single EKG is essentially a coin flip .
Half the time the test will show damage and be right .
The other half of the time it will show no damage and be wrong .
So life saving lesson number 1 is this – If you , or a loved one , are rushed to an ED with severe chest pain , by all means be sure an EKG is run .
But draw no comfort whatever from a normal result , and always inquire as to why , if there is not more than one such test made before discharge .
The reason for running the cardiac enzyme tests at various intervals is because each of them shows up in the blood at different times after the heart has been damaged and then the concentration of each of them rises at different rates before finally reaching the level called the " Reference Range " .
The Reference Range is that particular concentration , specific for each enzyme and sometimes for each hospital testing lab , at which the level is considered to be so far above the normal range for that enzyme , that it is considered to be strong evidence that an AMI has actually occurred and that prompt medical response is required .
The recommended enzymes to be tested for and their concentrations at various times after AMI damage has occurred are shown in the table below .
The column labeled " Begin " shows the number of hours after the onset of the AMI that the enzyme first becomes detectable in the blood .
For example it shows up essentially immediately after the AMI for Myoglobin , but does not begin to show up in the blood for CK - MB until 3 hours after the AMI and even then , the concentration is too low to be meaningful .
The Column labeled ULR ( Upper Level of Reference Range ) shows the number of hours after the onset of AMI that it takes for the enzyme to reach the Reference Range .
The words " Mild " and " Lge " after the enzyme Troponin I , refer , respectively , to a Mild AMI and a much larger , more serious AMI event .
Both are life threatening .
Note , Myoglobin will indicate a life threatening situation after only 3 hours , but CK - MB and Troponin I take at least twice as long .
For a mild AMI ( still life threatening ) Troponin I will not reach the required reference range level for 16 hours .
Learn these names .
Memorize this table .
Enzyme Begin ULR
Myoglobin 0 3
CK -MB 3 6
Troponin I Mild 8 16
Troponin I Lge 3 6
Life Saving Lesson number 2 is this .
If the hospital you are in does not measure all three of these enzymes and / or does not run them all more than once each several hours apart , you are at very grave risk of being discharged with an undiagnosed AMI , and you could very easily be dead in a few hours .
The smartest thing you can do if you find yourself in this situation is let the doctor know that you know how the enzymes work and that you know how unreliable a normal EKG reading is and that you think more testing is in order .
With the above information on enzymes in mind , we should now go back to RLT .
We know right off there is a problem .
RLT arrived at the hospital within minutes of developing symptoms and was in and out of the hospital in exactly 2 hours – one full hour before the most sensitive of the enzymes ( Myoglobin ) would have reached the reference Range ( if it had even been run ) ,
In addition , the blood that was tested was drawn just 47 minutes after arrival making the likelihood of this test producing any meaningful results absolutely nil .
But there is even more wrong .
Myoglobin , the earliest indicator of myocardial damage , was n’t even run .
Troponin I was run , which is good , and something else called CPK ( Creatine Phopho Kinase ) was run .
CPK is probably still the most commonly measured of all the cardiac enzymes , but by now it should be a relic of the past .
It is widely present in the blood at all times , and if it does rise to the Reference Level , it is still highly non-specific for cardiac damage , and then another test ( CK – MB ) , has to be run to determine if the source of the rise is in fact cardiac - related .
In short CPK tells you nothing and delays the diagnosis , if in fact there is a problem .
In the case of RLT , the actual concentrations of the two enzymes that were tested for and the reference range for each are shown in the table below .
The critical time for CPK to reach the Reference Range is about 6 hours , the same as shown earlier for its cardiac cousin , CK – MB , but it is always present in the blood at a substantial concentration , whether there is heart injury or not .
Enzyme Actual Conc. Reference Range
CPK 119 35 – 180
Troponin I 0.24 0.40
On the face of it both results indicate no problem .
But then , of course , at less than an hour after onset , they would not be expected to be anything but normal .
If the testing stops at this point , and it did , the results actually mean nothing at all .
Expense has simply been incurred with there being no chance that the tests could provide diagnostically useful information .
This is damning on its face .
Anyone who knows anything at all about the cardiac enzymes should know that they take a while after onset of AMI to show up , and even longer to become diagnostically useful .
To run only one set of tests very early after admission and not do any more has to mean that the Doctor simply did not believe that an AMI was the cause of the person ’s chest pain .
Why he did n’t is not clear .
Bush may not be the only one who talks directly with God .
But since he was sure there was no AMI , why did he incur the expense of running the initial tests at all .
Just to raise the billing to the insurance company ?
In order for one single test to show a problem , the onset of the pain would have had to have been several hours in the past which generally speaking would have meant that the patient would have died at home , died in the ambulance or died in the ED waiting room .
" Time is muscle " is the cry that the American Heart Association uses to try and convince its members to take all chest pain seriously and to go immediately to the ED .
The meaning of the phrase is that , if you are having an AMI , more and more of the heart muscle is dying every second you delay .
So we have quite an interesting dilemma here .
The best thing you can do to prevent death if you experience chest pain is to go to the ED quickly after the onset of the pain , but this has the adverse effect of increasing the likelihood that early testing will show no problem .
If the doctor is not going to do serial testing you might as well save the cab fare .
You are still going to die at home .
But we are n’t done .
There are also two other things wrong with the RLT example –
RLT is a woman and the reference range listed for CPK in the table above , is for the joint male / female population .
The correct reference range for women is 96 to 140 .
If subsequent testing had been done , it should have raised suspicion at 140 and not require waiting until it reached 180 .
The other thing that is wrong is that the reference level for the Troponin I enzyme as shown in the table is 0.40 .
Troponin I , is often called the " cardiac gold standard " .
It is uniquely specific evidence of cardiac damage .
Essentially , any measurable level at all means the heart has been damaged .
The Reference Range of 0.40 only means that the test method being used cannot reliably detect Troponin I at levels below 0.40 .
However , since 2001 there has been a Troponin I test available on the market for which the Reference Range is 0.04 .
This test is 10 times more sensitive than the test that was actually used .
Why would a hospital testing lab near the end of 2005 still be using a vastly inferior test method to detect the single most important compound that can diagnose the presence of heart damage ?
I ca n’t imagine an appropriate answer .
Although I had no legal standing to do so , I took the information detailed above to three large medical malpractice firms and asked each of them for their opinion as to whether or not filing a malpractice suit against the people involved in RLT ’s death would be likely to be successful .
I was simply stunned to find that all three agreed that such a suit had no chance of success .
I was told that if the judge even let the case go to trial , which was unlikely , he would shoot the theory down when he charged the jury .
Why ?
Because doctors , within wide bounds , are allowed to use something called " Medical Judgment " in making clinical diagnoses .
Medical Judgment is not the so called evidence - based medicine you have been hearing about .
Rather this is the doctor looking at the big picture , analyzing the evidence in a very special way that he has learned in some mystical way over the years and making a diagnosis that sometimes , unfortunately , simply fails to be correct .
It matters not one wit , that he might have made a better decision if he had done more testing .
The decision as to how much testing to do at all , is also his decision to make – again using " Medical Judgment " .
All three firms said that in essence , the limited testing performed by the ED doctor , even though it had essentially zero chance of detecting an AMI early after its onset , was still " Bullet Proof " protection against a successful law suit .
And then everything was clear .
It was not really medical judgment , it was business judgment .
You can run three tests and be legally immunized against a malpractice suit or you can run eleven tests and be sure you are making a correct diagnosis .
The deal clincher is that the extra eight tests have to be run on an extra 3,000,000 patients .
So if each test costs about $ 20 dollars , the extra cost to the insurance underwriter is $ 480 million .
From a straight forward business point of view , it ’s a no -brainer .
The legal hurdle to protect ones self against a malpractice suit is very low .
If the medical institution provides the legally minimum level of care , it is safe from suit and profit has been maximized .
" God ’s in his heaven and all ’s right with the world " .
And if the patient is dead - no big deal , I guess .
So what ’s your verdict – murder , criminal negligence , depraved indifference to human life , or unfortunate , unavoidable medical error
Keep in mind , this can happen to you – or someone you love .
A few weeks after RLT died there was a story in our local paper about a body being found in a local park swimming pool .
Autopsy showed the dead person had suffered a heart attack while swimming .
This was an older male in his early 70 ’s who had had a history of heart problems and he had gone to his doctor earlier in the same day because he had been " feeling tired " .
He was told he was fine .
Is RLT ’s case an isolated event ?
I do n’t think so .
I think she is one of 40,000 .
And I think something has to be done about it .
The Civil Court System is obviously not interested in imposing a penalty to discourage this type of medical practice , so that leaves only the Criminal Justice System , and this what I think we should do , and I do n’t think it is at all extreme , So listen just a little while longer .
There are some 200 million drivers in America and 51 % of them drink .
Altogether those 100 million or so drinking drivers , exercising " poor judgment " , get into their automobiles , after they have had " one too many " and in aggregate they kill about 17,000 people every year .
The Criminal Justice System thinks this is a big deal – and it is .
And they police this problem and they prosecute this problem relentlessly and with vigor .
At the very least , every driver who is involved in a fatal accident , loses his license and often his freedom as well .
Quite often he / she is also sued in Civil Court for monetary damages .
On the other hand , there are less than a million doctors in the US who collectively are killing minimally 40,000 persons per year using " poor medical judgment " , and there is no penalty , civil or criminal or even administrative for this .
There is definitely something wrong with this picture and I would suggest the following as a potential way to rectify it .
There are approximately 5,000 hospitals in the US , so on average , some one is dying of poor medical judgment in each one these hospitals about every 6 or 7 weeks during the year .
Ponder that statement for a moment or two .
When will one of them be you ?
Every one of these hospitals is located in a district where there is a publicly - elected District Attorney – charged with protecting the public against criminal acts .
If enough people in enough districts start pushing their local DA ’s into conducting criminal investigations into every one of these 40,000 deaths , sooner or later " Medical Judgment " is going to get a whole lot better .
If a minimum of 40,000 people a year are dying because of being misdiagnosed for the most serious , and most common , of all medical ailments , while there are procedures in existence for dropping this number to essentially zero , then any time a doctor has a patient die because this procedure was n’t followed , there should be some kind of investigation to determine just what was the overwhelming medical evidence that caused that doctor to be so sure that the patient ’s complaint was not heart related , when after the fact it is so clear that it was .
If this determination is actually being made on an economic basis rather than a medical one , and I have no doubt many of them are , then the situation is really no different than the drunk who gets in his car and drives home , and kills some one on the way , because driving drunk will save him two cab fares , and the penalties for killing heart patients to save testing money , should be the same as it is for the drunk .
Post Script
What the courts call " Medical Judgment " should really be called " Witch Doctoring " .
If the initial EKG does not show a problem , which is the case about 45 % of the time , then the doctor , at that point , really has no idea whether or not the patient is experiencing heart pain .
The proof of this statement is the simple fact that at least 13 times out of every 1000 , the patient dies of a heart attack after having been told his pain is not heart related .
If you think that ’s a pretty good record , ask your self if you would fly an airline with the same record .
Ten years ago , there was no choice but to trust the Doctor ’s judgment and pray that he was right .
But for the last five years it has been possible to run a series of tests that will tell unequivocally if chest pain in any given instance is heart related , and not to run those tests cannot be brushed off as Medical Judgment .
It is some degree of homicide and it ’s time we started treating it as such .
Doctors are not above the Law .
If there are any DA ’s in the readership , I would love to hear your thoughts on this .
Doctors too .
For those of you who are n’t DA ’s , or doctors , but who think that simply learning what has been written here can save lives , please do n’t hesitate to recommend this Diary .
The more it is read , the more lives will be saved , and the sooner the underlying problem will disappear .

The Robot Ethics Charter will cover standards for users and manufacturers and will be released later in 2007 .
It is being put together by a five member team of experts that includes futurists and a science fiction writer .
The South Korean government has identified robotics as a key economic driver and is pumping millions of dollars into research .
" The government plans to set ethical guidelines concerning the roles and functions of robots as robots are expected to develop strong intelligence in the near future , " the ministry of Commerce , Industry and Energy said .
Ethical questions
South Korea is one of the world 's most hi-tech societies .
Citizens enjoy some of the highest speed broadband connections in the world and have access to advanced mobile technology long before it hits western markets .
The government is also well known for its commitment to future technology .
ASIMOV'S LAWS OF ROBOTICS
A robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm .
A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law
A recent government report forecast that robots would routinely carry out surgery by 2018 .
The Ministry of Information and Communication has also predicted that every South Korean household will have a robot by between 2015 and 2020 .
In part , this is a response to the country 's aging society and also an acknowledgement that the pace of development in robotics is accelerating .
The new charter is an attempt to set ground rules for this future .
" Imagine if some people treat androids as if the machines were their wives , " Park Hye - Young of the ministry 's robot team told the AFP news agency .
" Others may get addicted to interacting with them just as many internet users get hooked to the cyberworld . "
Alien encounters
The new guidelines could reflect the three laws of robotics put forward by author Isaac Asimov in his short story Runaround in 1942 , she said .
Key considerations would include ensuring human control over robots , protecting data acquired by robots and preventing illegal use .
Other bodies are also thinking about the robotic future .
Last year a UK government study predicted that in the next 50 years robots could demand the same rights as human beings .
The European Robotics Research Network is also drawing up a set of guidelines on the use of robots .
This ethical roadmap has been assembled by researchers who believe that robotics will soon come under the same scrutiny as disciplines such as nuclear physics and Bioengineering .
A draft of the proposals said : " In the 21st Century humanity will coexist with the first alien intelligence we have ever come into contact with - robots .
" It will be an event rich in ethical , social and economic problems . "
Their proposals are expected to be issued in Rome in April .
Qantas Airways Ltd. expects to release preliminary results of its in - flight phone trial later this year .
While the technology is almost ready to allow passengers to use their mobile phone during flights , they should n't expect to do so anytime soon .
Qantas has extended until February 2008 a technology trial that allows passengers to send text messages and emails from their mobile phones during flights , with the plane acting as a mobile phone tower .
Passengers roam onto the tower as they normally do when travelling overseas .
In April , Australia 's communications regulator , the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) , gave Qantas a 12 month window of opportunity to temporarily test the service on one of its planes , a Boeing 767 travelling domestically .
While Qantas had initially flagged plans for a three - month trial , company spokeswoman Holly Williams told The Australian Financial Review last week the test period had now been extended , and was slated to finish early next year .
" They figured they might as well use the entire period to evaluate customer responses , " Ms Williams said of Qantas 's technical team .
Qantas expects to release preliminary results of the trial later this year .
Qantas 's efforts come as other carriers , such as Dubai's Emirates Airlines , flag similar trials this year although most remain concerned that mobile phones , which use a specialized form of radio waves , have the potential to interfere with in - flight signalling equipment .
Virgin Blue spokeswoman Amanda Bolger said the carrier did not offer any internet , SMS or mobile phone options on its planes , although the matter was under consideration .
ACMA and other government groups will consider permanent regulatory arrangements for in - flight mobile services once Qantas releases its results from the trial .
The Qantas trial involves the use of a so - called network control unit that acts like a tiny mobile phone tower connected by satellite to ground networks .
In - flight mobile voice services could also be even further away than mobile text and email services .
Qantas 's trial does not allow voice services , reportedly due to the need to prevent talkative passengers from disturbing others .
Passengers on Qantas flights can already communicate via available telephones located in their seats .
However , they may soon have another option .
In July , the airline announced it was planning to buy a number of Airbus A380s , which would provide wi-fi internet capability throughout the plane .
This is in addition to in - seat access to email , the internet and SMS .
The planes will also feature USB and ethernet ports as well as the ability to power laptops .
Mr Bremer says the White House knew of the army dismantling plan
Mr Bremer released a series of letters to the New York Times detailing the need to take " robust " action against the toppled regime of Saddam Hussein .
But in a book published on Tuesday , Mr Bush says the agreed policy was to keep Iraq 's army intact .
The disbanding is now widely seen as a mistake that fuelled Iraq 's insurgency .
This episode is another example of a falling - out among senior administration officials about policy in Iraq , says the BBC News website 's world affairs correspondent , Paul Reynolds .
In this case , the decision to disband the Iraqi army immediately after the invasion is now seen as a factor that contributed to the insurgency and nobody is keen to take authorship of it , our correspondent adds .
Letter exchange
In a letter dated 22 May 2003 , Mr Bremer , the former head of the US - led civilian administration in Iraq , appears to propose the dismantling of the army to Mr Bush .
You have quickly made a positive and significant impact .
You have my full support and confidence
President George W Bush
Letter to Paul Bremer , May 2003
" I will parallel this step [ dismantling the Baath Party ] with an even more robust measure dissolving Saddam 's military and intelligence structures to emphasise that we mean business .
" We are seeing signs that the outlawed organisations are behind some of the street violence here . "
The next day Mr Bush replies , according to a second letter published in the Times : " Your leadership is apparent .
You have quickly made a positive and significant impact .
You have my full support and confidence . "
Mr Bremer provided the letters to the New York Times on Monday after reading extracts of Mr Bush 's contribution to a new book .
" The policy was to keep the army intact ; did n't happen , " Mr Bush is quoted as saying in the book , Dead Certain : The Presidency of George Bush .
The book , by Robert Draper , is informed by six intimate conversations with the president .
William Bennett Is n't Scared To Tell It Like It Is
Speaking yesterday at the Family Research Council Conference , William Bennett took the American people to school :
" Battlefield surrender comes from cultural surrender , " [ Bennett ] says .
" Cultural surrender comes from befuddlement . "
Nothing in history is clearer than this .
Take World War II : the Germans surrendered only when their liberal media successfully confused and demoralized the populace .
Likewise , Japan surrendered following an intense effort by left - wing academics to befuddle Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
This may sound silly , but let me ask you a question .
Let 's say that I maxed out my credit at Citigroup to speculate on a house whose market price is now less than what I paid .
Citi wants its money , but instead I say , " Sorry , the house is selling for less than its true value .
As soon as it sells for what it should , I 'll send you a check . "
What do you think Citi 's reaction would be ?
How about " Sir , where should I send the repo man ? "
Well , folks , Citi ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) seems to have put itself in just such a fix by borrowing lots of money to buy assets that have dropped in market value .
But instead of summoning the repo ( as in repossession ) man , some of the world 's biggest hitters are trying to set up a huge fund to buy time for Citi and some other institutions with similar problems .
The idea is to set up a $ 100 billion " master liquidity enhancement conduit " to take some of the $ 80 billion of suspect securities off Citi 's hands so that it does n't have to sell them in the current market .
Other institutions have about $ 300 billion worth .
( This conduit is being called a superfund , to the delight of those of us who live in New Jersey , for whom the term evokes images of toxic industrial waste .
But I digress . )
The problem here , as you probably know , involves seven of Citi's " structured investment vehicles , " known as SIVs .
They borrowed short - term money to buy long - term assets , such as mortgage - backed securities , that have fallen in market value .
Regulators and various big institutions are trying to stabilize things to avoid what we can call SIVilis .
That 's a financially transmitted disease that could infect the world 's financial markets , leading to cascading failures and other consequences too dire to even think about .
Citi wo n't talk to us about SIVs .
The only player who would go on the record is Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , whose department is in charge of maintaining orderly financial markets .
The problem , Paulson told Fortune , is not merely " the repricing of risk " but also analyzing the immensely complicated securities the SIVs own .
" What you 're dealing with here is complexity , " he told us , and the proposed master conduit would pool not only money but analytical information as well .
An interesting concept .
Paulson would n't discuss Citigroup or provide details about how bad SIVilis is .
But he gets points for coming out and talking .
Citi clearly screwed up with its SIVs .
When a financial institution borrows short term to buy long - term assets , it 's supposed to have a plan for when its bet goes bad - rather than just whining about " disorderly markets . "
Citi now says it has put together enough borrowings to carry its SIVs through year - end , which may be why Paulson told us the problem " is n't urgent . "
If Citi's only problem is that it can't liquidate its SIVs without a profit hit , too bad .
If Citi 's very existence is at risk , I do n't think we dare let it fail , because that would drag down institutions throughout the world .
But if the bank needs help , its shareholders should have to pay .
Bigtime .
Step one would be to eliminate its common stock dividend , currently more than $ 10 billion a year .
Step two would be to force Citi to raise the capital it needs by selling new stock at a price well below its recent $ 42 a share .
That would force holders to either ante up or have their Citi stake diluted .
That just might inflict enough pain on shareholders that someone other than underlings would pay for Citi's SIV sloppiness .
In any event , if we believe in markets , Citi should have to take its chances .
We small fry take chances when we borrow , and we pay the price if we 're wrong .
Big fish should have to do the same .

A year later , White House continues to withold ' torture ' documents Nick Juliano
Published : Friday October 26 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy is urging the White House to turn its slow drip of information on CIA interrogation policies into a freely flowing faucet to wash away a lingering veneer of secrecy .
The Vermont Democrat on Friday reiterated his demands for all of the Bush administration 's documents outlining extreme interrogation policies -- critics call it torture -- justified by the president since the beginning of the " Global War on Terror . "
Calling the administration 's recent partial release of documents " a step in the right direction , " Leahy said too many questions remain about just what the Justice Department said CIA interrogators could do and what is still allowed .
" I remain deeply troubled by the Administration 's attempts to justify the use of harsh interrogation techniques and even torture , " Leahy wrote to White House counsel Fred Fielding , " and I intend to get to the bottom of what this Administration 's legal policy has been on this issue , and what it is today . "
The Judiciary Committee first requested documents related to CIA interrogation in November 2006 .
Among the documents that have not been provided to the committee , Leahy said , is a February 2005 memo that served as the basis of a recent New York Times article detailing harsh methods used by CIA interrogators .
The memo endorsed the harshest tactics used by the CIA , and it explicitly authorized " a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics , including head - slapping , simulated drowning and frigid temperatures , " according to the newspaper .

Leahy 's full letter to Fielding is reprinted below : #
Mr. Fred Fielding , Esq .
Counsel to the President
Office of the Counsel to the President
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , NW
Washington , DC 20530
Dear Mr. Fielding :
I appreciate your providing Senator Specter and me several of the documents we have requested relevant to the treatment and interrogation of detainees .
The release of these documents restarts the incremental process of providing necessary information to Congress and to the American people about the Administrations legal justifications and policies with regard to torture and interrogation .
I have long called for full disclosure of the Administrations legal opinions in this area and have been frustrated by continued stonewalling .
This release represents a step in the right direction .
This is only a first step , however .
I remain deeply troubled by the Administrations attempts to justify the use of harsh interrogation techniques and even torture , and I intend to get to the bottom of what this Administrations legal policy has been on this issue , and what it is today .
One of the documents you provided this week , per your unclassified cover letter , is a classified March 13 , 2003 , Memorandum for William J. Haynes , General Counsel , Department of Defense , from John C. Yoo , Deputy Assistant Attorney General , Office of Legal Counsel .
This memorandum should also be provided in non-classified form as completely as possible consistent with national security requirements .
To the extent possible , this document should become part of a frank and public discussion on these crucial issues .
Further , the Committee does not yet have a complete picture of the Administrations historic position on the legal basis and standards for detention , transfer , and interrogation in connection with counter - terrorism efforts .
It is important that you share with the Senate Judiciary Committee all other legal opinions on these issues from the Office of Legal Counsel and elsewhere in the Department of Justice and the Administration .
Finally , and most importantly , these documents aid our understanding only as to the Administrations policy until the beginning of Attorney General Gonzales tenure in February 2005 .
You have provided to us some documents demonstrating the Administrations expansive and disturbing position on torture and related issues in 2002 and 2003 , as well as documents from 2004 and very early 2005 withdrawing and minimizing those previous positions .
However , we have not yet seen the 2005 memoranda recently reported in the New York Times , which apparently authorize the use by the Central Intelligence Agency of combinations of cruel and extreme interrogation techniques and indicate that enumerated harsh techniques do not constitute cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment of detainees .
These documents fall squarely within the scope of requests that I and other Senators have made , including my November 15 , 2006 , request to Attorney General Gonzales for any and all Department of Justice directives , memoranda , and / or guidance regarding CIA detention and / or interrogation methods . 
I would ask that you promptly respond to the following questions and document requests , many of which I and others have made on numerous previous occasions :
1. Please produce any and all Department of Justice directives , memoranda , and / or guidance , including any and all attachments to such documents , regarding detention and / or interrogation methods by the Central Intelligence Agency , the military , or any other component of the United States government , including but not limited to the two memoranda identified by the New York Times on October 4 , 2007 , as well as the August 2002 Memorandum from the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel to the CIA General Counsel regarding CIA interrogation methods ( the  2nd Bybee memo ) .
2. Please provide a non-classified version of the March 13 , 2003 , Memorandum for William J. Haynes , General Counsel , Department of Defense , from John C. Yoo , Deputy Assistant Attorney General , Office of Legal Counsel , to the extent possible consistent with national security requirements .
3 . Please produce any and all documents produced by the Department of Justice regarding the legality of specific interrogation tactics , and the legal basis for detention and transfer of terrorism suspects , and the applicability of federal criminal prohibitions on torture and abuse .
4 . Please produce any and all Department of Justice documents that interpret , or advise on , the scope of interrogation practices permitted and prohibited by the Detainee Treatment Act or the Military Commissions Act .
5 . Please state which of the documents produced in accordance with the above requests remain in effect and which have been withdrawn , replaced or modified .
Please produce any and all revisions or modifications .
6 . Please produce an index of any and all documents relating to investigations and / or reviews conducted by the Department of Justice into detainee abuse by U.S. military or civilian personnel in Guantanamo Bay , Abu Ghraib prison , or elsewhere .
I look forward to your responses .
Sincerely ,
PATRICK LEAHY
Chairman #

BERLIN : A poll shows a quarter of Germans believe there were at least some positive aspects to Nazi rule - a finding that comes after a popular talk show host was sacked for praising Nazi Germany 's attitude towards motherhood .
Pollsters for the Forsa agency , commissioned by the weekly magazine Stern , asked whether National Socialism also had some " good sides [ such as ] the construction of the highway system , the elimination of unemployment , the low criminal rate [ and ] the encouragement of the family " .
Forsa said 25 per cent of responded " yes " , while 70 per cent said " no " .
The vice - president of Germany 's Central Council of Jews , Dieter Graumann , said the poll should be considered a warning sign .
" The result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " Dr Graumann told the online Netzeitung .

Scientists have built a memory chip that is roughly the size of a white blood cell , about one - 2,000th of an inch on a side .
Although the chip is modest in capacity — with 160,000 bits of information — the bits are crammed together so tightly that it is the densest ever made .
The achievement points to a possible path toward continuing the exponential growth of computing power even after current silicon chip - making technology hits fundamental limits in 10 to 20 years .
The scientists , led by James R. Heath of the California Institute of Technology and J. Fraser Stoddart of the University of California , Los Angeles , will report their findings today in the journal Nature .
As far back as 1999 , Dr. Heath and Dr. Stoddart reported on aspects of their work , which included specially designed molecular switches and a novel technique for making ultrathin wires .
The new work pulls the components into an integrated circuit .
“ Our goal always was to develop a manufacturing technique that works at the molecular scale , ” said Dr. Heath , a professor of chemistry .
“ It ’s a scientific demonstration , but it ’s a sort of a stake in the ground . ”

OCTOBER 5-- When the New York Yankees check into hotels on the road , stars like Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez register under phony names so not to be bothered by groupies , autograph seekers , and assorted lunatics .
For instance , when the Bronx Bombers played the Seattle Mariners in late - 2005 , the club stayed at the swanky Fairmont Olympic Hotel , where many players checked in using their phony handles , according to a $ 47,905.85 invoice sent to the club .
In a story this week in The Village Voice , reporter Neil deMause matched aliases with some actual Yankees by comparing the invoice with a separate key that he examined while sifting through documents submitted by the team to New York City 's Department of Parks & Recreation , which oversees the club 's Yankee Stadium lease .
Here 's a Who 's Who from the 2005 squad : Johnny Drama ( Jeter ) ; Simon Phoenix ( Mike Mussina ) ; Bruce Almighty ( Don Mattingly ) ; Ricky Ricardo ( Jorge Posada ) ; Joe Saturday ( Hideki Matsui ) ; Sam Adams ( Randy Johnson ) ; Richard Long ( Bernie Williams ) ; Turd Ferguson ( Jaret Wright ) ; and Austin Powers ( Ruben Sierra ) .
We 're not sure why outfielder Matt Lawton used the ' Eleven Fifty ' alias , but Luis Sojo apparently went by ' Harry Pelotas ' because the fake surname translates to ' balls ' in Spanish .
As for the true identities of Johnny Blaze , Ray Charles , Davey Crockett , Jack Daniels , Payne N. Deneck , Fyfe , Bo Jackson , Bruce Lee , Leon , Ghost Ryder , Charlie Wattsizname , and Randy White , well , that 's a mystery .
But we 're pretty sure that ' Joe Russo ' is manager Joe Torre and that ' Alex Emanuel ' is Alex Rodriguez , who appears to use his actual middle name as his phony surname .

As officials leave the Bush administration , there is no shortage of criticism of this White House : Disenchanted hawks are writing that Mr. Bush has abandoned the certainties of the first term and taking too soft a line on North Korea and Iran ; from the other side of the political spectrum , former officials are telling tales about how the administration bent rules on torture or domestic spying .
But Mr. Greenspan , now 81 , is in a different class , by dint of his fame , his economic authority , and his service across party lines .
His critiques are likely to have more resonance among Mr. Bush ’s base .
His book was provided to The New York Times by his publisher , Penguin Press , under an agreement that nothing would be reported until its publication date , on Monday .
But The Wall Street Journal , saying it had purchased a copy from a retailer , published excerpts on its Web site on Friday night , freeing other news organizations to do the same .
Much of the book concerns his reflections on markets , globalization , and the media ’s fascination with the thickness of his briefcase on the way to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets interest rates .
He praises President Bush for letting the Federal Reserve stay independent of political pressure , saying he was scrupulous in not trying to interfere with monetary policy — which he contrasts sharply with the pressure exerted by his father , George H. W. Bush , in the early 1990s .
For years the first President Bush has blamed Mr. Greenspan for contributing to his defeat in 1992 by failing to prevent a recession by cutting interest rates .
Of the presidents he worked with , Mr. Greenspan reserves his highest praise for Bill Clinton , whom he described in the interview as a sponge for economic data who maintained “ a consistent , disciplined focus on long - term economic growth . ”
It was a presidency marred by the Monica Lewinsky scandal , he writes , but he fondly describes his alliance with two of Mr. Clinton ’s Treasury secretaries , Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers , in battling financial crises in Latin America and then Asia .
Senate preparing to fold on telecom immunity : reports Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 11 , 2007

Print This Email This
This week 's much touted rebuke to immunity - seeking telecommunications companies may be scrapped as Senate Democrats are appearing ever more ready to accede to President Bush 's demands .
Reports are emerging that the Senate is preparing to introduce a foreign surveillance law update that would shield telecommunications companies from litigation or prosecution over their assistance in the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program instituted after Sept. 11 .
Based on a tip from the ACLU , Firedoglake reported a draft proposal being quietly circulated in the Senate " does contain legal immunity / amnesty for the telecom companies " that would include any of its actions over the last six years .
President Bush vowed Wednesday not to sign a bill that does n't spare prosecution for the telecommunications industry , and House Democratic leaders have indicated they may grant immunity if Bush 's administration agrees to detail the companies ' involvement in the wiretapping program .
The House moved its surveillance law update out of committee last week , and the Senate has not yet announced when its bill will drop .
A spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday .
The Bush administration pushed for telecom immunity to be included in a six - month update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , but Democrats managed to strip that provision from the bill .
Now civil libertarians and privacy advocates are urging Democrats to continue to stand up to the administration 's demands .
" If they didnt do anything wrong , why should they get retroactive immunity ? " asks Christy Hardin Smith at Firedoglake .
" And , worse , if it is likely that they broke laws , why on earth would the Senate just hand lawbreakers retroactive immunity before fact - finding on potential criminal conduct was even completed ?!?
That makes no logical or ethical sense . "
Salon columnist Glenn Greenwald , who also has been closely following the FISA debate , criticizes Washington columnists and pundits for agreeing with Bush administration claims about the law .
" If one actually thinks about , from scratch , what is being considered with this FISA law , it really is extraordinary .
The very idea that we ought to allow the government new powers to eavesdrop on our calls and emails without warrants -- particularly since we know that they have been breaking the law for years to do just that -- is unfathomable , " Greenwald writes .
" And even more unfathomable is the idea that the Congress would pass a law that has no purpose other than to protect from all legal consequences the largest and most powerful corporations in the event that they are found to have broken our nation 's surveillance and privacy laws ..
What possible justification is there for any of that ?
Those twin prongs simultaneously eviscerate the rule of law , equality under the law , and the core Fourth Amendment protections the Founders guaranteed . "
The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups are encouraging their members to lobby Congress against telecom immunity .
Another focus has been the House proposal 's authorization of " basket warrants " aimed at foreign suspects that could ensnare untold numbers of Americans ' calls and e-mails abroad .
Basket warrants were included in the House provision , and progressive lawmakers are deciding how hard to push to have that aspect of the law eliminated , TPM Election Central reported .
Calls to House progressive caucus members were not immediately returned .
The ACLU called the basket warrants " the modern - day equivalent of allowing government agents to sit in our living rooms , recording our personal conversations . "
For the first time since news of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal broke three years ago , an officer faces a court - martial for abuse of prisoners .
Lt. Col. Steven L. Jordan 's case may shed light on whether the grave mistreatment of detainees at the Baghdad facility , documented by a series of gruesome photographs , was an anomaly confined to a group of ill - trained soldiers or if it represented a policy that was driven from the top .
Within the first minutes of Monday 's court proceeding , two key charges against Colonel Jordan – lying under oath and making false statements – were dropped due to a legal technicality .
The dismissal of these charges shaved seven years off Jordan 's potential jail sentence .
The most serious charges , that he abused detainees , threatened them with dogs , demanded that they pose in humiliating positions while naked , and failed to train and supervise soldiers at the prison remain .
If convicted , he can face up to 8 - 1/ 2 years in prison , reports The Baltimore Sun .
The court - martial , which opened yesterday in hushed tones inside a low brick building at Fort Meade , Maryland , is expected to last several weeks .
The prosecution has listed 17 witnesses it plans to call to detail the charges against Jordan , a heavyset man who sat stolidly at the defense table .
Prosecutors also agreed yesterday to narrow one set of charges against Jordan , that he abused Iraqi detainees in a pattern of violations over a three - month period in the fall of 2003 .
Instead , they specified that the alleged abuse took place on one occasion , Nov. 24 .
Jordan , a reservist and the only officer to face a court - martial for the Abu Ghraib incident , has alleged that he is being made into a " scapegoat , " reports The Washington Post .
Initially charged on 12 separate counts , eight of the charges against Jordan have already been dismissed .
Additionally , prosecutors have long recommended that Jordan face administrative action for his role , rather than a trial .
Jordan said in a recent interview with The Washington Post that he believes he is a scapegoat because authorities want an officer to go to trial as a final chapter in the Abu Ghraib scandal , even though a more senior officer who admitted approving the use of dogs , Col. Thomas M. Pappas , received only a reprimand and a fine .
Jordan , 51 , is the last soldier to face charges related to the Abu Ghraib abuses and the only officer to go to court - martial for alleged crimes there .
A jury panel of nine Army colonels and one brigadier general is expected to hear opening statements in the case today , and yesterday each member told the court -- under questioning by Capt .
Samuel Spitzberg , one of Jordan 's defense attorneys -- that they would not use Jordan 's trial as " a referendum on Abu Ghraib . "
During the jury selection process , the Australian digital news service NEWS.
com.au reports that the defense attorneys made a point of ensuring that potential jurors would not be inclined to pass political judgment on the case , but rather would focus on solely the facts .
" Do you believe there is a difference between wrong and illegal , " [ Jordan 's lawyer Captain Samuel Spitzberg ] asked [ potential jurors ] .
For his part , Jordan contends that he is innocent .
Prior to his deployment at Abu Ghraib in 2003 , he had no experience in overseeing a detention facility or carrying out interrogations .
In a report of the abuse at Abu Ghraib , Jordan was described as focused on improving the day - to - day life of his subordinates and " ill - prepared to run the prison , and as a result was ' little involved in the interrogation operations , ' " reports The Times , a London - based daily .
His title of " director " and precise responsibilities were never formally confirmed and a military investigation into the scandal said his commanders made a " critical error " in not replacing him within weeks of being given the job .
Instead , Colonel Jordan , who was sent to Abu Ghraib three days after arriving in Iraq , spent his time trying to improve the lives of his personnel , who were living in squalid conditions and coming under almost daily mortar attacks without the proper body armour .
The Colonel was hit by shrapnel three days after arriving at the prison during an attack that killed two other men .
Already , 11 soldiers have been convicted of abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib , reports the British Broadcasting Corp .
Notably , Pvt. Lynndie England and Spc. Charles Graner Jr. , who were both prominently featured in the abuse photos leaked to the media , were sentenced to three and 10 years in prison , respectively .
The prison commander in Iraq at the time , Janis Karpinski , faced administrative action and was demoted from the rank of general but faced no criminal charges .
The BBC's Jamie Coomarasamy in Washington says that whatever the verdict in Lt - Col Jordan 's trial , many will continue to believe that there are those far higher up the military and civilian chain of command who should answer for an episode that did such damage to the image of the US military .
Meanwhile , the American Psychological Association has adopted a new resolution that lists specific interrogation techniques that it denounces .
The resolution comes months after it was revealed that psychologists had helped craft aggressive interrogation tactics after the Sept. 11 attacks for use by the military and intelligence agencies , reports Salon.com .
The APA has condemned torture in the past .
But this year the organization was responding , in part , to intense internal pressure from some members who were angered by the Bush administration 's permissive interpretation of prohibitions on abuse .
The new resolution aims to be more precise and detailed , articulating " an absolute prohibition for psychologists against direct or indirect participation " in brutal interrogation methods , from mock executions to waterboarding .
" The APA came in line with the minimum of its responsibilities by condemning , in certain circumstances , the most egregious forms of torture being committed in our name , " said Steven Reisner , a psychologist who has been pressing the organization to withdraw from detainee interrogations .
MOSCOW , Sept 12 , 2007 — President Vladimir V. Putin accepted the resignation of Russia ’s prime minister on Wednesday and nominated Viktor A. Zubkov , the low profile head of a financial crimes agency , to assume the post .
The moves signaled the beginning of an internal Kremlin rearrangement ahead of Parliamentary elections in the late fall and Mr. Putin ’s expected transfer of presidential power next year .
But an aura of mystery filled the day .
Kremlin watchers and diplomats said they were perplexed by what Mr. Putin ’s pick meant for the pressing question of who might succeed him if he steps down next spring at the end of his second term , as he has said repeatedly he would , and as is required under Russia ’s constitution .
The instant rise to prominence of the unheralded Mr. Zubkov , a confidante of Mr. Putin , added a new element of suspense for the two Russian officials long regarded as the principal presidential contenders : First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei B. Ivanov and First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry A. Medvedev .
Neither of the men was elevated by the shifts , nor was one pushed aside .
In principle Russia holds elections by popular vote , including those for president .
In practice , though , the ballots are carefully managed by the Kremlin , and are won handily by sanctioned candidates who receive support from the government and state - controlled news media .
Not only are certain Apple stores voiding the warranty on hacked and unlocked iPhones , Apple 's just released a statement saying the unlock process coupled with a future iPhone update may make your phones a useless brick .
Apple " strongly discourages users from installing unauthorized unlocking programs , " because the " permanent inability to use an iPhone due to installing unlocking software is not covered under the iPhone 's warranty . "
Our advice to users : wait until Firmware version 1.1 is out later this week before you decide to unlock your iPhone .
If you 've already unlocked your phone , do n't update until you know it 's safe .
Full release after the jump .

But first , the bricking .
Was this done on purpose ?
Lam does n't think so .
Jacqui at Ars believes that the firmware was completed weeks ago , and the bricking is unintentional .
It does n't matter what the intent was :
They did n't go out of their way to stop it , which is almost as uncool .
Principles aside , this situation wo n't affect lots of us , since the majority of us do n't have a reason to unlock .
But bricking it entirely is something they should work really really hard to avoid , even if it costs them some revenue share from AT&T .
My main concern is for the safe development of Apps that so far have done nothing but made the iPhone better .

" Users who make unauthorized modifications to the software on their iPhone violate their iPhone software license agreement and void their warranty . "
That photo above is what Lam's iPhone looks like now .
Does this mean Lam 's warranty is in the shitter ?
Because he did n't unlock my iPhone and nothing he did can't be fixed with a system restore .
Going after the hacks , which have changed the iPhone from a good product to a great phone ?
That 's idiotic .
There is a good side to all this , provided we can get Apple to make firmware that does n't brick iPhones .
The press release also mentions the feature updates via the firmware , like the Wi-Fi Music store .
This is historically how the PSP firmware updates were made as " must haves " for owners .
Unlocking an iPhone is n't nearly as appealing if it means you do n't get the benefit of new features .
So , if anything , the unlocking cat and mouse game should push Apple to make a lot more innovation , and quicker .
A good thing , when you consider that the best iPhone innovations in the last few months are not the web apps or official Apple updates , but the third party hacks .
Apple has discovered that many of the unauthorized iPhone unlocking programs available on the Internet cause irreparable damage to the iPhone 's software , which will likely result in the modified iPhone becoming permanently inoperable when a future Apple - supplied iPhone software update is installed .
Apple plans to release the next iPhone software update , containing many new features including the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store ( www.itunes.com), later this week .
Apple strongly discourages users from installing unauthorized unlocking programs on their iPhones .
Users who make unauthorized modifications to the software on their iPhone violate their iPhone software license agreement and void their warranty .
The permanent inability to use an iPhone due to installing unlocking software is not covered under the iPhone 's warranty .

Two miners have been diagnosed with the fast - spreading Ebola - like haemorrhagic fever , close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo .
One of them has died and about 40 other people working at Kitaka gold mine have been quarantined , officials say .
Marburg has a high fatality rate .
The last reported outbreak was in Angola in 2005 when some 300 people died .
' Unsanitary '
The health ministry has urged local people to report any suspicious cases .
Gold mines in DR Congo have been struck by Marburg in the past
Incubation takes up to 10 days and although the last suspected case was reported 15 days ago , there is still a risk that the disease could re-emerge .
" The last case needs to have been seen 21 days ago before we can actually say we 've contained it , " Sam Okware of Uganda 's taskforce on haemorrhagic fevers told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
Gold miners in DR Congo have been struck by the disease in the past .
Dr Okware says it is not exactly known what causes Marburg , although birds and monkeys are suspected vectors .
Rats and bats also reportedly spread the disease to humans .
" My own impression is that the source of the infection is in the mine itself - because when we went there to check , we found almost 5 m birds in the mine and the situation was quite unsanitary , " he said .
Early symptoms of Marburg are diarrhoea , stomach pains , nausea and vomiting , which give way to bleeding .
It is spread by the transfer of blood or other bodily fluids .
There is no cure .
Infected patients need to be kept in isolation so as to prevent the spread of the virus .
Mr. Bush , you cost lives everywhere you show up .
I am tired and cranky .
I 'm sick literally from the smoke .
I 've been told to evacuate a couple of times as have my horses .
I have n't had much sleep which means my anger is much like when I PMS and I get really flat bitchy when I PMS .
I BLAME YOU for NO RESOURCES here to fight the fire .
Your buddy Arnold makes it sound like all is well cuz we are getting tankers ... WOW 6 TANKERS for 13 fires in SAN DIEGO COUNTY ALONE ?
Over 300,000 acres ON FIRE OUT OF CONTROL .. may I please ask you what the FUCK 6 tankers are going to do ?
Our National Guard and our resources are IN IRAQ ... WHY ?
Do they need them more then MY STATE ?
You are pathetic Mr. Bush , as are your advisors , as are all the politicians on Capital Hill .
None of you live in reality , NONE OF YOU .
I am going to sign off now , you see , I am only ONE PERSON , but I have been taught about the POWER OF ONE ( the GOOD POWER OF ONE , not EVIL LIKE YOU ) and I need to get back out and breath in more shit air and try to save a horse or two and maybe help another human .
I know you WON'T LISTEN and will come here anyway , as will the politicians who want to grandstand .
I only wish the MILLIONS spent on these photo - op trips would be spent to BRING IN FUCKING RESOURCES .
Oh , and Mr. Bush , if you and Laura and your cronies have time tomorrow ... could you stop by Del Mar Fairgrounds and help clean 2400 stalls ?
Bring boots ... oh that 's right , you are use to wading through shit .
Sincerely ,
Barbara

Dear Kos Community ,
It was a tiring day .
Thank you for recommending this and thank you for being an amazing group of individuals .
Thanks to all keeping the " MotherShip " going ... I can only pray that continues for the rest of the week , the tiredless commitment you 've all made to do this is humbling me .
To all of you in the fire area .. be safe , please .
Tomorrow is another day , we will wake up and swear at Bush 's arrival , but that too shall pass .
We will dust off our ashy bodies and rinse out our swollen eyes , cough up a lung from all we 've breathed and go forward .
My horse got moved today and I 'm breathing again .
My Mom in Oceanside is doing well .
Tomorrow I will decide what to do .
I 'll let you all know .
THANK YOU ... each and everyone ... and Kos , thank YOU for having this blog for all of us .
Peace .

The past several years have seen a number of initiatives intended to leverage the Internet to provide greater access to scientific literature .
One such effort comes from the National Institutes of Health , which has encouraged researchers to place copies of their published works at PubMed Central , and has worked with publishers to facilitate this process while avoiding copyright issues .
Given the slow progress of PubMed Central , Congress has recently expressed interest in making this process mandatory .
This has raised red flags with a number of publishing concerns , but the tactics used by the publishers to block such bills are raising enough ethical issues that they may create a backlash .
Congressional action on the matter is based on the simple logic that the results of publicly funded research should be accessible by the public that 's paid for it .
A bill , the Federal Research Public Access Act , was introduced in 2006 with the intention of ensuring this access .
It would expand the scope beyond the biological research funded by the NIH to include any federal agency that funds over $ 100 million in research .
Journals could continue to attract subscriptions by retaining exclusive access to content for six months following publication ; the bill places the burden of hosting the material on the agency supplying the funding .
It also specifically excludes material that has not been subject to peer review .
Overall , it appears to strike a reasonable balance among a number of competing needs .
Many publishers , however , did not view these requirements as reasonable .
Back in January , Nature broke the news that the Association of American Publishers ( AAP ) had hired an aggressive public relations consultant to keep this bill and any future versions of it from ever becoming laws .
Best known for having led Exxon - Mobil 's attacks on Greenpeace , the consultant recommended a course of action that framed the measure as an attack on peer review itself and the government hosting of content as an invitation to government censorship .
Peter Suber , who tracks open access news , notes an article ( subscription ) in the Chronicle of Higher Education that indicates the publishers have put some of these ideas into action by funding an organization called PRISM , the Partnership for Research Integrity in Science & Medicine .
The site , which has stock photos of serious people in lab coats ( meant to suggest the involvement of the research community ) , implements a number of the PR suggestions originally reported in Nature .
These include the suggestions that the effort is an attack on peer review itself and that government - sponsored hosting is an invitation to censorship and manipulation .
These hyperbolic claims , however , may be prompting a lot of discomfort among the scientific publishing community , which contains a number of small academic presses in addition to the large commercial houses .
The accurate information provided to Nature suggested that not everyone was happy with the initial ideas .
With PRISM now live , Suber has published an open letter from the executive director of the Rockefeller University Press in which the AAP is asked to add a disclaimer to the PRISM web site .
The letter indicates that the views expressed at PRISM do not reflect those of all AAP members , and lists five ways in which the site spins or distorts the truth .
In short , if PRISM is any indication , the commercial publishers have overplayed their hand .
By grossly distorting the intent and likely result of potential Congressional action , they have both discredited any reasonable arguments they had and alienated some of those who might otherwise be their allies .
That said , Congress has been known to act based on discredited arguments in the past , so the publishers ' effort might succeed despite its shortcomings .

The most common refrain from the war - crazed Clinton / Bush oligarchy these days is ( as Hillary Clinton most recently expressed it )
“ We can not take any option off the table in sending a clear message to Iran that they will not be permitted to acquire nuclear weapons . ”
No options off the table .
Truly ?
If eviscerating her daughter in public would send a clear message to Iran — and surely it would send a blazing telegram of deadly seriousness — would she consider that to be an option on the table ?
I always wonder about the minds of people who can make this sort of pronouncement .
If destroying an entire city by bombing — and make no mistake about it , this is what she and others are referring to in this latest round of bomb - rattling — is an option to send a message , then would n't simply murdering her own daughter be an improvement ?
After all , think of the lives saved !
As for messages — what could possibly send a stronger message to the world that a person is serious ( or crazy , which in the political world comes to the same thing ) than that she would willingly sacrifice her own child for peace ?
There 's even biblical precedent for such an option .
But mercifully for Chelsea , there do seem to be some lines that even such a monster who would contemplate bombing whole cities to dust would not cross , idiotic pronouncements to the contrary notwithstanding .
And , really , I am happy for Chelsea .
I bear her no ill will , and certainly do not wish her dead at her mother 's hands .
I only wish the common folk in Iran were so lucky .
But here 's the thing :
Bombs designed to flatten large areas which cannot be separated from residential areas — and no large industrial area can be — should be off the table .
Nukes , conventionals , whatever .
Bombing civilians is wrong .
Period .
It needs to be taken off the table .
The U.S. government 's thousands of such murderous weapons of mass destruction do not make Americans any safer ; quite the contrary !
And history proves that some madman will always come along and use such weapons to slaughter innocents — as the poor folks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki found on the dawn of the nuclear age .
Is it just me , or is true that there really is less talk of disarmament now than there was during the hottest days of the so - called Cold War ?
If no option is truly off the table , the presidential candidates should be rethinking the disarmament option .
Imagine the world 's utter astonishment if an American president or candidate for the presidency stood up and said loudly and clearly " Slaughtering innocents is off the table as an option as of now , " and proceeded to dismantle the stockpiles of bombs and other weapons targeted primarily at civilians and their property .
That would be a message the world would hear with shock and awe .
The good kind .

General Motors Shoots Foot With Rush Limbaugh Green Ad
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
File this one under unbelievable .
Just when you think General Motors has more than two brain cells rubbing together on working to improve America ’s impression of fuel efficiency in auto - making , someone had the clever idea to hire right - wing radio host Rush Limbaugh to tout their green initiatives .
This is the same guy that revels in owning a Maybach because it has shitty mileage , believes global warming is bogus , and calls environmentalists “ wackos ” .
It gets better .
Not only does Limbaugh praise GM ’s commitment to the environment , but he also heaps praise on his Escalade and Suburban SUVs .
Now hey , obviously this is a guy that truly enjoys those vehicles — but we just find it incredibly odd that GM would choose to have someone represent them that could not truly care less about the direction they ’re trying to head in .
Save the planet ?
Make America more efficient and sustainable ?
The guy has been battling environmentalism since the early 90s — he could n’t give a rat ’s ass .
Truly disappointing .
Even the Spice Girls would have been a better choice .
You can listen to the ad here .

Prior to the so - called Church Committee , the President 's Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States was formed by President Gerald Ford .
Headed by Vice - President Nelson Rockefeller , this body came to be known as the Rockefeller Commission .
The Rockefeller Commission issued a single report in 1975 , which delineated some CIA abuses including mail opening and surveillance of domestic dissident groups .
It also conducted a narrow study of issues relating to the JFK assassination , specifically the backward head snap as seen in the Zapruder film ( first shown publicly in 1975 ) , and the possible presence of E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis in Dallas .
The Rockefeller Report is seen by many as a " whitewash , " and was certainly superceded by the Church Committee 's work in scope and depth .
The files of the Rockefeller Commission were reviewed by the Church Committee , and many of them are included as part of the roughly 50,000 pages of declassified Church Committee documents now publicly available at the National Archives .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese lottery ticket seller has been jailed for life for fraud for taking advantage of a system flaw to cash 28 million yuan ( $ 3.76 million ) in tickets illegally , state media said Tuesday .
Zhao Liqun discovered the flaw in the Welfare Lottery “ 3D ” system in 2005 that let a person buy tickets with the right numbers within five minutes of their being announced , sources at the Intermediate People ’s Court in Anshan , northeastern Heilongjiang province , said .
Zhao , 36 , who ran three lottery stalls in Anshan , “ bought ” the announced numbers many times over .
“ He asked his neighbors and friends to cash the tickets at the Welfare Lottery Center and to bring back the money , ” Xinhua quoted the court sources as saying .
The lottery center found the prizes were illegally claimed and police arrested Zhao in January .
The court jailed him for life for fraud and confiscated all his property .
We are always on the lookout for “ green ” stories so were pleased when a friend forwarded a link to Skysails , a German based company looking to augment tradition ship propulsion systems with kites .
SkySails tells us :
SkySails is now offering a wind propulsion system based on large towing kites , which , for the first time , meets the requirements of shipping companies .
By using the SkySails - System , a ship ‘s fuel costs can be reduced by 10 - 35 % on annual average , depending on wind conditions .
Under optimal wind conditions , fuel consumption can temporarily be reduced by up to 50 % .
Even on a small , 87 metre cargo ship , savings of up to 280,000 euros can be made annually .
They are not the only company trying to harness the power of wind to propel ship , San Francisco base KiteShip.com a maker of kites for sailboats , is also trying expand into the commercial shipping industry .
“ KiteShip is also working on marine applications as diverse as towing oil rigs and other large marine structures , diverting icebergs from oil platforms in high latitudes and in autonomous robot towing of relatively safe cargo such as bagged water , liquid fructose and the like . ”
Both companies have tested the technology with ( according to them ) success .

Here ’s a video showing how the system works ;
Mr. Bush complained that White House officials were not included in the discussions .
“ After going alone and going nowhere , Congress should instead work with the administration on a bill that puts poor children first , ” Mr. Bush said Tuesday .
States , unsure of federal money , are drafting contingency plans in case it runs short .
Officials in charge of the child health program in California said Tuesday that they were adopting rules to allow the state to create a waiting list and to remove some of the 1.1 million children already on the rolls .
“ The stalemate in Washington is having a real impact on children here , ” said Lesley S. Cummings , executive director of the agency that runs the child health program in California .
“ Given continued uncertainty , we will have to start dropping children from the program — 64,000 a month , starting in January — to save money .
This is getting less and less hypothetical . ”
According to the new study , from the Congressional Research Service , the nine states that will run out of money by March are Alaska , Georgia , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Jersey and Rhode Island .
The federal budget for the program is $ 5 billion for the current fiscal year , which began Oct.
1 . But states , by their own estimates , expect to spend $ 7.6 billion .
To continue coverage for people now enrolled in the 21 states would require an extra $ 1.6 billion just for the current fiscal year , the study said .
Perhaps as long as 5,000 years ago , a group of sailors found skulls belonging to a race of hideous giants whom the ancient Greeks named cyclops .
Dwelling in their mythical land , entrusting the fate of their crops to their evil gods and devouring any humans they could find , these creatures terrified generations of Europeans .
Today , relatives of these monsters can still be found — roaming the African savannas or the Indian jungles , or even eating peanuts from the hands of small children in city zoos .
In fact , the ancient Greek sailors found elephant skulls .
What they mistook for single eye sockets were the nasal openings for the elephants ' trunks .
Over the centuries , our understanding of mammals , both living and extinct , has improved considerably .
Just the same , scientists have made some mistakes .

Unicorn " sightings " occurred throughout the world , but the mythical creature was n't the same in each description .
Not all unicorns resembled white horses with ivory horns .
The Chinese unicorn was cow - shaped and scaly , or horse - shaped but with a dragon 's head .
The Arabian version looked like a rhinoceros but with a more elaborate horn .
Some unicorns looked like lions , some were as big as mountains , some were as small as dogs .
Some sported turtle shells .
Some had a combination of hooves and chicken feet .
Gifted with good taste , some ate only sugarcane .
This picture shows just three variations — fairly pedestrian versions compared to their exotic cousins .

From the Metropolitan Museum of Art : " Stamp seals were used in antiquity as marks of ownership and badges of status .
In the large urban centers of the Harappan civilization , hundreds of square - shaped stamp seals were found in excavations .
They are engraved with images of wild or domestic animals , humans , fantastic creatures , and possibly divinities .
The bull is the most popular animal motif on the Indus Valley glyptic art .
In this example , the animal is rendered in the typical strict profile , standing before what might be an altar .
Its shoulder is covered by a decorated quilt or harness in the shape of an upside - down heart pattern .
Most of the square stamp seals have inscriptions along the top edge .
The Indus script , invented around 2600 B.C. , is yet to be fully deciphered . "
Lavers points out that scholars have long debated whether this image — appearing on about 60 percent of the Indus Valley 's seals , according to a 1981 study by archaeologist Shereen Ratnagar — represented some kind of bovine in which one horn hides the other , or a unicorn .
Either way , this often - copied creature might have been the mark of a ruling clan or class , and seals like this have been found throughout the Persian Gulf region .
People in faraway lands would have seen such seals ( or their impressions ) , and probably remembered and talked about them .
Moreover , the seals ' links to prestige might have fired some imaginations .
So even if this bovine creature with what looks like a single horn might not have been meant to represent a unicorn , it might have fueled legends of the beast .

If seals from a great empire could convince the people who saw them that certain creatures were real , bas - reliefs on imperial grounds must have been even more effective .
Visitors to Persepolis , Iran , an ancient capital of the Persian Empire , could feast their eyes on a lion feasting on another animal .
But what was that other animal ?
Perhaps it was just a bull with two horns , one horn hidden neatly behind the other .
Historians have debated whether artistic representations in perfect profile like this one were understood to mean two horns , or whether only one horn was intended .
Either way , some visitors might have come away convinced of the reality of a single - horned creature .

Coryate claimed to see two unicorns in his travels to India .
As astronomer and science historian Owen Gingerich has observed , this woodcut is trimmed , which suggests that the picture was actually copied from an earlier work ( perhaps Conrad Gesner 's ) .
One reason unicorns held such fascination for medieval and Renaissance Europeans was that their horns , called alicorns , were thought to protect their owners from poison .
Europe 's royal families often acquired political power by poisoning their enemies , and some of the upper crust may not have been above testing their concoctions on their own family members .

Unicorn legends may have existed since antiquity , but the most iconic images of the mythical creature arguably date from the Middle Ages , when the unicorn and other real and imagined life forms were all loaded with symbolism .
From the Metropolitan Museum of Art : " The seven individual hangings collectively known as The Unicorn Tapestries , are among the most beautiful and complex works of art from the late Middle Ages that survive .
Luxuriously woven in fine wool and silk with silver and gilded threads , the tapestries vividly depict scenes associated with a hunt for the elusive , magical unicorn .
The The Unicorn Tapestries may have been created as a single image rather than part of a series .
In this instance , the unicorn probably represents the beloved tamed .
He is tethered to a tree and constrained by a fence , but the chain is not secure and the fence is low enough to leap over .
The unicorn could escape if he wished but clearly his confinement is a happy one , to which the ripe , seed - laden pomegranates in the tree — a medieval symbol of fertility and marriage — testify .
The red stains on his flank do not appear to be blood , as there are no visible wounds like those in the hunting series ; rather , they represent juice dripping from the bursting pomegranates above .
Many of the other plants represented here , such as wild orchid , bistort , and thistle , echo this theme of marriage and procreation : they were acclaimed in the Middle Ages as fertility aids for both men and women .
Even the little frog , nestled among the violets at the lower right , was cited by medieval writers for its noisy mating . "
In his book on sea monsters , Nigg explains that terrestrial animals were widely believed to have marine counterparts .
So just as Europeans believed the world 's vast ocean to host the sea cow , sea dog , sea hog and even sea rhino , it was also believed to host the sea unicorn .
Considering many of the objects traded as unicorn horns were actually narwhal tusks , you could say it was a case of accidental accuracy .

Nicknamed the " Siberian unicorn , " the species Elasmotherium sibiricum evolved over 2 million years ago .
Paleontologists had long believed the species went extinct 350,000 years ago , but a recent find of Elasmotherium fossils show that the species persisted until 29,000 years ago , meaning it might have bumped into the occasional Eurasian human .
Since the late 19th century , reconstructions have shown Elasmotherium sibiricum with a horn on its head , based on skull features similar to those of a rhinoceros .
Modern paleontologists have not disputed that facet of Harder 's illustration , but new reconstructions of the Siberian unicorn show an overall body shape resembling a rhino's , too , rather than this vaguely bear - shaped animal .

These narwhal skull illustrations have a minor error in that the furrows run clockwise , which they apparently do n't do in nature .
This small mistake , however , is more than offset by the much bigger mistake the illustration corrects .
The adult males of these marine mammals have ivory tusks extending from the left side of the upper jaw .
These tusks , often sold as alicorns , had long been believed to be unicorn horns .

Exotic Animals as Material Culture in Medieval Europe " by Aleksander Pluskowski in European Journal of Archaeology Image © National Museums Liverpool
Centuries ago , trade relayed Narwhal tusks from Greenland to Europe , and en route , the narwhal tusks apparently transmogrified into unicorn horns , or alicorns .
Some of the coveted alicorns were used by royalty to stave off poison ; a description of a banquet held by Charles the Bold in 1473 listed half a dozen unicorn horns , a couple of them within arm 's length of the duke .
Other narwhal tusks found their way into church collections .
One such tusk , a small snippet of which appears here , might have been used as a processional candlestick .
This supposed unicorn horn is especially charming as it's carved in a pattern that fits nicely with the narwhal tusk 's natural spiral , and the carvings include winsome dragons .
The carving style suggests that it might date to the 12th century .
Documentation about narwhal tusks in church collections is scarce , so modern historians can't be sure that this narwhal tusk was really believed to belong to a unicorn .
Whatever medieval Europeans did or did n't believe about this specimen , it 's easy to see why the traders involved in moving the tusks from northern oceans to Europe advertised the objects as they did .
Poison - foiling alicorns were in demand .
Nobody cared about narwhal tusks .

As 17th - century naturalists came to realize that some so - called unicorn horns were really narwhal tusks , the naturalists might have divided alicorns into a two - tiered system : " false " unicorns from narwhals , and " true " unicorns still believed to come from a semi-mythical terrestrial animal .
Mammoth tusks might have served as the trusty alicorns .
This illustration shows a terrestrial Unicornu Verum ( top ) and a marine Unicornu Marinum ( bottom ) .
While recounting the divisions between true and false unicorns , however , Duffin cautions that the situation was probably complicated , and opinions continued to differ about the identity of truly worthwhile alicorns .

Born in 1599 , Bochart undertook an enormous task : to analyze the nature and history of every animal mentioned in the Bible .
The holy book mentioned the unicorn , and although there are good reasons to think the unicorn was symbolic , Bochart took the references to it literally .
He considered but decided against the rhino and wild ox , and settled on the " reem " or " rim . "
Readings of Near Eastern literature convinced him that there existed a kind of one - horned goat , and he figured that must be the animal he sought .
Centuries later , Odell Shepard commented on the unintended consequences of studying zoology in the library .

As arguments advanced that the poison - defeating alicorn came of sea animals , rumors of amphibious unicorns spread across europe .
In keeping with the confusion , this unicorn has webbed hind feet , and notice all the nearby fish .

Leibniz probably directed Seelander to style his rendering after images appearing in contemporary periodicals .

Early in the 18th century , Valentini authored a massive book about the contents of European curiosity cabinets , presenting a combination of realistic illustrations and lingering fancies .
Daston and Park explain that , in this work , Valentini attempts to distinguish between true and false unicorn horns .
This picture shows mixed progress .
The caption for the traditional unicorn , portrayed in so many tapestries and woodcuts , indicates that it is fictitious .
Valentini includes a narwhal , the actual source for unicorn horns .
By the time this book was published , narwhal tusks had flooded the European market , causing the fabled poison - destroying alicorns to lose some of their mystique .
But the forward progress shown in this picture is offset by a " Unicornu fossile , " likely based on the alleged fossil unicorn assembled by Otto von Guericke in the 17th century , and illustrated in Leibniz 's Protogaea .

Not long after Alciati published his book , the famous naturalist Conrad Gesner published an encyclopedia of four - footed beasts , and the lengthy chapter on the fox not only pictured and described the animal , but enumerated its uses to people , and recounted just about every fox legend ever told .

Olaus Magnus was just one of many naturalists who passed along fox folklore .
This woodcut apparently conveys two 16th - century beliefs about the crafty animal .
Foxes were believed to be tormented by flies and gnats ( chances are , the people who wrote about them were ) .
So , the story was , the fox solved this problem by getting a mouthful of hay and lowering itself into the water , hay still in its mouth .
Once all the bothersome bugs had taken up temporary residence in the hay , the fox would open up its mouth and its multi- legged troubles would drift away .
The fox was also believed able to catch crayfish with its tail .
So this woodcut shows a fox getting rid of one group of arthropods while acquiring another .

At the dawn of the 17th century , when a group of young naturalists near Rome decided to form a scientific academy , they chose as their totem the lynx .
Members of the Lincean Academy may not have believed the legend that the animal could see through rock , but they did believe the lynx to be especially perceptive .
Many Europeans believed the animal had another remarkable ability : peeing a gemstone capable of curing a long list of ills .
Known sometimes as Lyncurium or Lapis Lincis , the lynx stone was really a crystal such as tourmaline or zircon , or a fossil such as belemnite or amber .
Some naturalists said the lynx stone was like amber , which suggests they could identify amber separately .
And not all naturalists believed in the lynx stone 's curative abilities ;
Pliny for one doubted the lore .
But for people who did believe , lynx pee turned to stone was amazing .
Taken in various forms , it was thought to calm pregnant women and children , as well as treat scrofula ( infection of the lymph nodes perhaps caused by bovine tuberculosis ) , gout , jaundice , digestive problems , poisoning , and heavy bleeding from menstruation and / or wounds .
Hildegard von Bingen , an abbess and something of a medieval celebrity , extolled the virtues of this stone , but warned that if it was taken for ills other than chronic stomachache or painful urination , it would stop the heart and shatter the skull .
Some said the lynx stored its coveted gemstone in the back of its throat , which would suggest the animal also knew how to suppress its own gag reflex .

Unlike elephants or giraffes , hedgehogs were familiar to medieval Europeans , and this depiction shows a recognizable animal .
But the behavior shown here is n't an accurate reflection of the animal 's daily activities so much as a small morality tale to the reader .
This hedgehog is gathering grapes , and the animal was said to impale the juicy fruits on its spines then scurry away .
In this sense , the snuffling little animal symbolized the devil who could run off with one 's poorly guarded spiritual truths .

Like dogs , cats were very well known to medieval Europeans , so artists did n't make a lot of mistakes in cat likenesses .
But while cats were domestic animals , there were never fully domesticated .
Like cats today , they often did what they wanted , and manipulated their owners into giving them more of what they wanted .
Europeans ' mixed emotions about cats led to mixed treatment of them .
They were valued for their ability to catch grain - munching mice , but also associated with witchcraft .
While witches were believed to work their evil magic through a multitude of small animals , cats appeared to be their favorites .
Feline habits of toying with their prey before making the kill reminded Christians of the devil 's habit of toying with damned souls .
Better treatment of cats started in the 17th century when aristocrats began keeping them not just as mousers but as pets .
Before that , medieval manuscripts often showed cats doing what they were valued for : catching mice .
This cat is a little bit off — too skinny front legs and an oddly shaped , perhaps stylized , head — but overall gives an accurate picture .
Written descriptions could sometimes do the same .
The Franciscan monk and encyclopedist Bartholomeus Anglicus characterized the domestic cat as " a full lecherous beast in youth " and " a right heavy beast in age and full sleepy . "
Sounds about right .

At the prehistoric settlement known as Akrotiri on the island of Santorini , perhaps the most thoroughly examined structure is the West House .
It contains a miniature frieze playing up Minoan sea power .
Part of the scene apparently intends to portray a north African landscape , but the lack of realism suggests that , even if the artist intended to be taken literally , he or she was working from the second - hand descriptions of others .
The creature 's spots and apparent stalking manner suggest it was some sort of feline .

The Greek hero Heracles and Trojan princess Hesione jointly took on the Monster of Troy , a fearsome beast that appeared along the coast near Sigeum .
The story was well known when Homer told it sometime around the eighth century BC .
Around 550 BC , an unknown artist painted the scene on this vase , but with a twist .
In a vase that otherwise provides realistic depictions of horses , geese , felines and people — although griffins put in appearances , too — the Monster of Troy looks weird .
In fact , it looks like a skull , but not one belonging to any known animal .
Folklorist Adrienne Mayor has argued that the skull might have been inspired by a real fossil , perhaps a prehistoric whale or giraffe .
The bony eye ring might have been inspired by bird remains , from either living or extinct species .
If so , then the artist might have rightly recognized a skull but wrongly attributed it to a contemporary monster .

A massive steppe that stretched from the northern shores of the Black Sea , past the Caspian Sea , to the mountains around the Taklimakan Desert , Scythia was populated during Antiquity by an equestrian society , which Herodotus described in his Histories .
Archaeological finds have shed light on this ancient society , but even during the Baroque period in which Caspar Schott worked , Scythia was likely characterized simply as an exotic , far - off land with weird people and animals .
No wonder a Scythian wolf might look feline .

Although its head is a little small , this armadillo is pretty recognizable .
What 's more intriguing about this depiction is the explanation for the animal 's strange appearance .
Jesuit scholar Kircher devoted considerable time and energy to discussing the logistics of Noah 's Ark , but by the time Kircher composed his various works , the discovery of the New World had presented a serious problem .
So many previously unknown creatures threatened to sink Noah 's boat .
Kircher found a few workarounds : spontaneous generation for lowly creatures like bugs , adaptation for creatures ending up in strange environments , and hybrids .
The armadillo , Kircher supposed , was a cross between turtle and a porcupine or hedgehog .

Kircher fretted over growing skepticism about biblical narratives , including understandable doubts about whether Noah's Ark could have carried all the animals needed to repopulate the world .
Kircher delved into the floorplan of the ark , even leaving room for chickens to feed the carnivores .
But he also maintained that some species were not passengers on the ark ; instead , they were hybrids .
Whether Kircher believed this quadruped with a long horn on its snout to be one of those hybrids is hard to say .

Besides the well - known example of the mule , he offered : Tragelaphus or Hirocervus from a goat and stag , Hippelaphus or Equicervus from a horse and stag , leopard from a lion and panther , Cameleopardalis ( giraffe ) from a camel and panther , Hippardium from a horse and panther , marmot from a squirrel and marten , Leocrocuta from a lion and hyena , Allopecopithicum from a fox and monkey ( whose happy pairing frankly beggars belief ) , and the Chiurcha whose pedigree was fuzzy .

In the mid-17th century , the famed printer Matthäus Merian the Elder published a five - volume natural history of animals by the physician Joannes Jonstonus ( John Jonston ) .
The book copied illustrations by other naturalists , and repeated hearsay about the serpents , dragons and human - headed beasts pictured .
Merian the Elder 's daughter , Maria Sibylla Merian , later copied some of the illustrations to hone her own artistic skills .
Maria — who would go on to become a printer in her own right , and a naturalist of considerable ability — would resolve to paint plants and animals " from life , " and would travel to the jungles of Surinam to study caterpillars .
Her studiousness would mark a significant departure from the naturalist whose work her father published .
The creatures shown here , from a later Jonstonus work published in England , include a human - faced " Lea Capra " ( top ) , and a leopard - spotted , horned , sweet - faced " Camelo Pardalis " ( bottom ) .

The label for this animal reads " Leucurcuta , " likely an alternate spelling of " Leucrota . "
The leucrota figured in bestiaries many years before it appeared in Jonstonus 's book , and was easy to identify by its mouth .
You could say this creature could smile from ear to ear because its mouth was said to span that distance all the time anyway .
But the leucrota would n't flash you a toothy smile ; in the place of teeth , it was said to sport a plate of bone .
In fairness to Jonstonus , many of the illustrations in his natural history book were much closer to reality than this one ; this illustration appears right above a picture of a recognizable lion .
Jonstonus worked with the publishing house of Matthäus Merian the Elder and Matthäus Merian the Younger — father and elder brother to the pioneering entomologist and illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian .
In the early 18th century , she would publish her own books of and set a new standard for accuracy based on first - hand observation .

If the weather can rain cats and dogs , it can probably also rain rats .
At least this depiction of rodents raining down upon a horrified farmer suggests the possibility .
Believe it or not , powerful winds in a hurricane or tornado can lift animals ( as well as trees and houses ) off the ground and drop them elsewhere .
Tornadoes forming over water may be able to loft fish into the air , simply to be deposited elsewhere later .
Where a tornado would find so many rats , however , is hard to say .
A much more plausible explanation for a 17th - century rat storm probably includes exaggeration if not fabrication .

The skeleton that would be formally described as Megatherium turned up in pieces along Argentina 's River Luján in 1787 .
The prehistoric jigsaw puzzle was soon relayed to the Royal Cabinet of Natural History in Madrid , where Juan Bautista Bru began overseeing its assembly in 1788 .
This was decades before any formal description of a recognized dinosaur , and although much more recent than dinosaurs , this elephant - sized ground sloth posed the same problems :
It was big , weird , and extinct .
Pieces of it seemed to belong to different species , but the fossil diggers only found one skull and four legs , indicating it really was a single individual .
Some naturalists puzzled over whether the animal was terrestrial , aquatic or amphibious .
And Bru was no naturalist .
Historian Juan Pimentel recounts the materials Bru used in mounting the skeleton : " wire , polish , pitch , glue , white powder , cork , a hand saw , and files . "
After explaining that Bru employed a carpenter and a locksmith to help mount the skeleton , Pimentel continues , " Our bold taxidermist sawed , filed , and cut various bones , filled many others with cork , placed several of them in the wrong place , added others that did not even exist , and in general altered the anatomy of the big vertebrate to such an extent that the gave it an incorrect posture . "
This picture shows nowhere near the worst of Bru's work .
By the time he made this sketch in 1796 , the famous French naturalist Georges Cuvier had learned of the strange skeleton , and published his own analysis of it .
In his own analysis , Cuvier corrected some of Bru's more egregious blunders , including confusing the animal 's front and rear legs .
Cuvier 's interpretation of the animal almost certainly influenced this later sketch by Bru .
Even so , Bru appended to the Megatherium an unmerited mule 's tail .

Published in : Memoir on the Megatherium , or Giant Ground - Sloth of America
Now appears in : Darwin's Fossils by Adrian Lister
Comparative anatomists made incremental improvements to Megatherium posture over time , and Richard Owen 's research contributed to that effort .
For one thing , he corrected an earlier mistake by French naturalist Georges Cuvier , who attributed armor from glyptodonts to giant ground sloths .
This mid-19th - century ground sloth rendition accurately showed the animal resting its weight on the outsides of its feet , but Owen had n't yet noted that the animal 's massive tail would enable it to make a tripod of its tail and hind limbs .
That upright posture took over later Megatherium reconstructions , including work Owen oversaw at Crystal Palace Park .
The South American fossils Owen studied were collected by someone Owen would later view as an enemy : Charles Darwin .
When the two were young , however , they were friends , and at a time when dinosaurs had n't broken through to the public 's consciousness , giant fossils mammals were everyone 's favorite prehistoric monsters .

Originally described in : " A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia " in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society
Now appears in : Jefferson and Science by Silvio Bedini
Thomas Jefferson and Georges Buffon were freethinkers with a genius for scientific research , but in the late 18th century , they disagreed .
Buffon convinced himself that " a niggardly sky and an unprolific land " in the New World left its human and animal inhabitants measly .
Jefferson begged to differ , and marshaled all the evidence he could .
In the case of the animal he dubbed Megalonyx or " Great Claw , " he overreached .
Jefferson described fossil bones discovered in western Virginia , identifying a femur fragment , radius , ulna and three claws .
He claimed that the bones likely belonged to a lion , and with apparent glee pointed to Buffon 's own measurements of " a large lion of Africa " to support his argument .
Calculating the animal 's overall size from bone fragments ( not as unreasonable as it might sound — so long as the animal is correctly identified ) , Jefferson proclaimed , " Let us only say then , what we may safely say , that he was more than three times as large as the lion . "
Remains of such a big beast no longer roaming the Virginia countryside raised the question of where the animal now lived .
He had a handy explanation : " Our entire ignorance of the immense country to the West and North - West , and of its contents , does not authorise us to say what it does not contain . "
( Jefferson did n't much care for the concept of extinction . )
But before his paper was published , he received some surprising and perhaps disappointing news , and hastily revised his paper .
The skeleton of a big quadruped had been dug up in Paraguay .
" The megatherium is not of the cat form , as are the lion , tyger , and panther . . . it probably was not carnivorous , had not the phosphoric eye , nor leonine roar . "
The anatomist Caspar Wistar eventually named Jefferson 's bones Megalonyx jeffersonii .
Jefferson was wrong about Great Claw , but Buffon was wrong about New World animals .
The Paraguay animal was n't a big cat but it was indeed big ; it was a giant ground sloth .
And any lingering skepticism about the size and ferocity of New World animals would have died in the claws and jaws of grizzlies encountered by Lewis and Clark and Company in the early 19th century .
In fact Jefferson 's 1799 paper attempted to advance an argument he had largely already won .
Buffon died in 1788 , and before his death he conceded Jefferson 's point that American wildlife could be as big and robust as European wildlife .
Buffon pledged to amend Natural History but died before he got around to it .

Around the time that Cuvier and Bru accurately reconstructed an extinct sloth , a newly published book showed 17th - and early - 18th - century struggles to understand an extant one .
Some aspects of this reconstruction , including the snout , claws and overall body proportions , are n't bad .
But the shoulder - length mane puzzles .
A delay in publishing perhaps preserved ideas that the authors might have discarded by late 18th century ; by the time this book was printed , Catesby had died , and George breathed his last in 1773 .

Thomas Jefferson worked doggedly for years to refute the French naturalist Georges Buffon 's conviction that New World inhabitants were scrawny .
Jefferson eventually succeeded by marshalling multiple lines of evidence .
American rocks yielded plenty of fossils of big animals , but they were long dead — extinct , in fact , though Jefferson hated the idea .
His disdain for extinction aside , Jefferson wanted a specimen that lived during his own day , and perhaps his prize specimen was a moose , acquired for him by a Revolutionary War General John Sullivan .
Notified of the moose find , Jefferson assured Buffon that a European reindeer could walk under the belly of his American moose .
One likes to think Jefferson said the reindeer could do so without leaving so much as a scratch .
He followed up the assurance with the physical specimen .
Printed in New York , this broadside appeared years later .
The overall look of this moose is accurate , but the ad boasts that the moose might be as much as 12 feet high .
Considering the moose Jefferson relayed to Buffon was measured at 7 feet tall , this claim is likely exaggerated .
Then again , it is an advertisement .

This is not a goof .
In fact , it 's a meticulous depiction of skeletal anatomy , and it was part of a book loaded with such examples of accuracy , artistry and charming weirdness .
Many of the illustrations in Osteographia , or Anatomy of the Bones , appeared inside ornate engraved frames .
Perhaps more importantly , Cheselden strove to show the animals in lifelike poses and realistic settings .
It does n't take a degree in osteology to figure out which two domestic animals miss their fur and confront each other here .
In aiming for the greatest possible accuracy , Cheselden dropped the original sketches made for the work and instead ordered Vandergucht and Schijnvoet use the camera obscura .
Unfortunately the book was a financial failure when it was published in the 18th century .
It has since achieved something closer to the respect it deserves .

Discussed in : The First Fossil Hunters by Adrienne Mayor and " Fossil Folklore from India : The Siwalik Hills and the Mahâbhârata " by Alexandra van der Geer , Michael Dermitzakis and John de Vos in Folklore
Temple sculptures in Belur commemorate the Indian epic Mahâbhârata , including an apocalyptic battle that left scores of elephants dead and dismembered .
Bheema ( or Bhima ) , a mythic figure in the epic , was reputed to have the strength of 1,000 elephants .
So it was little trouble for him to kill the powerful animals and toss their bodies into a heap , and such hapless elephants appear in this wall sculpture .
In fact , the epic battle myth might have been inspired by real fossil remains in the Sivalik ( also spelled Shivalik or Siwalik ) Hills .
The Sivalik Hills extend from northern Pakistan across northwestern India , Nepal , and northeastern India , ending in Bhutan .
In the 19th century , spurred by mythical tales about the region , paleontologist Hugh Falconer started excavating .
In a single day , he managed to collect more than 300 big bones .
By the time he was done digging , he had unearthed literal tons of fossils , including the remains of fossil proboscidians .
Paleontologists figure that the remains were deposited by rivers and streams starting during the middle Miocene and later uplifted by seismic activity .
Other legends associated with the area said that " Sivalik dragons " had jewels in their skulls , and Falconer found that many of the fossils in fact held large calcite crystals .

Describing dinosaurs as well as big mammals and birds , H.N. Hutchinson 's book about extinct animals was popular enough to merit multiple editions .
In the 1897 edition , in the chapter titled " Some Indian Monsters , " Reverend Hutchinson sang the praises of Hugh Falconer and Proby Cautley , who excavated fossils in the Sivalik Hills , the southern foothills of the Himalaya , in the 1830s .
Hutchinson included illustrations of the fossil booty , including this image of Sivatherium giganteum with " an allied form , Helladotherium , " in the background .
Hutchinson and Smit 's reconstruction was partially correct ; the fossil skull clearly bore bony protrusions .
But whereas modern reconstructions show an animal looking similar to a modern giraffe or okapi , Hutchinson 's book pictured something similar to a moose .
Century : Late 19th
Artist : Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins
Appears in : Princeton University Art Museum and Ewell Sale Stewart Library , Academy of Natural Sciences
Sivatherium giganteum lived in Asia during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs .
Now understood to resemble a supersized modern okapi with an extra pair of horns , the mammal was , in the 19th century , often portrayed as similar to a moose .
The moose - like appearance here is hard to miss , although Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins has given his version of the animal an even stranger appearance , with a bulbous snout ending in what looks like a stunted trunk .
His Sivatherium looks like something you might encounter in a Star Wars cantina .

Discussed in : Scenes from Deep Time : Early Pictorial Representations of the Prehistoric World by Martin J.S. Rudwick
Following the popularity of his Crystal Palace reconstructions of the early 1850s , Hawkins released a series of educational wall posters .
Besides dinosaurs and pterosaurs , he illustrated much more recent mammal life .
Working with James Tennant , a geology lecturer , Hawkins produced a pamphlet promoting this poster .
The pamphlet described " troops of ravenous Wolves , driving whole herds of Elks and Deer . "
In the midst of the hunt , the mammoth would be " entangled in the melée , panic - struck , and attacked on all sides , " and would be an easy target for " the fangs of the Cave Lion or Scimitar - toothed Tiger . "
In this picture , though , the saber - toothed cat looks like the one with reason to panic ; it 's tangled up in the mammoth 's tusks and trunk .
Serving the purpose of showing numerous animals , a whole menagerie conveniently crowds into this scene , including a hippo , a musk - ox and an Irish stag .
One has to wonder why these tasty herbivores do n't beat a hasty retreat ; if the felines do n't kill them on purpose , the mammoth might toss them by mistake .
Hawkins opposed evolutionary theory , yet his illustrations promoted " Nature red in tooth and claw " as envisioned by some evolutionists .
Canadian geologist J.W. Dawson , who also favored creation over evolution , saw fit to reproduce this picture in his 1873 edition of The Story of the Earth and Man .

Titled Pleistocene Edentates of Patagoni , this painting shows ground sloths feeding while glyptodonts wander underfoot .
As Waterhouse Hawkins aged , his paleoart showed scenes that were more confrontational .
Maybe the darker mood in his art was the consequence of his conflicts with Boss Tweed in New York City , or his messy personal life .
These ground sloths are pretty accurate anatomically , though a little less stately than the Megatherium he designed for Crystal Palace Park .
One of the sloths lays a hand on a passing Glyptodon , for reasons that are n't entirely clear .

Determined to contrast mammals and dinosaurs , early - 20th - century scientists exhibited teamwork in museum displays .
In the American Museum Journal William Diller Matthew described this scene as " the most realistic that has yet been attempted in the mounting of fossil skeletons . "
The exhibit , Matthew explained , shows mammals all enthusiastically working together to pull down a tree so they can all eat .
While one sloth stands on its hind legs to better pull at the highest branches , another rips up the roots so that the tree will topple more easily .
Another sloth ambles over to help dig , and another is just waiting to help in whatever way is needed .
Dinosaurs at the time were often displayed trying to kill each other , but mammals , the museum tried to demonstrate , had automatically evolved cooperation .

Now appears in : Fossil Revolution by Douglas Palmer and Wikipedia
By the time naturalists realized that wooly mammoths had once roamed the Siberian steppes , local people had long traded fossil ivory .
Around the turn of the 19th century , a Siberian chief named Ossip Shumakov found two beautiful ivory tusks still attached to a relatively intact animal .
Besides the skeleton and tusks , this mammoth still had much of its soft tissue .
Shumakov told an ivory dealer , Roman Boltunov , who sketched the animal before taking the tusks .
Not long afterwards , a naturalist , Mikhail Ivanovich Adams , visited the site .
Scavengers and human hunters largely de-fleshed the proboscidean before Adams examined it , and if this image is any indication , the trunk was gone by the time Boltunov produced his sketch .
But along with other parts of the animal , including nearly 40 pounds of wooly hair , Adams managed to recover an ear .
Aside from the missing trunk , the tiny ears high on the head are perhaps the most jarring aspect of this sketch .
Compared to modern elephants , mammoths had small ears , needing to conserve rather than radiate heat , but they were n't as tiny as this sketch implies .
It 's possible that scavengers had already nibbled the ears by the time Boltunov saw the mammoth .
It 's possible that the frigid conditions that preserved so much of the animal also distorted some appendages .
And it 's possible that , in making a hasty sketch of an extinct animal , Boltunov simply messed up a few details .
Overall , the sketch is very good .
This image , available via Wikipedia , also bears notes written by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach .
Boltunov contributed more than a sketch to our understanding of this animal ; he sold the tusks he had collected to Adams .
Adams shipped the tusks and other pieces of the animal he was able to collect to St. Petersburg , where he made a living teaching botany .

German zoologist Ernst Haeckel claimed that " ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny , " or that an animal 's embryological development repeats the stages of its ancestral evolution .
This picture comparing embryos was intended to support that view .
In early stages , vertebrate embryos look similar , but not nearly so similar as Haeckel claimed .
( In the first edition of one of Haeckel 's books , an identical woodcut was accidentally duplicated for three different types of embryos , a blunder that dogged Haeckel for years . )
Though embryologists recognized problems with this depiction when it was published , and Darwinian evolutionists abandoned the ontogeny - phylogeny link early in the 20th century , Haeckel 's drawings still managed to populate many biology textbooks .

The thick trunk culminating in the human species suggests that evolution 's only aim was in making us .

This Uintatherium giganteum diagram appears inside Gunning 's book , in Figure 17 .

"
In fact , much of Figure 17 is correct , but it repeats Gunning 's mistake of envisioning antlers rising from the parietal horn cores .
Few modern paleontologists would argue , though , with his description of Uintatherium giganteum as showing " a strange assemblage of characters . "

" What 's this thing doing in a page about mammals ? " you might wonder , but although this sail - backed creature has often been lumped into the same category as dinosaurs by toy makers , it 's a protomammal — not a mammal , exactly , but a forerunner .
In these depictions , the sail itself is missing , and only the supporting spines appear , but it 's impossible to dislike a picture in such pretty pastels .
In the early 20th century , Harder produced sketches and watercolors as part of his original plans for the Berlin Aquarium , an Art Nouveau building that opened in 1913 .
The original structure might have survived had it not been for World War II , but the Allied bombing of Berlin in 1943 destroyed the building .
In the 1970s , some of Harder 's original plans came to light including this sketch ( top ) .
A director of the rebuilt aquarium undertook a campaign to recreate the original murals , appealing to the public for any old pictures or postcards that might help .
In 1982 , the recreated murals were unveiled , including this cheerful - pastel mural ( bottom ) .
It preserved Harder 's mistake of omitting the sail 's soft tissue .
More than one name has been applied to this species , so while Harder thought of it as Naosaurus when working on his original watercolor , the label at the Berlin Aquarium now designates it as Edaphosaurus

The late - 19th - century Cope - Marsh Bone Wars were n't just about dinosaurs .
Trying to best each other in naming new fossil species , the paleontologists named extinct mammals , too , sometimes naming the same species multiple times .
When an extinct animal was adorned with puzzling protrusions , the problem of competing names worsened , especially if names were based on partial finds preserving different parts of the body .
Reconstructing the extinct animals could be as difficult as naming them appropriately .
Loxolophodon cornutus was the species name Cope applied to this animal , which is now known as Eobasileus cornutus .
Related to the equally bizarre Uintatherium , this prehistoric mammal bore illogical skull extensions .
In this case , the antlers were actually correct , but the elephant - style trunks and ears were abandoned by later paleontologists .

Perhaps saddest of all , elephants were used in gory spectacles — tossed into arenas with felines and bears .

This illustration includes a couple — but only a couple — features identifying it as an elephant .
Aside from the trunk and tusks , almost everything else — the small pointed ears , the long fur and the paws — belong to animals that Europeans likely found more familiar .

This woodcut pair in Pliny 's book showed pretty accurate views of the giant animal .
Even though he lived in Antiquity , Pliny remained enormously influential during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and with good reason .
Elephants were a more common site in Antiquity than in the two millennia that followed .
So while Renaissance greats Gesner and Aldrovandi had probably never seen an elephant , Pliny probably had .
Yet Pliny might not have approved of this illustration — he disliked illustrations in general .
And with or without illustrations , he passed along odd information about pachyderms .
Just one example : one elephant wrote a happy note ( in Latin ! ) in the sand describing its glee over the defeat of the Celts .

This elephant appeared in the same picture as a unicorn .
Polo apparently recalled both animals from his travels .
The illustrator apparently grasped the prehensile nature of the elephant 's trunk , and in this picture , the end of the trunk looks almost like a human hand .
The feet , meanwhile , look like giant paws .

This picture presents an odd mix to the modern viewer , showing the fetus of an elephant next to the fetus of a human inside a jar .
The 17th - and 18th - century Dutch apothecary and collector Albertus Seba might judge the modern viewer squeamish as these fetuses counted among his prized possessions .
Lavishly illustrated volumes of Seba's Thesaurus show not just items in his collections , but even some type specimens — the examples of species — that the 18th - century naturalist Linnaeus named with his system of binomial nomenclature .
One specimen , which Linnaeus named Elephas maximus , was pictured in Seba 's book , and the specimen itself has been preserved to the present day .
The Swedish Natural History Museum in Stockholm still houses the elephant fetus , but its days as a type specimen are now over .
When Linnaeus named Elephas maximus , he believed there was only one elephant species in the world .
Subsequent naturalists recognized that African elephants differed enough from Indian elephants to be placed in their own species and later their own genus , Loxodonta , and eventually split African elephants into two separate species .
Biologists can easily distinguish African from Indian elephants based on their ears and the shapes of their heads , but identifying the species can be harder in a fetus .
Nevertheless , biologists long suspected that the pickled elephant might be named incorrectly .
DNA analysis proved their hunch correct , although finding good DNA to sample was tricky .
Alcohol may preserve animal tissue for a long time , but the liquid is tough on DNA .
Diagnostic tissue — a protein known to differ in Asian and African elephants — was finally located in the little elephant 's esophagus .

The collections of the Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art includes a stony arch , rumored to be from a church at Narbonne .
Dating from around the late 12th century , the Narbonne arch includes an assortment of real and imagined animals .
Clockwise from the lower left , the arch includes a manticore , pelican , cockatrice , siren , griffin , amphisbaena , centaur and lion .
The lion , of course , is a very real animal , but this depiction indicates that medieval Europeans had scant experience with lions in the wild .
A lion in the wild would n't hesitate to make a meal of you , even if you were a woman , a child , a prisoner , or even a shrewd soul who politely prostrated yourself before the kingly beast .
A lion in the wild would n't wear a crown , though this cheerful cat does .
The animals shown in this arch reflected tales from bestiaries .
Kingly and kind , lions still had their eccentricities , the typical bestiary reported .
From the Metropolitan Museum of Art : " Although the lion was considered brave — as seems to be the case here — it also feared fire , human hunters , creaking wheels , and white roosters . "

Medieval bestiaries occasionally relayed objective observations about animals , but more often used the creatures to make a moral argument .
This picture illustrates a common legend , namely that lion cubs are brought to life by the roaring and breathing of their fathers .
In a society infused with Christianity , it 's not hard to imagine who the lion fathers represented .
The little tyke on the far right certainly looks like he 's just been on the receiving end of a mighty roar .

Another depiction of the lion 's legendary fathering skills appears in this gilded illumination .
The mother , having given birth to a lifeless cub , looks heavenward while the father inhales , preparing to breathe life into the newborn .
In fact , the cub is three days old .
The Getty explains , " The lion , the king of beasts , was understood in the Middle Ages as a symbol of Christ .
So the story of the cub's three days of lifelessness was interpreted as a reflection of the three days between Jesus ' Crucifixion and his Resurrection .
Few Europeans ever saw lions , native to Africa and Asia .
Nevertheless , the artist rendered the beasts with remarkable verisimilitude . "
That both the mother and father have manes is a forgivable mistake .

Unfortunately for European education of the time , this was supposed to be a giraffe .
Reuwich apparently tried to depict the animal from memory and remembered an antelope better .
Given how unusual giraffes are , and how few 15th - century Europeans saw one , this illustration may have been regarded as far more plausible than the real thing .
In Reuwich 's day , woodcuts were n't exactly copyrighted , and the same picture could easily appear in multiple books .

This porcupine is n't a bad rendition .
It not only shows the finer hairs near the porcupine 's head , but also the black - and - white coloring of the quills .
The face looks a little ferocious , but given the porcupine 's arsenal , 16th - century Europeans can probably be forgiven for thinking of this occasionally cuddly creature as bad - tempered .
The woodcut was apparently modeled on a porcupine shown around Zurich by a beggar who likely valued money over comfort .

This wild boar illustration was n't too bad .
At the time it was published , however , Europeans held some nutritional notions that would strike a modern reader as strange .
One idea was that eating an animal 's brains would make you smarter .
Another was that the ideal food to consume would be most like yourself .
That would be humans .
It does n't appear anybody took that advice seriously enough to actually feast on human flesh .
But pork was considered the next best thing .

In the early 16th century , a Portuguese official based in India relayed to his king , Manuel I , an Indian rhinoceros .
Remarkably , the animal survived the 120 - day sea journey to Lisbon .
Manual I re-gifted the beast to Pope Leo X .
The beast was one of several spectacular gifts plucked from the far reaches of the Portuguese empire .
Sadly , the much shorter sea journey to Rome ended in failure .
The ship sank and the animal perished .
( Some people even blamed the rhino for the sunken ship , claiming it threw its weight around until the vessel capsized . )
Its body was later recovered and its hide stuffed for display .
A sketch of the rhino reached the famed artist Dürer , who then made this woodcut .
Although this woodcut shows an unusually stout rhino with griffin - like legs and an ornate hide , it 's really not a bad likeness .
The reason its skin looks like armor may be that the animal described really had been outfitted with its own protective suit .
Dürer , who did not personally see the rhino , actively marketed his depiction in the form of leaflets with sensational text describing this " deadly enemy of the elephant " exuberantly goring the proboscidian at every opportunity .
Dürer 's much - admired picture appeared in later works by Ambroise Paré and Conrad Gesner , among others .

Forty years after Albrecht Dürer 's famous print , the rhinoceros worked its way into a compendium of emblems , associated with Alessandro de Medici .
This emblem gave prominence to a minor feature in the earlier print : its second horn .
The small protuberance on the rhino's back might have been a cyst or skin flap , though it 's often been associated with the unicorn .
In this emblem , it does look very much like a mythical unicorn horn .

This mezzotint had a long title , and part of the title ( besides " true representation " ) was " drawne after the life , " as if the artist had personally eyeballed these great masterpieces in the flesh .
More likely the artist eyeballed Albrecht Dürer 's 16th - century representation of a rhinoceros , in which he added armor .
The overall shape of the rhino is pretty accurate , and the same goes for the elephant , though this elephant bears an awful lot of wrinkles .
These fighting beasts exhibit the animosity they 'd been assumed to feel for each other since the days of Pliny .

Unlike the 16th - century rhino , this depiction was based on a specific animal , Clara , who took a tour through the best courts and cities of Europe .
One contemporary account described her as a wonderful animal who could plow the ground with her horn .
Another described her as a " hideous animal of the female gender . "
Clara was a generally placid , good - natured animal , but her charm was hardly enhanced by the moisturizer used on her thick skin : smelly fish oil .

This illustration shows a rhinoceros , purported snake stones ( believed to come from behind the eyes of vipers , and supposed bezoar stones ( thought to form in animals ' intestinal tracts , made up of indigestible materials ) .
To the modern viewer this assemblage looks miscellaneous , but to the doctor Sloane , all the items were related .
Sloane thought the snake stones could counteract fevers and , not surprisingly , venom .
He argued that the bezoars could draw substances out of the body , and could be particularly helpful in childbirth — though they had to be used with caution lest they coax out more than the baby .
He also said that shavings from the rhino 's horn could cure poison .
Despite the misinformation in Sloane 's argument , the rhino illustration relayed some accurate and fairly novel information : A rhino could have two horns .
Renaissance and Enlightenment Europeans were more familiar with one - horned Indian rhinos than two - horned African rhinos , and many scholars assumed that accounts of two - horned rhinos from Antiquity were in error .

Lurking in one of the many woodcuts from this late - 15th - century book , part of a menagerie of exotic fauna , is a camel .
It 's clearly recognizable , though its ears are a little big and its neck is a bit too long and too serpentine .
Looking at the human figures for scale , this camel is roughly the size of a dog .
That could be an error , but it might just be artistic convention of the time .
In the Middle Ages and early Renaissance , symbolism trumped realism , and a figure 's size often had more to do with its importance ; if the human figures mattered more , they would get more space .

The gulon , or glutton , was likely based on the wolverine .
The creature was believed to be so gluttonous that it would eat its fill , pull its body between two branches to clear its guts , and go back for more .
Here the creature is seen copiously depositing tokens of its esteem around the carcasses it has eaten .
Topsell believed that many beasts existed to give moral instruction to man , and the gulon was a shining example .
" It may be that God has ordained such a creature in those countries where it is found to express the abominable gluttony of the men there , so that they may know their deformed nature , " he explained .
No prisoner of political correctness , he continued , " Such are the men in Muscovia , in Lithuania , and most shameful of all in Tartaria . "

Verbiest was a Flemish Jesuit who , like his brothers in the Society of Jesus , was welcomed in China 's imperial court for his knowledge of topics such as astronomy and math .
The Jesuit missionary - Chinese cartographer collaboration produced a map showing continents as they were understood in the 17th century : Eurasia , Africa , America and a massive southern continent called Magellanica .
This map continued a centuries - long belief that the landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere were counterbalanced by an equally large landmass in the Southern , even though it had n't yet been precisely located .
Before discovering that Antarctica was ( 1 ) much smaller and ( 2 ) much colder than Magellanica , cartographers could easily imagine the place was home to animals akin to what had been found in Africa , along with some mythical creatures .
Inhabiting Magellanica in this map section are animals that had appeared in 16th - century encyclopedias , including a giraffe and a heavily - armored rhino .
Alongside them are a unicorn , a gluttonous gulon , and a giant arachnid .

When reading this Bodley Bestiary passage , one does n't know which misconception to find more alarming .
" There is an animal called the hyena , which lives in the graves of dead men and feeds on their bodies .
By nature it is sometimes masculine , sometimes feminine , and for that reason it is an unclean beast .
. . .
The children of Israel are like this beast ; at first they served the living God but later fell prey to riches and easy living and worshipped idols . "
In the dining hall of a U.S. Army post south of Baghdad , President Bush was on the wide - screen TV , giving a speech about the war in Iraq .
The soldiers did n’t look up from their chicken and mashed potatoes .
As military and political leaders prepare to deliver a progress report on the conflict to Congress next month , many soldiers are increasingly disdainful of the happy talk that they say commanders on the ground and White House officials are using in their discussions about the war .
And they ’re becoming vocal about their frustration over longer deployments and a taxing mission that keeps many living in dangerous and uncomfortably austere conditions .
Some say two wars are being fought here : the one the enlisted men see , and the one that senior officers and politicians want the world to see .
“ I do n’t see any progress .
Just us getting killed , ” said Spc. Yvenson Tertulien , one of those in the dining hall in Yousifiya , 10 miles south of Baghdad , as Bush ’s speech aired last month .
“ I do n’t want to be here anymore . ”

Morale problems come as the Bush administration faces increasing pressure to begin a drawdown of troops .
The Times reported Friday that Gen. Peter Pace , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was expected to advise Bush to reduce U.S. force levels next year by almost half because of the strain on the military .
But Pace on Friday said , “ The story is wrong , it is speculative .
I have not made or decided on any recommendations yet . ”
Plenty of troops remain upbeat about their mission in Iraq .

Matt Dawson said residents used to shoot at troops but now visit them and offer ideas on improving security .

“ For the 20 - year - old kids here who have been shot at for 10 months in a row , the change is a tremendous feeling , ” Dawson said last week .
The Army cites reenlistment numbers as proof that morale remains high and says it expects to reach its retention goal of 62,200 for the fiscal year .
“ On the 4th of July , we reenlisted 588 service members . . . in Baghdad .
That has to be an indicator , ” said Sgt. Maj .
Marvin Hill , who visits bases to gauge morale on behalf of Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , the commander of U.S. troops in Iraq .
Based on his encounters , Hill said , he would rank morale at 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 .
Advertisement
“ Units that are having real success are units where troop morale is extremely high , ” Hill said .
“ Units that are sustaining losses , whether it be personnel losses , injuries or casualties -- those are organizations where morale might dip a bit . ”
The signs of frustration and of flagging morale are unmistakable , including blunt comments , online rants and the findings of surveys on military morale and suicides .
Sometimes the signs are to be found even in latrines .
In the stalls at Baghdad ’s Camp Liberty , someone had posted Army help cards listing “ nine signs of suicide . ”
On one card , seven of the boxes had been checked .
“ This occupation , this money pit , this smorgasbord of superfluous aggression is getting more hopeless and dismal by the second , ” a soldier in Diyala province , north of Baghdad , wrote in an Aug. 7 post on his blog , www.armyofdude.blogspot.com.

“ The only person I know who believed Iraq was improving was killed by a sniper in May , ” the blogger , identified only as Alex from Frisco , Texas , said in a separate e-mail .
The Army ’s suicide rate is at its highest in 23 years : 17.3 per 100,000 troops , compared with 12.4 per 100,000 in 2003 , the first year of the war .
Of the 99 suicides last year , 27 occurred in Iraq .
The latest in a series of mental health surveys of troops in Iraq , released in May , says 45 % of the 1,320 soldiers interviewed ranked morale in their unit as low or very low .
Seven percent ranked it high or very high .
Mental health trends have worsened in the last two years , said Cindy Williams , an expert in military personnel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
“ These long and repeated deployments are causing acute mental stress , ” she said .

Most troops in Iraq expected 12 - month deployments .
Those were extended in May by three months for the troop buildup .
Thousands already were on their second or third deployments .
The result is a fighting force that includes many soldiers who are worn down , just as Petraeus , who took command of the war six months ago , is asking them to adopt intense counterinsurgency tactics .
Those strategies emphasize living “ outside the wire , ” in military - speak , in outposts that put troops close to Iraqis .
The theory is that people will come to trust the soldiers and share information needed to quell the violence .
But these posts often lack basic amenities such as running water , flush toilets , telephones and Internet access , which troops at the forward operating bases enjoy , along with food courts and athletic facilities .
Being on the front lines , troops in outposts also face greater danger than those at bases .
Since the war began , there have been eight months in which U.S. troop deaths topped 100 , including three months since the buildup began in February .

In Yousifiya , troops occupy the sun-scorched grounds of a former potato - processing plant .
They use pit latrines and get showers only when there is enough water .
They jog around a shade - less concrete lot that serves as a helipad and mortar - launching site .
Other troops in this area have far less comfortable surroundings .
Army Maj .
Rob Griggs believes rough conditions are good for the mission .
Without comforting distractions , troops are more driven to complete their jobs , said Griggs , who is on his fifth deployment , including two in Iraq , since enlisting 17 years ago .
“ It allows them to focus on why they are here , ” said Griggs , who sleeps and lives in half of a 20 - foot metal shipping container on the Yousifiya base .
Having troops live in the same spare conditions as many Iraqis do also helps convince people that the Americans are genuine about wanting to make things better , he said .
But the disparities in living and working conditions among soldiers heighten resentments , chipping away at morale .
So does the feeling that the mission is futile , a belief fueled by the Iraqi political stalemate and the unreliability of Iraqi forces .

“ There are two different wars , ” said Staff Sgt. Donald Richard Harris , comparing his soldiers ’ views with those of commanders in distant bases .
“ It ’s a dead - end process , it seems like . ”
Asked to rank morale in his unit , Harris gave it a 4 on a 10 - point scale .
“ Look at these guys .
This is their downtime , ” he said , as young soldiers around him silently cleaned dust from their rifles at a battle position south of the capital .
A fiery wind blasted through the small base , an abandoned home surrounded by sandbags and razor wire .
“ It sounds selfish , but if we just had phones and Internet service , ” said Staff Sgt. Clark Merlin , his voice trailing off .
Their unit was supposed to go home this month but its tour was extended until November .
That means three more months of using plastic sacks for toilets , burning their waste and hoping for packages from home .
Advertisement
“ I think the extension has been 99 % of the reason morale is low , ” said Merlin , rating it 4 or 5 .
Counterinsurgency expert Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations said the “ two wars ” issue is common in conflict zones as front - line soldiers grow to resent troops at the bases and come to believe their commanders are out of touch with the realities in the field .
“ But this kind of war really highlights it , ” Biddle , who has advised Petraeus , said of Iraq .
Soldiers ’ discomfort is compounded by the task of forging relations with people whom few trust , and who often make clear their dislike of the U.S. presence .
“ All war is political , but usually privates and specialists do n’t have to think much about that part of it .
In this conflict they do , to a much greater degree , ” Biddle said , referring to the community activities that troops have been drawn into .
These include negotiating with tribal leaders who once harbored insurgents , striking deals with former insurgents to bring them into the Iraqi security forces , and listening to residents ’ complaints about lack of services .

“ You have to help people despite the strong suspicion that lots of them mean you ill , ” Biddle said .
“ We ’re asking an awful lot of very , very young people . ”
It is especially difficult for soldiers trained to fight a uniformed enemy but in Iraq face an array of unconventional forces .
Most thought their job was finished after Saddam Hussein was ousted .
Instead , they found themselves directing traffic in Baghdad ’s chaotic streets .
Four years later , they still are policing and doing community work they did not anticipate .
“ You couple that with getting blown up and shot at , and it definitely makes it harder to deliver service with a smile , ” said Staff Sgt. Kevin Littrell , whose plan to leave the Army in May was thwarted when his unit ’s tour was extended .
At another patrol base , Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch , commander of U.S. forces in southern Iraq , was introduced to 1st Lt. Jeff Bess .
The young man had just arrived for his first assignment .
Asked how he liked the Army so far , Bess made an attempt to be polite .
“ It ’s a learning experience , sir , ” he replied .

Lynch told him : “ You ’re making history here while those back home are watching it on TV . ”

Many planetary scientists believe that Jupiter ’s moon Europa is our solar system ’s best contender to share Earth ’s distinction of harboring life .
Evidence gathered by the Voyager and Galileo spacecrafts suggests Europa contains a deep , possibly warm ocean of salty water under an outer shell of fissured ice .
In a paper published in the July 2007 Journal of Aerospace Engineering a British mechanical engineer proposes sending a submarine to explore Europa ’s oceans .
Carl T. F. Ross , a professor at the University of Portsmouth in England offers an abstract design of an underwater craft built of a metal matrix composite .
He also provides suggestions for suitable power supplies , communication techniques and propulsion systems for such a vessel in his paper , “ Conceptual Design of a Submarine to Explore Europa ’s Oceans . ”
Ross ’s paper weighs the options for constructing a submarine capable of withstanding the undoubtedly high pressure within Europa ’s deep oceans .
Scientists believe that this moon ’s oceans could be up to 100 kilometers deep , more than ten times deeper than Earth ’s oceans .
Ross proposes a 3 meter long cylindrical sub with an internal diameter of 1 meter .
He believes that steel or titanium , while strong enough to withstand the hydrostatic pressure , would be unsuitable as the vessel would have no reserve buoyancy .
Therefore , the sub would sink like a rock to the bottom of the ocean .
A metal matrix or ceramic composite would offer the best combination of strength and buoyancy .
Ross favors a fuel cell for power , which will be needed for propulsion , communications and scientific equipment , but notes that technological advances in the ensuing years may provide better sources for power .
Ross concedes that a submarine mission to Europa wo n’t occur for at least 15 - 20 years .
Planetary scientist William B. McKinnon agrees .
“ It is difficult enough , and expensive , to get back to Europa with an orbiter , much less imagine a landing or an ocean entry , ” said McKinnon , professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri .
“ Sometime in the future , and after we have determined the ice shell thickness , we can begin to seriously address the engineering challenges .
For now , it might be best to search for those places where the ocean has come to us .
That is , sites of recent eruptions on Europa ’s surface , whose compositions can be determined from orbit . ”
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is currently working on a concept called the Europa Explorer which would deliver a low orbit spacecraft to determine the presence ( or absence ) of a liquid water ocean under Europa ’s ice surface .
It would also map the distribution of compounds of interest for pre-biotic chemistry , and characterize the surface and subsurface for future exploration .
“ This type of mission , ” says McKinnon , “ would really allow us to get the hard proof we would all like that the ocean is really there , and determine the thickness of the ice shell and find thin spots if they exist . ”
McKinnon added that an orbiter could find “ hot spots ” that indicate recent geological or even volcanic activity and obtain high - resolution images of the surface .
The latter would be needed to plan any successful landing .
Slightly smaller than Earth ’s moon , Europa has an exterior that is nearly craterless , meaning a relatively “ young ” surface .
Data from the Galileo spacecraft shows evidence of near - surface melting and movements of large blocks of icy crust , similar to ice bergs or ice rafts on Earth .
While Europa ’s midday surface temperatures hover around 130 K ( - 142 C , - 225 degrees F ) , interior temperatures could be warm enough for liquid water to exist underneath the ice crust .
This internal warmth comes from tidal heating caused by the gravitational forces of Jupiter and Jupiter ’s other moons which pull Europa ’s interior in different directions .
Scientists believe similar tidal heating drives the volcanoes on another Jovian moon , Io .
Seafloor hydrothermal vents have also been suggested as another possible energy source on Europa .
On Earth , undersea volcanoes and hydrothermal vents create environments that sustain colonies of microbes .
If similar systems are active on Europa , scientists reason that life might be present there too .
Among scientists there is a big push to get a mission to Europa underway .
However this type of mission is competing for funding against NASA ’s goal of returning to our own moon with human missions .
The proposed Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter ( JIMO ) a nuclear powered mission to study three of Jupiter ’s moons , fell victim to cuts in science missions in NASA ’s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget .
Ross has been designing and improving submarines for over 40 years , but this is the first time he ’s designed a craft for use anywhere but on Earth .
“ The biggest problem that I see with the robot submarine is being able to drill or melt its way through a maximum of 6 km of the ice , which is covering the surface , ” said Ross .
“ However , the ice may be much thinner in some places .
It may be that we will require a nuclear pressurized water reactor on board the robot submarine to give us the necessary power and energy to achieve this ”
While Ross proposes using parachutes to bring the submarine to Europa ’s surface , McKinnon points out that parachutes would not work in Europa ’s almost airless atmosphere .
Ross has received very positive responses to his paper from friends and colleagues , he says , including notable British astronomer Sir Patrick Moore .
Ross says his life has revolved around submarines since 1959 and he finds this new concept of a submarine on Europa to be very exciting .
McKinnon classifies the exploration of Europa as “ extremely important . ”
“ Europa is a place is where we are pretty sure we have abundant liquid water , energy sources , and biogenic elements such as carbon , nitrogen , sulfur , phosphorus , etc , ” he said .
“ Is there life , any kind of life , in Europa ’s ocean ?
Questions do n’t get much more profound . ”

11 February 1998
Chapter 1 . Ground values .
Consider the following code :
( setf ( font - properties xf ) '( : fontname " FOO " : pointsize 5 ) )
A first attempt at a translation into X idioms gives :
xf->info.nprops=2 ; xf->info.props=xalloc(xf->info.nprops*sizeof(FontPropRec ) ) ; xf->info.props[0].name= " FONTNAME " ; xf->info.props[0].value= " FOO " ; xf->info.props [ 1].name = " POINTSIZE " ; xf->info.props[1].value=5 ;
You 'll notice the convenient syntax and flexible representation .
But as we do n't have exceptions ( signals ) in the language , we need to check every return value pedibus calcantibus :
xf->info.nprops=2 ; if (( xf->info.props=xalloc(xf->info.nprops*sizeof(FontPropRec ) ) ) ==0 ) return BadAlloc ; xf->info.props[0].name= " FONTNAME " ; xf->info.props[0].value= " FOO " ; xf->info.props [ 1].name = " POINTSIZE " ; xf->info.props[1].value=5 ;
You 'll notice the elegant manner of adding an error value to a data type by overloading 0 .
As we have no dynamic typing or usable sum types ( did I hear `union ' ?
are you kidding ? ) , we intern the strings and use integer handles .
xf->info.nprops=2 ; if (( xf->info.props=xalloc(xf->info.nprops*sizeof(FontPropRec ) ) ) ==0 ) return BadAlloc ; xf->info.props[0].name=MakeAtom ( " FONTNAME " ) ; xf->info.props[0].value=MakeAtom ( " FOO " ) ; xf->info.props[1].name=MakeAtom ( " POINTSIZE " ) ; xf->info.props[1].value=5 ;
We are now unable to distinguish between string handles and bona fide integers .
We therefore introduce another array .
xf->info.nprops=2 ; if (( xf->info.props=xalloc(xf->info.nprops*sizeof(FontPropRec ) ) ) ==0 ) return BadAlloc ; if (( xf ->info.isStringProp=xalloc( 2 ) ) ==0 ) return BadAlloc ; xf->info.props[0].name=MakeAtom ( " FONTNAME " ) ; xf->info.props[0].value=MakeAtom ( " FOO " ) ; xf->info.isStringProp[0 ] =1 ; xf->info.props[1].name=MakeAtom ( " POINTSIZE " ) ; xf->info.props[1].value=5 ; xf->info.isStringProp[1]=0 ;
Unfortunately , if the second allocation fails , there 's a memory leak .
We could store on a stack the values to release in case of failure , but that would involve more allocation , which would ...
We give up on this idea , and write the more C - like :
xf->info.nprops=2 ; if (( xf->info.props=xalloc(xf->info.nprops*sizeof(FontPropRec ) ) ) ==0 ) return BadAlloc ; if (( xf ->info.isStringProp=xalloc( 2 ) ) ==0 ) { xfree( xf -> info.props ) ; return BadAlloc ; } xf->info.props[0].name=MakeAtom ( " FONTNAME " ) ; xf->info.props[0].value=MakeAtom ( " FOO " ) ; xf->info.isStringProp[0 ] =1 ; xf->info.props[1].name=MakeAtom ( " POINTSIZE " ) ; xf->info.props[1].value=5 ; xf->info.isStringProp[ 1]=0 ;
Which , of course , means that if we add some code that allocates data earlier on , we have to manually update all the emergency deallocations .
Oh , well !
At this point , the reader is advised to consider the initial Lisp code again :
( setf ( font - properties xf ) '( : fontname " FOO " : pointsize 5 ) )
( Chapter 2 , “ Closures , ” fails to get written as author collapses , hysterically sobbing , when thinking of the amount of manual lambda - lifting he had to do . )

One of the curious ambiguities of the commutation controversy is what role , if any , Dick Cheney played in the process .
As the recent WaPo series made clear , not much happens in this White House without the VP ’s direct involvement ( i.e. , dictation ) , but what did Cheney do about keeping his former chief of staff out of jail ?
The Bush gang has been more than a little cagey about the details , which generally hints at the answer .
The WaPo noted on the front page this morning , “ An unanswered question last night was Vice President Cheney ’s role in advocating leniency for his former chief of staff and alter ego . ”
Reporters tried to get a few more details out of Tony Snow yesterday .
At this afternoon ’s White House press conference , reporters peppered Tony Snow with questions about Cheney ’s possible involvement in the pardon , which Snow refused to answer .
“ Did the vice president weigh in ? ” one reporter asked .
“ I ’m sure that everybody had an opportunity to share their views , ” Snow replied , failing to note that Bush issued his decision without much consultation .
Later ,
Snow waffled on Cheney ’s involvement , stating on the one hand , “ I ’m sure that the vice president may have expressed an opinion , ” but then backtracking .
“ He may have recused himself .
I honestly do n’t know . ”
Given the dodging , hedging , and awkward tap - dancing in response to questions about Cheney ’s role in this fiasco , and given what we know about Cheney ’s role in every fiasco , I hardly think it ’s a stretch to suspect the VP ’s fingerprints are all over this one .
NEW YORK -- New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick was fined the NFL maximum of $ 500,000 Thursday and the Patriots were ordered to pay $ 250,000 for spying on an opponent 's defensive signals .
Commissioner Roger Goodell also ordered the team to give up its first - round draft choice next year if it reaches the playoffs this season , or its
second - and third - round picks if it misses the postseason .
" This episode represents a calculated and deliberate attempt to
avoid long - standing rules designed to encourage fair play and promote honest competition on the playing field , " Goodell said in a letter to the Patriots .
The videotaping came to light after a camera was confiscated from Patriots video assistant Matt Estrella while he was on the New York Jets ' sideline during New England 's 38 - 14 win last Sunday at Giants Stadium .
Goodell will not change the outcome of the game .
Goodell said he had considered suspending Belichick but did n't " largely because I believe that the discipline I am imposing of a
maximum fine and forfeiture of a first - round draft choice , or multiple draft choices , is in fact more significant and long - lasting , and therefore more effective , than a suspension . "

Andy Murray notched up his first top - 10 win in nearly three years with a 6 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 7 - 5 victory over world number 7 Alexander Zverev .
After ten months out due to injury and the global pandemic , it 's hard to gauge Murray 's form .
On the evidence so far this week it 's safe to say that he is at the very least a threat to the best players in the world .
Murray eased through the first set , chasing down drop shots and showing the sort of outrageous court coverage that has become his hallmark .
His attacking game was in fine fettle as well , especially on the return of serve .
Zverev 's second delivery is fragile at best , and Murray capitalised , often meeting the return just feet from the service line .
Zverev steadied himself in the second set and suddenly Murray start ...
( CNN ) -- Yahoo misled Congress regarding information the Internet company gave to Chinese authorities about the journalist Shi Tao , Democratic Rep. Tom Lantos said Tuesday .
Yahoo officials have been asked to testify before a House committee in November about a Chinese journalist 's case .
Lantos , a California representative and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , asked Yahoo Inc. officials to testify about the company 's role in a case that sent Chinese newspaper writer and editor Shi to prison on a 10 - year sentence .
Lantos asked Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Jerry Yang and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Michael Callahan to appear November 6 .
" Our committee has established that Yahoo provided false information to Congress in early 2006 , " Lantos said in a written statement .
" We want to clarify how that happened , and to hold the company to account for its actions both before and after its testimony proved untrue .
And we want to examine what steps the company has taken since then to protect the privacy rights of its users in China . "
The newspaper reporter had posted information under a pseudonym on an overseas Web site called Democracy Forum about a government crackdown on media and democracy activists , Lantos said .
Shi was later arrested in his home in Beijing after Yahoo gave Chinese authorities information about his e-mail account , his computer address , his log - on history and the contents of several weeks of his e-mail , Lantos said .
Lantos said a Yahoo official testified last year that the company knew nothing " about the nature of the investigation " of Shi , a pro-democracy activist now serving time on what Lantos called " trumped - up charges . "
Do n't Miss China puts the squeeze on Web controls
" We have now learned there is much more to the story than Yahoo let on , and a Chinese government document that Yahoo had in their possession at the time of the hearing left little doubt of the government 's intentions , " said Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey .
" U.S. companies must hold the line and not work hand in glove with the secret police . "
In a written statement , Yahoo spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said Yahoo representatives have been truthful with Congress .
He called the House committee 's accusation " grossly unfair " and said it " mischaracterizes the nature and intent of our past testimony . "
During a February 2006 subcommittee hearing on limits to freedom on the Internet in China , Lantos and Smith questioned Callahan about Shi .
Callahan testified to the subcommittee that Yahoo handed over the information to Chinese authorities at a time when it knew nothing about the investigation , Lantos said .
But the San Francisco , California - based human - rights group The Dui Hua Foundation released documents in July indicating police in China had written to Yahoo saying they were seeking evidence about Shi for illegally " providing state secrets to foreign entities , " a charge frequently levied against political dissidents in China .
" This new documentation suggests that Yahoo's Beijing office was at least aware of the general nature of the crime being investigated in the Shi Tao case , " said Joshua Rosenzweig , manager of research and publications for The Dui Hua Foundation .
Even if Yahoo was unaware of the specific circumstances of the Chinese government 's inquiry , " One does not have to be an expert in Chinese law to know that ' state secrets ' charges have often been used to punish political dissent in China , " said Rosenzweig .
Shi has appealed his 10 - year sentence for divulging state secrets , saying he did not know the information he shared was classified .
He accused the police of using improper procedures in the investigation and arrest .
In addition , he has filed suit in U.S. federal court against Yahoo and its Hong Kong - based subsidiary .
Yahoo's spokeswoman said the company is working with other companies and the human rights community " to develop a global code of conduct for operating in countries around the world , including China . "

Male facial appearance signals physical strength to women .
2006 Dec 7;19(1):82 -87
[ Epub ahead of print ]
Fink B , Neave N , Seydel H.Previous studies showed that male faces with extreme features that are likely to be associated with testosterone ( T ) are perceived as dominant and masculine .
Women were reported to prefer masculinized male faces , as they may consider T markers to be an " honest " indication of good health .
However , it is also likely that female preferences for certain male faces arise from the fact that dominant - and masculine - looking males are signaling characteristics which may be beneficial in intrasexual conflict , and thereby also indicate potential achievers of high status , an important factor in female mate selection .
Although numerous studies were built on this assumption , nothing is known about the relationship between perceived facial dominance and physical strength in men .
We measured hand - grip strength , as a measure of overall physical strength , in a sample of 32 male students , and recorded age , body weight , and height .
Seventy - nine women rated facial images of these men for dominance , masculinity , and attractiveness .
After controlling for age and body weight , hand - grip strength was found to correlate significantly positively with all three measures .
The present data thus support the supposition that a male 's physical strength is also signaled via facial characteristics of dominance and masculinity , which are considered attractive by women
Hemant Mehta was raised in the Jain faith ( a religious tradition rooted in India ) , but became an atheist as a teen .
Now in his twenties and a high school math teacher near Chicago , he is active in many groups that promote secularism .
In early 2006 , Mehta auctioned himself off on eBay to a Protestant minister , agreeing to attend a variety of church services and remain open to their messages .
Mehta spoke with Beliefnet recently about his book , which describes his impressions of those churches , and why he 's still an atheist .
Your book , I Sold My Soul on eBay , tells the story of how you agreed to visit numerous churches even though you ’re an atheist .
What were you " bought " to do ?
No one actually bought my soul .
I offered to go to a church or temple or mosque saying that I 've really never been to any of those places outside my own Jain faith , and I really am curious about what it 's like .
The auction I put up on eBay said , ” I am an atheist .
You can bid on where I go to church or a temple or a mosque , etc . ”
It came down to Christians bidding that I go to a particular church and atheists bidding that I do n't go to church .
I work with a college atheist group called the Secular Student Alliance .
I did n't want to be put in the position where a Christian with , say , $ 1 million has the opportunity to win this auction .
So [ I said ] that the money will be donated to the secular group I work with .
That way , if a Christian was bidding that much money , at least I know it 's going to a cause I really support .
How much money was paid ?
$ 504 was the winning bid .
The person that won was Jim Henderson , a former pastor from Seattle , Washington .
He thought , " Wow , this is the kind of thing I like to see -- getting an impression of church from a non-believer 's perspective . "
Based on what I had written in the auction , I owed Jim 50 Sundays ’ worth of church .
Jim saw that and he said , " You know what ?
Why do n't you go to say 10 or 15 churches in Chicago where I 'm from and write about them on his ministry 's website , called Off the Map . "
What was the agreement - that you would go to a different church once a week for a year ?
I ended up going to close to 10 churches around Chicago for Jim .
A publisher saw what I was doing for Jim 's site and had the idea , " Why do n't we send you to more churches across the country , and then compile those into the book ? "
What would you do at each church ?
I was n't wearing a big sign that said " I 'm an atheist " or something .
The churches did not know I was coming .
I would go there with a notebook .
A couple of times , I brought some people with me .
But I would just go , usually by myself , and sit somewhere in the auditorium or the gymnasium .
I would listen , take notes on what other people were doing , how they were reacting , what the sermon was like , the atmosphere and just whatever stood out to me .
I tried to keep the focus on :
Are they really doing something that would reach out to me ?
Or if the pastor said something that I found incredibly offensive that they thought was just normal talk , I would jot that down .
What surprised you about the different churches ?
I had a lot of stereotypes that church was very Simpsons - esque : a very boring pastor , a bunch of people who were sleeping in the pews , things like that .
When I started going to the churches , I was very shocked to see that a lot of them , especially the bigger ones , were so far removed from that .
But I did go to some churches where it was the pastor says a line , the congregation repeats or says the next line , and they go back and forth .
There 's no emotion .
It 's like a bunch of students reciting the Gettysburg Address in class .
You 're just saying it because you have to .
I was so surprised .
If you really wanted to be moved by what they were saying , that 's not the way it was going to happen .
You seemed open to going to these churches , but sort of puzzled by what draws people to them .
Some of the pastors I heard , especially at larger churches , were wonderful speakers .
They said something -- and I know this sounds cheesy -- but it really touched me , even though I did n't buy into the supernatural , godly aspect of it .
So I can understand why people would want to go there , especially when some of these churches are doing the type of community service they 're doing .
And it 's not proselytizing .
It 's just “ We 're Christians .
It 's our duty to help our community . ”
Why would n't you be drawn to that ?
But when you go to some of the other churches , it 's just ritual after ritual and I 'm falling asleep and I could see everyone else falling asleep listening to their pastor .
I do n’t know why they come back -- and even worse , why they bring their kids .
Why do you think that is ?
They do n't really know any other way to raise children than with religion or to say , " You have to be good because you 're going to hell otherwise , " or " God wants you to be good . "
They do n't really know that there are any alternatives .
One of my good friends , Dale McGowan , wrote a book called Parenting Beyond Belief with contributions from atheists about issues that atheist parents face , like , " Do you tell your kids about Santa Claus ? "
Some say you do .
Some say , " No , that ’s as bad as telling them that there 's a God . "
One example : How do you teach a kid to not steal ?
Well , just ask them questions .
“ How would you feel if someone stole from you ? ” “ Well , I would n't like that . ”
Well , there you go .
So do n't treat the other person like that .
It 's a very Socratic type of asking the kid questions , seeing what they come up with .
Usually what they come up does n't have to do with religion .
It 's following the Golden Rule sort of thing .
You 're not a Hitchens - style atheist with a big axe to grind .
Right .
And I 'm not an anti-theist .
I would love to see a world where religion does n't play a role , but I do n't see religion as this complete force for evil .
I came from a religious family .
Most of the people I know are religious people .
And these are not bad people .
These are people who think very rationally in just about every area of their life , but kind of suspend that when it comes to religion .
Religion in that sense does n't bother me .
It gets them through the day .
It gives them hope . [ But ]
I do n't agree with the rationale for why it gives them hope .
Religion can do a lot of good things .
It may not be because God exists , but because of the structure that 's around it .
You say religion gets people through the day or gives them hope .
What does that for you and other atheists ?
If I 'm ever sad or if something 's going bad , I know I have friends I can talk to , people out there who will show me the love that I might need .
And I know if I 'm in a jam or I do something wrong , no one else is going to fix my situation .
I know that I have to do it myself and I have the power to do it myself .
Once you realize that you have the power to change a lot of things in your life , that does give you hope .
In the book , you say that you do n't feel " lost " in the sense of being lonely , desperate and without hope .
You ask , " Is being down and lonely a prerequisite to finding God ? " and " Did I have to go through trauma and crisis to find something meaningful ? "
Yeah .
At one of the churches I went to , the pastor asked a number of her churchgoers to write on a sheet of paper what you felt like before and after you found God .
She had a lot of these people read their " before and afters . "
For just about all of the people that were up there , their “ before ” words were “ I was lost , I was hopeless , I was depressed , ” and afterwards they were " found " and happy and full of joy .
It really seemed that the prerequisites for them finding God was that they were going through this miserable , horrible part of their life .
I 'm just thinking , I 'm not sad , I 'm not depressed .
So does that mean , oh , God 's shut out of my life or there 's no way I 'm going to find God now because I 'm a happy person ?
It seemed just very strange to see so many people have those experiences .
No one was saying , “ I was fine before and I 'm better now . ”
They were all saying , “ I was hopeless and miserable .
And now that I 've found God , I 'm much better . ”
You also said that you rarely feel lonely or apathetic , and that being an atheist actually gives you confidence and more passion to help people than , for example , when you were being raised as a Jain .
When I was religious , if we knew a friend that was going through a rough time or we saw homeless people on the street , I would always hear , " You should pray for them , " or be thankful that God did n't put you in that situation .
There was nothing , when I was growing up , about whether we should actually go out and make them lunch or build houses or something like that .
And once I became an atheist , it was very clear that I can do something for people who are less fortunate .
No God is going to do it for them .
I need to get out and donate blood or donate money to causes that help those groups of people .
I 'm not saying Christians would n't do that , but their reasoning for doing it is very different .
I actually think the atheist reasoning -- that we have to help them because God 's not going to do it -- is a more moral way than to say , “ Pray for them ” or “ We should do it because God wants us to . ”
There ’s a stereotype that atheists do n't volunteer that much or do n't contribute to charities .
Unfortunately , from what I 've seen , I agree with [ it ] .
We do n't do it nearly as much as we talk about it .
I would love to see that change .
There is a meeting every year of the heads of a lot of national atheist groups .
One thing we discussed this past January is what sort of community service activity we can all do .
This is one of the places where religion really does do a much better job of community service than atheists do .
Whatever their reasoning is , [ religious people are ] doing more of it and they 're doing it a lot better than we are .
We need to learn from their example .
There are exceptions .
I know that one of the local groups in Chicago goes to the food depository every month with a big group of atheists .
They go there and help out .
Did you put money in the collection plates at these churches ?
No .
Which churches did you like best and why ?
There 's a couple of churches that I really liked .
I thought Joel Osteen 's was really good .
A lot of atheists make fun of me for that .
I know a lot of Christians disagree with me on that because they see him as “ Christian lite . ”
But I thought his message was just one of optimism , even if it is the prosperity gospel .
He makes you feel good .
And when I wake up on a Sunday , if I 'm with my parents , Joel Osteen is on the TV because my mom likes listening to him .
[ He ] just reaches out to people , whether or not you really believe in God .
And he does n't reference God or the Bible a lot .
I think that 's for good reason .
I 've been to Willow Creek a few times .
I really like that church .
I love the sermons that they have .
They do reference the Bible a lot more , but you walk out of there thinking about your life and what you can do better .
I download their podcast .
I download Mars Hill with Rob Bell sometimes .
It 's fun to listen to .
But I was listening to an older Willow Creek podcast [ by ] Bill Hybels about the myths of being gay .
One of those myths was that being gay is not a choice .
He was saying , " That 's not true , " basically -- that it is a choice .
I 'm listening and thinking , this is one of the problems we have in this country and it 's being propagated by this church .
And that depresses me .
They also promote intelligent design -- or many of their pastors do , anyway .
I do n't think they really seek out good scientific information on that stuff .
So on a lot of those issues , there are things I really disagree with .
There were a couple of smaller churches that I really liked , [ such as ] a house church in Yorkville , Illinois .
[ The pastor there ] was trying to form another community .
I have a Web site , friendlyatheist.com .
He comments on there a lot and always has something good to say from a Christian perspective , so much so that I actually asked him if he would just kind of do a Q&A , like “ Ask a Christian Pastor . ”
People submitted questions and he responded to every single one of them .
Atheists said , " Wow , I did n't know there were Christians that thought like that . "
And you had other people saying , " Oh , he 's not a true Christian . "
Which churches did you like least and why ?
There was a church where they had the big - screen monitors everywhere --[ it was ] a high school gym , essentially .
You do n't need big - screen TVs to watch the pastor when he's not that far away from you .
The program we were given for the day basically had the outline of what [ the pastor ] was going to talk about with blanks written down .
This is not what was written in there , but this is an example : God is ____ .
And then , during the sermon , he would say , “ God is good .
Write that down . ”
He actually said that .
And you would fill in the blank .
Yes .
It was so childish .
You receive letters from people .
Could you describe some ?
I do n’t get a lot of “ You 're going to hell ” at all .
That 's very different from a lot of atheist authors .
I 've gotten several letters from Christians , some [ of whom are ] pastors who are reading it in their church book club or something .
And they said , " Our church is working to make sure that people that come to our church are not turned off and they know the reasons why we 're doing things . "
[ But ] some of them are just funny .
I got a letter from one woman who said , “ I know Satan is real because he left a message on my answering machine . ”
I wrote her back and said , “ Did you star - 69 the number or save the tape ?
Because I 'm sure we could find an explanation for this . ”
One person wrote , “ I just want you to know , if you use physics , if you understand the laws of physics , bumblebees can't fly .
They fly because God wants them to . ”
I responded with , “ Actually , here 's a Wikipedia link to bumblebees and the section about how they do fly and here 's another actual science Web page that explains why bumblebees fly despite that myth . ”
She writes back and says she 's not going to look at the link , she just has faith that God helps them fly .
That 's so depressing .
They do n't even want to listen to what I have to say .
But I really do n't get a lot of those .
At the end of the book , you talk about what it would take to convince you or why you were not convinced .
I do n't know any atheists that are saying , “ There is no God , I will never pay attention to the evidence . ”
I do n't know a single atheist that thinks that way , even though that 's the stereotype .
Atheists say , “ I do n't believe in God .
But if you show me the evidence , I 'll look at it , I 'll think about it . ”
One of the things that would convince me that there 's maybe some supernatural power at work is a miracle .
If I saw a real miracle that really had no explanation , I would have to second - guess my atheism .
I 've gotten emails that said , " Here 's a miracle . "
Every example they give has a perfectly logical explanation to it .
You hear stories about people saying , " I have a friend of a friend who saw someone 's amputated arm grow back . "
Of course , they were never there and I never saw that on YouTube .
Someone get a video camera .
That would be nice .
But if I actually saw that firsthand , that would go against everything I think is true about the world .

Apple has seeded version 1.1 of ZFS ( Zettabyte File System ) for Mac OS X to Developers this week .
The preview updates a previous build released on June 26 , 2007 .
In the release notes , Apple confirms that the original release of Mac OS X Leopard ( 10.5 ) will only offer Read - Only ZFS .
As a result , no ZFS pools or filesystems can be modified or created under 10.5.0 .
This developer 's preview enables full read / write capability , including the creation / destruction of ZFS pools and filesystems .
ZFS is described as " a fundamentally new approach to data management .
We 've blown away 20 years of obsolete assumptions , eliminated complexity at the source , and created a storage system that 's actually a pleasure to use . "
The initial version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard is rumored to be released on October 26th , 2007 .
It 's unclear when Leopard will incorporate full Read / Write ZFS support , but it seems clear that Apple is working on adding this functionality .
Homophobia directed at the elderly has many faces .
Home health aides must be reminded not to wear gloves at inappropriate times , for example while opening the front door or making the bed , when there is no evidence of H.I.V. infection , said Joe Collura , a nurse at the largest home care agency in Greenwich Village .

A lesbian checking into a double room at a Chicago rehabilitation center was greeted by a roommate yelling , “ Get the man out of here ! ”
The lesbian patient , Renae Ogletree , summoned a friend to take her elsewhere .
Sometimes tragedy results .
In one nursing home , an openly gay man , without family or friends , was recently moved off his floor to quiet the protests of other residents and their families .
He was given a room among patients with severe disabilities or dementia .
The home called upon Amber Hollibaugh , now a senior strategist at the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the author of the first training curriculum for nursing homes .
Ms. Hollibaugh assured the 79 - year - old man that a more humane solution would be found , but he hanged himself , Ms. Hollibaugh said .
She was unwilling to identify the nursing home or even its East Coast city , because she still consults there , among other places .
While this outcome is exceedingly rare , moving gay residents to placate others is common , said Dr. Melinda Lantz , chief of geriatric psychiatry at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York , who spent 13 years in a similar post at the Jewish Home and Hospital Lifecare System .
“ When you ’re stuck and have to move someone because they ’re being ganged up on , you put them with people who are very confused , ” Dr. Lantz said .
“ That ’s a terrible nuts - and - bolts reality . ”
The most common reaction , in a generation accustomed to being in the closet , is a retreat back to the invisibility that was necessary for most of their lives , when homosexuality was considered both a crime and a mental illness .
A partner is identified as a brother .
No pictures or gay - themed books are left around .
Elderly heterosexuals also suffer the indignities of old age , but not to the same extent , Dr. Lantz said .
“ There is something special about having to hide this part of your identity at a time when your entire identity is threatened , ” she said .
“ That ’s a faster pathway to depression , failure to thrive and even premature death . ”
And boy , if I were the rest of the world , I 'd be less than thrilled to know Qwest had build a redundant fiber optics network for US intelligence agencies throughout my country .
The rest of this chronology just describes how Qwest has built several fiber optics networks for our intelligence agencies -- potentially global in scale -- that they claim are " impervious to attack . "
While it 's not clear whether these networks are connected up with public networks or not ( GovNet , the proposed network for the government that got scotched with 9/11 , was supposed to be private ) , it does raise the question of how much of these global networks are for communicating ( that is , secure communication within an intelligence agency ) and how much are for eavesdropping .
From reading the filing , I think ( though I think others will disagree ) that what Nacchio describes as Groundbreaker is at least the physical tap into switches that we know AT&T to have accomplished .
That 's important , because Nacchio walked out of his meeting on February 27 , 2001 willing to do Groundbreaker ( at least the hardware side of it ) , but unwilling to do something else NSA requested at that meeting .
Which means the telecom involvement goes beyond simply tapping into the switches , and the switch - related aspect is not the troubling side of it .
The documents made available by the RMN yesterday provide more details about what the NSA and other government agencies have been doing with fiber optic networks -- but it 's still not exactly clear what those documents show .
As a preliminary , I 'm going to try to put the contents of this CIPA filing into a coherent chronology , to clarify some of the issues .
The filing is what Nacchio submitted when the judge said his previous CIPA filing was not detailed enough , and it has a timeline going back to the late 1990s .
Late 1997 : Dean Wandry ( the govt accounts person ) and Nacchio meet with a Lieutenant General , who tells Wandry the government wants to use Qwest 's network for government purposes .
The General also asked that Nacchio get a security clearance .
The Agency gave Qwest the business with just a phone call 's notice , but prohibited Qwest from announcing it publicly .
1998 : The Agency expands its work with Qwest , having it construct fiber from Qwest 's international gateway that eventually linked up with a local vendor 's network .
Early 1999 : Qwest joins a Computer Sciences Corporation team to bid for NSA business , including Groundbreaker .
Unknown , 1999 : Payne and Nacchio in discussions about $ 500 million business .
August 1999 : James Payne replaces Dean Wandry as Qwest 's govt accounts person .
Qwest remained in its relationship with its first government agency customer , building redundancies into its network .
At that point , Qwest had a sole source contract expected to bring in up to $ 500 million , and had been given a contractor rating of 96 ( the average rating was in the 70s ) .
Note that there were " Senatorial maneuverings " that held up the project at this stage .
December 1999 : Nacchio attends the first meeting to discuss a business opportunity with govt agency .
Late 1999 to early 2000 : Richard Clarke introduces himself to Qwest to begin discussions on GovNet .
He revealed to Mr. Payne his knowledge about the classified work the company had already done for various agencies , and impressing Mr. Payne with his vision for a future private network that would be impervious to cyber - warfare and government - wide , sweeping up both classified and non-classified agencies .
This vision became known as GovNet.
Mr. Payne arranged for Mr. Clarke to tour Qwest 's " CyberCenter " in Sterling , Virginia on June 22 , 2000 .
January 2000 : Second meeting to discuss business opportunity with govt agency .
June 2000 : Nacchio meets with DISA about building a private fiber optic network .
July 6 , 2000 : James Payne attends a security briefing on some of this , and is read into various programs with the agency .
September 2000 : Qwest begins to talk about building network in South America , connected to the US .
[ The agency ] told Qwest it wanted a continental backbone in South America and back to Washington , D.C .
September 2000 : Qwest does ( or contemplates ) work with an " Army customer " -- the description remains redacted .
September 2000 : Nacchio meets a second time with DISA about building a private fiber optic network , both in the Continental US and in Europe .
Payne described the opportunity this way .
My team has been working with the DOD customer and various classified agencies to move quickly to implement a world wide network using existing Qwest contract vehicles .
September 2000 to February 2001 : Qwest had meetings to discuss work done outside the continental US -- in this case , to extend the contracting Agency 's network in Europe and the Middle East , which Qwest had already done for the Agency .
This passage from the filing gives some idea of the scope of what we 're talking :
Qwest 's European network ended at Prague , and Mr. Nacchio concluded that he would have to go out and get routes from there down through the Red Sea and into India to create a fully global network .
An email included as an exhibit elaborates .
The [ redacted ] program was awarded to Qwest on September 15 , 2000 .
This was a joint effort with K/Q that connects [ redacted ] hub cities in Europe in a private line service .
Also throughout this period , the contracting agency would call Qwest with concerns about its financial viability , whether it had to do with the telecom bust , or a potential buy - out offer from Deutsche Telecom .
[ Note , all four of these September 2000 references may be to the same international program , though it appears that there are at least two discrete ones , one extending existing networks in Europe and the Middle East , and one establishing a network in Latin America . ]
February 2001 : Discussions on Groundbreaker are started .
Some descriptions of it include :
Qwest 's portion consisted of a $ 50 - $ 100 million opportunity , planned for implementation in 2001 , to construct a CONUS ( continential US ) private fiber network and provide related network services .
[ snip ]
The Groundbreaker project grew out of the aftermath from a fire at Ft. Meade which destroyed a large NSA data center .
It was thereafter decided to outsource much of this work to private industry .
The project was described in a July 31 , 2001 press release issued by CSC as providing " secure and non-secure telephony and network services , distributed computer services , and enterprise and security management of the non-mission information technology infrastructure at NSA headquarters and surrounding offices .
One of the suits against AT&T describes the program for " development of a center for monitoring long distance calls and internet transactions and other digital information for the exclusive use of NSA " as being named Pioneer - Groundbreaker , or Groundbreaker Enterprise System within AT&T .
Like the description of the CSC team , the AT&T suit describes discussions about Groundbreaker as having started before Bush was elected , then get put on hold , then resuscitated shortly after Bush came to office .
If the AT&T suit is correct ( and Nacchio 's filing says they intend to corroborate the accounts of Nacchio , Wandry , and Payne with something from the AT&T suit , perhaps by subpoenaing Mark Klein , it means Qwest was willing to do at least the physical side of the deal , allowing the government to tap into their switches .
Which makes sense -- if it was supposed to replace a large " data center " at NSA , it would need to be involved in data .
Further this seems to match Naccio 's description of Qwest 's bid to do a " ' CyberCenter ' solution to the Groundbreaker networking issue . "
February 27 , 2001 : Nacchio's meeting at NSA headquarters .
Groundbreaker was discussed , as was the request that Qwest 's General Counsel would go on describe as illegal .
It was this pending opportunity that lead [ sic ] to Mr. Nacchio 's first meeting with NSA , which took place on February 27 , 2001 at the NSA Headquarters at Ft. Meade , Maryland .
Mr. Nacchio expected to discuss the $ 50 - 100 million " Groundbreaker " opportunity at this meeting , and he thought great progress was made on the substantive discussions .
[ At least one sentence redacted . ]
Mr Nacchio walked out thinking that the NSA $ 50 - 100 million opportunity remained viable .
This passage makes two points clear : Qwest was bidding for the Groundbreaker program , and Nacchio remained willing to do that Groundbreaker program after the meeting at which he refused to do something else ( note his expectation for the $ 50 - 100 million tied to Groundbreaker remained constant ) .
It was not Groundbreaker that he refused .
March 2001 : Announcement that " network service " on Groundbreaker delayed until 2002 .
March 7 , 2001 : White House Situation Room meeting with Condi , Richard Clarke , General Raduege , Nacchio , Payne , and representatives from Raytheon and GTE .
At the meeting , Mr. Clarke asked the group if it was possible to create a network , then proceeded to describe [ redacted ] .
Mr. Payne had n't known that Clarke had the " need to know " that would have allowed him to know the details of this project .
After describing this " hypothetical " network , Mr. Clarke asked the group what kind of company could do this .
Everyone said no one could , it could n't be done .
Mr. Nacchio , instead of saying " I already built this network twice , once for [ redacted ] and once for DISA , " instead simply described how it could be done .
Later , Paul Kurtz ( a NSC staffer ) told Mr. Payne that Mr. Clarke did this because he wanted to see Mr. Nacchio 's response . [ snip ] ... what Mr. Clarke had in mind for GovNet was an " airgap network , " impervious to outside attack .
May 9 , 2001 : Meeting with Richard Clarke on GovNet at Anschutz Ranch .
June 6 , 2001 : Meeting with Wolfowitz on GovNet ?
July 31 , 2001 : CSC wins Groundbreaker contract ; Qwest is not included among sub-contractors .
NSA 's press release states the program will be " fully functional " by November 2001 .
Your Giuliani observation of the day
Take this for what you will :
Over the past month , I 've had at least two dozen conversations with various people about Rudy Giuliani 's presidential campaign .
A lot of these people are Democrats , but there were a healthy number of Republicans and independents as well .
These are all smart observers of politics who generally do not make knee - jerk assessments .
The one common denominator was that , at some point , all of these people had lived in the New York City area while Rudy was mayor .
What is astonishing is that , despite the fact that this collection of individuals would likely disagree about pretty much everything , there was an airtight conensus about one and only one point :
A Giuliani presidency would be an unmitigated disaster for the United States .
That is all .
UPDATE : Commenters have reasonably asked the " why ? " question .
For some answers from New Yorkers , click here and here .
By Charles Hawley and David Gordon Smith , Der Spiegel
SPIEGEL ONLINE : So what are the lessons of the Surge ?
Hersh :
The Surge means basically that , in some way , the president has accepted ethnic cleansing , whether he ’s talking about it or not .
When he first announced the Surge in January , he described it as a way to bring the parties together .
He ’s not saying that any more .
I think he now understands that ethnic cleansing is what is going to happen .
You ’re going to have a Kurdistan .
You ’re going to have a Sunni area that we ’re going to have to support forever .
And you ’re going to have the Shiites in the South .

FOR a small , high - tech country such as Estonia , the internet is vital .
But for the past two weeks Estonia 's state websites ( and some private ones ) have been hit by “ denial of service ” attacks , in which a target site is bombarded with so many bogus requests for information that it crashes .
AFP
Tallinn 's unknown soldier , still embattled
The internet warfare broke out on April 27th , amid a furious row between Estonia and Russia over the removal of a Soviet war monument from the centre of the capital , Tallinn , to a military cemetery ( pictured below ) .
The move sparked rioting and looting by several thousand protesters from Estonia 's large population of ethnic Russians , who tend to see the statue as a cherished memorial to wartime sacrifice .
Estonians mostly see it rather as a symbol of a hated foreign occupation .
The unrest , Estonia says , was orchestrated by Russia , which termed the relocation “ blasphemy ” and called for the government 's resignation .
In Moscow , a Kremlin - run youth movement sealed off and attacked Estonia 's embassy , prompting protests from America , NATO and the European Union .
Perhaps taken aback by the belated but firm Western support for Estonia , Russia has backpedalled .
Following a deal brokered by Germany , Estonia 's ambassador left for a “ holiday ” and the blockade ended as abruptly as it began .
But the internet attacks have continued .
Some have involved defacing Estonian websites , replacing the pages with Russian propaganda or bogus apologies .
Most have concentrated on shutting them down .
The attacks are intensifying .
The number on May 9th — the day when Russia and its allies commemorate Hitler 's defeat in Europe — was the biggest yet , says Hillar Aarelaid , who runs Estonia 's cyber - warfare defences .
At least six sites were all but inaccessible , including those of the foreign and justice ministries .
Such stunts happen at the murkier end of internet commerce : for instance , to extort money from an online casino .
But no country has experienced anything on this scale .
The alarm is sounding well beyond Estonia .
NATO has been paying special attention .
“ If a member state 's communications centre is attacked with a missile , you call it an act of war .
So what do you call it if the same installation is disabled with a cyber- attack ? ” asks a senior official in Brussels .
Estonia 's defence ministry goes further : a spokesman compares the attacks to those launched against America on September 11th 2001 .
Two of NATO 's top specialists in internet warfare , plus an American colleague , have hurried to Tallinn to observe the onslaught .
But international law is of little help , complains Rein Lang , Estonia 's justice minister .
The crudest attacks come with the culprit 's electronic fingerprints .
The Estonians say that some of the earliest salvoes came from computers linked to the Russian government .
But most of them come from many thousands of ordinary computers , all over the world .
Some of these are run by private citizens angry with Estonia .
Anonymously posted instructions on how to launch denial - of - service attacks have been sprouting on Russian - language internet sites .
Many others come from “ botnets ” — chains of computers that have been hijacked by viruses to take part in such raids without their owners knowing .
Such botnets can be created , or simply rented from cyber -criminals .
To remain open to local users , Estonia has had to cut access to its sites from abroad .
That is potentially more damaging to the country 's economy than the limited Russian sanctions announced so far , such as cutting passenger rail services between Tallinn and St Petersburg .
It certainly hampers Estonia 's efforts to counter Russian propaganda that portrays the country as a fascist hellhole .
“ We are back to the stone age , telling the world what is going on with phone and fax , ” says an Estonian internet expert .
Mikko Hyppönen of F - Secure , a Finnish internet security company that has been monitoring the attacks , says the best defence is to have strong networks of servers in many countries .
That is not yet NATO 's job .
But it may be soon .
The American people rose up out of their usual apathy and soundly defeated the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 that would have given amnesty to illegal immigrants .
Now , some senators are trying to get Congress to pass a backdoor amnesty by calling it the DREAM Act , and it 's really a nightmare for Americans .
The cutesy title DREAM , which is meant to be a double - entendre , is an acronym for Development , Relief and Education for Alien Minors .
The DREAM Act would allow any illegal immigrant of any age who entered the United States before age 16 and has a high school diploma or equivalent to enroll in any state university and pay only the in - state tuition rate .
Being an illegal immigrant is the prerequisite to getting this preferential treatment , which is denied to legal aliens with valid student visas .
In - state tuition can amount to a taxpayer subsidy of up to $ 20,000 a year , depending on what the university charges students from the other 49 states .
The illegal immigrant also becomes eligible for taxpayer - paid federal student loans and federal work - study programs , for which lawful foreign students are ineligible .
There is no upper age limit ; any illegal immigrant is eligible for this preference by declaring he entered the U.S. illegally before his 16th birthday .
The illegal immigrant does n't have to prove when he entered the U.S. ; he can simply make a sworn statement .
But that 's not all .
The illegal immigrant would be rewarded with conditional lawful permanent resident , green card , status , which can be converted to a non-conditional green card .
The immigrant can use his new legal status to seek green cards for the parents who brought him into the United States .
The student has six years to convert his green card from conditional to non-conditional .
He just needs to complete two years of study at a college or serve two years in the military , and if he has already had two years of college , he can convert his green card to non-conditional immediately .
The illegal immigrant who applies for the DREAM
Act can count his years under conditional green card status toward the five years needed to attain citizenship .
That 's a fast track to citizenship that is not available to aliens who are lawfully present in the United States .
Section 4 ( f ) provides that , once an illegal immigrant files an application , the government cannot deport him .
A federal officer who shares with another federal agency any information on the illegal immigrant 's application , such as admission of illegal entry , can be fined $ 10,000 .
Giving in - state college tuition to illegal immigrants is so unpopular with many Americans that the only way a Congressman could support this bill is by hoping it passes before the public discovers how bad it is .
Arizona 's Proposition 300 , which specifically bars Arizona universities from giving in - state tuition rates to illegal immigrants , passed in 2006 with a majority of 71.4 percent .
Support for in - state tuition rates for illegal immigrants was the No. 1 issue that caused the upset defeat of former U.S. Rep .
Tom Osborne , R - Neb. ( the former University of Nebraska football coach ) in his campaign for governor of Nebraska in 2006 .
He fumbled and endorsed in - state tuition for illegal immigrants while his opponent , Republican Gov. Dave Heineman , vetoed it and ran campaign ads against it .
The DREAM Act would give amnesty not only to illegal immigrants , but also give amnesty to 10 states that have been flagrantly violating federal law .
The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act expressly forbids a state to give in - state tuition rates to illegal immigrants unless that subsidy is also granted to all U.S. citizens nationwide .
The DREAM Act would retroactively repeal that law , thereby saving the 10 states from punishment and equal - protection lawsuits filed by out - of - state U.S. citizens and law - abiding foreign students .
The 10 states that have been engaging in a 21st century use of the 19th century theory called nullification , defying a federal law the state does n't like , are California , Illinois , Kansas , Nebraska , New Mexico , New York , Oklahoma , Texas , Utah and Washington .
We are indebted to professor Kris W. Kobach of the University of Missouri - Kansas City for publicizing how the DREAM
Act treats illegal immigrants more favorably than U.S. citizens and legal aliens .
The bill 's sponsor , Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , has not been successful in attaching it to a defense authorization bill , but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , says he will bring it up in November .
Tell your U.S. senators the DREAM
Act must be defeated .
Ministers are urging schools to involve police in the most serious cases of cyberbullying of pupils and staff in a new crackdown on the " unaccceptable " and " insidious " use of new technology .
They say some instances might break criminal or civil law protecting people from threatening communications and could lead to Asbos .
Police intervention , along with that of mobile phone and web companies , might be needed to track the digital footprint of perpetrators .
The threat of legal sanctions on top of school disciplinary measures , including the confiscation of mobile phones and temporary bans or restricted access to the internet , is recommended in far tougher guidance to combat the increasing incidence of this form of bullying .
Research for the new campaign found one in three 12 - 15 - year - olds reported having been cyberbullied , a higher proportion than other surveys .
Teacher unions , too , say members are being subjected to demeaning and offensive attacks through pupils ' videos and comments on websites .
The drive includes a new emphasis on curbing " bystander bullying " by young people who pass on images or comments made by the original bully without thinking .
Sanctions should also be devised to deter these " accessories " , according to the government , which is using on - line pop-ups to warn any young people tempted into this behaviour : " Bullying causes depression , self - harm and even suicide .
Laugh at it and you are part of it . "
The campaign , drawn up with the help of industry , gives practical tips including not responding to malicious texts or emails , saving evidence , reporting incidents , keeping passwords safe and not revealing details such as mobile phone numbers over the internet .
Parents should also be fully involved .
Ed Balls , the children secretary , said : " Schools need to get to grips with newer forms of bullying and the different impact these have on the victim ... bystanders can inadvertently become perpetrators .
Simply by passing on videos or images , they are playing a part in bullying .
It is important pupils are aware that their actions have severe consequences and participating in such activity will not be tolerated . "
Unions welcomed the measures , although Steve Sinnott , general secretary of the NUT , said : " As good as the guidance is , parents , teachers and young people will still need the assurance that when a complaint is made to a provider offensive material is removed . "
Ministers should monitor the effect of the guidance closely to see if further changes in the law were needed .
Ministers will today also challenge homophobic bullying , saying it must become as unacceptable as racist remarks .
They were shocked by a report by the charity Stonewall which said homophobic remarks were still common in everyday conversation .
Rainfall uncovers Viking treasure in Swedish garden
Stockholm | September 16 , 2007 1:17:27 PM
IST
A bout of torrential rain has uncovered a Viking treasure trove in a Swedish garden .
Tage Pettersson , a farmer , discovered two coins in his lawn on the island of Gotland , following a heavy downpour in the region .
Pettersson then called in Gotland 's archaeologists , who last week found a further 52 coins on the site .
According to a report by the local daily , The Local , most of the coins are German , English and Arabic currency from the late 900s and early 1000s .
But archaeologists are most excited about the presence of six very rare Swedish coins , from the reign of Olof Skotkonug , king of Sweden from 994 - 1022 .
One of the Swedish coins has never been found in Sweden before , although an example has been found in Poland , and one of the other coins is only the second of its kind to have been found .
Archaeologist Dan Carlsson told the daily , Svenska Dagbladet , that the coins were " very well preserved , and came from a period about which they knew little in terms of coin history " .
He said the English coins were likely to have been paid to the Vikings as an incitement to let them live in peace .
Gotland is one of the richest sources anywhere of buried Viking treasure .
Discoveries of coins and other treasure are made on a regular basis .

“ We are acutely aware that the credibility of the United Nations human rights system hinges upon satisfactory implementation of the review , since the UPR has the potential to greatly influence and address human rights situations on the ground , ” she told the Council which is currently meeting in its sixth session in Geneva .
Under this new mechanism , over the course of four years , all UN Member States – at the rate of 48 a year – will be reviewed to assess whether they have fulfilled their human rights obligations .
“ Through the UPR all UN Member States will now be reviewed in the same comprehensive manner on the basis of universal and equal parameters and standards , ” she said .
“ At the same time , countries under review will be fully involved in what is envisaged as a participatory and inclusive review process . ”
In her address to the 47 - member body , the High Commissioner also highlighted problems faced by countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , Iran and Myanmar .
On the DRC , Ms. Arbour voiced concern over the lack of progress in the vast Central Africa nation which is seeking to rebuild after a brutal six year civil war that killed 4 million in fighting , attendant hunger and disease .
The High Commissioner pointed out that no perpetrators who committed serious crimes committed in the first half of this year have been arrested and brought to justice .
“ Interference by military and political authorities in the administration of justice is prevalent , particularly in high - profile cases , ” she noted .
“ Recent trials raise serious questions about the independence of the judiciary . ”
While visiting Teheran , Iran ’s capital , earlier this month , Ms. Arbour met with senior Government officials as well as with local women ’s rights defenders on how to improve respect for human rights .
She expressed to them her particular concerns regarding the death penalty being applied to juveniles and the need to defend the right to peaceful public expression , she told the Council , which began its session on 10 September .
Ms. Arbour also said that she has been following the suppression of peaceful protests in Myanmar with mounting concern .
“ I urge the authorities to release detainees and political prisoners and ensure respect for fundamental rights , ” she told the Council , whose three - week session wraps up on 28 September .
In a related development , UN independent experts today jointly called on Myanmar to immediately release over 150 people brutally arrested last month after protesting the surge in fuel prices .
“ It is shocking that peaceful demonstrators have received life sentences in trials without any basic guarantee of the due process of law and that local journalists were prevented from reporting on these measures , ” three Special Rapporteurs said in a joint statement .
Noting the “ important and courageous role ” that women , student leaders and monks played in the protests , the experts said that the “ Myanmar authorities should be proud of its vibrant civil society and engage without hesitations in a constructive and transparent dialogue with all parties so as to lay down a roadmap for a healthy and empowered democratic society , for the benefit of the country and the region at large .
They also warned that Myanmar can push forward with political transition unless “ ordinary people have the space to express their views and discontent , peacefully and in public . ”
The three experts who issued today ’s statement are Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro , the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar ; Ambeyi Ligabo , the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; and Leandro Despouy , the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers .
Late last night we started receiving reports from readers experiencing problems with Windows Genuine Advantage authentication .
Users of both Windows XP and Windows Vista were writing to say that they could not validate their installations using WGA , and one user even said that his installation was invalidated by the service .
We contacted our sources at Microsoft , who told us off the record that the company is aware of a major WGA server outage affecting users across the globe .
The Windows Genuine Advantage support forum has exploded with complaints as a result , and Phil Liu , WGA project manager , says that he wo n't sleep until the problem is fixed .
Windows Vista and XP are affected , 32 - and 64 - bit versions .
Microsoft is telling users who are affected that they should " try again " later , with some support techs telling readers that Microsoft is aiming to have a fix in place by Tuesday , August 28 .
That would mean the outage will last more than three days , given that it started last night ( and may have started earlier ; we 're hearing reports of some users running into this earlier in the week , on a limited basis ) .
Reader Aaron
Woolf tells us he was unable to validate patches for installation on a developer 's copy of Vista pulled from MSDN .
He writes , " My legitimate MSDN - acquired Vista Ultimate , which has been running , activated and validated for several months , now fails WGA . "
Others have reported similar difficulties .
How does this affect you ?
If you use Windows , do your best to avoid anything that requires a ping to WGA .
That means you should stay away from patches and add - ons until the coast is clear .
WGA will not reach out across the Internet and deactivate your copy of Windows , but you should avoid talking to a WGA server for any reason .
For those of you doing installations and upgrades this weekend , we recommend that you avoid activation at this time .
Remember that you can run Windows legally for 30 days without activating .
If you attempt a validation and it fails , your install may be marked as non-genuine , which could lead to several annoyances .
First things first , do not reboot a Windows machine that has been marked as non-genuine .
Once you do so , you will lose functionality and the Aero interface .
It would be best to wait until this problem has been resolved .
The cause
Right now we do n't have official word on a cause , but one source familiar with WGA tells us that the issue may be caused by updates to the service that were required after Microsoft expanded the number of activations keys available for Windows XP .
However , the sense we get from Phil Liu is that Microsoft is pretty much in the dark right now .
More as this develops ...
Update : Word from Microsoft is that this problem has been fixed , and all users affected should revisit the WGA site and re-validate .
There 's no explanation as to why Microsoft was originally telling people to wait until Tuesday , but the good news is that the problem has been solved .
In response , R. Nicholas Burns , an under secretary of state who is the chief American strategist on Iran , told the group that negotiations with Tehran could still be going on when Mr. Bush leaves office in January 2009 .
The hawks in the room reported later that they were deeply unhappy — but not surprised — by Mr. Burns ’s assessment , which they interpreted as a tacit acknowledgment that the Bush administration had no “ red line ” beyond which Iran would not be permitted to step .
But conservatives inside the administration have continued in private to press for a tougher line , making arguments that their allies outside government are voicing publicly .
“ Regime change or the use of force are the only available options to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapons capability , if they want it , ” said John R. Bolton , the former United States ambassador to the United Nations .
Only a few weeks ago , one of Mr. Cheney ’s top aides , David Wurmser , told conservative research groups and consulting firms in Washington that Mr. Cheney believed that Ms. Rice ’s diplomatic strategy was failing , and that by next spring Mr. Bush might have to decide whether to take military action .
The vice president ’s office has declined to talk about Mr. Wurmser ’s statements , and says Mr. Cheney is fully on board with the president ’s strategy .
In a June 1 article for Commentary magazine , the neoconservative editor Norman Podhoretz laid out what a headline described as “ The Case for Bombing Iran . ”
“ In short , the plain and brutal truth is that if Iran is to be prevented from developing a nuclear arsenal , there is no alternative to the actual use of military force — any more than there was an alternative to force if Hitler was to be stopped in 1938 , ” Mr. Podhoretz wrote .
Mr. Burns and officials from the Treasury Department have been trying to use the mounting conservative calls for a military strike to press Europe and Russia to expand economic sanctions against Iran .
Just last week , Israel ’s transportation minister and former defense minister , Shaul Mofaz , visited Washington and told Ms. Rice that sanctions must be strong enough to get the Iranians to stop enriching uranium by the end of 2007 .
While Mr. Mofaz did not threaten a military strike , Israeli officials said he told Ms. Rice that by the end of the year , Israel “ would have to reassess where we are . ”
But those who are reading Mr. Khan ’s blog include officials at the Combating Terrorism Center who , since last year , have been training F.B.I. agents and analysts with the government ’s joint terrorism task forces .
Center officials say Mr. Khan ’s blog yielded confirmation of an important discovery : that a host of militant sheiks and scholars , dead and alive , are today far more influential than Osama bin Laden .
These men include Abdullah Yusuf Azzam , a mentor of Mr. bin Laden ’s who promoted global jihad with his writings until his death in 1989 , and the center ’s findings helped the authorities conclude that Al Qaeda is but part of a larger , and diffuse , ideological movement .
Similar efforts to monitor online jihadists are under way in cities like Berlin , where intelligence and law enforcement officials have created a new multi-agency Internet center , and New York , where the police department this summer published a report on Islamic extremism that drew from the department ’s online sleuthing .
Quite apart from the intelligence value of leaving the sites up , it ’s not clear what can be gained by shutting them down .
Operators of the sites have proved difficult to put behind bars , although legal experts offered mixed views on Mr. Khan ’s blog .
“ If I were a prosecutor I would look at treason , ” said Andrew C. McCarthy , a former chief assistant United States attorney who led the 1995 terrorism prosecution against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman .
While treason has a large burden of proof and such a charge has been brought only once since World War II , Mr. McCarthy said the 1996 antiterrorism law should “ make it much easier for prosecutors to win cases , especially in national security . ”
“ I ’d also want to look at criminal solicitation , ” Mr. McCarthy said .
“ I would probably scrub the information this guy is putting out , and see if it contains what you would need to convince a jury , specific commands to commit acts of violence . ”

" He has been too benevolent , " she said .
" He 's right that a happy employee is a productive long - term employee , but he could force employees to pick up a little more of the burden . "
Mr. Sinegal says he pays attention to analysts ' advice because it enforces a healthy discipline , but he has largely shunned Wall Street pressure to be less generous to his workers .
" When Jim talks to us about setting wages and benefits , he does n't want us to be better than everyone else , he wants us to be demonstrably better , " said John Matthews , Costco 's senior vice president for human resources .
With his ferocious attention to detail and price , Mr. Sinegal has made Costco the nation 's leading warehouse retailer , with about half of the market , compared with 40 percent for the No.2 , Sam 's Club .
But Sam's is not a typical runner - up : it is part of the Wal - Mart empire , which , with $ 288 billion in sales last year , dwarfs Costco .
But it is the customer , more than the competition , that keeps Mr. Sinegal 's attention .
" We 're very good merchants , and we offer value , " he said .
" The traditional retailer will say : ' I 'm selling this for $ 10 .
I wonder whether I can get $ 10.50 or $ 11 . '
We say : ' We 're selling it for $ 9 .
How do we get it down to $ 8 ? '
We understand that our members do n't come and shop with us because of the fancy window displays or the Santa Claus or the piano player .
They come and shop with us because we offer great values . "
Costco was founded with a single store in Seattle in 1983 ; it now has 457 stores , mostly in the United States , but also in Canada , Britain , South Korea , Taiwan and Japan .
Wal - Mart , by contrast , had 642 Sam's Clubs in the United States and abroad as of Jan. 31 .
Costco 's profit rose 22 percent last year , to $ 882 million , on sales of $ 47.1 billion .
In the United States , its stores average $ 121 million in sales annually , far more than the $ 70 million for Sam's Clubs .
And the average household income of Costco customers is $ 74,000 -- with 31 percent earning over $ 100,000 .
One reason the company has risen to the top and stayed there is that Mr. Sinegal relentlessly refines his model of the warehouse store -- the bare - bones , cement - floor retailing space where shoppers pay a membership fee to choose from a limited number of products in large quantities at deep discounts .
Costco has 44.6 million members , with households paying $ 45 a year and small businesses paying $ 100 .
Introduction
" The biggest trick the devil ever pulled was in getting folks to blame someone other than Hollywood for video DRM . " — not Keyser Söze
Peter Gutmann , author of a well - known and fascinating paper describing the tradeoffs of Microsoft 's content protection system in Windows Vista , is on the hunt again .
Last year , his paper " Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection " painted a grim picture of the lengths Microsoft went to in order to gain full compliance with AACS , the next - gen copy control system for Blu-ray and HD DVD ( and they did go far ) .
Now Gutmann is reiterating his claims but also reportedly digging deep in his attacks on Microsoft .
While Microsoft deserves some of the blame , the bigger story here is the technical nightmare created by AACS and how its tentacles are reaching into the consumer technology we all use daily .
It 's a shame that this is getting lost in the mix , but after discussing the issue with a journalist this weekend , I decided to delve a little more into it here .
Gutmann 's presentation at this year 's USENIX Security Symposium in Boston has been profiled at Network World .
Gutmann 's thesis is fairly basic and unchanged from last year : Microsoft spent way too many resources appeasing Hollywood when it should have been making Windows Vista better .
Gutmann is essentially correct ; any time a consumer electronics manufacturer or other technology company has to waste time with DRM , that company is wasting resources that could be better spent elsewhere if DRM was n't a sad fact of life .
Let no one doubt that .
All of this attention focused on Microsoft is missing the bigger story , however .
AACS : coming to an ( incorporated ) OS near you
This is important but rarely acknowledged in these discussions ( and my journo discussion partner was rather surprised to learn this ) :
Apple will also have to adopt a strict DRM regimen at the most fundamental levels of Mac OS X in order to be able to ( legally ) play back AACS - protected Blu-ray or HD DVD discs ( e.g. , most commercial discs in those formats ) .
Apple thus far has avoided criticism , but only because the company has not unveiled its full plans for appeasing the various requirements imposed by the AACS Licensing Administrator for next - gen optical disc DRM .
When Apple does , we 'll all see that Blu-ray / HD DVD support comes with plenty of strings attached — strings that Apple will have to work into its OS , too .
There is no way around it ; something similar to Microsoft 's Protected Media scheme will be required of Mac OS X if Apple is a licensee to AACS .
( The same would be true for Linux , except that AACS wo n't be licensed for Linux desktop use .
There 's no way to securely implement it since desktop Linux is an open environment , and AACS requires keeping secrets . )
Here 's the basic rundown : AACS has " robustness rules " that include strict mandates for the path that video data takes through a software - based system , like a modern PC .
These rules require that decrypted video " not be present on any User - Accessible Bus in analog or unencrypted , compressed form , " because users could possibly record or redirect that content .
Companies like Apple and Microsoft are additionally required to use " encryption , execution of a portion of the implementation in ring zero or supervisor mode ( i.e. , in kernel mode ) , and / or embodiment in a secure physical implementation , " or any other method that can " effectively " keep encryption keys secret .
Furthermore , they are required to use " techniques of obfuscation clearly designed to effectively disguise and hamper attempts to discover the approaches used " to secure the systems .
Thus , video content must travel through the system encrypted and must only interact with authorized components over authorized pathways .
Again , these are the requirements of AACS , and they 're not simple to accomplish , especially in an operating system where there are multiple ways to attack the system .
This is why AACS goes even further , requiring that operating systems constantly monitor the " integrity " of the content protection system and purposely stop playing content in the event that any " unauthorized modifications " are detected .
In this way , the system not only watches the video path as video travels on it , but it monitors the state of the PC as a whole .
So , when thinking about this issue , we have to ask ourselves : is a company like Microsoft or Apple likely to tell Hollywood to jump off a cliff ?
No , because both companies know that users will want to play HD DVD or Blu-ray discs on their computers .
Microsoft did n't tell AACS LA to stuff it , and Apple wo n't tell them to , either .
Not only do both companies want to be a part of the HD " revolution , " but both of them are also DRM developers , too .
While Steve Jobs may be an opponent of DRM for music , he has said on record that his objections to DRM for music do not apply to video .
Timeline flaws adding up
Most of what breaks the " HD experience " on PCs right now stems from AACS 's demands on technology , starting with the requisite HDMI / HDCP support on video cards and displays .
HDMI / HDCP are two key parts of the " secure path " for video , but the two technologies have still not penetrated the PC market in any substantial way .
( I 'm quite surprised that monitor and video card manufacturers were so late implementing HDCP , given that this aspect of AACS has been known about for some time . )
Regardless , note that hardware - level support for AACS ( via HDMI / HDCP ) has nothing to do with Microsoft or Apple , but both companies will have to grapple with balancing the AACS requirements with providing users with a simple playback environment .
Thankfully , Hollywood has backed off the Image Constraint Token for now , the biggest snag in the HDCP plan , likely because of the slow adoption of HDCP itself .
Hollywood holds the cards here : it 's the studios ' content licensing practices at work , and it's their call when to start enforcing technical requirements for full HD display .
So , while the HDCP issues may seem only theoretical for now , those days are numbered .

Republicans get ready to threaten Valerie Plame Wilson with subpoena Michael Roston
Published : Monday June 18 , 2007 Print This Email This As Democrats in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform plow ahead with their investigation of the intelligence used by the Bush administration to build the case for the Iraq War , their Republican colleagues are attempting to up the ante .
Last week , Rep. Tom Davis ( R - VA ) , the ranking minority member of the committee , alleged that former covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson had given false testimony and prepared to threaten her with a subpoena .
The Wilsons , who were not aware of the subpoena threat until contacted last week by RAW STORY , criticized the Republican effort in an exclusive statement .
" This is once again another frivolous attempt to go after Valerie Wilson , and distract from what 's really at issue , " said her husband , Ambassador Joseph Wilson through a spokesman .
During last week 's hearing with Lurita A. Doan , the Administrator of the General Services Administration , who was found to have violated the Hatch Act by politicking in a federal workplace , Davis attempted to refocus the session on Plame 's testimony .
" Valerie Plame Wilson 's sworn statements to this committee are irreconcilably inconsistent with her statements to the CIA inspector general and the Senate Intelligence Committee , " he said in last Wednesday 's hearing .
" I would move the committee direct the chairman to issue a subpoena to Valerie Plame Wilson .... She should be summoned to appear before this committee and address the irregularities in her sworn testimony . "
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , the committee 's chairman , responded that it was not appropriate to issue a subpoena at that particular moment .
" I do n't want to issue a subpoena before we invite a witness .
She did come here voluntarily and if there are questions we want to ask of her and you feel you need an answer , I 'll work with you to get the answers , " the congressman said .
Waxman 's office did not respond to requests from RAW STORY about what steps the committee would take to accommodate the Republicans ' demands .
But Rep.
Davis 's office was ready to press ahead with its attempt to re-direct Waxman 's Iraq investigation onto Plame and her statements .
" We 've asked them to invite her to re-appear , " Brian McNicoll a spokesman for the Republicans on the Oversight Committee said Friday morning .
If the committee 's Democratic members do n't accommodate that request , he added , they 'd move again to compel Plame Wilson 's testimony .
The Republican effort to subpoena Plame , whose husband , Ambassador Joe Wilson , was sent by the CIA to Niger in order to gauge the truth of claims that the African country was supplying uranium to Iraq , faces obstacles that are likely insurmountable .
A majority of members of the committee , which is controlled by the Democratic Party since January , must vote to authorize and issue the subpoena .
" It s not a realistic threat .
A majority vote is required for a the committee to issue a subpoena and it is highly unlikely that Rep.
Davis will be able to marshal any Democratic votes , " said Melanie Sloan , Executive Director of the DC - based group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
Sloan is representing the Wilsons in a civil lawsuit against Vice President Dick Cheney and other Bush administration officials who are accused of blowing Plame 's cover and violating the Wilsons ' privacy .
Still , the Congress members McNicoll represents made clear that their effort to subpoena Wilson was meant to fight back against Waxman 's investigation of President Bush 's push for the invasion of Iraq .
Calling the Doan hearing " a witch hunt , " Rep. Dan Burton ( R - IN ) , the former chairman of the committee during the Clinton administration , assailed Waxman for his attempts to subpoena Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
" To pursue this the way you 're doing it when you wo n't bring Sandy Berger or Valerie Plame before this committee and yet you 'll subpoena the Secretary of State , who 's got a little bit to do around this world .
It just does n't make sense to me , " Burton said during the Wednesday hearing .
On April 25 , the Oversight Committee issued a subpoena for Secretary Rice on a 21 - 10 vote .
Waxman alleges that Rice , who served then as Bush 's National Security Adviser , played a key role in making the case for war .
" There was one person in the White House who had the primary responsibility to get the intelligence about Iraq right : and that was Secretary Rice , who was President Bushs National Security Advisor , " he said in April when issuing the subpoena .
" She has never testified in public about what she may know about how the intelligence was used  or misused  by the White House .
That is all we are asking her to do . "
Waxman had planned to hold a hearing tomorrow , Tuesday , June 19 , with Rice and former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet .
But he wrote a letter June 12 to the two explaining that he was postponing the hearings while deepening the committee 's investigation .
" The Committee has been conducting interviews and depositions of senior government officials with knowledge of prewar intelligence about Iraq 's nuclear program , including John McLaughlin , former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence ; Col. Lawrence Wilkerson , former Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell ; and Carl Ford , former Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research .
The Committee plans to conduct additional interviews over the coming weeks .
In addition , the CIA and State Department have begun to provide important documents to the Committee , " Waxman wrote in a June 12 letter .
" The interviews , depositions , and documents are illuminating the Committee 's inquiry and will provide the predicate for a more thorough hearing with you . "
As this thoroughgoing investigation proceeds , Rep . Davis appeared to be attempting to parry its progress with his accusations against Plame Wilson .
He issued a three - page document entitled " Asked and Answered ... And Answered ... and Answered !
Valerie Plame Wilsons Contradictory Testimony , " last week .
The document parses Wilson 's statements to the Oversight Committee , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , and in other locations , and points to alleged contradictions .
A statement issued by the Wilsons earlier in June responded to claims like Davis 's by saying they had no merit .
" I am dismayed that three Republican Senators ( a minority of the minority ) have again misused the occasion of the publication of an objective investigation by the whole Senate Select Committee on Intelligence of prewar Iraq intelligence to make erroneous assertions ... and to attack improperly prior statements by my wife and me with essentially frivolous claims of purported inconsistency , " Ambassador Wilson wrote in a June 2 letter to Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
" The record demonstrates that no such inconsistencies exist and that partisan politics , not truth , is the basis for the ' additional views ' asserted by Senators Bond , Hatch and Burr . "
Sloan , the counsel to the Wilsons in their civil suit , agreed .
" Ms. Wilsons statements have not been inconsistent , but in any event this is simply another effort to smear Ms. Wilson in order to draw attention away from the real issue : that top White House officials outed a covert CIA officer and endangered our national security , " she said .
In the civil court matter , the Wilsons are waiting to learn whether the judge who is hearing the case will dismiss it from court .
Recently , quite a lot of information about individuals have been aloft in Norway .
The government seems to ignore the problem , and just silence the people complaining and uncovering the problem .
Traditionally , identity theft has not been much of a problem in Norway , but this has changed the last few years , and this incident could pave the road for really large scale identity theft .
A short time - line of the events so far
Here ’s a short time - line , since most foreigners probably ain’t familiar the background of the case .
It is accurate as far as I know .
November 2006 Norwegian government agency Datatilsynet informs several Norwegian telephone operators of security holes in the operators websites .
Middle of June , 2007 Holes still unpatched .
First attack against Talkmore takes place .
Roughly 20000 names and birth numbers is leaked .
July 28. , 2007 A proof - of - concept ( PoC ) code snippet is released to the public .
This PoC - code utilises a security hole in Tele2 ’s web pages .
The PoC was written by a 16 year old Norwegian .
July , 29 .
Major Norwegian newspaper , dagbladet , covers it July , 30 .
Tele2 patches hole .
Still not patched by at least two other phone operators .
July , 30 - 31 .
4500 names are fetched from other operators in Norway .
August , 3 - 4. 63000 names are leaked from GoBergen , a subsidiary of Combitel August , 8 . Tele2 Norway sends letters to 60000 Norwegians , informing about the leak .
In this letter , Tele2 claims they were cracked .
Tele2 reports the incident to KRIPOS , Norwegian criminal police .
September , 13 .
KRIPOS , Norwegian criminal police branch , raids 52 persons across Norway .
Common denominator for these 52 cases is that they have tried the PoC code , or in some other way fetched data from phone operators
The last incident is quite interesting .
Notable persons , like Gisle Hannemyr maintains that nothing illegal is being done .
What birth numbers means in Norway
In Norway , each individual is identified by his birth - date , noted in the form ddmmyy .
In addition , 5 digit personnummer is tacked on at the end , to uniquely identify persons .
This is not quite the Norwegian version of the American Social Security Numbers , but it ’s the best analogy I can think of .
The purpose of the birth number is to identify a individual .
It has historically been treated as a secret , although the laws clearly says it is not sensitive or secret information .
For example , one can :
Order mail readdressing from Norwegian postal service .
Order mobile phone service from operators .
Start bank accounts in f.ex .
SkandiaBanken .
The security hole
The algorithm for generating / checking birth numbers is public .
There ’s no reason for why not , since it would be trivial to reverse engineer , and a quite useful tool to ( legitimately ) check if a birth number is entered correctly .
By starting off with a date of birth you ’re interested in , you can quickly generate all valid birth numbers for that date , using the algorithm .
Then , you feed the generated numbers into altinn .
no , the website for reporting income and alike to the Norwegian government .
Altinn has security hole # 1 : they confirm whatever you have a real number , assigned to a living person , or simply a number not in use .
Security 101 says that a system should respond in exactly the same way whatever the user - name / credentials is incorrect or not .
Then , you take the validated numbers over to a website like Tele2’s , and feed them into the order form there .
To make it easy , it was enough to enter ones birth number , and the system fetched your name and address from the central Norwegian Registry Office , maintaining records of all living and dead people .
This is security hole # 2 , and by far the biggest : by assuming that a birth number is enough to authenticate a person , you let everyone with access to other peoples birth numbers authenticate as that person .
The program is really really trivial , as you can see .
Any programmer which knows regexp , how to create a http request and some tiny weeny bit of HTML can create such code .
Again , as you can see , this program bypasses no security measures !
The core problem is indeed that a birth number is a identificator , not a authenticator .
In short : no cracking was done .
In reality , the PoC - code only automated what you could have done with a normal calculator and a web browser !
The core problem
The really sad part about this story is that the core of the problem gets no attention .
You can still steal one persons identity with just the social security number .
Tele2 and the other companies has clearly broken Norwegian law ( paragraph Â§13 , part 1 of Personopplysningsloven , law about handling of information on individuals , for those interested ) , they have been reported to the police but the case got rejected .
In Norway , you need a permit from Datatilsynet to store sensitive information about individuals and plan to use them in a business / organisation - related setting .
You do n’t need any kind of permit to compose a database over individuals for your own , private use .
However , Kripos do n’t buy that .
Any serious hacker cracking a site ( ! ) must be harmful , and must be raided , even if he only got away with maybe a few hundred of the total hundred thousands .
Another scary part is that some bloggers that have have covered the case , and spoken in favor of the people that have used the program has been brought in for questioning by the police .
They probably want to know their sources and to harass them .
And again :
The funny thing is that the program just automated something you could do with your web browser and a bit of patience …
So KRIPOS decides to go after those who have used it , and probably ( according to several people ) not broken a single law .
However , Tele2 and other operators , which have clearly broken Personopplysningslove , Â§13 , part 1 , has got no reaction so far .
POL Â §13.1 places the burden of protection on the owner of the database in question .
( Lars , 16 , the author of the program has not yet been caught . )
Oh , and please take care to digg this entry .
Slashdot It !
Duluth , Minnesota — Testimony today in Capitol Records , et al v. Jammie Thomas quickly and inadvertently turned to the topic of fair use when Jennifer Pariser , the head of litigation for Sony BMG , was called to the stand to testify .
Pariser said that file - sharing is extremely damaging to the music industry and that record labels are particularly affected .
In doing so , she advocated a view of copyright that would turn many honest people into thieves .
Pariser noted that music labels make no money on touring , radio , or merchandise , which leaves the company particularly exposed to the negative effects of file - sharing .
" It 's my personal belief that Sony BMG is half the size now as it was in 2000 , " she said , thanks to piracy .
In Pariser 's view , " when people steal , when they take music without compensation , we are harmed . "
Pariser has a very broad definition of " stealing . "
When questioned by Richard Gabriel , lead counsel for the record labels , Pariser suggested that what millions of music fans do is actually theft .
The dirty deed ?
Ripping your own CDs or downloading songs you already own .
Gabriel asked if it was wrong for consumers to make copies of music which they have purchased , even just one copy .
Pariser replied , " When an individual makes a copy of a song for himself , I suppose we can say he stole a song . "
Making " a copy " of a purchased song is just " a nice way of saying ' steals just one copy ' , " she said .
Countless studies have shown that the majority of music on portable music players like the iPod comes from sources other than download services .
For most people , that music is comprised primarily of songs " ripped " from CD collections to MP3 or some other comparable format .
Indeed , most portable music players comes with software ( like iTunes ) which is designed to facilitate the easy ripping of CDs .
According to Pariser 's view , this is stealing .
We 've actually heard something similar to this view before .
As part of the 2006 triennial review of the effectiveness of the DMCA , a number of content - related industries filed a joint reply with the government on the effectiveness of the DMCA and the challenges that lay ahead for copyright .
The argument relating to CDs espoused in the joint reply could be summarized : although nothing has prevented consumers from making backups of CDs , this cannot be construed as authorization from the music labels for them to do so .
Thus , there has been no authorization of said backups , and the coincidental ability to make backups currently should not be mistaken for fair use .
Pariser 's views appear to be similar , insofar as she clearly suggests that consumers have no right to make backups of the music that they have purchased in CD form or even in download form .

( CNN ) -- Police have taken into custody a 14 - year - old boy who is suspected of planning a " Columbine " type event at a Pennsylvania high school , a police spokesman said .
Police took a 14 - year - old boy into custody after a search of his home turned up dozens of weapons .
Police in Plymouth Township near Philadelphia took the boy into custody after a search of his home turned up a number of weapons , including a 9 mm rifle with a laser scope and dozens of air guns , said Deputy Chief Joe Lawrence .
Police also found an operational hand grenade , three other hand grenades in the process of construction , bomb - making equipment , manuals and 30 powered weapons that fire BBs .
The boy 's mother bought the rifle for him several weeks ago at a gun show , police said .
No ammunition was found for the rifle .
The grenades were made with plastic casings that authorities believe the boy bought on the Internet , Lawrence said .
The operational hand grenades included black powder , BBs and a fuse believed used in fireworks .
Lawrence said police are also investigating whether the boy 's mother bought him black powder used in the grenades .
The boy was making the grenades in his bedroom , he said .
Do n't Miss Cleveland school shootings
In addition to the weapons , authorities found a hand - painted Nazi flag and a video about the Columbine shootings , District Attorney Bruce Castor said .
Watch Castor explain why he is ' very upset ' with the parents »
" It is my judgment that this individual considered that something to be glorified and was doing so , " he said .
Two students opened fire at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colorado , on April 20 , 1999 .
They killed 13 people and wounded 23 others before killing themselves .
The 14 - year - old is expected to appear in juvenile court Friday to face charges that could include making terroristic threats , criminal solicitation , weapons possession , and possession and manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction , police said .
If he 's found delinquent , he could face jail time and counseling .
The boy 's mother and father may face criminal charges pending an investigation , police said .
" I do n't see any evidence that leads me to conclude that she knew that this attack was planned or anything of that nature , " Castor told " Anderson Cooper 360 . "
But he said he thinks charges against the mother are likely .
" I think you have a parent who has fallen down on the job in supervising the child , perhaps indulgent on the child because she knows he has issues . "
Police acted on a tip they received at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday from a Plymouth Whitemarsh High School student and his father , school officials said .
The 14 - year - old was taken into custody at his home about 10 p.m .
" The boy who gave the tip was one who was trying to be recruited , " Castor added .
" He was a friend of the boy in the loosest terms . "
Officials said they think the tip was prompted by Wednesday 's shooting at a school in Cleveland , Ohio .
" We have no information at this point that leads us to think this is other than an isolated individual who was trying to recruit others to help , " Castor said .
School officials said the boy is not a student at the school .
" This was a youth in the community who has not been enrolled in school since spring of 2006 , " according to Dave Sherman , spokesman for Plymouth Whitemarsh High School .
The school has an enrollment of 1,591 students in grades nine through 12 .
No classes are being canceled because of the incident , school officials said Thursday .
Plymouth Township is about 15 miles northwest of Philadelphia .

Two weeks ago , the Tyee ran a five - part series that made the case why transit should be free of charge to riders .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
The response to the series ' main argument -- namely that to fight global warming we must cut out cars and pull down barriers to taking the bus -- was dramatic .
Traffic crashed our site , series author Dave Olsen went on national and local radio , versions of the article went viral on the Internet , and Atlantic magazine columnist Andrew Sullivan praised Olsen 's argument as " a great idea . "
In a nutshell , the series hit a nerve .
" Should people really be paying for something that 's benefiting society ? " asks Lawrence Frank , an urban transportation expert at the University of British Columbia .
If anything , it 's drivers who should shell out more for their dirty deeds , the logic goes .
Timely as the argument is , it remains to be seen that free transit can work where it 's needed most : in big cities .
While taking out the fare box makes sense in smaller communities , where the costs of collecting fares often outweigh the benefits , in the city fees keep systems on their feet .
So could they really do without charging riders ?
Asking a number of experts ,
The Tyee set out to discover why past attempts to go fare - free city - wide failed in cities in New Jersey and Texas , degraded services in downtown Miami , succeeded in portions of Portland and Seattle , and might yet bear fruit in San Francisco .
Lost in Austin
Let 's start with where it failed .
Both Stanton , New Jersey and Denver , Colorado , dabbled with fare - free in the 1970s ; both tried it during off - peak hours and both quit one year into the experiment .
Austin , Texas , was the last American city to try ditching fares ; they pulled out their fare - boxes between 1989 - 1990 , something Joel Volinski says lead to " chaos . "
Rowdy young passengers vandalized vehicles and scared off " core riders , " said Volinski , who authored a major U.S. study in 2002 that concluded that citywide fare - free policies were a bad idea .
After one year , Austin bus drivers themselves rallied and had the program shut down .
Volinski saw a similar experiment fail when he was a director of a smaller transit system near Fort Lauderdale , Florida .
Ridership soared when that system went fare - free , but it was soon carpe diem for hooligans there too .
" They 'd jump on the bus , raise holy hell , then jump off two blocks later .
They got a big kick out of that . "
" It has something to do with the question of value , " he believes , " when people pay nothing for something , they just do n't think it has value and they treat it as such . "
The Austin experiment , his report states , " left lasting impressions on transit operators throughout the country . "
Nothing on that scale has been tried since .
San Free-cisco
That may not be true for long .
Under Mayor Gavin Newsom , San Francisco is currently taking a hard look at the viability of going fare - free .
In a city beset by smog and congestion problems , Newsome recently wondered aloud if the costs of enforcing and collecting fares was worth it in a city where many skip out of paying fares in the first place .
" There 's been a lot of different ideas floated here , " says Peg Stevenson , San Francisco 's chief services auditor .
Some of those ideas have to do with dredging up new sources of funding , which would be needed to replace the massive revenues that come from charging the city 's riders .
Fares add up to roughly a quarter of the system 's current annual revenue , or $ 145 million .
That 's low , compared to the fare box yield in the Greater Vancouver region , where fares are more than one - third of Translink 's funding sources , or $ 300 million per year .
By the same token , San Francisco has plans to expand transit services to outlying areas , and that has them wondering just how much new fare inspection equipment and enforcement systems will cost .
Will the city be able to afford the switch ?
Stevenson is n't sure -- the final report is due in August -- but she says that so far there has n't been widespread support for the idea , nor is it clear if proposed new parcel and transit impact taxes , plus re-funneled parking tax monies , will cover it .
Stevenson is also quick to point out that the normally expensive study is being carried out on the cheap since it 's piggybacking a larger study on roads and service planning in the Bay Area .
Bear in mind , too as some reports have pointed out , that it is an election year in the City by the Bay .
Bus or shelter ?
After sussing out the costs , managers in San Francisco will study the kind of riders a free service would invite .
Todd Litman thinks that , in Vancouver anyway , fare - free transit would attract the wrong kind of clientele .
" I have pretty significant concerns about transit vehicles becoming shelters for homeless people . "
Fares , Volinski puts it bluntly , help keep off " the wacko element . "
As the director of the Victoria Transport Policy Institute , Litman argues that if the over - arching goal of promoting transit is to combat global warming , the concept of a free ride is wrong - headed .
" I think we need to be most concerned about the quality of public transit , not the cheapness , " he said .
Reducing emissions boils down to luring people out of their cars , something that pits public transport directly against the private automobile .
In the U.S. , for example , a national household survey concluded that pretty much everybody who can afford to drive a car already owns one .
The challenge now is to charm those drivers back into the transit system .
How ?
Echoing Litman , the report 's authors say operators will have to improve quality of service by reducing wait times , and increasing convenience .
Litman points out that car manufacturers now spend most of their efforts improving motoring 's creature comforts :
Plush interiors , sound systems and cup holders are what sell cars these days .
Transit systems have no choice but to improve services , or else they could drive away the same drivers environmentally - minded planners are hoping to entice .
" It has to become consumer - oriented , " notes Litman .
U - Pass , we wait
In Vancouver , for example , current bus conditions are anything but enjoyable for the city 's transit - takers , according to David Hendry .
And riders have seen four consecutive fare increases in less than 10 years .
Overcrowding , pass-ups , bullying transit cops , fare increases : as an organizer with the area 's Bus Riders Union , Hendry says the city 's Translink system is already way too embattled to go fare - free .
He blames Translink 's broken promises and cut - backs from senior levels of government .
" In terms of having a fare - free bus system I think it 's important to have that vision , but we also have to do the work to stop the attacks that are happening right now . "
Although a resounding success , officials and experts agree Translink 's U - Pass program has stretched the system to its limit .
The cheap annual student fare - card has jammed the major routes to the universities where the U - Pass is offered .
Vancouver 's ' terrible problem '
But even with four fare hikes over eight years , general ridership continues to climb , bucking the drops in ridership that accompanied hikes in other cities .
" It seems as though everything we put out there gets used , " says Trish Webb , spokeswoman for Translink , " so while I am sympathetic to people saying [ that ] higher fares make it difficult for people who have low incomes , we 're not seeing a big drop in ridership . "
Ridership figures for this year are tracking an increase of close to four per cent over last year .
" Vancouver has this terrible problem that all kinds of cities throughout the world would love to have , which is people want to ride transit and you 're simply not providing enough service , " says Litman .
Canada climbs aboard
In fact , the North American Urban Transit Association says Canadians are hopping on the bus en masse : ridership is rising by 57 million trips a year , about a three per cent increase .
Association president Michael Roschlau says the upward trend is expected to continue partly due to Canadians ' concern about the environment .
Canada 's big-city mayors get it , and are lobbying the federal government to help cash - stapped municipalities cope with the pressures .
" We do n't have the capacity to expand our transit systems , " Toronto mayor David Miller said to the CBC .
" We do n't even have the money to keep them going . "
In the zone
Some say a high - grade free service operating in the downtown core , rather than citywide , could be the answer for cities battling emissions and traffic .
But even this has lead to mixed results in the U.S .
Portland and Seattle both have what appear to be workable systems , but Miami's MetroMover -- an elevated rail system servicing the city centre -- has seen cars trashed and abused since that city decided to make that part of its system free , according to Volinksi .
The previous fare was a quarter , which meant collection costs outweighed revenues .
" Boy , I rode in it just a week ago and it was a shambles , " said Volinski .
Shot carpet , etched windows , graffiti came with a 60 to 70 per cent rise in ridership , he said .
" They may have discounted the fact that it was going to result in a lot more vandalism , now they 're going to be paying tons to fix it up . "
A comparable service in Seattle , on the other hand , seems to be doing well .
The Seattle Post - Intellegencer reports that the fare - free zone downtown " allows Metro buses to move more quickly , but costs the city $ 370,000 a year , the difference between the lost fares and the savings in bus speed . "
La fin
While Olsen's
Tyee series detailed several success stories and sparked imagination and conversation in B.C. and beyond , it will take more pressure from citizens to generate the political will necessary to see fare free transit in the Lower Mainland .
" It 's not a big topic around here , " says Webb of Greater Vancouver 's Translink system .
But , things are heating up , says UBC's Lawrence Frank , who insists that the Lower Mainland could afford to go fare - free if tolls were put up on bridges leading in and out of Vancouver .
Drivers get cranky when they 're asked to subsidize transit , he notes , but they 're also the ones " externalizing " the environmental and health costs of driving onto society at large .
" They do n't seem to care about that , because they 're getting away with it . "

Las Vegas , Oct. 3 — After four weeks of what ’s being called the most intensive search for a missing aircraft in United States history , the Civil Air Patrol and the state of Nevada have halted the effort to locate the millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett .
Mr. Fossett , 63 , disappeared on Sept. 3 while taking what was intended to be a short morning jaunt in a single - engine airplane around the region around a posh ranch owned by William Barron Hilton , the hotel magnate .
When Mr. Fossett failed to return to the ranch 90 miles southeast of Reno , a mammoth search commenced .
“ We ’re really disappointed that we could n’t find him , ” said Cynthia S. Ryan , spokeswoman for the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol , the volunteer Air Force auxiliary that led the search .

The device will help people have bilingual conversations
Users simply have to silently mouth a word in their own language for it to be translated and read out in another .
The researchers said the effect was like watching a television programme that had been dubbed .
The system , detailed in New Scientist , is not yet fully accurate , but experts said it showed the technology was " within reach " .
The idea is that you can mouth words in English and they will come out in Chinese or another language
Tanja Schultz
The translation systems that are currently in use work by using voice recognition software .
But this requires people to speak out loud and then wait for the translation to be read out , making conversations difficult .
But the new device , being created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh , is different .
Electrodes are attached to the neck and face to detect the movements that occur as the person silently mouths words and phrases .
Using this data , a computer can work out the sounds being formed and then build these sounds up into words .
The system is then able to translate the words into another language which is read out by a synthetic voice .
Within reach
The team currently has two prototypes : one that can translate Chinese into English and another that can translate English into Spanish or German .
If the prototypes used a small vocabulary of about 100 - 200 words they worked with about 80 % accuracy , researcher Tanja Schultz said .
But , she added , a full vocabulary had a much lower level of accuracy .
Professor Schultz said : " The idea is that you can mouth words in English and they will come out in Chinese or another language . "
The ultimate goal , the researchers said , was to be in a position where you can just have a conversation .
Chuck Jorgensen , a researcher at Nasa 's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , California , told New Scientist : " This is showing the technology is really within reach . "
Phil Woodland , professor of information engineering at the University of Cambridge , said : " This work sounds interesting .
Most groups are working on translating audio data into different languages , but this is different to work I have come across before because they are not working from a real acoustic signal . "
One thing that always fascinates me is how reductionist , how mechanical , how sciencey and medical we like our stories about the body to be .
This week , a new study was published on acupuncture .
Many newspapers said it showed acupuncture performing better than medical treatment : in fact it was 8 million times more interesting than that .
They took 1,162 patients who had suffered with back pain for an average of eight years ( so these were patients who had failed with medical treatment anyway ) and divided them into three groups .
The first group had some more medical treatment ; the second had full - on acupuncture with all the trimmings , the needles all put carefully into the correct " meridians " and so on ; while the third group just had some bloke pretending to be an acupuncturist , sticking needles in their skin at random .
The study set a threshold for " response to treatment " , which was an improvement of 33 % on three items out of a bigger scale , or 12 % on one symptom scale .
So this was not " getting better " , or a " cure " .
I 'm not carping , I 'm just telling you what they measured .
And what were the results ?
Firstly , 27 % of the medical treatment group improved : this is an impressive testament to the well - known healing power of simply " being in a trial " , since medical treatment had n't helped these patients for the preceding eight years .
Meanwhile , 47 % of the acupuncture group improved , but the sting is this : 44 % of the fake acupuncture group improved too .
There was no statistically significant difference between proper , genuine acupuncture and fake , " bung a needle in , anywhere you fancy , with a bit of theatrical ceremony " acupuncture .
There are three possible explanations for this finding .
One is that sticking needles in your body at random helps back pain due to some physiological mechanism .
The second is that theatrical ceremony , reassurance , the thought of someone doing something useful , helps back pain .
( The third option is " a bit of both " . )
Now as I have said so many times before , the placebo effect is not about a sugar pill , it 's about the cultural meaning of a treatment , and our expectations : we know from research that two sugar pills are more effective than one , that a salt water injection is better for pain than a sugar pill , that colour and packaging have a beneficial effect , and so on .
Interestingly , there has even been a trial on patients with arm pain specifically comparing a placebo pill against a placebo ritual involving a sham medical device , modelled on acupuncture , which found that the elaborate ritual was more effective than the simple sugar pill .
" Placebo " is not a unitary phenomenon ; there is not " one type of placebo " .
But the most important background information missing from the news reports was n't about the details of the study : it was about back pain .
Because back pain is n't like epilepsy or tuberculosis .
Most of the big risk factors for a niggle turning into chronic longstanding back pain are personal , psychological , and social : things like depression , job dissatisfaction , unavailability of light duty on return to work , and so on .
And the evidence on treatments tells an even more interesting psychosocial story : sure , anti-inflammatory drugs are better than placebo .
But more than that , bed rest is actively harmful , specific exercises can be too , and proper trial data shows that simply giving advice to " stay active " speeds recovery , reduces chronic disability , and reduces time off work .
We do n't like solutions like that for our health problems .
There are huge industries telling you that your tiredness is due to some " chromium deficiency " ( buy the pill ) ; your cloudy - headed feeling can be fixed with vitamin pills , pills , and more pills .
It is a brave doctor who dares to bring up psychosocial issues for any complaint when a patient has been consistently told it is biomedical .
But in conditions like back pain or fatigue , information alone can make a difference .
In Australia , a simple public information campaign ( " Back pain : do n't take it lying down " , arf ) was shown to reduce back pain significantly .

Why Gore Derangement Syndrome is so sad to watch
I saw the first few minutes of Fox News Sunday yesterday , and was struck by how angry the conservative Republicans were about Al Gore winning the Nobel Peace Prize .
These guys do n’t just ignore the scientific evidence , they lash out wildly at Gore , the Nobel committee , the scientists , everyone who dares to think differently than they do .
Bill Kristol disparaged Gore and the Nobel prize itself , saying “ it ’s a prize given by bloviators to a bloviator . ”
Charles Krauthammer insisted the award goes to “ people whose politics are either anti-American or anti-Bush , and that ’s why [ Gore ] won it . ”
These pundits were obviously bitter and incensed , much the same way National Review ’s Iain Murray was late last week , when he suggested Gore share his award with Osama bin Laden , “ who implicitly endorsed Gore ’s stance ” in a September video harangue .
( Apparently , to accept global warming is to embrace a terrorist philosophy . )
It ’s led Paul Krugman to ask a good question : “ What is it about Mr. Gore that drives right - wingers insane ? ”
Partly it ’s a reaction to what happened in 2000 , when the American people chose Mr. Gore but his opponent somehow ended up in the White House .
Both the personality cult the right tried to build around President Bush and the often hysterical denigration of Mr. Gore were , I believe , largely motivated by the desire to expunge the stain of illegitimacy from the Bush administration .
And now that Mr. Bush has proved himself utterly the wrong man for the job — to be , in fact , the best president Al Qaeda ’s recruiters could have hoped for — the symptoms of Gore derangement syndrome have grown even more extreme .
The worst thing about Mr. Gore , from the conservative point of view , is that he keeps being right .
In 1992 , George H. W. Bush mocked him as the “ ozone man , ” but three years later the scientists who discovered the threat to the ozone layer won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry .
In 2002 he warned that if we invaded Iraq , “ the resulting chaos could easily pose a far greater danger to the United States than we presently face from Saddam . ”
And so it has proved .
But that ’s only part of it .
Those on the right are n’t just angry because they ’re wrong ; they ’re angry because their smear did n’t work .
[ I ] f science says that we have a big problem that ca n’t be solved with tax cuts or bombs — well , the science must be rejected , and the scientists must be slimed .
For example , Investor ’s Business Daily recently declared that the prominence of James Hansen , the NASA researcher who first made climate change a national issue two decades ago , is actually due to the nefarious schemes of — who else ? — George Soros .
Which brings us to the biggest reason the right hates Mr. Gore : in his case the smear campaign has failed .
He ’s taken everything they could throw at him , and emerged more respected , and more credible , than ever .
And it drives them crazy .
The headline on Krugman ’s piece is entirely appropriate : “ Gore Derangement Syndrome . ”
The whole “ derangement syndrome ” phenomenon stems from an increasingly common problem — when contempt for a leader strays from simple political opposition to irrational , reflexive antagonism .
If so - and - so says “ day , ” I ’ll say “ night , ” even if the sun is shining .
It ’s more important to fight the perceived opponent than to make sense .
And for far too long , that ’s exactly how the right has approached Gore and the science on global warming .
The evidence must be wrong , because Gore believes it .
The Nobel Peace Prize must be worthless , because Gore won it .
These are n’t arguments .
They ’re sad and nonsensical temper - tantrums .

What Is It Like to be a Spider ?
Last night the Institute for Figuring sponsored a lecture on spider vision and cognition by Simon Pollard : “ What Is It Like to be a spider ? ”
Dr. Pollard started by saying that spiders are not the little automatons we might think they are ( hey , I 'm pretty sure humans are automatons , but I do n't hold it against them ) .
It seems that jumping spiders ( one particular group of jumping spiders , Portia , was the focus of the talk ) exhibit some behaviors that most people would think of as too complicated for a spider , which just reminded me of Valentino Braitenberg 's “ law of uphill analysis and downhill invention . ”
Jumping spiders will spot a prey spider sitting in a web , then take a route that eventually gets them closer to the prey while staying hidden from it .
This hunting “ detour ” may take hours , during which the jumping spider often does not have the prey in visual contact .
That is , it seems to have “ memory ” of a “ goal ” .
Jumping spiders have amazing vision for such small creatures — something like 1/ 5 the visual acuity of human beings while being smaller than our eyeballs .
They can recognize ( and will attack ) TV images .
They achieve this visual acuity through a pair of telescopic eye tubes .
The fovea is small with a very narrow field of view , but the spiders seem to build a detailed image by scanning an object of interest — which they do without moving their heads or bodies or eye lenses , but by pivoting the eye tubes inside their heads .
The video of this was a big hit , with everyone making surprised and amazed noises when they saw a spider , sitting motionless , in front of a powerful backlight that allowed us to see the shadows of the eye tubes swiveling like mad inside its translucent head , taking in the scene .
“ ... when we look into Portia 's dark , bulging eyes , the lights are on , somebody 's at home , and a lot more than an eight - legged automaton is staring back . ”

Christian Couple Flogged for Attending ' Secret Sermon ' in Iran
London -- A Christian couple were flogged in Iran for participating in an " underground Church " , an Iranian Christian group said in a report on its website earlier this week .
The unnamed couple were arrested on September 21 , 2005 , the report said , adding that a Revolutionary Court reviewed their case in July 2007 .
Even though the couple had decided to marry seven years ago , the country 's marriage laws - which prohibit the union of ex-Muslims and members of other religious minorities -- prevented them from obtaining a certificate of marriage .
The report said that the woman was born a Christian in an Assyrian - Iranian family and the man was a convert to Christianity prior to getting married .
The court ruled that both the man and the woman were Mortad , a description of someone who has committed apostasy by leaving Islam .

Yes , it 's true : like contestants on a reality TV show , protesters at the SPP meeting were invited to vent into video cameras , their rants to be beamed to " protest - trons " inside the summit enclave .
It was security state as infotainment - Big Brother meets , well , Big Brother .
The spokesperson for Prime Minister Harper explained that although protesters were herded into empty fields , the video link meant that their right to political speech was protected .
" Under the law , they need to be seen and heard , and they will be . "
It is an argument with sweeping implications .
If videotaping activists meets the legal requirement that dissenting citizens have the right to be seen and heard , what else might fit the bill ?
How about all the other security cameras that patrolled the summit - the ones filming demonstrators as they got on and off buses and peacefully walked down the street ?
What about the mobile phone calls that were intercepted , the meetings that were infiltrated , the emails that were read ?
According to the new rules set out in Montebello , all these actions may soon be recast not as infringements on civil liberties but the opposite : proof of our leaders ' commitment to direct , unmediated consultation .
Elections are a crude tool for taking the public temperature - these methods allow constant , exact monitoring of our beliefs .
Think of surveillance as the new participatory democracy ; of wiretapping as the political equivalent of MTV's Total Request Live .
Protesters in Montebello complained that while they were locked out , chief executives from about 30 of the largest corporations in North America - from Wal - Mart to Chevron - were part of the official summit .
But perhaps they had it backwards : the CEOs had only an hour and 15 minutes of face time with the leaders .
The activists were being " seen and heard " around the clock .
So instead of shouting about police - state tactics , maybe they should have said : " Thank you for listening . "
( And reading , and watching , and photographing , and data - mining . )
The Montebello " seen and heard " rule also casts the target of the protests in a new light .
The SPP is described in the leaders ' final statement as an " ambitious " plan to " keep our borders closed to terrorism yet open to trade " .
In other words , a merger of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the homeland security complex - Nafta with spy planes .
The model dates back to September 11 , when Paul Cellucci , the US ambassador to Canada , pronounced that in the new era , " security will trump trade " .
But there was an out clause : the trade on which the economies of Canada and Mexico depend could continue uninterrupted , as long as the governments of those countries were willing to welcome the tentacles of the US war on terror .
Canadian and Mexican business leaders leaped to surrender , aggressively pushing their governments to give in to US demands for " integrated " security in order to keep the goods and the tourists flowing .
Almost six years later , the business leaders at Montebello - under the banner of the North American Competitiveness Council , an official wing of the SPP - were still holding up " thickening borders " as the bogeyman .
The fix ?
According to the SPP website , " technological solutions , improved information - sharing , and , potentially , the use of biometric identifiers " .
From experience we know what this means : continent - wide no-fly lists , integrated databases , as well as the $ 2.5 bn contract to Boeing to build a " virtual fence " on the northern and southern borders of the United States , equipped with unmanned drones .
In short , under the SPP vision of the continent , " thick " borders will soon be replaced with a nearly invisible web of continental surveillance - almost all of it run for profit .
Two members of the SPP advisory group - Lockheed Martin and General Electric - have already received multibillion - dollar contracts from the US government to build this web .
In the Bush era , security does n't trump big business ; it may be the biggest business of all .
In the run-up to the SPP summit , a spate of surveillance scandals helped paint a fuller picture .
First , Congress not only failed to curtail the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping but opened the door to snooping into bank records , phone call patterns and even physical searches - all without any onus to prove the subject is a threat .
Next , the Boston Globe reported on plans to link thousands of CCTV cameras on streets , subways , apartment buildings and businesses into networks capable of tracking suspects in real time .
And on August 15 confirmation came that the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency - the arm of the American military that runs spy planes and satellites over enemy territory - would be fully integrated into the infrastructure of domestic intelligence gathering and local policing , becoming the " eyes " to the National Security Agency 's " ears " .
Add a few more hi-tech tools - biometric IDs , facial - recognition software , networked databases of " suspects " , GPS bundled into ever more electronic devices - and you have something like the world of total surveillance most recently portrayed in The Bourne Ultimatum .
Which brings us back to the Security and Prosperity Partnership .
Who needs clumsy old border checks when the authorities are making sure we are seen and heard at all times - in high definition , online and off , on land and from the sky ?
Security is the new prosperity .
Surveillance is the new democracy .

Mr. Bush wants Congress to wait until September , when the top military commander in Iraq , Gen. David H. Petraeus , and the top civilian official , Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker , deliver a fuller assessment of progress of the troop buildup .
But the president said he was not “ going to speculate on what my frame of mind will be ” at that time , and he would not say how he might react if the September report is as mixed as the one delivered today .
The report assessed the Iraqi government ’s progress in meeting 18 benchmarks set forth by Congress on military , economic and political matters .
It found the Iraqis made satisfactory progress in meeting eight benchmarks , including committing three brigades for operations in and around Baghdad , and spending nearly $ 7.3 billion in Iraq ’s money to train , equip and modernize Iraqi forces .
But the Iraqis made unsatisfactory progress in meeting another eight benchmarks , including passing an oil revenue - sharing law and preparing for local elections that could help reconcile the country ’s Shiite , Sunni and Kurdish factions .
On two benchmarks , progress was too mixed to be characterized .
The report bluntly criticized the Shiite - dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , saying the government continued to permit political interference in some military decisions .
Although the report asserted that Mr. Maliki has not been involved , it singled out the Iraqi Office of the Commander in Chief , which reports directly to Mr. Maliki , saying there is evidence that the office formulated “ target lists , ” primarily of Sunni Arabs .
And Mr. Bush himself offered only lukewarm support for Mr. Maliki at today ’s news conference , declining to echo the praise he put forth in Jordan last November , when he proclaimed Mr. Maliki “ the right guy for Iraq . ”
Asked if he still felt that way today , the president responded , “ I believe that he understands that there needs to be serious reconciliation and they need to get law passed . ”
As Mr. Bush offered his own interpretation of the report , administration officials , including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , were working behind the scenes , offering to interpret the document for Republican senators .
Among those called was Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana , who is working with Senator John W. Warner , Republican of Virginia , to draft a proposal calling for a change in the military mission in Iraq .
Mr. Warner said the report was disappointing .
“ That government is simply not providing leadership worthy of the considerable sacrifice of our forces , ” he said of the Iraqis , “ and this has to change immediately . ”

To leash train your cat , start by putting it in its harness for just a few minutes at a time , and gradually increase the length of time in harness over several days so your cat can get used to it .
When your cat seems comfortable in its harness , attach the leash and let your cat trail it around behind them .
You can then start picking up the leash and walking around with your cat .
Practice inside before you venture outside for your first short trips .
Finally , be sure to encourage your cat at every stage of training by offering treats and lots of praise .
For information from our Veterinary reviewer on getting the right harness and leash to train your cat , read on !
If you were one of the Americans waiting for Congress , under Democratic control , to show leadership on the war in Iraq , the message from the Senate is clear : “ Nevermind . ”
The same goes for those waiting for lawmakers to fix the damage done to civil liberties by six years of President Bush and a rubber - stamp Republican Congress .
The Democrats do n’t have , or ca n’t summon , the political strength to make sure Congress does what it is supposed to do : debate profound issues like these and take a stand .
The Republicans are simply not interested in a serious discussion and certainly not a vote on anything beyond Mr. Bush ’s increasingly narrow agenda .
On Wednesday , the Senate failed to vote on two major bills .
One would have restored basic human rights and constitutional protections to hundreds of foreigners who are in perpetual detention , without charges or trial .
The other was the one measure on the conduct of the Iraq war that survived the Democrats ’ hasty retreat after last week ’s smoke - and - mirrors display by Gen. David Petraeus and President Bush .
There were votes , of course , but not on the bills .
They were cloture votes , which require 60 or more Senators to agree to cut off debate , eliminating the possibility of a filibuster , so Senators can vote on the actual law .
In both cases , Democrats were four votes short , with six Republicans daring to defy the White House .
I grew up in a small town , the son of small town teachers .
We were Methodists but we went to whichever of the two churches ( they alternated services ) was open on a particular day for worship , Sunday School , MYF , BTU , prayer meeting or revival ; the Baptist or the Methodist , it did n't matter ... we were there !
My father was the Sunday School superintendent ( at the Methodist church ) and my mother played the piano at both churches .
Obviously we were well churched .
We were also poor as church mice since my parents had five children on a very limited income .
I had no concept that I would ever be able to go to medical school when I was young , and when we started in 1964 , I had no idea how we were going to be able to finish .
But my mother always said to me , " the Lord has a special purpose for your life . "
( I suspect that she told all her children that . )
The longer I live , even though I am not a particularly superstitious man , the more I have come to believe that to be true for each of us - if we make it happen .
By 1967 I was a third year medical student , still with no visible means of support , and we were pregnant with our third child .
It was the spring of that year and I was ending my rotation in the Ob - Gyn Service clinic .
I was assigned a 40 plus year old , poverty stricken mother of several children .
I think she was unmarried but I am not sure of that now .
This care worn mother - of - several had a large abdominal mass that I rapidly determined to be a well advanced pregnancy .
I asked my resident to come and break the news to this woman ; it was very obvious to me that she was not going to be happy about the news of another pregnancy .
When told that she - already unable to adequately feed and clothe her family - was again pregnant , she looked up at me and the resident .
There we stood , two white males , well clothed , well feed young men with superior educations .
We were , in her eyes , stunningly blessed and obviously going places in the world .
She began to weep silently .
She must have assumed , for good reason , that there was no way that we would understand her problems ; she knew also that there was nothing that we could or would do to relieve her lacerating misery .
" Oh God , doctor , " she said quietly , " I was hoping it was cancer . "
That mother 's anguished whisper eventually became a shriek of despair and hopelessness that has reverberated in my heart and mind and soul for over thirty years .
Before that moment , forever seared like a brand on my memory , I would have described myself as " Pro- Life " had I then known this political term .
Over the next few years , I was exposed to real life as it is lived by millions of people who do n't have the sanctification granted in America to those who are white , male , well educated , well gene - ed , well nurtured , well advantaged .
I learned that what this woman knew was a personal tragedy for herself and her family , was only one face in a multifaceted problem confronting thousands of girls and women every day .
How did I learn this ?
I learned it - really made it a part of my essential being - by seeing the repercussions of desperation walk , and crawl , and be carried through our emergency room door three , four , five times , every night for four years .
Each night we would admit to the wards of University Hospital in Little Rock ( a fairly small hospital , as metropolitan hospitals go ) girls and women with raging fevers , extraordinary uterine and pelvic infections , enormous blood loss , and a multitude of serious injuries of the pelvic and intra-abdominal organs as a result of illegal and self - induced abortions .
During the years 1970 through the end of my residency in June , 1972 we did in the same hospital perhaps twenty to thirty safe , legal abortions a month on girls and women of various ages for mostly elective reasons .
The contrast between the outcomes for these two sets of women was dramatic , not only for what happened to them immediately - that is , the almost total lack of complications in those undergoing legal abortions and the terrible consequences of some of the illegal abortions that we saw - but also for what happened over the next few years to those who had illegal abortions as they discovered that they were sterile , or faced total hysterectomy for the effects of injuries suffered during their illegal procedures .
I could and sometimes do go on for hours about what I saw during those years of training and in early private practice , before abortion became universally legal and affordable in the first few months of pregnancy for any woman who determined , for a myriad of reasons , that carrying a pregnancy to term and delivering a baby was not in her best interest .
Or perhaps not in the best interests of her family .
( The very poor in those early days of legal abortion were covered by Medicaid . )
But what of the concern for , as a ninth grader expressed it , " someone who is often forgotten , the little life who does n't even have a chance to live . "
No one , neither the patient receiving an abortion , nor the person doing the abortion , is ever , at anytime , unaware that they are ending a life .
We just do n't believe that a developing embryo or fetus , whose mother cannot or will not accept it , has the same moral claims on us , claims to autonomy and justice , that an adolescent or adult woman has .
I have never seen an abortion decision entered into lightly by anyone involved .
The decision to have an abortion is most often made in the time of the first great personal moral crisis that ever faces a girl , a woman , her family and the people who love them .
It is only those who stand outside and condemn the women and families who are faced with these dilemmas who take lightly the decisions made in these straits and trivialize the circumstances in which they are made .
Moral dilemmas are always about difficult problems .
Decisions between right and wrong are not moral dilemmas ; decisions between right and wrong should be no-brainers and should never be difficult .
It is in deciding between what we consider morally near - equal alternatives that we are forced to make agonizing appraisals .
The decision between competing evils or competing goods - these are the judgments that may burn in your mind and live forever in your memory , that fry your soul .
And it matters not whether one believes elective abortion a good or an evil , for every abortion decision is made between self - perceived competing goods or competing evils , not between obvious good and self - evident evil .
Is legal abortion dangerous ?
I personally have not seen an abortion injury to a woman since 1974 , with three exceptions :
One was a young women who became sterile after a post legal - abortion infection in 1974 in my practice ; another was a woman from my practice who had a ruptured uterus in about 1975 as the result of an abortion done in Little Rock at about twenty - four weeks by a resident using a no - longer - used method of abortion .
( Since I wrote this several years ago , I have had another patient with an abortion related injury in July , 2003 .
Apparently , as I was dilating the cervix so that I might remove the fetus and placenta in an 18 year old , I perforated her uterus .
It turned out that no significant harm was done , but I felt obligated to evaluate her pelvic and intra-abdominal organs with the laproscope under general anesthesia before sending her home . )
The other exception was a mother of five whom I admitted to my hospital in about 1991 with a septic abortion at about twenty - six weeks pregnant .
She or someone else had obviously tried to abort her .
The fetus was alive , but the fetal membranes were ruptured and blood from the uterus was mixed with a stinking pus , fouling her body , her clothes , and her bedclothes .
( She was the sickest obstetric patient I had seen in a number of years , and the sickest abortion patient I had seen since June 1 , 1971 . )
She had a fever of about 104 on admission and exhibited signs of impending septic shock .
We got her stabilized and loaded her with massive doses of antibiotics .
She was lucky .
We were able to induce labor , deliver the extremely premature and septic fetus that died almost immediately , and she went home in about three days .
Arkansas Medicaid did not cover her abortion , but it did pay part of the bill for her recovery from one , which was well over ten times the cost of a safe first trimester abortion .
I know of only two deaths from legal abortions in the state of Arkansas since 1970 .
One was in about 1980 or 1981 , a young woman from Springdale with severe heart disease who died as a result of complications of her heart disease , who had the abortion done by another physician at my hospital where she died in the recovery room , before she was to go to Houston for open heart surgery ; the other was probably a patient of Dr Bernard Nathanson , an early abortion provider in New York state and maker of The Silent Scream .
This was a doctor 's daughter from Northeast Arkansas who died after she came home , in about 1970 or 1971 , as a result of self - neglected complications of an abortion that Dr. Nathanson may have performed in New York .
The girl came home , started having serious problems and died rather than tell her parents of the abortion .
It was only discovered at autopsy , and her story was then told by a friend .
There may have been others ; if so , I am not aware of them .
There are risks to any medical procedure ; however , legal abortion , done by competent medical personnel is among the safest operative procedures performed today in the United States .
From 1972 through 1990 , there were 563 deaths from abortions of all types - legal , illegal and spontaneous - in the U.S. ; fewer than half that number were from legal abortions .
In 1990 , there were in the United States a total of 5 women who died from legal abortions and another 5 from spontaneous abortions .*
*{ Taken from the Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report ( MMWR ) published by the Center for Disease Control .
New editions of the MMWR covering abortion usually come out in May of each year .
It takes several years to collect reasonably accurate statistics about abortion deaths , since each death report must be thoroughly reviewed before the CDC publishes their data in order to make sure that the most reliable numbers are available for making public health policies .
The numbers through 1991 will be published in May , 1997.}
I mentioned earlier that my mother always said to me , " the Lord has a special purpose for your life , " and that the older I get , the more I think she may have been right ; not just for my life , but for all of us .
( But we have to find that purpose ourselves . )
We each have unique skills , talents and abilities to be used in the service of our fellow human beings .
What I mean by this is , that I was led into OB - Gyn by my love for delivering babies .
Gynecology was really to be only an appendage to my obstetrical practice and I am sure that providing abortions , even thinking about abortions , would never have been a major part of my life had other physicians in my area continued to provide them as was being done prior to 1984 .
However , I soon found my practice inundated with abortion patients because other physicians who had also been providing abortions stopped doing so .
In late 1983 it suddenly became uncomfortable , and very soon dangerous , to provide abortions .
I literally had no option but to make a " Sophie 's choice " between delivering babies , which I loved , or making what for me would be an immoral and unethical decision , that is , to choose to abandon those girls , women and families who started coming to my office by the dozens .
How could I look my children , my wife , my mother and my friends - myself - in the face and say , " I believe that abortion should be legal , safe , and available .
But now some people disapprove and it's become very uncomfortable , perhaps even dangerous , to provide them .
And so I am going to stop doing what I know to be absolutely right .
When it gets uncomfortable or dangerous , it 's OK to say , `not me , coach . ' "
Was that the morality that I wanted to demonstrate to my children ?
To parade in front of my wife , my family and friends ?
Not me , coach !
Why do I provide abortions ?
Here is the short answer .
Like multitudes before me and , I trust , multitudes to come , I eventually heard ( Try as I might to avoid hearing it ! ) in that mother 's grief - filled declaration , " Oh God , Doctor , I was hoping it was cancer " , a still , small voice asking , " Whom shall I send , and who will go for us ? " to which I was at last compelled to reply , " here am I , send me . "

After her son was born , JoAnne Pastel could n’t find children ’s picture books that showed racially diverse families like hers .
She saw lots of animal characters and lots of light - skinned kids .
“ But I saw nothing that looked like my son , ” recalled Pastel , an African - American who lives in Orono with her German and Norwegian husband .
So , Pastel decided to write her own stories .
The former stockbroker put together a draft of an ABC book about boating and showed it to her friend Kakie Fitzsimmons , a single white mom who is also raising a biracial son .
The two Twin Cities women thought they were on to something .
They spent several years researching the market and honing ideas for a book series and other products featuring a multiracial group of kids who are involved in sports and outdoor activities .
This year , they self - published the first three books introducing Bur Bur , a sporty little boy who goes fishing and to the ballpark with his Caucasian dad and dark - skinned mom .
“ My son is going to face times when people question his ethnicity , ” said Fitzsimmons , who lives in Apple Valley with her 6 - year - old son .
“ And I think it ’s important for him to have role models and see people who look like him . ”
Bur Bur is named for Pastel ’s son ’s imaginary friend .
“ Bur Bur ’s Boating ABCs , ” “ Bur Bur Throws Out the First Pitch ” and “ Bur Bur ’s Fishing Adventure ” are available for $ 14.95 at www .
burburandfriends .
com and can be special ordered at Borders .
A fourth book , “ Anna ’s Hiking Adventure , ” will be out next month .

A very inventive dad in our neighbouring city Suzhou has decided to strip his son naked , and parade him around on the streets as punishment .
Apparently the 15 year old teenager sleeps around in the park in the day and picks trash at night .
He has refused to go home with his parents when they came to pick him up and even threw away the new shoes his mom bought him .
Chinese netizens have lambasted the father for shaming his own child this way because even in the past , only the worst of criminals would be paraded and shamed in public .
Poor child .
We hope help comes to him soon .

THE FACTS
It sounds like a joke , or perhaps just an urban legend that grew out of Dr. Seuss ’s “ Green Eggs and Ham . ”
But food scientists say this one is no myth .
The reality is that green potatoes contain high levels of a toxin , solanine , which can cause nausea , headaches and neurological problems .
Potatoes naturally produce small amounts of solanine as a defense against insects , but the levels increase with prolonged exposure to light and warm temperatures .
The green color is actually caused by high levels of chlorophyll , which by itself is harmless .
But it is also a sign that levels of solanine , which is produced at the same time as chlorophyll , have increased as well .

According to a recent report by Alexander Pavlista , a professor of agronomy and horticulture at the University of Nebraska , Lincoln , a 100 - pound person would have to eat about 16 ounces of a fully green potato to get sick .
That is the weight of a large baked potato .
The Japanese are an incredibly efficient people .
They work harder , stronger and faster than their American and European counterparts , and seem almost allergic to the idea of taking sick days and holidays .
With that said , perhaps this is why I was n’t surprised to discover this sign outside a chic bar in Shibuya , advertising a 26:00 closing .
Now , although I ’ve never been in the military , I ’m fairly certain that after 24:00 , the clock is supposed to roll back to 0:00 with the start of a new day .
I guess this brings about a simple question : if you had 26 hours in a day , what would you do with your extra time ?
Perhaps this is the real reason why the Japanese are so efficient .

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
State health officials are decrying new federal guidelines that require many children to be uninsured for a full year before they have access to government - subsidized coverage .
Waiting periods prevent families from dropping private insurance to get cheaper or better coverage for their kids through the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , or SCHIP .
But the vast majority of states require much shorter waits — typically one month to six months — than the Bush administration will require .
Only Alaska has a one - year wait ; in 16 states , there is no waiting period .
State officials say the policy could prevent pregnant women from having health coverage during any portion of their pregnancy or it could keep children from obtaining insurance even if a parent has died or lost a job .
" It would actually increase the number of uninsured children , " said Deborah Bachrach , deputy commissioner in New York 's Office of Health Insurance Programs .
" We think it 's bad policy . "
New York has applied to expand its program coverage to families with incomes up to 400 % of the poverty level — a threshold that many say the program was not intended to serve .
Under the New York policy , a family of three earning as much as $ 68,680 could participate .
In its request to expand eligibility , the state said it would enact a six - month waiting period .
Currently , the state has none .
The one - year wait is " simply unconscionable , " Bachrach said .
" New York could not agree to that . "
Many of the state Medicaid directors who participated in a conference call Wednesday to discuss the guidelines were upset .
" Not having any coverage for a year flies in the face of the health care reform efforts the states have been undertaking , " said Martha Roherty , director of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors .
The one - year minimum applies to states that extend program coverage to more moderate - income families — specifically , to families whose income exceeds 250 % of the federal poverty level , or $ 43,925 for a family of three .
It is estimated that 18 states and the District of Columbia are in that category or have plans to expand coverage to at least that level .
Dennis Smith , who oversees the Medicaid program at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , spelled out in a letter last week several new requirements the administration planned for those particular states .
The new requirements were first reported by The Associated Press .
Smith said states that use the children 's insurance program to cover families above 250 % of the poverty level must make some assurances to prevent the substituting of public insurance for private plans .
The program subsidizes the cost of health insurance for families whose incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford private insurance .
Both the Senate and the House passed bills this summer that would increase substantially the spending on the program .
Bush has promised to a vet if they reach his desk in their current form .
Several states have lowered their waiting period since the program began a decade ago .
Georgia and Florida are the only states to increase theirs .
Both states require children to be uninsured for six months before they can enroll .
Connecticut dropped its waiting period from six months to two months .
New Jersey has dropped its waiting period twice — it now is three months — and allows for exceptions .
" We think it 's very bad public policy to prohibit children from coming onto our program , " said Ann C. Kohler , deputy commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Human Services .
" There 's absolutely no evidence that people are dropping their private coverage to go on SCHIP . "
The Congressional Budget Office said this year the program does result in some substitution of private insurance for public insurance .
For every 100 children who enroll , there is a corresponding reduction in private coverage of between 25 and 50 children .
Other states that would be affected by the new guidelines include Maryland and Massachusetts , which have six - month waiting periods .
In Minnesota and the state of Washington , children have to be uninsured for four months before they can participate .
Vermont has a one - month wait .
Rhode Island has none .
Vermont Gov. James Douglas , a Republican , was highly critical of the guidelines .
" I am disappointed and dismayed by the Bush Administration 's recent actions regarding SCHIP and by the shortsightedness that seems to continually emanate from Washington , " said Douglas .

One of my cats – the one that has not yet appeared on I Can Has Cheezburger – has developed an elaborate routine for getting me up to feed him in the morning .
It involves a lot of meowing , jumping on things , knocking things over , and the occasional loud coughing up of hairballs .
I can't prove that last bit is intentional , but I 'm pretty sure it is .
If I had a real job I would n't have to set an alarm clock , but as it is I feel that this is a problem that I must solve , as I solve all my problems , with technology .

The technology in this case is an automatic cat feeder .
Most of the automatic feeders on Amazon come with reviews detailing how the cats have managed to work around the DRM ( dinner rights management ) built into them .
No matter what lies between them and kibble , the cats manage to prod , pull and shove their way to an extra serving .
I 'm buying one anyway , because I have a Dremel tool , and somehow that convinces me that I can re-engineer the thing to outsmart the one primal urge a cat has left after being sterilized .
I already have an automatic water dispenser for the cats , and I 'm thoughtfully eyeing one of those elaborate automatic self - cleaning litter boxes that scoops , flushes and sprays its interior with the delicate scent of live mice , the better to make it not just a litter box , but a space to exist .
It occurs to me that with the proper application of money and floor space , you can get machines to take on most of the duties incumbent upon the cat owner .
For instance , any number of electronic cat toys will whip a fuzzy thing around so you can watch Best Week Ever without having to move any part of your body .
Better yet , they make actual electronic mice .
When I get that time machine working , I 'm going to go back to colonial times and explain to a farmer that in the future , we go to the store and buy artificial vermin .
I 'm sure he 'll enjoy thinking about that when he's not busy watching locusts eat his crops or burying his children .
This covers most of the services I provide to my cat , but not all of them .
Let 's start with the scratching and / or skritching .
As far as I can see , this is between my cat and my hand , with very little participation from me .
I just kind of stick out my hand and make a repetitive scratching movement , and my cat moves his head and neck around to his liking .
I can even do it while playing Warcraft , provided the other people in my group do n't mind dying for a cat 's pleasure once in a while .
Really , though , there 's no reason I could n't substitute one of those robotic hands scientists build to prove that some day robots will be able to make shadow puppets .
Just stick it on a " repetitive scratching motion loop " and the cat can go nuts , assuming he is n't terrified by the whirring and buzzing .
On the other hand , fiction teaches us that a ) most robots turn evil and b ) most severed hands turn evil , so maybe this is n't such a good idea .
After that I only need to build a robotic lap – I think that 's called a " heating pad " – and some sort of sweeper arm to knock the cat off my desk when he 's being pesky , and then I 'm set .
Modern science has very nearly rendered human beings unnecessary when it comes to the life of a cat .
And you know , I can't back this up biologically , but I somehow suspect this is how the cats planned it all along .
Time may prove that , evolutionarily speaking , we are simply a large and complex external cat organ , one given the duty of making itself obsolete .
I think , on some level , we know this .
That 's why so many stories and movies and TV shows are about robots replacing mankind .
I think if you look carefully , somewhere in the corner of their austere mechanical fortresses , you 'll see a cat box being scooped .

I tried to think of a witty , ironic title for this post , but in the end , I simply could n’t .
The above title is a literal statement of fact .
A reader named Warren Smith informs me of an Australian TV commercial ( which you can watch on YouTube ) , in which two fashion models have the following conversation :
Model 1 : But if quantum mechanics is n’t physics in the usual sense — if it ’s not about matter , or energy , or waves — then what is it about ?
Model 2 : Well , from my perspective , it ’s about information , probabilities , and observables , and how they relate to each other .
Model 1 : That ’s interesting !
The commercial then flashes the tagline “ A more intelligent model , ” followed by a picture of a Ricoh printer .
More intelligent , or simply more shameless ?
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , allow me to quote from Lecture 9 of my Quantum Computing Since Democritus notes :
But if quantum mechanics is n’t physics in the usual sense — if it ’s not about matter , or energy , or waves , or particles — then what is it about ?
From my perspective , it ’s about information and probabilities and observables , and how they relate to each other .
For almost the first time in my life , I ’m at a loss for words .
I do n’t know how to respond .
I do n’t know which of 500,000 possible jokes to make .
Help me , readers .
Should I be flattered ?
Should I be calling a lawyer ?

The longer I blog , the more I despair of ever achieving my central goal in life , namely for everyone to like me .
Also :
Many commenters seem to assume the pilfered quote is just my expression of the conventional wisdom .
Well , it should be , and I wish it were !
But as Avi Wigderson pointed out to me , the idea that quantum mechanics is about information rather than waves or particles is still extremely non-standard , and would have been considered insane fifteen years ago .
Update ( 10/5 ) :
This is not to say it ’s my idea ( as other commenters assumed I was saying ) !
If any entity can claim “ ownership ” of the idea , I would think it ’s the entire quantum computing and information community .
The longer I blog , the more I despair of ever achieving my secondary goal in life , namely for everyone to understand me .
Most of the 80,000 who attended the conference were Indonesian
The Islamist group Hizb ut - Tahrir - which organised the conference - said it had been the largest gathering of Muslim activists from around the world .
However , the group is illegal in many countries and key speakers have been stopped from entering Indonesia .
A caliphate - or single state for Muslims - last existed in 1924 .
Hizb ut - Tahrir regards this as the ideal form of government , because it follows what it believes are the laws of God as set out in the Koran , rather than laws designed by man .
The group says it seeks to set up a caliphate by non-violent means - but many experts see it as ideologically close to jihadist groups .
It is banned in most of the Middle East and parts of Europe .

Q&A : Hizb ut - Tahrir
If the audience turnout was impressive , not so the speakers lined up to address the crowd , our correspondent adds .
One by one , over the past few days , seven of the delegates invited to speak have dropped out .
Barred
Controversial Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir was asked to stay away on security grounds , while three national leaders cancelled at the last minute .
The Palestinian delegate was unable to leave the Palestinian Territories , and representatives from Britain and Australia landed in Jakarta on Friday but were refused permission to enter the country .
Hizb ut - Tahrir 's spokesman in Indonesia said he was disappointed about these problems and said that the Indonesian authorities had not told the group why its speakers had been barred .
Key speakers were barred from travelling to Indonesia
Hizb ut - Tahrir - or Liberation Party - was founded in Jerusalem in the 1950s by Palestinian religious scholar Taqiuddin an - Nabhani .
Today it has a mainly clandestine following in the Middle East , a large presence in Central Asia - where hundreds of its members have been jailed - and active supporters in the West , including London , which is believed to be one of its main bases .
Many experts see it as ideologically close to jihadist groups , and suspect its commitment to peaceful means is purely tactical .

Last Mon­day , NPR ( very good US - based radio sta­tion ) had a pro­gram on “ do brain train­ing pro­grams work ? ” that reflect­ed very old - fash­ioned think­ing .
In short , the guest speak­ers talked and talked about the impor­tance of nutri­tion and phys­i­cal exer­cise ( both very impor­tant , as we have cov­ered in this blog mul­ti­ple times ) , and expressed skep­ti­cism about the con­cept of exer­cis­ing our brains to improve atten­tion , mem­o­ry and oth­er skills …
I guess it takes a while to change old men­tal par­a­digms ( And yes , some pro­grams work bet­ter than oth­ers ) .
Neu­ro­sci­en­tists have final­ly debunked that old think­ing that our brains decline inex­orably after a cer­tain age with lit­tle each of us can do to “ exer­cise ” or “ train our brains ” .
But do n’t trust me .
Dur­ing the last year I have had the for­tune to inter­view 11 cut­ting - edge neu­ro­sci­en­tists and cog­ni­tive psy­chol­o­gists on their research and thoughts .
Here are some of my favorite quotes ( you can read the full inter­view notes by click­ing the links ) :

Let ’s see when this sto­ry makes it into NPR .
The central bank also reduced its discount rate , the interest it charges in making direct loans to banks , by a half - point as well .
The Fed already had cut the discount rate on Aug. 17 as it scrambled to respond to the growing credit crisis .
Stocks immediately rallied on the moves , which were more aggressive than many investors had expected .
The action was designed to boost economic growth by lowering borrowing costs for millions of consumers and businesses .
Commercial banks were expected to quickly match the Fed 's action by cutting their prime lending rate .
The prime rate has been at 8.25 percent for the past 15 months .
The Fed 's action came in the midst of the worst slump in housing in 16 years .
That downturn has triggered record defaults in subprime mortgages and roiled financial markets around the globe as investors have become worried about where the spreading credit problems will next appear .
The financial market turmoil represents the first major test for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , who took over from the venerable Alan Greenspan in February 2006 .
Tightening Credit
In explaining its action Tuesday , the Fed said that " the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally . "
