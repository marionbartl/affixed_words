I am an unabashed partisan of the Web — its architecture , culture , and content .
I ’m proud to have played a very small part in shaping bits of the machinery and having contributed probably too many words to that content But as for HTML5 ?
It ’s a good enough thing to the extent it turns out to work .
But nothing terribly important depends on it .
Let me start with some anecdotal evidence .
Item : I got mail from really well - known Web technologist — his competence is not in doubt — making his first foray into mobile development .
He wrote : “ I ’m trying to avoid appstore hell by developing rich HTML5 apps , but the performance on iPhone is shoddy whenever network IO is going on , and I seem to be able to crash the browser on our departmental Nexus
One with such frequency it 's not even funny .
I think I 've got a lot of optimization to do to my app to dial down network access , but I just wondered what the jungle drums say about HTML5 as a sensible approach for delivering apps in 2010 . ”
Item :
The HTML specification process is controversy - laden , immensely ambitious , and is attempting to boil at least one ocean .
There is no guarantee of success , no matter how you choose to measure it .
Item : Apple and Adobe get into a major public pissing match ; the club each side is bashing the other with is prominently labeled “ Open ” and “ Web ” .
Item : Ben Ward writes Understand The Web which rambles all over the place , has an egregious grammar botch in the first sentence , but makes some really important points .
What ’s The Web ?
· I wear my biases on my sleeve as one of those who helped write The Architecture of the World Wide Web .
The Web is a tripod , depending critically on three architectural principles :
Pieces of the Web , which we call Resources , are identified by short strings of characters called “ URIs ” .
Work is accomplished by exchanging messages , which comprise metadata and representations of Resources .
The representations are expressed in a number of well - defined data formats ; you can count on the message data to tell you which one is in use .
It is essential that some of the representation formats be capable of containing URIs .
The “ Web ” in WWW is that composed by the universe of Resources linked by the URIs in their representations .
That ’s all .
You notice that there ’s nothing there that depends crucially on any flavor of HTML .
Speaking only for myself , an increasingly large proportion of my Web experience arrives in the form of feed entries and Twitter posts ; not HTML at all , but 100 % part of the Web .
On Flash ·
This may be a side - trip , but anyhow : I entirely loathe Flash but by any definition it ’s part of the Web .
It works just fine as a resource representation and it can contain URI hyperlinks .
What ’s not to like , then ?
Well , the user experience , which in my experience is fourth - rate for anything but games ;
No “ Back ” button , feaugh .
And of the course the fact that it remains essentially proprietary .
So , I use a Flash - blocker every day , and I am not a friend of Flash inside Google , but none of my arguments have anything to do with being part of the Web , or not .
Native Applications ·
A large proportion of the native applications on iPhone , and on Android , and on Windows , and on Mac , and on Linux , are Web applications .
They depend in a fundamental way on being able to recognize and make intelligent use of hyperlinks and traverse the great big wonderful Web .
Those apps that are not so enabled are in general the worse for it .
So whatever you may think of native applications , please do n’t try to pretend that they are ( or are not ) necessarily good citizens of the Web .
Being native ( or not ) has nothing to do with it .
Why HTML5 Then ?
· Obviously , there are two reasons for all the white heat and white light around HTML5 .
First , HTML - based software has historically provided a better user experience compared to what went before .
Everyone in our profession knows that building a good user interface is maddeningly difficult .
The discovery , in the early Web browsers , that reasonably - typeset text which embedded simple forms and hyperlinks , and came equipped with a “ Back ” button , hit the biggest 80/20 point ever in the history of User Interfaces , could n’t have been predicted by anybody ; but it ’s as true today as ever .
Second , writing software is slow and expensive ; HTML5 offers the promise that you can do less of it , go faster and cheaper , just because it works across many platforms .
And Your Point Is ?
· HTML5 promises to broaden the class of application problems you can solve with HTML , providing a good user experience while saving time and money .
But that ’s all ; it ’s not better because it ’s “ Web Technology ” , it ’s better because it ’s better .
Except when it is n’t .
Right now , there are certain classes of applications , particularly on mobile devices , where you ’re going to get a better result by building a native app .
Maybe even by building two or three native apps , for iPhone and Android and webOS .
This is entirely orthogonal to the “ Webbiness ” ( or not ) of the technologies .
And another point : building a really hot HTML5 application that takes advantage of the nice new features is not exactly easy .
Even assuming that you ’re using one of the dozens of clever toolkits , it ’s still not a slam - dunk .
In fact , compared to the level of support and tooling you get from XCode on the Apple side or the various pieces of Android IDE - ware , HTML5 development is a major pain in the ass .
Let ’s Do Scenarios ·
What ’s the best thing that could happen ?
Some widely - interoperable dialect of HTML5 becomes broadly usable quicker than expected , and we get decent tooling around it quicker than expected , and the nature of the devices evolves slowly enough so as not to outpace heavyweight browser technology .
In this world , software user experience is on average better and development cost is on average lower .
The worst thing that can happen ?
HTML5 is holed below the waterline by some combination of interpersonal toxicity and corporate land - grabs and intellectual - property litigation ; does n’t become a really appealing application platform for a few more years .
But the best case does n’t help the Web , as such , all that much , and the worst case does n’t really damage it .
Because every interesting application , more or less , is already a Web application .
Once again , HTML5 is n’t better because it ’s a “ Web ” technology .
It might prove to be a user - experience and developer - productivity win .
That ’d be nice .
But I ’m neither holding my breath in anticipation nor losing sleep over delays and obstacles .
The Web will do OK .

Backers of an initiative to repeal Proposition 8 , the California ban on same - sex marriage , have failed to gather enough signatures to place it on the ballot in November .
The supporters say they will try to qualify the measure for the November 2012 election .
Gay rights activists had been split on whether to push such a measure this year or in 2012 .
The largest groups supported waiting for the next presidential election .
Those supporting a vote this year said the division hampered their fundraising and volunteer efforts .
They needed slightly more than 694,000 signatures of registered voters to place the measure on the ballot and had until Monday to collect that amount .
Leaders of the effort would not disclose how many signatures they gathered .
" It was n't close enough to submit signatures to county registrars , " said Sean Bohac , who was chairman of an advisory panel for the effort , called Restore Equality 2010 .
The group raised about $ 10,550 , according to the California secretary of state .
Prop. 8 supporters said the failure shows that voters in California prefer allowing only heterosexual couples to marry .
" Even the minority of Californians who voted against Prop. 8 have accepted that the majority rules and moved on to other issues , " said Brian Brown , executive director of the National Organization for Marriage , a major backer of Prop .
8 .
Prop. 8 passed in November 2008 with 52 percent of the vote .
Opponents have filed a federal lawsuit over the ban , which could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court .
A poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California last month found for the first time more voters support same - sex marriage than oppose it , with 50 percent in favor and 45 percent in opposition .
Bohac said that he expects gay rights groups to unify behind the effort to repeal the ban in the 2012 election and that he does not expect the rift to have damaged the movement .
The Prop. 8 repeal is not the only marriage - related measure that failed to qualify for November 's election .
An initiative to outlaw divorce , the brainchild of Sacramento Web designer John Marcotte , missed its deadline last week .
Marcotte said he and volunteers had gathered about 8,000 signatures - they also needed about 694,000 - and said he plans to refile as well .
" We ca n't ask gays to shoulder the entire burden of protecting traditional marriage , " Marcotte said .
Apple announced in late April that its annual Apple Design Awards , given every year since 1997 during its annual Worldwide Developers Conference , would only be awarded for iPhone and iPad apps this year .
While iPhone OS 4.0 and Apple 's mobile devices are indeed the new hotness , long - time Mac OS X developers felt a little slighted .
Ars decided that if Apple was too preoccupied with mobile devices to recognize noteworthy software on the Mac , then we would pick up the torch .
As such , we are announcing the first ever Ars Design Awards .
We are giving you , our readers , the opportunity to nominate your favorite Mac OS X applications to receive an award in one of five categories : Best New App , Best User Experience , Most Innovative App , Best K - 12 Education App , and Best Student - created App .
We will accept nominations until Friday , May 21 .
At that time , we 'll tally the top five nominations in each category , and the Ars staff will choose from among these a winner for each award .
We 'll also collect the top ten apps among all categories receiving the most nominations , and put those ten apps to a vote for a special Reader 's Choice award .
The nominees will be announced and Reader 's Choice voting will begin on Monday , May 24 .
Reader 's Choice voting will be open for one week , giving us enough time to tally the votes , and winners for all awards will be announced during WWDC in June .
( Note : Though Apple 's decision was the inspiration behind our own awards , we will also be awarding apps for Windows and possibly Linux at a later date .
Windows awards will coincide this year with PDC in fall . )
Without further ado , please nominate your picks for top Mac OS X apps below :

One million could lose jobless benefits in March
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More than 1 million people could lose their jobless benefits and health insurance subsidy in March if Congress does n't act fast .
When it returns from the President 's Day recess on Monday , the Senate will have one week to extend the deadlines to apply for federal unemployment benefits and the COBRA health insurance subsidy .
Currently , the jobless have until Feb. 28 to sign up .
Without an extension , people receiving state jobless benefits wo n't be able to apply for additional federally paid unemployment insurance , and anyone already receiving those checks could be cut off .
Justin Julian is one the 1 million people who are desperate for Congress to take action next week .
If they do n't , he and his wife wo n't have a place to live .
The Lewisville , Texas , resident lost his software position in August and will miss the deadline to apply for additional federal benefits by only a few days .
He currently receives $ 1,600 a month in unemployment benefits , which he uses to cover rent , car payments and the electricity bill .
He must borrow money from friends and family to pay for food .
" Without the unemployment insurance , we can't pay any of our bills , " said Julian , 39 , whose wife is disabled .
" It 's kind of doomsday for us .
We 'll wind up sleeping on friends ' couches . "
Stalled in the Senate
Lawmakers were on track last week to introduce legislation that would have extended the deadlines to May 31 at a cost of $ 25 billion over 10 years .
But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , decided Thursday to offer a slimmed - down job creation package that did not include the provision .
But Reid plans to address the jobless benefits deadlines when Congress returns next week , a Senate Democratic aide said .
" We also hope to pass an extension of expiring provisions , including unemployment insurance and COBRA , next week , " the aide said .
" With Republican cooperation , we should be able to do so . "
In December , the House passed a $ 154 billion job creation package that extended the deadlines to June 30 .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , last week urged her Senate colleagues to pass a more comprehensive jobs measure .
While extending the deadline generally enjoys bipartisan support , passing a bill to do so is an entirely different matter .
Last year , it took seven weeks for legislation extending unemployment benefits to get through the Senate .
But when lawmakers finally took up the measure , it passed by a 98 - 0 vote .
Potentially out of luck
About 11.5 million people currently depend on jobless benefits .
Nearly one in 10 Americans are out of work and a record 41.2 % have been unemployed for at least six months .
The average unemployment period lasts a record 30.2 weeks .
" These are essential benefits that people spend on food , utilities and housing , " said Judy Conti , federal advocacy coordinator at the National Employment Law Project .
While unemployment benefits now run as long as 99 weeks , depending on the state , not everyone will receive checks for that long a stretch .
Those who run out of their 26 weeks of state - paid coverage after Feb. 28 would not be able to apply for federal benefits .
The jobless currently receiving extended federal benefits , which are divided into tiers , would stop getting checks once they complete their tier .
The law project would like to see the deadline extended to the end of the year so " workers do n't fall hostage " to the machinations within Congress , Conti said .
Julian agrees , saying waiting for lawmakers to act has been " a living hell . "
State agencies are expected to start mailing notices to the jobless to alert them to the impending end of their benefits .
While the economy is slowly recovering , hiring is expected to remain slow in coming years .
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at about 10 % this year , according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers , and wo n't fall back to its 2008 level of 5.8 % for another seven years .
HOMOSEXUAL hunting in AFL circles should stop .
Two former AFL players are rumoured to have been offered $ 150,000 to be the first to publicly come out as gay .
And rumours in the past two weeks suggested a Victorian - based player was ready to out himself - rumours that have been baseless .
If a player wants to out himself , then I say good luck .
But I believe the world of AFL footy is not ready for it .
To come out is unnecessary for a lot of reasons .
Imagine the publicity associated with a current player admitting he 's gay .
It would be international news and could break the fabric of a club .
Football clubs are very different environments .
Locker room nudity is an everyday part of our lives and unlike any other work place .
I believe it would cause discomfort in that environment should someone declare himself gay .
I have played with a gay player in the twos for Mayne in Queensland in the mid-1990s who was happy to admit his sexual persuasion .
He was a great guy who played his heart out and was respected by everyone in the team .
The only time I noticed a difference was when I was showering with 10 other players after a good win and I turned around to see all 10 heading out in a second with their towels .
Sure enough , our gay teammate had wandered in .
For some reason I felt uncomfortable , so I left .
I am sure most players these days would do the same .
I know he was n't about to try and convert me to his way of thinking , but I was uncomfortable all the same .
What I should have done was to sit down and talk with him in an attempt to understand his life .
Away from football , I 'm all for any initiative that helps lessen public bias against homosexuality , such as IDAHO ( International Day Against Homophobia ) , which was run on Monday .
If you thought suicide was bad among young men , it is four to six times higher for people who are attracted to the same sex .
It clearly can be a difficult and lonely road , one that hopefully can be made easier .
Now try being the first AFL player to come out .
That is too big a burden for any player .
I know there are many who think a public AFL outing would break down homophobia , but they do n't live in football clubs .
It 's not the job of the minority to make the environment safer .
Not now , anyway .
We have made massive steps in other areas of society and in time I hope the environment changes to a degree where coming out is n't a big deal .
In women 's sport - tennis , golf , cricket , hockey and soccer - being gay carries no stigma .
But men's sport is well behind in acceptance .
Take American - born British national John Amaechi , who became the first NBA professional to come out when he published his book Man in the Middle .
Amaechi claims he has spoken to a dozen professional players who are gay .
He says none have asked him if they should come out , but if they did he would tell them not to .
After all he is not a gay rights activist .
In an athletic environment the rules are different from the cultural rules for men .
Never in a mall will you see two straight men hugging , a--- slapping and jumping around like kids after an important goal .
Locker room nudity and homoerotic activities are normal inside footy clubs .
Young people from the ages 15 - 24 are the main participants in organised sport in Victoria .
Some of them must be gay and I hope they thoroughly enjoy their sporting lives without having to experience any form of prejudice .
But if they are thinking of telling the world , my advice would be forget it .

How do you recreate the dynamics of the Earth ’s oceans in a laboratory ?
This is exactly what Iakov Afanassiev from Memorial University of Newfoundland , Canada , has done with an experiment using a rotating platform of fluid .
The shape and rotation of the Earth are crucial in ocean dynamics , and the platform mimics both of these .
The centre can be thought of as the North Pole .
This fluorescent " ocean " of fluid is observed by cameras from above .
A coloured filter above the platform enables the team to " code " the topography of the fluid 's surface - the tiniest of perturbations appear as different colours .
Here , a wave occurs downstream of a model underwater mountain on the floor of the tank .
Researchers have used the experiment to recreate a planetary scale wave known as a Rossby wave , which travels from the eastern to the western boundary of the ocean .
Here the wave , which is blue and green , forms to the west of the model mountain .
“ Vortices [ or spinning motions of fluid ] are abundant in the ocean and are often observed on satellite images , ” explains Professor Afanassiev .
With this experiment , they can be reproduced and studied in detail .
The ocean plays a major role in our climate .
This experiment allows scientists to observe its dynamics and to take detailed measurements of their speed and direction .
The results can be used to improve mathematical models of climatic processes .
Planetary scale waves also contribute to the formation of narrow jets – just like jet streams in the atmosphere .
These are more subtle than atmospheric jets , but are likely to play an important role in climate .
It is so tough not to get over - excited about this team right now .
Yes it is only one series and yes , there ’s still a ways to go .
Yes they ’ve made it to the second round several times in recent years and yes , they ’ve gone no further .
But this series has been all about the highs and lows .
It ’s been a roller - coaster of emotion .
It started off with two overtime nail - biters , continued with a crushing loss , followed by a thrilling comeback , a blowout victory and yet another third period resurrection .
As much as you ’re supposed to temper your emotions in the post - season , always keeping an eye on what ’s still to come …
It ’s hard .
I rolled in the valleys and I ’m rocking the peak right now .
Because after a troubling start — with somewhat shaky goaltending , absolutely atrocious penalty - killing and an under - performing support staff — the Canucks turned it all around .
They proved that the regular season was not a mirage — they really were who we thought they were .
This was an incredible series to watch .
Game 4 was easily one of the most entertaining sporting events I ’ve ever seen , and in many ways was a microcosm for the series itself .
There were shades of rough goaltending by Roberto Luongo in the early - going , as he let an easily gloveable puck pop out to the slot only to be scooped into the net by ( who else ? )
Drew Doughty .
It almost goes without saying that it was a powerplay goal , as the penalty - killing woes continued .
But somewhere in the second period , things began to change .
Luongo began to take his game to the super - human level once more .
The PK started pressing the puck instead of letting the Kings ’ point - men do whatever they wanted with it .
And Pavol Demitra found the Olympic form that ’s been missing from his game with the Canucks .
The Kings still led after two , and looked like they could take a stranglehold on the series , but Vancouver was trending in the right direction .
And in the third period , they took over .
A day after Don Cherry called for him to give up the ‘ C’ , Roberto Luongo emphatically showed why he ’s this team ’s leader .
With the Kings already up by one , Alexander Frolov broke in alone only to be stoned by the captain .
It proved to be the turning point in the series , sparking the team up - front .
From that point on , they dominated .
That powerhouse offensive team that I was left waiting for after Game 3 ?
They finally arrived , storming the Kings , and Jonathan Quick had no answers for them .
Sure the Kings tied it up late to make things interesting , but I never really felt like the result was in doubt .
And just like they did to close the series in Game 6 , a Sedin showed up late with the game on the line to stick a dagger in the heart of the Kings before a member of the team ’s other dynamic duo added an empty - netter to seal the deal .
Henrik ’s goal was a moment of pure elation , and he let loose the type of emotion seldom seen from a Swede .
Perhaps it ’s a product of growing up in the era of Markus Naslund ’s “ someone just killed my dog ” post - goal stares , but to see Hank explode with enthusiasm after scoring that goal was beautiful .
It hearkened back to watching Ed Jovanovski pound the glass in the penalty box , except the Art Ross winner was scoring the game - winner instead sitting in the box for the season - ending goal .
I simply can not say enough good things about the twins in this series .
I really wanted to meet the Kings in the first round .
They were a team Vancouver should beat , but they also had a potent enough offense to really test Luongo and help him get back into “ the zone ” .
It may have taken longer than some would like , but he did just that .
After taking steps towards excellence in Game 4 , he was down - right spectacular in 5 and 6 .
There have been times this year , and in this series , where I ’ve winced every time a puck ’s gone on net — a feeling I have n’t felt since the days of Dan Cloutier and Alex Auld .
Times where “ it seemed like every shot had a chance ” .
By the end of this series , Luongo looked every bit as good as he did in the 2007 playoffs , when he provided some of the best goaltending this city has ever seen .
The key difference ?
Those performances were wasted on a team that was anaemic offensively .
This incarnation seems to be able to score at will .
Best of all the series went six games , allowing the team ( and Luongo ) to get a little rest before the second round , but not enough to lose their rhythm , as they seemed to after sweeping St. Louis last year .
It just would n’t be the playoffs if there were n’t unexpected heroes stepping up and delivering huge performances .
In this series , Mikael Samuelsson , Steve Bernier and Shane O’Brien provided that for Vancouver .
All year long Samuelsson ’s valuable playoff experience has been a media talking point , but I do n’t think anyone could have predicted he would do this .
To put his league - leading seven goals in context , after only five games with the team , the former Red Wing had already scored more career playoff goals for Vancouver than Todd Bertuzzi ever managed to .
Bernier was a playoff hero against St. Louis as well , but he penned another chapter in his folk legend this year .
The much - maligned winger took literally thousands of shots on empty nets from in - close over the summer , in an effort to make that reflex part of his muscle memory .
That hard work finally paid off , as he made no mistake in burying the chances he got in this series .
Come to think of it , he too is now tied with Bertuzzi on Vancouver ’s all - time playoff goals list .
How depressing is that ?
O’Brien meanwhile was the center of attention twice in this series , both for the wrong reasons : first for spouting off at associate coach Rick Bowness , then for gesturing to the crowd after a fight with L.A. ’s Wayne Simmonds .
Lost in all this was the way he was able to channel those fiery emotions into fantastic play .
He looked like a legitimate top - four defender in this series , and his strong play went a long way in mitigating both the absence of Willie Mitchell and the continued mediocrity of Kevin Bieksa .
Only once did he seem in over his head , in Game 5 where he got stuck circling down low against Anze Kopitar .
Personally I ’m more inclined to fault Bowness for allowing that mismatch than blame O’Brien for not being able to match up well against one of the league ’s speediest power - forwards .
As for the taunting that led Terry Murray to call him a clown ?
It may not have been the smartest move in the world , but the crowd in GM Place ate it up — as did audiences watching across the province .
The bar I was at went crazy after his fight .
And the real clown in this series had his shoulder dislocated in the other fight anyway .
It was n’t all roses , however .
The second line of Alex Burrows , Ryan Kesler and Mason Raymond really needs to step up their game going forward .
While Kesler did what he could and played quite well for the most part , he was clearly hampered by his rather ineffective linemates .
I ’m not convinced Burrows is fully healthy at the moment , but the Canucks will need more from him to go on a deep run .
His only point of the series came in the dying minutes on an empty net , and that ’s just not good enough .
The third line played well enough to mask the second ’s struggles ( minus Kyle Wellwood , who was wildly inconsistent ) , but who knows if that will happen again in the next round .
They have to be better .
Still , give the Kings credit .
Beyond Dustin Brown ’s shameless diving , they have a lot to be proud of .
They pushed the Canucks harder than many thought they would , myself included .
There were times where it looked like they might even win the series .
What can I say about Drew Doughty other than it would be no surprise if the 20 - year - old defenseman wins his first Norris in a few short months ?
His plus- minus is skewed by the fact that the Kings scored the majority of their goals on the powerplay , so do n’t let that - 5 rating fool you .
He was sensational in this series , and will only get better as time goes by .
Really , you could say the same for most of the Kings ’ young core .
If they can get better goaltending than what Quick provided them in this series , they will be a team to be reckoned with for quite some time .
But not yet .
So try as I might not to get too excited … I just can’t .
After this series , how could anyone ?
The second round ca n’t start soon enough .
Activists in South Korea have defied warnings from the government of North Korea and sent a host of giant balloons to the reclusive state .
The balloons were released near the border carrying leaflets , DVDs , and money as part of a campaign organised by mainly North Korean defectors .
Dimitri O'Donnell reports .
With the Cataclysm beta around the corner , Blizzard has finally pulled the sheet off of the female members of the playable Worgen race .
When Blizzard announced Cataclysm , its third expansion to MMOG behemoth World of Warcraft , it revealed that the game would be getting two new playable races :
The Horde would be getting the profit - minded , explosion - happy Goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel , and Alliance would be joining up with the Worgen - cursed inhabitants of Gilneas ( essentially , Victorian werewolves ) .
One of the biggest questions players had , though , was this :
What the hell would the female Worgen look like ?
All of the existing art and models - and everything Blizzard showed at BlizzCon '09 - had been based on male lycanthropes .
We 'd seen the male Worgen , and both the male and female Goblins , but Blizzard was keeping the female Worgen tightly under wraps .
Until they sent us the images you see below earlier today , anyway .
So , if you were intending to roll a female Worgen once Cataclysm hit , this is what you 're going to look like .
It 's worth noting that Blizzard stressed that these are , in fact , a work in progress and will likely change slightly by the time the game comes out .
So , keep that in mind .
Honestly , though ?
It 's tough to say , and I 'll have to withhold final judgment until we see them fully animated , but I like 'em .
It 's the little touches in the model that get me : Notice how the ears are upright when they 're standing still , but flattened in the " action " poses ?
If you 've ever owned a dog with that type of ear , that 's pretty damn accurate .
Also , those claws look pretty wicked - no wonder Worgen Leatherworkers do n't need a skinning knife to do their job .
Ouch !
I think Blizzard has done a pretty good job here of striking a fine line between " feral badass " and " nice to look at . "
Back in Burning Crusade , the Horde got an " attractive " race in the Blood Elves , but the Alliance has been missing a similarly " bestial , monstrous " race of their own .
And no , the Draenei do n't count , they 're just Russian .
What do you guys think ?
Do you like how the female Worgen look ?
Are you more or less likely to create one now ?

I ride my bike to work .
It seems so pure .
We 're constantly urged to " go green " — use less energy , shrink our carbon footprint , save the Earth .
How ?
We should drive less , use ethanol , recycle plastic , and buy things with the government 's Energy Star label .
But what if much of going green is just bunk ?
Al Gore 's group , Repower America , claims we can replace all our dirty energy with clean , carbon - free renewables .
Gore says we can do it within 10 years .
" It 's simply not possible , " says Robert Bryce , author of Power Hungry : The Myths of " Green " Energy .
" Nine out of 10 units of power that we consume are produced by hydrocarbons — coal , oil and natural gas .
Any transition away from those sources is going to be a decades - long , maybe even a century - long process . …
The world consumes 200 million barrels of oil equivalent in hydrocarbons per day .
We would have to find the energy equivalent of 23 Saudi Arabias . "
Bryce used to be a left - liberal , but then : " I educated myself about math and physics .
I 'm a liberal who was mugged by the laws of thermodynamics . "
Bryce mocked the " green " value of my riding my bike to work :
" Let 's assume you saved a gallon of oil in your commute ( a generous assumption ! ) .
Global daily energy consumption is 9.5 billion gallons of oil equivalent . …
So by biking to work , you save the equivalent of one drop in 10 gasoline tanker trucks .
Put another way , it 's one pinch of salt in a 100 - pound bag of potato chips . "
How about wind power ?
" Wind does not replace oil .
This is one of the great fallacies , and it's one that the wind energy business continues to promote , " Bryce said .
The problem is that windmills cannot provide a constant source of electricity .
Wind turbines only achieve 10 percent to 20 percent of their maximum capacity because sometimes the wind does n't blow .
" That means you have to keep conventional power plants up and running .
You have to ramp them up to replace the power that disappears from wind turbines and ramp them down when power reappears . "
Yet the media rave about Denmark , which gets some power from wind .
New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman says , " If only we could be as energy smart as Denmark . "
" Friedman does n't fundamentally understand what he 's talking about , " Bryce said .
Bryce 's book shows that Denmark uses eight times more coal and 25 times more oil than wind .
If wind and solar power were practical , entrepreneurs would invest in it .
There would be no need for government to take money from taxpayers and give it to people pushing green products .
Even with subsidies , " renewable " energy today barely makes a dent on our energy needs .
Bryce points out that energy production from every solar panel and windmill in America is less than the production from one coal mine and much less than natural gas production from Oklahoma alone .
But what if we build more windmills ?
" One nuclear power plant in Texas covers about 19 square miles , an area slightly smaller than Manhattan .
To produce the same amount of power from wind turbines would require an area the size of Rhode Island .
This is energy sprawl . "
To produce the same amount of energy with ethanol , another " green " fuel , it would take 24 Rhode Islands to grow enough corn .
Maybe the electric car is the next big thing ?
" Electric cars are the next big thing , and they always will be . "
There have been impressive headlines about electric cars from my brilliant colleagues in the media .
The Washington Post said , " Prices on electric cars will continue to drop until they 're within reach of the average family . "
That was in 1915 .
In 1959 , The New York Times said , " Electric is the car of the tomorrow . "
In 1979 , The Washington Post said , " GM has an electric car breakthrough in batteries , now makes them commercially practical . "
I 'm still waiting .
" The problem is very simple , " Bryce said .
" It 's not political will .
It 's simple physics .
Gasoline has 80 times the energy density of the best lithium ion batteries .
There 's no conspiracy here of big oil or big auto .
It 's a conspiracy of physics . "

LANSING – State and national organizations who represent the LGBT community are expressing outrage over T - shirts bearing the slogan “ Straight Pride ” offered for sale at a April 10 rally of the Tea Party Express .
The person selling the shirts said that his company was an official sponsor and financial supporter of the Tea Party Express , adding that they typically give 10 - 15 percent of their sales to the organization .
The shirt was offered for sale at a Capitol rally along with buttons featuring Glenn Beck , Sarah Palin and a host of other conservative causes and ideas .
The company also offered other T - shirts carrying slogans like “ Fox News Fan , ” the Second Amendment written out in the shape of a handgun and a drawing of two stick figures with one holding a gun to the head of the other , with the label “ socialism . ”
Gay advocacy groups say the shirts are reminiscent of the “ white pride ” slogan adopted by racist groups who oppose equality .
“ It ’s like white supremacy , ” said Penny Gardner , president of the Lansing Association for Human Rights .
“ It ’s as if they are saying the idea of supremacy is some how the American way .
The American way is about equality , and equality is all we ’re looking for . ”
“ We are past the time when marginalizing the LGBT community will nurture political power , ” added Alicia Skillman , executive director of the merged Michigan Equality / Triangle Foundation .
“ That type of thinking is narrow and extreme .
Our world should have room for multiple expressions of attractionalism but it ’s disheartening that there are signs in the Tea Party Tour pointing toward continued marginalization of LGBT persons . ”
“ It sends a message that this is a cause for a certain group of people , ” said David Holtz , executive director of Progress Michigan .
“ That group is older white people – straight , apparently .
It sends the message that if you are not in the group , you really are n’t welcome . ”
“ What ’s troubling is the idea they are getting support and clearly making money off a vendor who is making money off discrimination against gay and lesbian people , ” said Holtz .
“ And they think that ’s OK . ”
The connection comes as a new University of Washington poll found that of those Americans who supported the Tea Party movement , “ only 35 percent believe blacks to be hardworking , only 45 percent believe blacks are intelligent and only 41 percent think that blacks are trustworthy .
…
When it comes to gays and lesbians , white Tea Party supporters also hold negative attitudes .
Only 36 percent think gay and lesbian couples should be allowed to adopt children , and just 17 percent are in favor of same - sex marriage . ”
“ They are working very hard at being a fringe group , and succeeding , ” said Holtz .
Daryl Presgaves , spokesperson for the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network , said the fundraising connection was “ a cause for concern . ”
GLSEN is a national organization working on creating safe school environments for the LGBT students and staff across the country .
He said the group was particularly troubled that parents allowed a young man to purchase the T - shirt .
“ It ’s sad and troubling that some parents instill values of exclusion and teach their children to disrespect and bully those who are different from them , ” Presgaves added in a statement .
“ These shirts promote harassment and bullying of actual or perceived LGBT youth , plain and simple .
We hope the parents at the very least have the common sense and decency to not let their children wear such shirts to school . ”
“ It ’s shameful , ” said Michael Cole , a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign .
“ Homophobia has no place in our country , let alone as a tool for groups to profit from . ”
Cole had a message for the candidates who attended the rally Saturday night as well .
“ Anyone who is running for office should be mindful of these sorts of practices , because they do n’t have a place in our country , ” Cole said .
“ It especially should n’t be associated with our elected officials . ”
Speaking at the rally were gubernatorial candidates Mike Bouchard and Mike Cox .
In addition , Brian Rooney , a candidate vying for the nomination of the Republican party to challenge Mark Schauer , a freshman Democrat from Battle Creek , spoke .
Steven Mobley , a candidate for the 62nd district of the state House also addressed the crowd .
All of them are Republicans .

“ Breaking Upwards ” is about a pair of Jewish Manhattan 20 - somethings who find their relationship foundering ; but rather than split up , they choose to alternate days alone and together .
Emotions get complicated and feelings get hurt , of course , as they meet potential romantic partners and have to explain their arrangement to their uncomprehending parents ....
The story in large part echoes the experience of [ the filmmakers ]
Mr. Wein , 26 , and Ms. Lister - Jones , 27 .
A couple for six years , they “ started having issues , ” as they put it , about two years after they met , and decided to try what their parents ’ generation might term an open relationship but which they ( and anthropologists ) call polyamory .
“ I remember that we were sitting in a coffee shop much like a scene in the film , writing on a paper tablecloth , both of us being so hyper - articulate about the goals and bounds of this experiment we were going to do , ” Ms. Lister - Jones recalled .
“ It was definitely a sad moment , but we were also laughing at ourselves .
I remember that at that moment Daryl said , ‘ This would make a really funny movie . ’ ”
... The couple have been promoting “ Breaking Upwards ” over the last year with every tool available ....
After initiating an open relationship with her boyfriend , director Daryl Wein , the duo went on to write , produce , and star in “ Breaking Upwards , ” a film re-enacting their experiment with polyamory .
Issues of intimacy and autonomy abound – no surprise from 27 - year - old Lister - Jones , who garnered critical acclaim for her 2004 one - woman show , “ Codependence is a Four Letter Word , ” and went on to score roles in Law and Order , State of Play , and the upcoming Salt ( starring Angelina Jolie ) ....
... LISTER -JONES :
My mom ’s best friends are polyamorous , and they were an inspiration for the experiment .
I think that lifestyle is so interesting ... and terrifying .
People are human , and they have human desires and needs – and how do you deal with that ?
I mean , most people deal with it by cheating .
So I think it ’s pretty brave to say to someone : “ You know , I want to sleep with someone else right now . ”
Rare is the indie movie shot for $ 15,000 that earns a major , 1,700 - word article in the Sunday " Breaking Upwards , " having toured the film - festival circuit to acclaim , is opening Friday in a few theaters but will be mostly available by video on demand .
From today 's paper : Read the whole article .
( It 's in the print edition for March 28 , 2010 . )
Here 's a short interview with the leading lady / filmmaker inmagazine .
Excerpts : The prime poly mantra  bitter wisdom from countless people 's schools of hard knocks  is " Communicate , communicate , communicate . "
The couple in the movie , it seems from the trailer , started off with a Do n't Ask Don't Tell agreement , a rulecommunication , which is pretty well guaranteed to end up creating awfulness and drama .
But where would a romantic comedy be without drama ?
Here 's the " Breaking Upwards " site , with trailer notes , links to numerous reviews , etc .

A massive volcanic plume covering most of Europe forced President Obama to cancel a Sunday trip to Poland to attend the funeral of the nation ’s president .
But the last - minute change left an opening in his schedule , so the president headed to the links for a round of golf instead .
On a cool but sun-drenched Sunday , the president and three golfing companions went to Andrews Air Force Base to play 18 holes .
It is the 32nd time Mr. Obama has played golf since taking office Jan. 20 , 2009 , according to CBS Radio ’s Mark Knoller .
After canceling the Poland trip on Saturday , the White House announced that Mr. Obama had no public schedule for Sunday .
He was to have arrived in Krakow in the morning , attend the 2 p.m. funeral and leave for home by 5 p.m. , arriving back at the White House after midnight .
Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his wife , Maria , along with dozens of top Polish government officials were killed April 10 when their airplane went down in heavy fog after clipping a tree on approach to Smolensk , Russia .
Mr. Obama has not gone to the Polish Embassy in Washington since the accident , but Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. both have .
There , they signed a condolence book .
Mr. Obama was not the only world leader to miss the funeral because of the expanding volcanic ash cloud .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel also canceled .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , however , flew by plane from Moscow for the funeral .
Other foreign leaders used different modes of transportation to get there .
Slovenian President Danilo
Turk decided to drive the 500 miles to Krakow .
Romanian President Traian Basescu traveled to northwestern Romania by helicopter and then continue by car through Hungary and Slovakia .
Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip made the 18 - hour drive to the funeral , while Czech Republic President Vaclav Klaus made the trip by car and train .
Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko left Kiev with his wife at 7 a.m. Saturday for the long road trip .
Mr. Obama has played golf far more often than former President George W. Bush .
In his eight years in office , Mr. Bush played just 24 times .
His last time as president was Oct. 13 , 2003 .
He said in 2008 that he gave up golf “ in solidarity ” with the families of soldiers who were dying in Iraq .
“ I do n’t want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf , ” Mr. Bush said in a White House interview Saturday with the Politico .
“ I feel I owe it to the families to be as — to be in solidarity as best as I can with them .
And I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal . ”
He stopped playing after he received word of a deadly attack in Iraq while playing golf during a stay at the family ranch near Crawford , Texas .
“ They pulled me off the golf course , and I said it ’s just not worth it anymore to do , ” Mr. Bush said in the interview .
Since Mr. Obama took office , 397 soldiers have died in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan .
Another 151 have died in Operation Iraqi Freedom .

When we first spied Huawei's SmaKit S7 Android tablet , we were at CeBit and it was ... well , non-functioning .
Now Huawei's officially announced the tablet now , and we have to say that it looks just like every other Android tablet being hoisted upon the world these days , but it 's got some nice features that make it worth a second gander .
The 7 - incher boasts an 800 x 480 pixel resolution , 720 p playback , 3G connectivity , plus a dock with HDMI out , two USB 2.0 ports , and two microSDHC slots .
The tablet , which runs the 1.6 version of the OS , will supposedly be available this summer , though we do n't yet have any information about where it will be available or how much it will cost .
We 'll let you know as soon as we do -- but in the meantime , there 's a video demo after the break .
SENECA --
A couple of small - town business owners have found a way to fight back against antagonists in their communities :
They say they 'll sell out to a white supremacist group hoping to put a national headquarters somewhere in the Northwest .
This week , the owners of the Bearcat Lodge bed and breakfast here offered to sell their place to a group that calls itself the Aryan Nations .
Earlier this month , the operators of the Moby Dick Hotel , Restaurant and Oyster Farm on Washington 's Long Beach Peninsula told officials in their town that they , too , might sell to the group .
More
A factor in both cases appears to be a desire to influence local policymakers and capitalize on the outrage that erupted in February when a representative of the neo -Nazi group showed up in John Day seeking a new headquarters .
Almost 400 Grant County residents turned out to a public meeting to make sure the hate group knew it was n't welcome .
In Washington , Fritzi Cohen , owner of the Moby Dick Hotel , and her hotel manager Keith Stavrum are upset at Pacific County and the state Department of Agriculture for spraying herbicides on shoreline grass near their 6 1/2 acres of oyster beds in Willapa Bay .
Stavrum recently told county officials : " If we are sprayed next to , we are going to sell , " and the hotel could become " the new national headquarters of the Aryan Nations . "
Cohen declined to discuss the hate group Friday , but criticized the county and state for using herbicides .
" There is something really radically wrong in this part of the state ; they are so eager to put more and more chemicals into the bay , " she said .
In Seneca , Carol L. Chaffee and J.W. Everitt , owners of Bearcat Lodge , claim the City Council blocked their proposals to put in a " green " biodiesel plant , build a row of craft shops and engage in motorcycle , four - wheeler and snowmobile sales .
They 'd take $ 1 million from the hate group to sell out and leave town , Chaffee said .
Coeur d'Alene attorney Norman Gissell , who has battled white supremacist groups for 29 years and helped win a landmark 2000 judgment that dismantled Idaho 's original Aryan Nations , was stunned to hear of the offers .
" That is just shocking , " he said .
" I 've never heard of that before .
I 'm 69 years old , and this is a new iteration . "
Seneca is tucked into a timbered corner of Bear Valley , 25 miles south of John Day along U.S. 395 in eastern Oregon .
The Grant County town consists of a store , a K - 12 school with 58 students , a tavern , post office , City Hall , fewer than 100 homes and about 150 residents .
Sometimes referred to as " Oregon 's icebox , " the town is notorious as one of the state 's coldest places , where the temperature plummeted to 54 below zero on Feb. 10 , 1933 .
Chaffee , an attorney , said the couple 's reception in Seneca was chillier than the winter weather and has never thawed .
Townspeople began circulating a story soon after their arrival in 2006 that they were dealing drugs or in the federal witness protection program , both untrue , she said .
The couple ignored the jibes and bought the town 's biggest building , a 40 - room former boarding house constructed in 1939 by the old Edward Hines Lumber Co .
They spent $ 2 million transforming the rundown building into a bed and breakfast for visiting motorcyclists .
Everitt , a professional guitarist , vocalist and songwriter who rides dragster motorcycles for relaxation , installed a $ 200,000 recording studio .
The bed and breakfast has proven successful and is booked through 2012 , but their relationship with the town continues to hit sour notes , they said .
" We are new cat people in an old dog town , " said Everitt , a reference to the couple 's love of cats -- they have four , including a domesticated 30 - pound bobcat named Bob .
" They treat us like we are the worst thing to happen to this town , " Chaffee said of the townsfolk .
" But I do n't think they would be happier to have the Aryan Nations up here . "
Do n't be so sure , replied Seneca Mayor Andrea Officer .
" I guess there are a few people who believe a sane Aryan Nations owner would be easier to deal with than the present owner of the lodge , " she said .
She described Everitt as a hothead and said the couple arrived with " lots of demands " that the City Council could n't meet .
" It really boils down to , if they do n't get their way , they are angry , " she said .
When John Day residents were protesting earlier this year , Seneca residents tied green ribbons on gates and fence posts in solidarity to oppose the hate group , Officer said .
About that time , a rumor began circulating that Bearcat Lodge owners planned to sell to the group , the couple said .
" When we heard the rumors that we were selling out to the Aryan Nations , we laughed , " Chaffee said .
But then , " it got us to thinking .
Why would n't we sell ? "
Gissell suspects all this may be a tempest in a teapot because the hate group is broke .
" We have no indications that they have access to money , " he said .
Efforts to reach the group on Friday were unsuccessful .
Grant County also probably is the last place the group would try to move into , Gissell said .
" There is a thoroughly aroused public there , " he said .

News Corp boss hails iPad as potential saviour of newspapers , but says industry must stand up for itself and charge for content
Rupert Murdoch has launched a spirited defence of putting up paywalls around his newspaper websites , while embracing the game - changing potential of Apple 's iPad .
The News Corp chairman hailed the new device as a possible saviour of the newspaper industry .
Murdoch renewed his attacks on search engines , such as Google , whom he accused of stealing journalism from traditional media outlets .
He told a National Press Club event at George Washington University that the newspaper industry had to stand up for itself and charge for content while using copyright law to defend its journalism from being used without permission .
" We are going to stop people like Google or Microsoft or whoever from taking stories for nothing … there is a law of copyright and they recognise it , " Murdoch told a packed audience of students , journalists and other media professionals .
He said search engines had tapped into a " river of gold " by aggregating content but that the days of free news had to come to an end .
" They take [ news content ] for nothing .
They have got this very clever business model , " he said .
In June , Murdoch 's British titles the Times and Sunday Times will join joining his business title , the Wall Street Journal , behind a paywall .
However , some critics say consumers are now too used to getting online news for free and will not pay subscriptions in big enough numbers to form a viable business model for quality journalism .
Murdoch dismissed this fear , saying consumers could be forced to change their habits .
" When they have got nowhere else to go they will start paying .
If it is reasonable .
No one is going to ask for a lot of money , " he said .
Murdoch also fired a shot at the New York Times – a bête noire of Murdoch's and the Journal 's main rival – by saying its paywall plans were halfhearted and needed to be more restrictive .
" They do n't seem to be able to make up their mind .
They will have opposition internally from some of their journalists , especially their columnists , " he said .
" To really make it work they have got to put a paywall up .
I think most newspapers in [ the US ] have got to have a paywall . "
Advocates of free newspaper websites often accuse Murdoch of being a technophobe , but the Australian media mogul was happy to embrace the iPad , launched last Saturday .
During the interview , with journalist Marvin Kalb , he picked up an iPad to demonstrate how to navigate the Journal 's website .
He said the iPad could be the saviour of newspaper journalism , albeit in electronic form , not print .
" I got a glimpse of the future last weekend with the Apple iPad .
It is a wonderful thing , " he said .
" If you have less newspapers and more of these … it may well be the saving of the newspaper industry . "
Murdoch was challenged in the interview – and by many in the audience – over the conservative bias of his Fox News cable television channel .
The audience tittered when Murdoch said he thought the channel 's news coverage had no political bias .
" We have both sides .
We have Democrats and Republicans , libertarians and whatever , " he said .
Asked to name a single Democrat - leaning Fox commentator – alongside such conservative names as Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly – he struggled openly to remember one .
" I wish I could tell you a couple of names .
But they are certainly there , " he said .
He eventually settled on the Fox host Greta van Susteren , whom he said was " close " to the Democratic party .
One analysis suggests gusher is 70,000 barrels daily , or an Exxon Valdez every four days , and 12 times more powerful than estimates by Coast Guard or BP
Marine scientists were carefully viewing footage of oil and gas billowing out of a ruptured well on the ocean floor today , to try to deliver the first reliable estimates of the crude gushing into the Gulf of Mexico – it could be as much as 70,000 barrels a day .
The video could help resolve the increasingly contentious debate about the scale of the disaster , and the oil companies ' willingness to give access to any information .
BP has claimed repeatedly there is no way of measuring the scale of the leak .
The US Coast Guard , meanwhile , has stuck to an early estimate of 5,000 barrels a day .
Independent marine researchers have suggested the spill could be much larger .
National Public Radio in the United States last night reported that the well is spewing up to 70,000 barrels of oil a day , or 2.9 m US gallons – the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez disaster every four days .
Nearly 11 m gallons of oil were spilled in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground , oiling beaches and poisoning marine life for generations .
NPR said scientific analysis of newly released video footage from the ocean floor suggested the gusher was 12 times more powerful than estimates offered so far by the Coast Guard or BP .
Its analysis was conducted by Steve Werely , an associate professor at Purdue University , using a technique called particle image velocimetry , a method was accurate to 20 % .
That puts the range of the oil spill from 56,000 to 84,000 barrels a day .
Werely told The Guardian he based his estimate on techniques which track the speed of objects travelling in the flow stream .
" You can see in the video lots of swirls and vortices pumping out of the end of the pipe , and I used a computer code to track those swirls and come up with the speed at which the oils is shooting out of the pipe , " he said .
" From there it is a very simple calculation to figure out what is the volume flow . "
He said he had use the method for 15 years , and elsewhere it had been in use for 25 years .
Scientists had spent the day scouring the video footage of the gushing pipe on the ocean floor to try to arrive at estimates .
Eugene Chiang , an associate professor at the University of California Berkeley who teaches a course on measurement , said he had been copied on an email which set it as a science challenge for academics .
" It was just like estimating the number of jelly beans in a can , it had that kind of a feeling – but of course with much more serious consequences , " he told the Guardian .
Chiang said he used relatively " back of the envelope " calculations to put an estimated rate for the spill at 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day .
Chiang studied the angle of the flow of oil and gas from the leaking pipe , and made calculations about buoyancy and gravitational acceleration .
" I estimated that it was moving 100 cm per second going up as a very rough estimate , so then all I needed to know was the area of the pipe . "
His guess turned out to be very close to the measurements released by BP .
" This was just based on back - of - the - envelope scribbling and looking at the vide ; but even within that range you can already infer that this is a huge disaster exceeding the magnitude of the Exxon Valdez spill by quite a large margin , " he said .
" The calculation is uncertain , but I am confident enough to say that this is one of the big ones .
It is not 5,000 barrels a day .
That much I can say . "
However , these estimates made no impact on BP .
" We have said from the begining there is no way to estimate the flow coming out of the pipe . " said Mark Proegler , a spokesman for BP .
" Our estimate was provided by the coast guard and Noaa ( the ocean and atmospheric agency ) and it is based on satellite imagery , overflight observations , and on water observations . "
The size of the spill has long been contested territory .
In the initial 48 hours after the rig went down , the Coast Guard offered repeated assurances there was no evidence of a leak from the crumpled pipe on the ocean floor .
The Coast Guard later admitted its initial assurances were based on data from BP 's robot submersibles .
The Coast Guard then suggested the ruptured well was leaking at 1,000 barrels a day before revising upwards to 5,000 barrels a day .
But marine scientists have been warning of a much more extensive spill , and have been demanding BP release data gathered from its remote operating vehicles , such as the video footage released on Wednesday .
BP officials last week laid out a worst case scenario of 60,000 barrels a day when they were in a closed - door briefing with members of Congress in Washington DC .
But the release of the first video from BP 's submersible cameras – under growing pressure from scientists and news organisations – could help scientists arrive at independent estimates .
Timothy Crone , at the Lamont - Doherty earth observatory , part of Columbia University in New York , a scientist who has spent years studying natural jets on the ocean floor , said that he would be able to produce an independent estimate of the leak by analysing the video and information from BP on the diameter of the leaking pipe .
" If they took about 20 or 30 seconds of video with a very specific purpose of measuring flow rates , which means having the ROV [ remotely operated vehicle ] stay completely still or parked on the bottom , and you got video of the plume close to the leak , and if it was illuminated and with high resolution , then you could get pretty good estimates of the flow rates , " Crone said .
The scientists say access to the video from BP 's ocean - floor vehicles could become even more crucial in the next few days for gauging the success of various devices to clog the leak .
BP engineers today began the slow process of trying to fit a smaller tube inside the crumpled riser pipe on the ocean floor to try to siphon oil to the surface .
Officials said it could take 12 hours to insert the tube into the pipe without running into debris .
Engineers are also considering a smaller version of a failed containment box .
The original device was abandoned because it trapped hydrate crystals which could clog the pipe .
" One of the really critical things is , if you do n't know the flow , it is awfully hard to design the thing that is going to work , " said Norman Guinasso , director of the geochemical and environmental research group at Texas A&M University .
" This has been going on for weeks and we are just assuming the flow rate is the same . "
The Deepwater Horizon Unified Command ( set up by the Marine Board of Investigation to report on the explosion on 20 April which caused the leak ) posted the first clip on Wednesday .
It said the oil and gas were flowing from the larger of the two known leaks on the riser .
" This leak is located approximately 460 ft ( 140 metres ) from the top of the blowout preventer and rests on the sea floor at a depth of about 5,000ft . "
Initial investigations by Congress and government agencies in Louisiana have pointed to a series of equipment failures on the rig , and a culture of lax regulatory oversight of the offshore drilling industry .
Deepwater Horizon has heightened sensitivities for offshore drilling world - wide .
Off Venezuela , an offshore natural gas platform leased to the national oil company sank early today , and within hours Hugo Chávez , the president , was on Twitter offering reassurances that all 95 crew were safe and that there was no risk to the environment .
Officials said that a tube connecting the rig to the gas field was disconnected and the safety valve sealed .
• This article was amended on 14 and 21 May 2010 .
The original referred to the Coast Guard 's assessment of leakage at 1,000 gallons a day before revising estimates to 5,000 gallons a day .
It also qualified the Exxon Valdez oil - tanker spill as 11 m barrels of oil .
This has been corrected .
Mrs Clinton accused Iran to trying to deflect pressure on the nuclear issue Plans for a fourth set of UN sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme are being circulated among all 15 members of the Security Council .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the five veto - wielding members had agreed on a " strong " draft resolution .
The measures foresee cargo ship inspections and new banking controls .
They come despite a recent deal in which Iran agreed to send low - enriched uranium to Turkey in return for enriched fuel for a research reactor .
But Mrs Clinton suggested Iran had been trying to deflect pressure .
ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC Tehran correspondent
This is Washington 's answer to what was widely seen as a last - minute attempt by Iran to head off new sanctions .
Indeed , in slightly triumphant tone , Hillary Clinton said it was as convincing an answer as it was possible to provide .
It appears that the two more sceptical big powers , Russia and China , have not been convinced by Iran 's agreement to ship out a large part of its stocks of enriched uranium to Turkey .
Iran hit by new sanctions threat For US officials the core issue was that Iran intended to continue enriching uranium , which the UN has banned , the BBC's Barbara Plett reports from New York The Turkish deal , which Brazil helped to negotiate on Monday , was similar to one proposed by the West and its allies last year .
The members of the Security Council , which includes Turkey and Brazil , were holding a session behind closed doors on the resolution , but Brazil reportedly said it would not discuss the draft " at this point " .
The US is quite confident of getting a majority of Council members behind the resolution although it may not get unanimity , our correspondent says .
The vote is expected in June .
The sanctions , she adds , are not as strong as Western states would have wanted and some proposals were watered down by Russia and China .
China 's UN Ambassador Li Baodong said on Tuesday that " the purpose of sanctions is to bring the Iranian said to the negotiating table " .
" The sanctions are not for punishing innocent and should not harm normal trade , " he added .
Russia 's UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin described the draft resolution as " well balanced " .
" That 's why we agreed to accept the text on the whole after the long discussions and corrections of the initial proposals and we find it to be an appropriate one , " Mr Churkin was quoted as saying by Russia 's Itar - Tass news agency .
There have been three rounds of UN sanctions against Iran , blocking trade of " sensitive nuclear material " , freezing the financial assets of those involved in Iran 's nuclear activities , banning all of Iran 's arms exports and encouraging scrutiny of the dealings of Iranian banks .
The US and its Western allies fear that Iran is secretly trying to build a nuclear bomb .
Tehran says its programme is aimed solely at peaceful energy use .
' New situation ' Proposals in the 10 - page resolution include : • A comprehensive new framework for cargo ship inspections both in ports and on the high seas if there is reason to suspect a ship is carrying conventional arms or nuclear missile items •
A ban on countries selling tanks , armoured combat vehicles , warplanes , warships and other heavy weapons to Iran • A ban on the opening of new branches , subsidiaries or representative offices of Iranian banks if there are grounds for believing that they are linked to nuclear proliferation •
Greater vigilance over transactions involving Iranian banks in order to prevent such transactions contributing to proliferation of sensitive nuclear activities •
The placing of more members of the Revolutionary Guards on a list to have their assets frozen Brazil 's UN envoy said his country was not " engaging in any discussion on a draft at this point because we feel that there is a new situation " .
" There was an agreement yesterday which is a very important one , " Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti was quoted as telling reporters on the sidelines of the Security Council meeting .
Earlier , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the world to support Monday 's deal with Iran .
But he added that if Iran did not ship out the uranium within one month , as agreed , then it would be on its own .
' Strong draft '
Mrs Clinton addressed the US Senate foreign relations committee after talks between the five permanent Security Council members - the US , UK , Russia , China and France - and Germany .
" We have reached agreement on a strong draft with the co-operation of Russia and China , " she said .
Mrs Clinton said she had spent Tuesday morning on the phone with her Russian counterpart , Sergei Lavrov , " finalising the resolution " .
Russia and China have previously resisted calls for a new round of sanctions .
Talking about the Turkish deal , Mrs Clinton accused Tehran of trying to deflect pressure from the major powers .
" We do n't believe it was any accident that Iran agreed to this declaration as we were preparing to move forward in New York , " she said .
" The fact that we had Russia on board , we had China on board and that we were moving early this week , namely today , to share the text of that resolution , put pressure on Iran which they were trying to somehow dissipate . "

Image caption RBS had to be nationalised in two stages in 2008 and 2009
A former senior executive at the bank RBS has been forced to agree he will not take any senior or full - time work in the financial services industry .
The agreement between Johnny Cameron and the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) comes after an investigation into the management of the bank .
He was chairman of its investment banking business at the time RBS had to be rescued by the UK taxpayer in 2008 .
The regulator said he did not meet the required standards for a senior banker .
Mr Cameron said : " Given the losses sustained by RBS in 2008 , as a director of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group , I recognise that it is appropriate that I take my share of responsibility , and I will not be seeking another managerial role in the financial services industry . "
Legal settlement
Mr Cameron left RBS in January 2009 after seven years in the job and his conduct has been under investigation by the FSA since April that year .
The FSA questions his competence to run a bank , but does n't think he broke any of its rules .
Robert Peston , BBC business editor Read Robert Peston 's blog
The regulator said it had been looking at the " systems and controls " at the investment banking arm of RBS .
It refused to say exactly what it thought Mr Cameron had done wrong .
However , the FSA made it clear that its punishment could have been more severe .
" Were it not for this undertaking , it was the FSA 's intention to take steps to seek to prohibit Cameron from performing any significant influence function or any function held in full time employment in relation to any regulated activity carried on by any authorised person , exempt person or exempt professional firm , " the FSA said .
" On the basis of the information available to it , the FSA believes that Cameron would not meet its current standards for approval for a significant influence function , " it added .
However Mr Cameron can still undertake part - time consultancy so long as it does not require FSA approval .
The FSA said it had not found any examples of the former RBS man breaching any regulations or making any admissions .
" The FSA questions his competence to run a bank , but does n't think he broke any of its rules , " said the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston .
" What that implies is that it 's quite possible to be on the bridge of one the world 's great banks , which is part of the UK 's economic infrastructure , while it ploughs into a humungous iceberg , while following the FSA 's rulebook and the law , " he added .
Northern Rock
Mr Cameron is the most senior figure in UK banking be punished for his role in the management of a bank that had to be bailed out by the government at the height of the UK banking crisis .
To stop it going bust , RBS had to be nationalised in two stages , with the taxpayer taking stakes in the bank first in October 2008 and then in January 2009 at a cost of £ 46bn .
The then chancellor Alistair Darling said if the government had not taken this action then the bank would have been forced to close down .
Last month , two former directors of Northern Rock , whose collapse in 2007 precipitated the banking crisis , were fined by the FSA and banned from working in the financial services industry again .
The former deputy chief executive David Baker was fined £ 504,000 for misreporting mortgage arrears data .
The former credit director Richard Barclay was fined £ 140,000 for also failing to ensure the accuracy of the bank 's financial information .

Readers Question :
Is “ national debt ” interchangeable with the term with “ foreign debt ” ?
National Debt represents the total amount the government owe the private sector .
National debt builds up because the government spend more than they receive in tax .
Foreign or External debt represents the amount a country ( both public and private sector ) owe to other countries .
So they are different things .
The UK measure of National debt is termed the public sector borrowing requirement .
Some of the National debt is financed by selling bonds to oversees investors .
But , most of the UK National debt is bought by domestic financial institutions .
on June 2009 , UK public sector debt stood at £ 798.8 billion ( or 56.6 % of GDP ) – UK National Debt
What is the UK External Debt ?
According to National Statistics the UK External Debt – Gross is £ 6,290 bn ( this is roughly 430 % of GDP ) ( of which only £ 26bn is owed by General government ) .
The biggest balance is the banking sector which owes nearly £ 4,000 bn .
These banking liabilities should be cancelled out by an equal amount of foreign assets .
See : UK external liabilities and external assets
Though if these assets deteriorated , the UK ’s position would definitely worsen .
But , they are n’t quite as shocking as they might first appear .

LED traffic light in Forest Hill , New South Wales .
Image credit : Wikipedia .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- IBM has filed a patent application for a traffic light system that can remotely stop and start the engines of vehicles , with the aim of increasing fuel consumption efficiency at busy intersections .
The system would be able to receive position information from vehicles waiting at red lights to determine a queue of participating vehicles stopped at the signal .
It would then determine the time still to elapse before the lights turn green , and if this time is over a set threshold ( such as two minutes ) the traffic light would then send signals to the vehicle engines to stop them .
When the lights turn green , a “ start - engine notification ” would be sent to the front vehicle to start its engine first , and a signal would be sent to the second vehicle in the queue an “ optimal time ” later , and so on .
The IBM patent says the system could be applied to traffic signals at intersections , railway crossings , or other transportation signals for “ indicating correct moments to stop and to proceed . ”
Its stated aims are to reduce wastage of fuel and optimize the movement of vehicles through the intersection or crossing .
The patent states that with “ increasing vehicle usage there may be more traffic and longer wait times at traffic signals , ” resulting in wasted fuel if the vehicle engines are kept running .
It acknowledges that most drivers do not turn off their vehicles ’ engines in such situations , and that more fuel may be used in restarting the engine than in keeping it running if it is stopped for too short a time .
The system would therefore take into account the time remaining before the signal changes to determine if the vehicle ’s engine should be stopped .
The proposed traffic light system would gather data from traffic signal clocks , GPS data on vehicle positions , traffic load information ( perhaps from weight sensors in the road ) , cameras , and / or “ other data obtainable from sensors embedded at the intersections . ”
The communications system may use Wi-Fi technologies , a cellular network , or satellite communications .
In one proposed model the method would be made available as a “ service ” that vehicle drivers would need to sign up for .
The stop / start - engine notifications could switch the engine off and on automatically , or they could trigger alerts to the driver to turn it off / on manually .
The idea is at the patent application stage , and the patent only covers the method but not the communications technology .
Many patent applications never proceed any further , and only time will tell if this will be one of them .

Updated The Tories , in their enthusiasm for all things Web2.0rhea , launched an ill - conceived Facebook Connect campaign over the weekend that they hoped would encourage people to gripe about Labour 's ties to the Unite union .
As is the norm in these , er , web - enlightened days , the Conservative Party hoped to turn " #cashgordon " into a " trending " topic on Twitter .
Well their wish appears to have come true , but perhaps not in the way the Tories had planned it because many people were injecting some JavaScript code into their tweets , which meant the site was for a time being redirected to the Labour Party , porn sites and even Rick Astley singing on YouTube .
The Tories recently launched their own tech manifesto , in which the David Cameron - led party proclaimed it would embrace the interwebs , do some stuff with open source software and even get heavily involved in crowd sourcing just to show how down - wid - da - kids they really are .
But , at time of writing , the cash - gordon.com site was out of action and redirecting to the Tories ' main homepage , all because – in their rush to attack the opposition online – the Conservative Party forgot one fundamental rule of good Web2.0rhea PR : do n't get hacked , stoopid !
Earlier today , the Tories gloated about their Cash Gordon campaign , even though at that point it only had about 600 supporters .
The party could n't resist posting a self - congratulatory missive on its website this morning in which the " Conservative blogger , turned speechwriter , turned online campaigning guy " Samuel Coates bigged up the campaign :
" Having a Facebook page and updating it regularly is the bread and butter of what political groups and representatives can do , but there ’s also room to think outside of the box .
" There ’s also the Facebook Connect feature , for example , that enables users to log in to third party websites using their Facebook account .
There have been some fun and practical uses of it so far , though few in the political realm , " he said .
Coates went on to claim that the Cash Gordon campaign was " one of the most innovative uses of the [ Facebook Connect ] tool yet seen in the UK . "
In the same post he urged people to " spread the word " to raise awareness online about Charlie Whelan 's influence over Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the Labour Party .
" Unlike face - to - face traditional campaigning , a lot of online advocacy is hard to measure and often goes unrecognised - action points provide a way of both measuring and incentivising those efforts , " he noted .
" In the brave new world of online politics it ’s importantly [ sic ] to keep innovating this way .
If you have any ideas on how else we could be using the internet , please let us know in the comment thread . "
Well , the interwebs has spoken , Coates .
But perhaps not in the way the Tories had anticipated .
The Register asked the Conservative Party to comment on this story , but no one had got back to us with a response at time of publication .
Tory flacks have been uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter too .
Funny that . ®
Update
The Tories gave us this statement , however the Cash Gordon site is still redirecting to the party 's " Blue Blog " .
“ There was an attempt made to redirect # CashGordon users to other websites .
We ’ve made the necessary adjustments to the site and the # CashGordon campaign has now led to many thousands [ sic ] people hearing about Unite ’s funding stranglehold over the Labour Party , ” said a Conservative spokesman .
Enlarge Virginia Department of Corrections via AP Rastafarian inmate Kendall Ray Gibson at the Brunswick Correctional Center in Lawrenceville , Va. Gibson has spent more than 10 years in segregation because of his hair .
Join the conversation : Religion , spirituality & ethics | Reader forum : Your beliefs COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER JARRATT , Va.  Kendall Gibson would seem to be one of Virginia 's most dangerous prisoners .
For more than 10 years he has lived in segregation at the Greensville Correctional Center , spending at least 23 hours every day in a cell the size of a gas station bathroom .
In a temporary home for the worst of the worst inmates too violent or disruptive to live among the rest of society 's outcasts he has been a permanent fixture .
He is there , he says , not for his crimes but for a crime he will not commit a crime against God .
The only thing imposing about Gibson is his long black dreadlocks , resting on the front of his shoulders so they wo n't drag the ground as he shuffles along in his orange jumpsuit .
It is his hair winding locks he considers a measure of his Rastafarian faith that makes him a threat , according to Virginia Department of Corrections Operating Procedure No. 864.1 .
The rule took effect on Dec. 15 , 1999 .
Inmates had two choices : cut their hair no longer than their collars and shave their beards , or be placed in administrative segregation .
In the beginning , Gibson was among as many as 40 inmates who opted for confinement over cutting .
By 2003 , when a handful of the inmates filed a federal lawsuit against the department over their detention , 23 remained in segregation .
The lawsuit failed .
Some cracked under the pressure of constant isolation with no visits from loved ones , educational or religious programs or commissary .
Some went home .
Today , it 's difficult to tell exactly how many remain in isolation .
The Department of Corrections wo n't volunteer the information , but has confirmed 10 names given to The Associated Press by a group of Rastafarian inmates .
Not everyone can handle it , Gibson says .
For those weak in mind or spirit , the walls can easily close in on them .
" People always ask how I can smile in a place so negative , " he says .
The Rastafarian God , Jah , " is my answer .
Without Jah in my life I would n't be able to handle it . "
Lifestyle , movement or religion ?
Like most of the Rastafarians in segregation , Gibson did n't become a believer until after he entered prison .
He was 18 and had a long time to do , sentenced to 47 years on robbery , abduction and gun charges .
Gibson had always loved the " peaceful vibes of Rastafari livity , " but like many he knew the movement by the hair , the music and the ganja .
In prison , he met others who taught him the spiritual aspects .
He took on the name Ras - Talawa Tafari , a strong leader who inspires awe .
MARIJUANA : Rasta smoker wins case on religious grounds in Italy Rastafari draws from the Bible , mixing in African and Caribbean cultural influences .
It is considered by many more of a way of life or movement than a religion .
They preach unity with god , nature and each other , but are loosely organized and followers are free to worship with other congregations .
Rastafarians regard Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I , who was known as Ras Tafari before he rose to power in 1930 , as the second coming of Christ .
They believe Jah inhabits them so there is no real need for a church .
They smoke marijuana as a sacrament and adhere to a vegetarian diet .
While some view growing their hair as optional , most Rastafarians see it as demanded by the Nazarite Vow in the Bible ( Numbers 6:5 ) , " There shall no razor come upon his head . "
Gibson never entertained the thought of cutting his hair when the policy was announced or during the 10 long years since .
" Jah did n't lead I to feel that this plight was burden enough to bow , " he says .
A person must be willing to stand up and fight for a worthy cause , he says , echoing Rastafarian messenger Bob Marley 's rhythmic chant " Get up .
Stand up .
Stand up for your rights . "
Gibson longs to hear such reggae music .
A clear analog radio that picks up about nine stations is his only luxury in his small cell , but the island music does n't get much air time in these parts .
His days are long but compact .
Five days a week , he is led in restraints to an outside cage that resembles a dog kennel for an hour of recreation .
Otherwise , he only leaves his 8 - by - 10 cell for three , 20 - minute showers each week .
His cinderblock walls are off - white or gray , depending on the way the light hits them .
The cell is freshly painted , drowning out the smell of his Dove soap resting on his one - piece sink - toilet unit .
If he stands on top of his mounted stainless steel bed Gibson can peak out the window , where he can see inmates in the general population recreation yard in the distance .
He prefers to stare into the woods just beyond the razor - wife fence .
On occasion he spies a deer grazing in the field .
The segregation unit has 16 cells , and although the inmates can't see each other they often talk .
Gibson is amazed at what he calls their pure confusion and senseless babbling obsession with the lives of movie stars and rappers and sports figures .
And then there are the other Rastafarians .
" These people may have my physical body confined , but I refuse to surrender my mind and spirit , " says Allen McRae , also known as Ras-Solomon Tafari , who is serving 20 years for cocaine possession .
Elton Williams , who is behind bars for armed robbery , gets the question all the time from inmates pulling stints in segregation .
Would n't it be easier just to cut his hair ?
His answer : " My very soul depends on the decisions I make . "
Williams , 31 , likens it to a Christian who is told that , for security reasons , he must denounce Christ .
Williams is set to leave prison in December ; he could cut his hair until then , he says , but what would happen to his soul ?
Then there was Ivan Sparks , a 59 - year - old Rastafarian elder who refused to cut his hair and was sent into segregation at Buckingham Correctional Center .
He never left it except to die at Virginian Commonwealth University Medical Center last fall , of prostate cancer .
The no hair policy
The way Department of Corrections officials see it , the inmates could come out of segregation any time they wish .
They made a choice to go to segregation instead of cutting their hair , spokesman Larry Traylor says .
Should they decide to comply with the grooming policy , they could return to general population .
" Rules must be in place in order to have a secure , safe environment for everyone , " Traylor said .
" An inmate that will not follow the rules jeopardizes normal prison operations and is potentially a danger to other inmates and staff . "
Virginia is among only about a dozen states , mostly in the South , that limit the length of inmates ' hair and beards , according to the American Correctional Chaplains Association .
A handful of those allow religious accommodations for Rastafarians , Muslims , Sikhs , native Americans and others whose religious beliefs prohibit shaving or cutting their hair .
There is no hair policy for federal prisoners .
The U.S. Supreme Court has said that constitutional protections , like the right to practice religion , do not end at the prison gates .
Congress has said institutions can restrict religious liberties only for compelling reasons , like security , but the policies must be the least restrictive means to accomplish that .
Still , inmates have rarely been successful in challenging prison grooming policies .
A native American inmate spent a year in his cell and lost other privileges before a federal appeals court ruled in 2005 that the California prison system 's ban on long hair violated his religious freedom .
In a 2002 case , a group of Rastafarian and Muslim federal inmates who were housed in Virginia prisons challenged the grooming policy and a federal court ordered the Bureau of Prisons to transfer them to other facilities that did not have such policies .
The court also required the federal prison system to evaluate inmates ' religious beliefs and refrain from sending them to Virginia or other states with burdensome grooming policies .
But in the case filed by the Virginia state prisoners , a federal appeals court ruled in 2008 that the Department of Corrections ' argument that inmates could hide weapons and other contraband in long hair or easily change their appearance upon escape was compelling enough reason to require trimmed hair .
Kent Willis , executive director of the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union , which represented the inmates , said the outcome was deeply disappointing because he knew the sincerest believers would be those who would be punished most severely .
" This has a disturbingly mean - spirited aspect to it , " Willis says .
" This is not about corrections .
This is not about security , but it 's about punishment .
In this instance , people are being punished for their religious beliefs . "
Today , the department cuts each inmate 's hair when he enters prison .
If he refuses , the use of " reasonable force and restraints " is authorized .
If the inmate grows his hair back and refuses to cut it , he is sent to segregation .
Thomas Fitzgerald , 52 , had grown his locks for 10 years before he was sent to prison for possession of a firearm by a felon .
He said he started going bald after his hair was unceremoniously shorn from his head , and he 's convinced that there 's a connection .
The last time he saw his locks they were being stuffed into a red biohazard plastic bag .
He asked to send them home for a proper burial ; his request was denied .
Fitzgerald has chosen to abide by the grooming policy so that he can work toward growing the Rastafarian community inside the prison and when he is released in three years .
But it is hard to shake the humiliation : " Every day is a real struggle for me because I perceive shaving my face a serious act of mutilation to myself , " he says .
' Irie '
With his prison - issue eyeglasses , scrawny frame and boyish smile , Gibson looks much less of a menace than the prisoners stacking lunch trays just outside the glass - walled visitation room .
Even less intimidating are his words — talk of love , faith , " upful vibrations " and , most perplexing of all , happiness .
Now 38 , he 's proud of the things he 's accomplished while behind bars .
Gibson quit school at 15 , but once in prison he completed vocational training in building maintenance and carpentry and in 1994 got his GED , something he said gave him an " irie , " or peaceful and happy , feeling .
Gibson 's five co-defendants are out of prison now .
He has been denied parole 12 times for the same reason — the serious nature of his crime — but he believes his refusal to bow to the grooming policy likely played a role in that .
" Life is what we make of it , " he says .
" Jah give each person the fullness of free will to create our own personal heaven or hell and joy or pain . "
He tries " to create good irie vibes of joy and not of pain . "
He has bad days , but he tries not to brood , even though he remains in isolation , year after year , as those who murder , rape and maim other inmates are rotated in and out .
He has now been in isolation nearly 4,000 days .
He begins each one with prayer , reading scripture and meditation .
At night , when the lights are out , he listens to rodents scampering through the ducts .
Sometimes they run across his cell floor and he cringes .
When it 's quiet he can hear a train chugging by and he allows his mind to wonder briefly what is on it , and where 's it 's going .

I can't remember when I last touched or even saw a floppy disk .
Do you ?
Can we in truth say we knew the floppy disk was still alive that we might mourn its death now ?
The floppy disk had become an old pair of shoes , their soles and laces so worn out as to be useless , but with enough memories invested in them that throwing them out would give us pause .
I remember when floppy disks were actually floppy .
I 'm not quite old enough to recall the eight - inch ones , but oh , yes , I remember the five - and - a - quarter inch ones very well .
My family 's first computer , bought when I was all of nine ( I think ) had two such floppy drives but no hard drive at all .
I well recall the protective paper sleeves , the care not to bend the disk as you put it in the drive , the notch on the side that you had to cover with tape if you wanted to write protect the disk , having to pull a plastic switch to close the drive .
I remember the pride I felt labeling a disk with the first Turbo Pascal programs I ever wrote .
Of course , I had to write out the label before putting it on the disk so I would n't damage the fragile plastic sheath .
And I tied an onion to my belt , which was the style at the time .
Yeah , floppies were pretty much a pain in the butt , were n't they ?
Transporting them was always a pain because once you bent one even a little too far your odds of being able to use it again were slim to none .
I remember the first Infocom game I got that required more than one disk , so partway through I had to swap them .
I remember trying to — very carefully ! — cut a notch into a distribution disk so I could reuse it .
I remember my elementary school 's Atari 800s , whose floppy drives always sounded like they were grinding the disk into powder .
And then the three - and - a - half inch disks took over , and there was much rejoicing ( yay ! ) .
Smaller , more durable , and with much greater capacity — the older , bigger , floppier ones did n't stand a chance .
By the time I was in high school anyone who had n't grown up with computers had no idea what a 5 ¼ drive was for : I recall at least two times when a student in one of the school computer labs put a CD in a 5 ¼ drive and , in trying to close the drive , broke the CD into pieces inside it .
Still , the memory of 3 ½ disks that sticks with me the most is having to install Microsoft Office on my work PC off of them .
Thirty - two of them .
Thirty - two of them that I had to sit there and swap , back and forth , making sure to keep them organized .
For about two hours , that felt more like six .
And I had to walk uphill both ways in the snow to get to work , too .
So , do you feel like showing your age , too ?
What are your floppy memories ?
When do you think enough people will be confused by the little 3 ½ - inch disk icon that 's so often used for " save " functions that it 'll have to be changed ?
And is it strange to have nostalgia for something you would never actually want to use again ?
Four Lions takes real Nerve to poke fun at terrorists , sheer idiots or not , especially when their intended target is a place like London , where terror has reared its head so often and did so to devastating effect less than five years ago .

Canadian members of Parliament should not be afraid to have their expenses audited , if it 's true that the rules and regulations in place are as good as the MPs say they are , says Auditor General Sheila Fraser .
" Well , I do n't think MPs have anything to fear .
They 've certainly indicated that they have strong systems and practices in place .
If that 's the case , I would be very happy to report that . "
Fraser said the public and some MPs have clearly " misunderstood " what her intentions were when she asked to do a performance audit of the administration of the House of Commons .
Fraser said a performance audit is not as detailed as a forensic audit .
While she could discover inappropriate spending — as happened in Britain with members of Parliament — the performance audit she is recommending is more focused on looking at what spending rules are in place and if they are being followed .
" I 've heard people talking about a $ 4 cup of coffee .
I 've got , quite frankly , better things to do than look for $ 4 cups of coffee , " Fraser said .
She said she would welcome the chance to clarify her position at the Board of Internal Economy , which initially turned down her audit request .
Speaker Peter Milliken , who chairs the board , said it 's not up to him whether or not Fraser gets that chance ; he says it 's up to the board as a whole .
When asked if he understands that the public is looking for accountability , Milliken said : " All Canadians have that interest .
It 's not a matter of what you 're hiding .
It 's a matter of what the auditor general 's report is going to reveal .
It may reveal nothing .
It may say everything is fine . "
Milliken was also asked why he believes the auditor general does not have the authority to do such an audit when previous auditors general have done them .
Milliken said those auditors general were invited to do the audits .
He repeated that it is not up to him to invite Fraser to do an audit .
Parties sound more open to talks
Meanwhile all the parties — after hearing from constituents in their ridings over this past break week — have now indicated they are willing to have further discussions with Fraser about what she would like to look at .
Liberal MP Marcel Proulx , who is one of two designated spokespeople for the Board of Internal Economy , said the invitation for Fraser to come back and speak to the board was already made in the letter it sent to her declining the audit request .
But it is not clear when or if Fraser will appear before the board .
Fraser said it 's clear Canadians want " accountability for their monies spent . "
" I do n't think anyone likes to be audited , but it is an important part of our accountability and governance framework .
It has been a very long time since an audit has been done of the House , I mean close to 20 years , and that is why we suggested it , " Fraser said , adding that she already audits all departments and agencies on a regular basis .
Is Nick Clegg the British Barack Obama ?
Photomontage : Steve Caplin
For Barack Obama , the crucial moment came one cold night in January 2008 , when the one - term senator 's unexpectedly decisive triumph in the Iowa caucuses set him on the path to an epoch - making victory .
For Nick Clegg , it happened last week , when he stepped back from his debate podium to address a retired toxicologist from Cheshire .
Obama promised to transcend America 's troubled racial past and the culture wars of the 1960s .
Clegg promises to make the drivers of night buses let you get off between stops , and to refund VAT to mountain rescue services .
( Oh , and cut taxes on low earners , break up the banks , and scrap the Trident replacement . )
From Yeovil to Cornwall , from northern Bristol to certain areas of Surrey , there is a frisson , a whisper of possibility : Yes , we can .
Well , maybe .
And probably not , actually , because of the first - past - the - post voting system .
And yet you can feel it in the air : the fierce urgency of Nick ; the audacity of Clegg .
It was always inevitable that Obama would cast a long shadow over this election , inspiring activists across the spectrum to exploit internet campaigning , small - scale fundraising , and the intoxicating promise of unity and change .
But it was the perpetually tieless David Cameron , we had assumed , who would seek most directly , if also most cringe - inducingly , to appropriate the president 's mantle .
We were wrong .
Consider the Obama - Clegg parallels .
Obama 's sensibility developed during a childhood dominated by the absence of his father and his struggles to fit into communities in Hawaii and Indonesia ; Clegg 's outlook was forged in the crucible of his hardscrabble origins in Chalfont St Giles , Buckinghamshire , his education at Westminster School in London , and his degree in archaeology and anthropology at Robinson College , Cambridge .
Obama had " Yes , we can " .
Clegg has " I agree with Nick " .
Obama , as a youth , flirted with hard drugs .
Clegg set fire to a cactus .
These parallels are n't perfect , of course .
They may even strike some readers as absurd .
But what Clegg 's rightwing and leftwing critics miss , as do predictably sarcastic journalists , is that this is precisely the point .
To say that Nick Clegg is the British Barack Obama is not to suggest that he is an exact duplicate of the original , American Obama , transplanted to our shores .
He 's a British version .
The US likes its heroes to be inspiring underdogs who battle vast forces to realise their dreams .
We like ours to be not - particularly - inspiring underdogs who never do quite realise their dreams – think Eddie " The Eagle " Edwards , or Mallory on Everest , or the Beagle 2 Mars probe .
Thanks to various unfortunate psephological realities , Nick Clegg almost certainly wo n't realise his dreams either .
Just like Obama , Clegg even has his own squadron of loopy conspiracy theorists , intent on inadvertently bolstering his support by wheeling out implausible claims about his origins .
In America , the " birthers " say that Obama is Kenyan - born , and / or a Muslim , and / or that his birth certificate was faked ; in Britain this weekend , the Mail on Sunday published a surreally xenophobic sneer at " the United Nations of Nick Clegg " , implying that his Spanish wife , Dutch mother and half - Russian father meant that he failed to meet some obscure and rather distasteful blood - based definition of Britishness .
In an echo of the non-existent Michelle Obama " whitey " tape , we can presumably soon expect a report on Clegg 's plans to ban Christmas , or to force Britain 's motorists to marry gays .
Impressionists and caricaturists , meanwhile , complain that they can't properly satirise Clegg , because he has few distinguishing features .
But that , again , is the point : Clegg has a transparent quality , a nondescriptness , that allows each of us to project on to him our deepest aspirations .
These last few days of Cleggmania have seen him compared also to Winston Churchill , the epitome of British stubbornness – one poll suggested that Clegg was the most popular party leader since Churchill – and to Che Guevara , the epitome of stylish beret - wearing .
But these are inevitably imperfect efforts to capture in visual form the unique charisma , the indefinable Clegginess of Clegg .
Ultimately , that can't be done .
His qualities are too hard to pin down : Nick Clegg looks kind of normal , he wears normal - looking clothes , he has some good ideas , along with a few that are a bit rubbish ; he might do OK , but if we 're honest , probably not brilliantly , and he has provoked a low - key outburst of restrained hysteria .
He is a British version of Barack Obama , but perhaps this is just another way of saying that he is the new Tim Henman .
Naked cyclist Nick Lowe has successfully appealed against a conviction and fine for riding his bike nude near Upper Hutt .
Mr Lowe was convicted of offensive behaviour and fined $ 200 and $ 130 court costs after he was stopped by police while riding his bike naked on the Akatarawa Rd , north of Upper Hutt on March 15 last year - ' World Nude Bike Day ' .
A female motorist had complained to police after seeing him and later told the court she was '' fairly disgusted ' ' when she saw him .
Mr Lowe appealed the conviction to the High Court .
In a ruling released today , Justice Clifford said Mr Lowe 's nakedness had not met the test of offensive behaviour and he quashed the conviction and fine .
Mr Lowe , a builder from Johnsonville , completed last year 's Coast to Coast naked from the waist down , and regularly trains in the buff .
He told The Dominion Post when he filed the appeal : " It 's a lifestyle thing - to put clothes on is uncomfortable .
It 's not about exhibitionism , I 'm just uncomfortable in clothes . "

Hands down , this has to be the hottest cosplay of Kasumi from ‘ Dead or Alive ’ I had ever seen .
Her name is .. wait for it ..
Kipi Nopan !
Yup , now go and create a fanpage of her right now because she is seriously lacking an English fan page ( Not even a Wiki ) .
Why was n’t she playing as Kasumi in the movie ‘ Dead of Alive ’ was beyond me .
I mean seriously HOLLYWOOD come on !
This just probably inspire me to do a top ten Kasumi cosplay list ..mmmm
Check out her blog here too .
Thanks to two technologies developed by Professor Benoît Marsan and his team at the Université du Québec à Montréal ( UQAM ) Chemistry Department , the scientific and commercial future of solar cells could be totally transformed .
Professor Marsan has come up with solutions for two problems that , for the last twenty years , have been hampering the development of efficient and affordable solar cells .
His findings have been published in two scientific journals , the Journal of the American Chemical Society ( JACS ) and Nature Chemistry .
The untapped potential of solar energy
The Earth receives more solar energy in one hour than the entire planet currently consumes in a year .
Unfortunately , despite this enormous potential , solar energy is barely exploited .
The electricity produced by conventional solar cells , composed of semiconductor materials like silicon , is 5 or 6 times more expensive than from traditional energy sources , such as fossil fuels or hydropower .
Over the years , numerous research teams have attempted to develop a solar cell that would be both efficient in terms of energy and inexpensive to produce .
Dye - sensitized solar cells
One of the most promising solar cells was designed in the early '90s by Professor Michael Graetzel of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) in Switzerland .
Based on the principle of photosynthesis -- the biochemical process by which plants convert light energy into carbohydrate ( sugar , their food ) -- the Graetzel solar cell is composed of a porous layer of nanoparticles of a white pigment , titanium dioxide , covered with a molecular dye that absorbs sunlight , like the chlorophyll in green leaves .
The pigment - coated titanium dioxide is immersed in an electrolyte solution , and a platinum - based catalyst completes the package .
As in a conventional electrochemical cell ( such as an alkaline battery ) , two electrodes ( the titanium dioxide anode and the platinum cathode in the Graetzel cell ) are placed on either side of a liquid conductor ( the electrolyte ) .
Sunlight passes through the cathode and the electrolyte , and then withdraws electrons from the titanium dioxide anode , a semiconductor at the bottom of the cell .
These electrons travel through a wire from the anode to the cathode , creating an electrical current .
In this way , energy from the sun is converted into electricity .
Most of the materials used to make this cell are low - cost , easy to manufacture and flexible , allowing them to be integrated into a wide variety of objects and materials .
In theory , the Graetzel solar cell has tremendous possibilities .
Unfortunately , despite the excellence of the concept , this type of cell has two major problems that have prevented its large - scale commercialisation :
The electrolyte is : a ) extremely corrosive , resulting in a lack of durability ; b ) densely coloured , preventing the efficient passage of light ; and c ) limits the device photovoltage to 0.7 volts .
The cathode is covered with platinum , a material that is expensive , non-transparent and rare .
Despite numerous attempts , until Professor Marsan 's recent contribution , no one had been able to find a satisfactory solution to these problems .
Professor Marsan 's solutions
Professor Marsan and his team have been working for several years on the design of an electrochemical solar cell .
His work has involved novel technologies , for which he has received numerous patents .
In considering the problems of the cell developed by his Swiss colleague , Professor Marsan realized that two of the technologies developed for the electrochemical cell could also be applied to the Graetzel solar cell , specifically :
For the electrolyte , entirely new molecules have been created in the laboratory whose concentration has been increased through the contribution of Professor Livain Breau , also of the Chemistry Department .
The resulting liquid or gel is transparent and non-corrosive and can increase the photovoltage , thus improving the cell 's output and stability .
Safe Kids Move Downed Power Lines !
Did you know that downed power lines are very dangerous ?
It 's true !
Power lines can sometimes fall due to heavy snow storms , hurricanes , or poor craftsmanship .
As a safe kid , it 's your job to give grownups a hand !
Here 's how : First , locate the downed power line .
If it 's up a tree , get a ladder .
Make sure your hands are dry !
Never touch electric cables when your hands are wet !
Next , see if there are any adults around .
If they are , wait until they leave so they do n't get scared and go nuts !
Finally , and this will be the last thing you do , grab the cable to see if there 's still a current running through it .
If there is , let go !
If not , move the cable out of the way where plants and animals wo n't get hurt .
That 's it !
If you follow all of these rules , that makes you a real safe kid , and safe kids are cool kids !
Safe Kids Practice Safe Shooting !
Here 's a fact : robbers can walk into your home any time they want , make a sandwich , use your bathroom and play with your mom 's titties .
The most important rule to avoiding accidents with guns is to : BE CAREFUL !
Everybody knows that guns save lives , but did you know that guns can end lives too ?
In fact , they can end just as many lives as they save , and possibly even more if you do n't follow common sense safety rules .
Safe kids know that the only way to shoot someone safely is if you have good aim , and the only way to get good aim is to practice shooting all the time .
But first , you need to know what robbers look like .
Here 's what to look for :
Any time you see a dark silhouette in your home at night , it could be a robber ( see right ) .
Make him or her think twice about breaking in with those balloons .
Open fire !
a robber ( see right ) .
Make him or her think twice about breaking in with those balloons .
Open fire !
Robbers love to use disguises .
Sometimes they look like the mail man , or the guy who reads meters from the power company .
Do n't be fooled !
Pump off a couple warning rounds in the air to let them know you 're serious about safety !
Sometimes robbers even look like pets .
Stay alert !
It could be your neighbor 's pet .
It could be your own .
Dogs eat food that is n't their 's all the time , but if you did the same thing at a restaurant , you 'd get arrested or worse !
Why should dogs get away with it ?
Teach dogs that the only free meal in life comes at you at 800 mph , and is made of lead .
Next , you have to find your dad 's gun so you can practice shooting !
You do n't have to be a detective to find the key to his gun chest ; it 's on his keyring .
Once you get the gun , get some target practice .
Just take care not to hit any of mom's precious china , or you 're cruisin ' for a bruisin !
And if you practice enough at shooting targets , you might even get good enough to shoot with your eyes closed , just like magicians !
And the only thing cooler than safety is magic !
Run Fast Across Freeways to Avoid Being Hit !
Grownups always tell you to look both ways before crossing the street , but what about crossing the freeway ?
Here are some tips that most grownups wo n't give you :
Learn the difference between cars that honk angrily , and cars that honk in support .
The trick to crossing a freeway is to run fast .
Sometimes ducking down and letting a car pass over you is the best option .
Just make sure there 's enough clearance under the car .
If not , you may find jumping helpful .
Use spacial reasoning : if a motorcycle can fit between cars , so can a kid .
And a baby .
Speaking of ...
If you have a baby brother or sister , make sure to carry him or her on your back .
Sometimes running and jumping just is n't enough , and you might get hit .
The important thing to remember is if you get hit by a car , do n't panic !
Just dust yourself off and try again .
Save Money & Time By Buying Things You Want !
Ever ask your mom to buy you something from the store , but she says " no " because she 's too busy ?
You 're not alone !
You do n't have to forego fun just because your parents are too preoccupied with work and divorce .
Here are three easy steps to getting what you want , and freeing up your parents ' time so they can sort out their lives :
Wait until your parents are sleeping , and sneak quietly into their room .
It 's important to be as quiet as possible so you do n't waste their time by waking them up .
Find your dad 's wallet or your mom's purse .
Take any cash or credit cards you find .
That 's it !
Next time you go to the store , you can use the cash to buy whatever you want .
But be careful !
Make sure you only buy things you really want !
If you spend your money carelessly , you could end up buying bread , groceries , and food that your mom already has for you at home .
And boy will she be mad if she found out you bought a bunch of things she already has .
It 's best to use cash for candy and toys , and credit cards for things you buy online , like TVs and home entertainment centers .
When your mom realizes how much time you saved her , she 's going to flip !
Safe Sex Sexual abstinence is sometimes promoted as a safe way to avoid getting sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) , HIV and pregnancy .
Though most people ( 60 % ) who pledge not to have pre-marital sex end up having it anyway , and are 30 % less likely to use contraceptives than their peers who receive and practice safe sex procedures .
Safe sex is not just about protecting you , it 's also about protecting your partner .
Some people think that safe sex is less enjoyable than regular sex , but if done properly , safe sex with the right partner can still be an exhilarating experience .
When you have decided you are ready to have intercourse , here are some rules you should keep in mind : 1 . Use a Condom Always , always , always use a condom !
The best condoms for general purpose use are lubricated latex condoms .
For vaginal intercourse , you may want to consider a condom with spermicide lubricant .
If you are allergic to latex , there are polyurethane alternatives , as well as lambskin condoms , though lambskin does not protect against STDs and HIV and are n't recommended .
2 . Use Lubricants
Using a good water - based lubricant will make things go smoother for you and your partner , and is great for if you tend to get sore .
Avoid oil - based lubricants because oil can wear down and eat through latex condoms .
Do n't use vaseline or handcreams as lubricants , but do use Astroglide , KY Liquid , Liquid Silk , Maximus and Probe ( though note that Probe contains glycerin , which may sometimes cause yeast infections ) .
It 's especially important to use a good lubricant if you engage in riskier anal sex .
If you decide to engage in anal sex , make sure the anal area is clean and the bowels are empty .
It may help to remember the phrase " shit it before you hit it . "
3 . Clean Sex Toys After Every Use Proper storage and maintenance of your sex toys will ensure safety and a long life .
If you notice your dildos chipped , cracked , or stained , throw them away !
Make sure not to put the toy in your vagina after it 's been in your pooper without washing it first .
It 's best to use a condom with toys , and even vegetables such as cucumbers , zucchini , eggplant and butternut squash .
4 . Use a Condom for Oral
If you are going to put your partner 's chach ( pronounced " chawch " ) in your mouth , make sure to use a condom for males , and plastic wrap or a dental dam for females .
Dental dams are square pieces of latex you can get from most drugstores and dentist 's offices .
for sexual infections .
If you play it safe , you can help reduce the risk , and reducing risk is cool !
Microsoft filed an intellectual property suit against Salesforce.com May 18 , alleging infringement on nine of its patents .
Patent - infringement suits are a regular occurrence in the tech industry , and larger companies often use this type of suit as part of a broader strategy .
The question is , What sort of motive lies behind Microsoft 's legal action against the cloud - based software provider ?
According to Microsoft , the case is straightforward patent infringement .
" Microsoft has been a leader and innovator in the software industry for decades and continues to invest billions of dollars each year in bringing great software products and services to market , " Horacio Gutierrez , Microsoft 's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel of Intellectual Property and Licensing , said in a May 18 statement .
" We have a responsibility to our customers , partners and shareholders to safeguard that investment , and therefore cannot stand idly by when others infringe on our IP rights . "
A Salesforce.com representative had no comment on the lawsuit .
While Microsoft offers cloud - based solutions such as its xRM platform , the company continues to invest heavily in on - premises software and hybrid environments .
By contrast , Salesforce.com - which has the corporate tagline , " No Software " - has aggressively pushed cloud - based platforms as the way of the future .
Given the two companies ' focus on the business audience , and their radically different philosophies on software , a collision was perhaps foreordained .
Salesforce.com 's recent strategic moves include the launch of AppExchange 2 , the next generation of its online enterprise - application storefront , which will include a new ChatterExchange with social enterprise applications built by third - party developers .
The company 's Chatter platform , which allows Facebook - style social collaboration among enterprise workers , is currently undergoing a round of private beta testing .
Salesforce.com 's push to enlist third - party developers also includes its partnership with VMware to create VMforce , a platform that 6 million enterprise Java developers can potentially use to work with the cloud environment .
That sort of maneuvering puts Salesforce.com even more at odds with Microsoft , which encourages developers to build applications based on .NET .
While the amount of damages sought remains unspecified , Microsoft 's patents in the lawsuit cover specific areas such as , " Method and system for mapping between logical data and physical data , " " Method and system for stacking tool bars in a computer display " and " System and method for providing and displaying a Web page having an embedded menu . "
But what lies behind Microsoft 's decision to pursue a lawsuit now ?
" It may be there 's a tactical angle to this - where Microsoft puts a stick in Salesforce 's spokes , " Roger Kay , an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates , told eWEEK in a May 19 interview .
" But I do n't think Microsoft 's motive here was , ' Hey , how can we mess these guys up ? ' "
Instead , Kay said , Microsoft may be seeking ways to " monetize " its large patent portfolio , by exploring where a rival company 's technology potentially conflicts with its existing intellectual property .
Kay added : " It does n't seem as if Microsoft is challenging the core intellectual property of Salesforce .
It 's really about Microsoft having looked over Salesforce 's operations and seen some pieces of plumbing that looked like it could belong to them . "
Nonetheless , other analysts suggest that the patents cited by Microsoft are particularly valuable .
" Microsoft considers these to be core patents , ideas that differentiate Microsoft 's offerings broadly , " Rob Enderle , principal analyst of the Enderle Group , wrote in a May 19 e-mail to eWEEK .
" They wo n't license these and approached Salesforce and Salesforce evidently [ blew ] them off , likely thinking that Microsoft would n't litigate because they rarely do . "
According to Enderle , that move could translate into a protracted legal battle .
" Microsoft uses the threat of litigation , and to use that threat effectively and not have to litigate broadly it has to be real and frightening , " Enderle wrote .
" This means from time to time they have to make an example of a company so that the threat works and they do n't have to incur massive legal fees every time there is a problem like this . "
Salesforce.com , Enderle added , " will not be that example and Microsoft 's investment in this effort will be significant .
They 've been doing this for decades . "
In any case , this is n't the only intellectual property battle engaging Microsoft 's attention .
The company 's current legal woes include a patent - infringement lawsuit leveled against it by i4i , which alleges a violation of its custom XML - related patents ; on May 11 , the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office confirmed the validity of the patent in question , limiting Microsoft 's options after months of judgments and appeals .
In addition , Microsoft announced on March 17 that it would pay $ 200 million to settle a patent - infringement suit leveled against it by VirnetX , which builds communication and collaboration technologies .
In March , a Texas jury found that Microsoft had infringed on two U.S. patents held by VirnetX , and ordered the software giant to pay $ 105.7 million .

If the Australian government really does n’t want to implant its citizens with PositiveID ( PSID ) microchips , it sure is n’t helping itself with its
Web page dedicated to a “ literature review ” of different patient identification technologies , including VeriChip , “ palm vein scanning , ” radio frequency identification , and other dystopian sci- fi ideas .
While the New South Wales Department of Health Web page is ostensibly a reference point for officials who want to reduce medical errors caused by patient mixups , it looks pretty scary if you ’re someone who thinks that society is heading toward a Minority Report - style dictatorship in which everyone carries a compulsory microchip implant .
And there are lots of those people .
Managers ought to be aware that transparency has a flip side :
The same information can look mighty different when viewed by unintended audiences .
Australia is in the middle of a healthcare reform , and a central plank of those changes is the introduction of a “ personally controlled electronic health record system , ” or e-Health scheme , that gives each Australian a 16 - digit ID number .
By unfortunate coincidence , PositiveID ’s VeriChip device also relies on a 16 - digit system , and its Health Link medical records product sounds exactly like the online database Australia is creating .
So , paranoid Americans who believe President Obama wants to introduce a socialist World Government that controls its subjects via RFID chips just caught a lucky break : Australia is giving us all a sneak preview .

We 've seen plenty of studies like this one in the past , but here 's yet another in a long list ( this one from Australia ) suggesting that people who are file sharing unauthorized files are really frustrated consumers , who would pay if there was an actual reason to .
That is , it suggests the reason they go to file sharing sites is because they 're easier and more convenient , not just because it 's free .
While I 'm sure that 's true of some people , I 'm not convinced the numbers in this report are anywhere near accurate .
This was done as a survey , and surveys are notoriously inaccurate when it comes to having people tell you what they would do , compared to what they actually would do .
Frankly , while studies like this do point out that file sharers are often willing to buy -- if given the reason -- the setup of the survey actually gives the industry a false milestone to work towards .
It gets them back to thinking that there really is a market for digital goods , when the economics suggest they should be looking for scarcities , not trying to price infinite goods .
Of course , even with that false hope , the industry still is confused .
The response to the study from Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft was that the industry wo n't " compete " with unauthorized file sharing until it goes away Talk about getting it backwards .
The reason they have to compete is because file sharing is there .
And , of course they can and do compete with free alternatives all the time , and have for ages .
Saying you can't compete with free is a lie .
Providers compete on things other than price all the time .
In fact , saying you can't compete with free is a direct misunderstanding of what the survey appears to say : it 's saying that consumers are more than will to pay for greater value , but the industry refuses to provide it .
Saying you wo n't compete until the market changes in your favor is basically signing your own death warrant .

There was some news earlier today that the Droid2 had appeared in Verizon ’s inventory .
Since we really do n’t bother much about inventory blurry cam shots , we decided to wait for further info and now there is a image posted on HoFo which shows the improved QWERTY Keyboard on the upcoming Droid2
The Keypad on the Droid has a D - Pad on the right side .
This might soon be history as this might be replaced by Arrow keys in the Droid2 .
This is pretty similar to the way Nokia did similar stuff to the N97 and N97 Mini .
Also we spotted a OK button next to the arrow keys .
Also there is a new ALT Lock button which might let you type numbers ot symbols more easily .
Another interesting thing is the Dedicated Voice Input Key .
I really love the fact that I can choose to use Voice Input on the Nexus One across the Interface .
A key dedicated to this functionality should be cool .
Do you like this new layout ?
Will you be happy if it went official ?
And its pretty clear by now that the Shadow and Droid2 will be two separate devices from Motorola .

The Michigan - based militia group charged with conspiring to kill police officers is preparing for battle with the Antichrist , according to a Web site purportedly run by the group .
" Jesus wanted us to be ready to defend ourselves using the sword and stay alive using equipment , " Hutaree.com reads .
" The only thing on earth to save the testimony and those who follow it , are the members of the testimony , til the return of Christ in the clouds .
We , the Hutaree , are prepared to defend all those who belong to Christ and save those who are n't .
We will still spread the word , and fight to keep it , up to the time of the great coming . "
Nine suspects associated with Hutaree , which is purportedly a Christian - based militia group , have been charged with conspiring to kill police officers and then attack a funeral in hopes of killing more law enforcement officials , federal prosecutors said Monday .
U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said agents moved on the group because the militia members were planning an attack sometime in April .
Members of the militia , including its leader , David Brian Stone , also known as " Captain Hutaree , " are charged in the case and allegedly met regularly since at least 2008 to conduct military - style training in Michigan 's Lenawee County and elsewhere .
An indictment alleges that members of the group conspired to " levy war against the United States , ( and ) to oppose by force the authority of the government of the United States . "
Eight suspects have been arrested by the FBI and one more is being sought .
Of the eight captured , seven were arraigned Monday in Detroit and ordered held pending a bond hearing Wednesday .
Stone 's ex-wife , Donna Stone , told The Associated Press before the arraignments that her former husband was to blame for pulling her son into the Hutaree movement .
She said David Brian Stone legally adopted her son , David Brian Stone Jr. , who is among those indicted .
She said the marriage lasted about 10 years .
" It started out as a Christian thing , " said Donna Stone , 44 .
" You go to church .
You pray .
You take care of your family .
I think David started to take it a little too far .
He dragged a lot of people with him . "
Another son of David Brian Stone , Joshua Matthew Stone , also was indicted and is a fugitive , said Detroit FBI spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold .
According to an indictment unsealed Monday , nine members of the militia had planned to kill a member of law enforcement and then plant an improvised explosive device to attack the subsequent funeral procession .
Other possible acts included killing a law enforcement official and his or her family at home or luring a member of law enforcement with a false 911 emergency call and then killing him or her .
" These acts would intimidate and demoralize law enforcement diminishing their ranks and rendering them ineffective , " the indictment reads .
Once such an attack was launched , the indictment alleges that Hutaree members would then retreat to one of several " rally points " to detonate trip - wired improvised explosive devices .
" It is believed by the Hutaree that this engagement would then serve as a catalyst for a more wide - spread uprising against the Government , " the indictment continued .
Several conspirators allegedly attempted to travel to Kentucky in early February to attend a summit of militia groups convened by Stone , the alleged leader of the organization .
" The purpose of the summit of militia groups was to facilitate better communications , cooperation , and coordination between the various militias , " the indictment read .
Although weather ultimately prevented the conspirators from reaching their destination , Stone allegedly identified law enforcement officers in a " specific community " near his residence and one officer as potential targets , according to the indictment .
Weeks later , the suspects gathered in Michigan 's Lenawee County to engage in training for the planned covert reconnaissance exercise .
Each suspect in attendance carried and used at least one firearm , the indictment continues .
Andrew Arena , head of the FBI 's field office in Detroit , said the case is an example of " radical and extremist fringe groups " found throughout society .
The " Doctrine of the Hutaree , " which is based on faith , according to the group 's Web site , states that Christians should " stand firm in Christ and believe in him until our uttermost end .
The testimony must by no means pass away and we must spread the word believing in Christ 's words , even during the end times . "
A two - minute video on the Web site depicts several camouflaged , armed men firing high - powered rifles as they move throughout open wilderness .
At one point , three men can be seen firing weapons from behind a parked vehicle .
Several other videos of the militia 's training activities , including one that has been viewed more than 21,000 times , can be found on its YouTube channel .
Michael Lackomar , a spokesman for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia , told the Associated Press that one of his team leaders got a frantic phone call Saturday evening from members of Hutaree , which the Web site says means " Christian soldier . "
The callers said their property in southeast Michigan was being raided by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , Lackomar said .
" They said they were under attack by the ATF and wanted a place to hide , " Lackomar said .
" My team leader said , ' No thanks . ' "
A message sent to the militia group by FoxNews.com seeking comment was not immediately returned early Monday .
According to the militia 's ranking system , members of the group can hold titles such as senior gunner , gold rifleman , " zulif " and " arkon . "
" Respect the officer above you and obey your commander with dignity , " the Web site reads .
" Each man holds his place in flesh and spirit , heaven and earth . "
The Web site also includes links to Hutaree forums , a photograph of a patch for the Colonial Christian Republic and a red banner promoting a training session for April 24 .
" Preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive , " the Web site reads . " ... Being Hutaree is to stay the Testimony of Christ alive , and follow a motto , John 15:13 , ' Greater love hath no man than this , that he lay down his life for his friends . ' "
Hutaree was named in a list of 512 so - called active " patriot " groups in the U.S. last year by the Southern Poverty Law Center in its spring intelligence report on extremist organizations .
Of those groups , 127 were militias , including Hutaree .
The remaining groups , according to SPLC , engage in " groundless conspiracy theorizing " or advocate anti-government doctrines .

Police were alerted to smoke coming from an SUV , before finding canisters of propane and an electronic trigger .
Fortunately nobody got hurt as the bomb did n't go off .
There 's still no definitive answer to who was behind the bomb , but according to UK's The Telegraph , police are investigating whether there 's any connection between the foiled attack and the controversial episode of South Park , which drew the ire of some Muslim extremists , who vowed revenge .
The article notes the proximity between the van ( at 45th and Broadway ) and the Viacom building at 1515 Broadway .
Beyond that , investigators are also looking into the similarity between this device and that of a 2007 London Nightclub bombing .
1993 : Waco cult siege ends with inferno
At least 70 people are feared to have died in a fire at the besieged headquarters of the Branch Davidian sect near Waco , Texas .
The fate of the cult 's leader , David Koresh , is still unknown .
The White House said the blaze had been started deliberately by those inside after the FBI began a dawn assault .
Tear gas canisters and stun grenades were fired into the cult 's compound and an armoured vehicle moved in to demolish the walls .
Three hours later they broke down the main entrance .
At one point reports said the cult members had agreed to come out but then reneged on the deal .
When the fire started at around 1200 local time ( 1800 GMT ) several children were believed to be inside with David Koresh and his followers .
By the time firefighters arrived the fire had taken a firm hold on wooden buildings inside the compound .
The fire worsened when the cult 's store of munitions exploded .
Eight cult members escaped but David Koresh is not believed to be among them .
Orders from God
The cult 's buildings been surrounded since February when four agents with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( ATF ) were killed as they attempted to arrest Mr Koresh on firearms charges .
It was hoped Mr Koresh would give himself up last week but he sent FBI agents a message saying he had not yet received his orders from God .
The Branch Davidians descend from a breakaway group from the Seventh Day Adventist Church .
President Bill Clinton said yesterday he had had advance warning of the assault on the compound .
But the president added that newly - appointed Attorney - General Janet Reno made the decision to begin the operation .
On March 31 at 9:00 am , I was driving across a bridge in Moscow .
The lanes towards the city center were jammed , but I was heading in the opposite direction and my lane was more or less empty .
A black BMW was going towards the city centre , and when its driver saw the traffic jam , he moved into the opposite lane and came head - on towards me .
He had a beacon light flashing on his roof , but no siren .
I signalled at him , flashing my headlights on high beam .
I also began to slow down .
We stopped head to head .
Then I took out my camera and started to film .
People are fed up with the impunity of bureaucrats , who feel that they are privileged and above the law .
Ordinary people like me ask themselves : who are all these people behind the tinted glass in expensive cars ?
Do they really need to ignore laws and traffic regulations ?
This is especially the case after the accident in Leninsky Prospect , when Vera Sidelnikova and her daughter - in - law died .
Ordinary people do n’t believe in the official explanation , that it was Sidelnikova 's Citroen at fault .
It 's events like these that push you over the edge .
I ’ve been driving in Moscow for many years , and it 's getting worse each year : the traffic jams , the brazenness of the powerful - all these ' special license plates ' that give their owners special rights .
It does n't exist anywhere else in the world , but we have to deal with it every day .
Thank God there was n't any pressure on me from the police .
Mr Shevchenko declared that what I did was a deliberate provocation against him .
It 's complete nonsense .
As if I was waiting in a bush to jump out at him with a camera .
Thankfully , they did n't declare that I was an American spy taking into account my non-Russian surname .
They could have twisted it into the ' discovery ' of an anti-Russian plot by Western secret services .
Now , this man ( Shevchenko ) , who has the rank of ambassador and has worked for many years with two presidents , seriously claims that in any civilized country I would be severely punished for what I did .
You can't help thinking that these bureaucrats are detached from the people .
When you drive in the morning on Kutuzovsky Prospect , they ’re speeding by the dividing strip with their flashing lights on .
People joke now that we should be grateful that they let us drive in our lanes at all . "
Two gay teens , Jordan Nixon and his boyfriend Chase have been allowed to attend prom at Starmount High School in Booneville , NC after Jordan 's mom Leesa heard how Chase had been told by the principal that he could n't bring a " friend " to the prom .
After explaining that Jordan was not a friend but a " boyfriend " the school still would n't relent .
Jordan 's mom Leesa Nixon went to the principal , threatened to take action and go to the media , and quickly the issue was resolved .
This is the story of a great parent standing up for her gay kid and a school faced with the threat of exposing its discriminatory behavior .
Writes Leesa Nixon :
" The discrimination that Chase was confronted with has been resolved .
I called and spoke with his principal and informed her that not allowing Chase to bring his boyfriend to the prom was discrimination and a violation of his constitutionally protected rights .
I threatened to call the ACLU , ( which I did ) and go to the media .
After our first conversation , I was contacted by Mrs. Parker , who informed me that she was waiting on the school attorney to call .
April 7th , Mrs. Parker left a message on my phone stating that she had spoken with the school attorney and that the school was going to allow Chase to bring my son Jordan to his Senior Prom “ as his outside date ” and that what they were going to have to do , was change the rule to allow students to bring a guest and not necessarily a “ date ” .
To be fair to Mrs.
Parker , I got the distinct impression that she did not agree with this policy and was only trying to follow the rules that were in effect in her school district before she got there .
She immediately went to work and corrected the issue at hand .
I applaud Starmount High School for their quick actions , I brought this issue to their attention and in one day they not only changed their initial decision , they changed their policy to ensure that this would never happen again .
Although they change their policy to state “ guest ” instead of “ date ” , it is still a step in the right direction and they should be admired for their willingness to change .
It is my hope that all schools would respond to these issues in such a fair and timely manner .
Head on over to Jack Mackenroth 's blog to read the entire tale , as well as Chase 's account of his meeting with the principal .
Enjoy your prom , guys !
The station 's energetic Gayle Anderson was conducting an interview about " Best Road Trip Cars " in a beach parking lot when she casually worked in a line about receiving a citation as a cameraman panned to an officer writing ticket .
" And after you pay your Santa Monica parking ticket , where do you go in this Porsche Panamera ? " she asked .
" We 've paid for parking , I have receipts , but that 's okay , we 'll figure it out , friendly Santa Monica , " Anderson snarked .
Sergeant Jay Trisler , however , says the story actually goes like this : the parking manager for the lot called police after payment was n't received for several vehicles that had entered .
Apparently at 7:40 a.m. , the attendant 's supervisor asked that the parking spots be paid for -- in response , the news crew said it would be paid by 9 a .m.
But at 8:50 a.m. , the news crew ignored the attendant when he returned for payment .
An officer that was called to the lot approached a KTLA representative about seeing receipt and permits for the spaces .
" The representative walked away and did not come back , " said Trisler , who explained that four tickets written around 9:20 a.m .
" Although the news reporter stated on the live television broadcast that they had paid for the parking spaces at the time the officer was issuing the citations , the news crew actually paid for the parking spaces at 9:40 a.m. , after the citations were issued . "
Waiters on restaurant row are welcoming customers they have n’t seen since the first days of the drug war .
Police no longer patrol neighborhoods in four - vehicle convoys .
Kidnappings are down , and late - night crowds are way up at clubs and bars .
“ Look at all the single ladies here , ” said Juan Carlos Eguiluz , taking in the bustling scene at his Cheripan restaurant in the Zona Rio dining district .
“ Single lady .
Single lady .
Single lady .
They know they ’re safe and respected here . ”
Four months after the capture of the notorious crime boss Teodoro Garcia Simental , this border city is showing glimpses of its old , vibrant self .
Like survivors of a Category 5 hurricane of crime , residents are emerging from their homes , wary but hopeful .
While clashes in other key drug - trafficking centers such as Juarez are reaching new heights of brutality , the uniquely savage violence that has plagued Tijuana during the government ’s three - year war on organized crime has declined dramatically since the January arrest .
Drug - fueled crime has always cycled up and down , of course .
But there are no signs that anyone of Garcia ’s ruthless ambition has stepped into the power void .
Although homicides still occur at a steady pace , the beheadings , massacres and dissolution of victims in lye that were Garcia ’s terrorizing trademark have largely stopped .
Near the bustling produce market on Insurgentes Boulevard where 13 people died in the gun battle that sparked the local drug war two years ago , taco vendors push carts still bullet - riddled from the shootout , but say there ’s no need to duck these days .
Across town , businessmen and politicians have cut back on large security details that shadowed their movements and ferried their children to school .
“ We feel that since they caught all these monsters , things are going to calm down , ” said Genaro de la Torre , a businessman .
***
In other drug war hot spots , crime bosses are distant , shadowy figures whose killing rampages are a blur of anonymity .
In Tijuana , the violence had a face : Garcia ’s chubby mug .
He was a hometown narco - soldier turned renegade cartel lieutenant , carousing in restaurants and banquet halls , roaming the city in a convoy of armored SUVs and leaving behind a trail of tortured massacre victims , proudly claiming responsibility with taunting narco - messages .
His gunmen killed hundreds of rivals from the Arellano Felix drug cartel , and at least 45 police officers .
He accumulated wealth by holding for ransom middle - and upper - class residents , forcing hundreds , perhaps thousands , of families to flee across the border to San Diego .
Many residents feared even saying his name , instead referring to him by holding up three fingers to signify his nickname , El Tres , the three .
To this day , some people avoid the sprawling eastern part of the city , a mostly working - class area far from tourist destinations that was Garcia ’s stronghold .
One real estate developer sold out a subdivision there , only to see some of his new homebuyers get kidnapped .
“ It was almost like we put them on stage .
They became targets .
It makes us feel horrible , ” said the developer , declining to be identified for security reasons .
The developer , like some other businesspeople and lawyers , conducts business nowadays at upscale restaurants in the Zona Rio , holding meetings and sales calls between servings .
“ I feel very safe here , ” said Alisha Oceguera , a 20 - year - old student who crossed the border from San Diego with friends to dine at Cheripan on a recent Saturday night .
Some parents still do n’t like their children to stay out late , but many have eased their home - by - dark rule , she said .
Some chefs say they ’re seeing double the number of customers from last year .
Some are people who fled the city , and now feel safe enough to return to their old haunts .
At Cheripan , the lines stretch out the door on weekends , and the owner of the nearby La Querencia , where a photo of visiting U2 ’s front man , Bono , hangs on the wall , is planning to open two new restaurants .
“ People from Tijuana are dynamic , ” said La Querencia ’s owner , Miguel Angel Guerrero .
“ You ca n’t keep us closeted .
We have to go out . ”

Mayor Jorge Ramos is laying out the welcome mat .
The city has successfully hosted several conventions and events in recent months , including the World Junior Taekwondo Championships , he points out , adding that visitors from Southern California should n’t be afraid .
“ We lived many difficult days , but with the arrest of more than 100 drug lords , things have gotten better , ” said Ramos , adding that he has been able to cut back on a security detail that once totaled 24 bodyguards .
“ We want to invite everybody to see how things have improved . ”
Few U.S. citizens have taken him up on the offer .
The city ’s top tourist draw , downtown ’s once - raucous Avenida Revolucion , attracts only trickles of tourists , mostly Chinese or Europeans who ride the usually empty double - decker tourist bus around some of the city ’s historic sites and shopping areas .
Government officials complain that the State Department ’s travel alerts are scaring off visitors .
After Garcia ’s capture , local authorities hoped Washington would ease the warnings , but the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana issued another one , saying Garcia ’s arrest could trigger more violence .
“ When gunfire / explosions are heard , immediately move to a safe area with good cover , ” said the alert , which Mexican officials called alarmist and contradictory .
They note that the same travel warning says there ’s no evidence that U.S. tourists have been targeted in any narco - violence .
For many residents , a stark indicator of changing times is the new nightlife scene burgeoning in downtown Tijuana .
Called “ La Sexta ” — for its location on Sixth Street — the area ’s funky theme bars attract a mixed crowd of hipsters and professionals , college students and young businessmen .
A few years ago , crime fears would have hampered the growth of the trendy scene .
But times have changed , said Rueben Flores , 35 , a bartender at one of the popular spots in the area , La Mezcalera .
“ If there was violence , the Sexta would n’t exist , ” Flores said .
“ We would n’t have business . ”

Il peut y avoir quelques nuances entre les différentes expressions , mais qu’on l’appelle Revenu citoyen , Revenu de vie , Allocation universelle ou Dividende Universel , l ’idée principale consiste à verser tout au long de sa vie un revenu unique à tous les citoyens d’un pays , quels que soient leurs revenus , leur patrimoine , et leur statut professionnel .
Ce revenu permettant à chaque individu de satisfaire ses besoins primaires tels que se nourrir , se loger , se vêtir , voire acquérir certains biens culturels de base .
À priori cela semble totalement fou .
Mais quand on se penche sur les sites spécialisés , comme CreationMonetaire .
info d’où est issu le billet reproduit ci-dessous , on réalise que c’est peut - être moins utopique qu’on ne le croit .
Du reste , nous pouvons témoigner : GNU / Linux , Wikipédia , OpenStreetMap … les projets utopiques existent , nous en avons rencontrés ;-)
Et puis , reconnaissons surtout que c’est l’économie actuelle qui est devenue complètement folle et qui va finir par tous nous mettre à genoux .
Alors folie contre folie …
En tout cas il n’est pas anodin de voir le logiciel libre et sa culture fournir des arguments aux partisans de cette idée folle .
Et inversement , imaginez qu’on assure un jour à tous les membres de la communauté du Libre un revenu minimum pour vivre , ce serait à n’en pas douter une explosion d’enthousiasme et de projets !
Parce que c’est bien moins l’argent [ 1 ] qui nous manque que le temps .
Un temps trop souvent occupé à devoir survivre …

Les 4 arguments du Dividende Universel
URL d’origine du document
Stéphane Laborde – 17 mai 2010 – CreationMonetaire.info
Licence Creative Commons By
Depuis quelques semaines , je reçois des demandes d’arguments concernant le Dividende Universel , par des personnes connaissant le sujet , mais qui se trouvent confrontées à des interlocuteurs ignorants de la question .
Il y a bien sûr la multitude de liens , d’explications et de justifications qui se trouvent sur l’article Wikipedia qui le concerne , mais je vais résumer ici les points fondamentaux nécessaires à l’introduction dans le sujet pour un novice :
1. L’argument massue de la propriété de la zone EURO ( remplacer EURO par la monnaie de son choix ) .
La Zone EURO est une construction fondamentalement Citoyenne .
Chaque Citoyen via son
Etat respectif est co-propriétaire de la Zone Euro , et il est régulièrement convié à voter pour élire ses représentants tant locaux que continentaux , directement ou indirectement .
Or tout propriétaire d’une entreprise quelle qu’elle soit , reçoit , en proportion de sa détention du capital un Dividende annuel , généralement autour de 5 % de la valeur de l’entreprise .
La Zone Euro étant économiquement valorisable en proportion de sa Masse Monétaire en Circulation ( voire du PIB , mais PIB et Masse Monétaire sont interdépendants ) .
Le Dividende Universel correspond donc simplement à la reconnaissance de la co-propriété de la zone économique par chaque Citoyen ( présents et à venir , aucune génération n’a de droit privilégié de ce point de vue ) .
Cet argument conviendra à tout défenseur de la propriété et du droit économique .
2. L’argument de la création libre et non marchande
L’Art , les logiciels libres , les écrits libres de droit , le travail non marchand effectué par l’action associative ou individuelle etc …
Que fournissent chaque citoyen de la zone euro , est une valeur , incommensurable , qui bénéficie au secteur marchand directement ou indirectement .
( par exemple internet fonctionne avec une couche de logiciels libres qui ont été développés et distribués sans aucune reconnaissance monétaire ) .
Ces valeurs sont difficilement monnayables , parce que ce qui fait leur valeur , est justement l’adoption par le plus grand nombre , d’autant plus rapidement que c’est gratuit .
Or sur ce substrat de valeur , se développent des valeurs marchandes , qui elles valorisent leurs produits raréfiés .
Le Dividende Universel est une valorisation de cette couche libre et non marchande de la société , qui est la juste compensation du droit d’usage de cette couche multi-valeur pour des activités marchandes .
Cet argument conviendra à tous ceux qui souhaitent travailler et créer pour autrui , sans contrainte marchande , en étant valorisé à minima , sans pour autant vouloir tirer un avantage économique de leur création ( artistes , développeurs libres , auteurs libres , blogueurs , bénévoles associatifs , aides de voisinage etc… ) …
3. L’argument anti-crises financières de la Création Monétaire neutre
La Création Monétaire par effet de levier est une dissymétrie qui accentue les écarts capitalistiques sans raison .
Parce que X , Y ou Z ont un avantage capitalistique de départ , on leur permet de surévaluer cet avantage par un effet de levier de création monétaire , qui dévalue la monnaie existante , et leur permet à tout moment d’acheter ou de copier toute innovation par création de fausse monnaie momentanée ( éventuellement détruite lors du remboursement de la fausse monnaie - dette émise , mais le mal est fait , et toute l’Histoire montre que jamais cette dette n’est réellement remboursée par les plus gros bénéficiaires , sommets de pyramides de Ponzi… ) .
Le Dividende Universel est une création monétaire neutre et symétrique dans le temps et dans l’espace , et rend à la monnaie tout sens sens premier : un Crédit Mutuel entre Citoyens , versé non pas en une fois , mais progressivement , tout le long de la vie , et de façon relative à la richesse mesurable ( Proportionnelle à La masse monétaire / Citoyen ) , sans léser les générations futures .
Cet argument conviendra aux Scientifiques , Economistes et Ingénieurs , soucieux de justifications théoriques solides .
4. L’argument de la valeur fondamentale de toute économie
La valeur fondamentale de toute mesure est l’observateur lui même .
En effet hors l’observateur il n’est point de mesure , alors que hors objet extérieur , l’observateur peut toujours se prendre lui même pour objet d’observation .
C’est le point minimum et suffisant pour toute mesure .
L’homme est l’observateur de l’économie , autant que son acteur fondamental , et son service en est l’objectif premier .
Or cette valeur fondamentale nécessite d’être valorisée sur une base éthiquement acceptable , afin que son potentiel de création , de travail pour autrui , de choix de développement économique , soit libre et non faussé .
En valorisant l’homme par un micro-investissement continu , tout le long de sa vie , c’est l’ensemble de l’économie qui investit dans chacune de ses composantes économiques fondamentales , le " risque " étant noyé dans la multitude .
Le Dividende Universel est un micro-investissement global et continu sur la valeur productive fondamentale de toute économie : l’homme .
Cet argument conviendra aux humanistes , philosophes , constitutionnalistes , et juristes soucieux des Droits de l’Homme .
Looks like this may be actually worth the wait .
It looks great .
This is my favorite version of tabbed browsing I have seen on a mobile device so far .
And I 'm really looking forward to what kinds of add - ons devs come up with .

Ripe tomatoes are left to rot in the dirt in a field Thursday , March 4 , 2010 , in Plant City , Fla .
The recent cold weather in Florida has been especially hard on tomato farmers and is predicted to drive the up prices at the grocery store .
ST .
PETERSBURG , Fla . 
A frigid Florida winter is taking its toll on your sandwich .
The Sunshine State is the main U.S. source for fresh winter tomatoes , and its growers lost some 70 % of their crop during January 's prolonged cold snap .
Wholesale prices are up nearly five times over last year .
That means you can say goodbye to the beefsteaks on that burger and prepare to pay more than usual for the succulent wedges in your salad .
At Costello Sandwich and Sides in Chicago , which uses 10 to 15 cases of tomatoes a week and is now paying $ 25 a case instead of $ 15 , customers can expect to get a bit less tomato on their sandwiches .
The shop has n't raised prices or stopped serving tomatoes altogether , but manager Matthew Villareal says he can see the tomatoes are soft when the prep cooks are cutting them .
" The tomato prices definitely have gone up and the quality is n't so great either , " he said .
" We just kind of eat the cost . "
An unusually cold January in Florida destroyed entire fields of tomatoes — along with some green beans , sweet corn and squash .
The cold scarred the tomatoes , damaged their vines , and forced many farmers to delay their harvest .
The average wholesale price for a 25 - pound box of tomatoes is now $ 30 , up from $ 6.50 a year ago .
Florida 's growers would normally ship about 25 million pounds of tomatoes a week ; right now , they 're shipping less than a quarter of that , according to Reggie Brown of the Florida Tomato Grower 's Exchange , a tomato farmer cooperative in Maitland .
Some parts of Florida saw average temperatures so low that this January and February were among the 10 coldest on record , according to the National Weather Service .
" Anecdotally , from talking to some real long timers , as well as people who watch the weather , this has been the most extended cold in maybe 60 years , " said Terry McElroy , spokesman for the Florida Department of Agriculture .
Industry estimates suggest that about two - thirds of the tomato crop in the major southwestern production region was destroyed , according to a Feb. 25 United States Department of Agriculture report .
There 's more bad news , Brown said : Because of the continued cold weather — 38 - degree temperatures were predicted Friday in some central Florida growing areas — the current crop of fruit is n't as far along as everyone had hoped .
" We thought they 'd recover by early April , but now it 's mid- April , " he said .
And because high demand has driven up domestic prices , many wholesalers are buying from Mexico instead .
" We 're obviously losing market share to Mexico , and there 's always a price to pay to get the customer to get back into the Florida market , " Brown said .
Florida is the only place where tomatoes are grown on a large scale in the U.S. during winter .
California does n't grow them until later in the year , and much of that state 's crop is used for processed foods , such as ketchup , sauce and juice .
Other states grow tomatoes in greenhouses year - round , but Florida 's winter tomato crop is by far the largest .
At Subway restaurants , the timing of this year 's shortage was fortuitous :
It hit right when the sandwich chain switches its tomato purchases from Florida to other regions .
While they so far have n't been impacted , managers are ordering different varieties of tomatoes to keep supplies steady , a spokesman said Thursday .
McDonald's , CKE Restaurants , ( which owns Hardees , Carl Jr. ) and Darden Restaurants ( the nation 's biggest casual dining chain , which owns Olive Garden , Red Lobster , Longhorn Steakhouse ; Capital Grille ; Seasons 52 ) said it 's business as usual and no shortages are being reported .
Some Wendy 's restaurants posted signs saying tomatoes would only be provided upon request because of limited availability .
But smaller restaurants are feeling the pinch .
In Chicago , where a hot dog is n't a hot dog without chopped tomatoes , you might end up with just a bit less on the bun .
" We 're a little more careful with our tomatoes , " admitted Bill Murphy , owner of Murphy 's Red Hots , which uses 75 to 100 pounds of the fruit a week .
" You still owe it to your customers to get them out there and get them on the dogs .
You try to get an extra piece out of every tomato if you can .
You do n't toss them around like they 're pennies , you toss them around like they 're quarters . "

Here are the seven key points of the coalition government 's spending cuts for 2010 - 2011 , set out by Chancellor George Osborne and Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws .
CUTS BY TYPE • £ 1.15 bn in " discretionary " areas such as consultancy and travel costs • £ 95 m through savings in IT spending • £ 1.7bn will be saved in delaying or stopping government contracts and projects • Reductions in property costs will save £ 170 m • More than £ 120 m expected to be found through a freeze in civil service recruitment • £ 600 m by cutting the cost of quangos • £ 520 m will be saved through other low - value spending CUTS BY DEPARTMENT Dept business : £ 836 m DCLG : £ 780 m Dept Transport : £ 683 m Education dept : £ 670 m
Dept work pensions : £ 535 m Chancellor 's Dept : £ 451 m Local govnt : £ 405 m Home Office : £ 367 m Mins of Justice : £ 325 m Devolved admins : £ 704 m DEFRA : £ 162 m Dept for Energy : £ 85 m Culture dept : £ 88 m Cabinet Office : £ 79 m Foreign Office : £ 55 m Law officers ' dept : £ 18 m
Since taking up their jobs at the Treasury Mr Osborne and Mr Laws have had discussions with the secretaries of state of each department .
They also sought advice from officials at the Treasury and Bank of England on whether these savings are viable .
It is the coalition government 's first move to tackle the UK's £ 156bn deficit , attempting to reduce any waste in Whitehall ahead of a spending review later in 2010 .
There will be more details as well - including on civil service pay - in an emergency Budget on 22 June .
IN MORE DETAIL : EDUCATION
The education department will have to make savings of £ 670 m but Mr Osborne said that schools ' funding , the Sure Start programme and spending on education for 16 - 19 - year - olds would be protected - something that was not in the Conservatives ' manifesto .
The 20,000 extra university places promised by the Labour government will be reduced to 10,000 .
By closing the quango British Educational Communications and Technology Agency ( Becta ) the government hopes to save £ 80 m .
CHILD TRUST FUNDS
There will be a reduction then end to Child Trust Funds , saving £ 320 m , with payments being stopped altogether in January 2011 .
From then , provisions will be made for an extra £ 20 m to provide respite care for disabled children .
CIVIL SERVICE
There will be a £ 190 m saving through a freeze on non-frontline civil service recruitment .
Any salary that is higher than the prime minister 's own will have to be approved by Mr Laws .
HEALTH , INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AND DEFENCE
Frontline services in these departments will be protected .
Any efficiency savings in these areas will be recycled within their own current budgets .
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government is expected to make a contribution of £ 1.165 bn through reductions to individual grants .
Ring - fencing to end for more than £ 1.7bn of grants given to local authorities so they can make their own cuts .
BUSINESS
The biggest of all the departmental cuts will be at the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills , totalling £ 836 m .
TRANSPORT
Spending at the Department of Transport will be reduced by £ 683 m .
By cutting grants to local authorities , the department will save £ 309 m .
Network Rail will have to find savings of £ 100 m .
In London , following discussions with Mayor Boris Johnson , £ 108 m could be cut from Transport for London 's grant .
WORK AND PENSIONS
The Department for Work and Pensions will make £ 535 m of cuts .
Of that , £ 200 m will be saved through reduced IT projects and consultancy , marketing , travel and a recruitment freeze .
The remaining £ 335 m comes from measures such as winding down , then cutting altogether , the Future Jobs Fund which will save £ 290 m .
The department will also stop the £ 1,000 subsidy for employers to take on anyone who has been out of work for six months .
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS
Ministers will no longer have dedicated ministerial cars and will be expected to walk , use public transport or pooled cars where possible .
DEVOLVED CUTS
The savings for all three devolved administrations in Edinburgh , Cardiff and Belfast will be £ 704 m .
This is a gross total , not taking into account any reinvestments or recycled savings .
In each case , the three can choose to defer the cuts until the next financial year .
For Wales , the cuts will total £ 187 m .
However , after £ 24 m is reinvested into the Welsh block grant , the actual figure will be £ 162.5 m .
The savings in Scotland are £ 375 m but this will be reduced to £ 332.8 m once £ 42.2 m is reinvested via the Scottish block grant .
Northern Ireland 's gross cut is £ 142 m which , after £ 14 m is reinvested through the block grant system , will actually be £ 128 m .
WHO WILL OVERSEE THE CUTS ?
A new board , called the Efficiency and Reform Group , is being set up to oversee departmental cuts .
It will be chaired jointly by Mr Laws and Cabinet Minister Francis Maude and include civil servants from across Whitehall .

PICTURE a Hollywood agent powering to a power lunch .
“ Entourage ” has done it for us : an expensive convertible , an iPhone and dialogue devoted equally to schmoozing and screaming .
But for Erwin More , an actual talent agent whose clients include film and television actors whose names you ’d recognize in a second , traveling for work is closer to a clip from “ Roman Holiday . ”
He rides his Vespa through the midsection of Los Angeles every sunny workday , from his home in manicured Hancock Park to the Paradigm Agency ’s offices in Beverly Hills .
And when he has to take in a meeting outside the area , Mr. More is far less likely to climb into his automobile than he is to strap on a helmet and rev up his scooter , an LXV 150 .
“ About three years ago , I accidentally - on - purpose mentioned to my wife that I wanted a Vespa , and she surprised me at Christmas , ” said Mr. More , 52 .
“ I love it .
It was a life - changing experience .
On paper , the friendly might seem like a meaningless fixture in a cluttered schedule for New York .
But Sunday afternoon ’s 3 - 1 victory over Juventus may have meant the world to the home side .
Losers of three straight in league play , the match against this storied team was an opportunity for the Red Bulls to get the bad taste of their recent string of results out of their mouth .
But the fact that New York held their own , knocked the ball around and created chances was as encouraging as the victory .
It was an entertaining end - to - end affair .
Greg Sutton was busy in goal , making five saves .
The Red Bulls fielded mainly reserves , their starters in the friendly combining for just 17 starts in league play this season .
Juventus ' best chance of the first half came in the 41st minute when Alessandro Del Piero , streaking down the left side of the field , banged a shot that beat Sutton in goal , but rattled off the post .
The effort seemed to awaken New York .
Three minutes later , a patient build - up by the Red Bulls almost produced a goal for the home side .
Near the top of the box , Jeremy Hall fed John Wolyniec , who fed a diagonal ball across the box to Conor Chinn .
Trapping the ball neatly , Chinn was able to get off a nice shot that forced Juventus keeper Alex Manninger into a save .
Whatever head coach Hans Backe said in the Red Bulls locker room at the half must have worked , but the result was a clear response from the team .
In the 50th minute , a poor Juve clearance fell to Irving Garcia about 25 yards from goal .
Lining up his shot , Garcia hit an immaculate laser that swerved past Manninger and pinged off the post .
The rebound then fell to Jeremy Hall at the edge of the six - yard box who slotted home a shot past the sprawled out Juve ' keeper .
“ It may have been the best shot I ’ve ever had that did n’t go in , ” Garcia said after the match .
“ Mainly because it was against Juventus . ”
Five minutes later , Roy Miller moved into the attacking third and hit a beautiful cross into the box directly into the path of a streaking Chinn .
The rookie forward took one touch and powered a shot directly into the back of the net .
As the Juventus fans began to head to the exits , one last explosion of cheers from the New York fans came in the 75th minute .
From his central position , Sinisa Ubiparipovic played a ball wide to second - half substitute Dane Richards on the right wing .
The speedy Jamaican winger then sent a centering pass along the ground to a wide open Juan Pablo Angel , also a second - half insertion , who hit the back of a wide - open net .
An Amauri goal on the stroke of stoppage time gave the visitors some consolation in a match in which they were clearly bested by their hosts .
“ This is a good game for us , ” defender Carlos Mendes told MLSsoccer.com .
" Good to win any game , but especially when you ’re playing a great team like we did today . "

Esaw Wood would saw wood !
All the wood Esaw Wood saw Esaw Wood would saw .
In other words , all the wood Esaw saw to saw Esaw sought to saw .
Oh , the wood Wood would saw !
And oh , the wood - saw with which Wood would saw wood .
But one day Wood ’s wood - saw would saw no wood , and thus the wood Wood sawed was not the wood Wood would saw if Wood ’s wood - saw would saw wood .
Now , Wood would saw wood with a wood - saw that would saw wood , so Esaw sought a saw that would saw wood .
One day Esaw saw a saw saw wood as no other wood - saw Wood saw would saw wood .
In fact , of all the wood - saws Wood ever saw saw wood Wood never saw a wood - saw that would saw wood as the wood - saw Wood saw saw wood would saw wood , and I never saw a wood - saw that would saw as the wood - saw Wood saw would saw until I saw Esaw Wood saw wood with the wood - saw Wood saw saw wood .
Now Wood saws wood with the wood - saw Wood saw saw wood .
Oh , the wood the wood - saw Wood saw would saw !
Oh , the wood Wood ’s woodshed would shed when Wood would saw wood with the wood - saw Wood saw saw wood !
Finally , no man may ever know how much wood the wood - saw Wood saw would saw , if the wood - saw Wood saw would saw all the wood the wood - saw Wood saw would saw .

Funerals for the victims are due to be held over the weekend
A black box voice recording from the Polish jet which crashed in Russia shows the pilots knew they were about to crash , Polish officials say .
Polish chief prosecutor Andrzej Seremet said it was clear the crew knew disaster was " inevitable " after the plane hit tree - tops .
A Russian source said there was no evidence the pilots were pushed by their VIP passengers into taking risks .
Poland 's president and numerous other top figures died in Saturday 's crash .
The bodies of Lech Kaczynski and his wife Maria were the first to be repatriated from Russia .
The crew was aware of the inevitability of the coming catastrophe , if only due to the plane shaking after the wings hit the trees
Andrzej Seremet
Polish chief prosecutor Poland , which is in national mourning all of this week , received the remains of 35 other victims on Thursday , including those of Ryszard Kaczorowski , the last leader of Poland 's government - in - exile during the period of communist rule .
In all , 67 of the 96 victims have been brought back from Russia .
Most of the remains , believed to be badly disfigured and burnt , were taken to Moscow for identification shortly after the crash in the western region of Smolensk .
Mr Kaczynski and his wife are to be given a state funeral in the city of Krakow on Sunday , with world leaders including US President Barack Obama set to attend .
However , Poles are divided over whether the late leader , whose popularity ratings had fallen sharply , should be interred in Krakow 's Wawel Cathedral , a site traditionally reserved for Poland 's kings and heroes .
' Dramatic ' seconds Russian investigators , who have been working in conjunction with their Polish counterparts , said soon after the crash that the jet 's pilots had disregarded repeated warnings from Russian air traffic controllers to land at an alternative airport because of heavy fog at Smolensk .
The wreckage of the jet has been removed for further examination Some have suggested the crew were under pressure to land regardless because they were carrying their passengers to a memorial at nearby Katyn , where Stalin 's secret police massacred Polish military officers during World War II .
A senior Russian aviation official , Tatyana Anodina , said on Thursday that the plane only tried to land once - not up to four times as previously reported .
An unnamed source close to the investigation in Moscow also told Russia 's Interfax news agency that no evidence had been found in the flight recorders that " any of the high - ranking passengers forced the pilots to land near Smolensk " .
" The panel 's analysis , namely data from the black boxes , shows that it was the pilot 's mistake that caused the crash , " the source added .
Poland 's chief military prosecutor , Krzysztof Parulski , rejected the Russian report as " speculation " and warned that it was too early to draw any conclusions since the investigation was still ongoing .
Mr Seremet , for his part , told Polish radio :
" The crew was aware of the inevitability of the coming catastrophe , if only due to the plane shaking after the wings hit the trees - which we are certain happened . "
Col Zbigniew Rzepa , a Polish military prosecutor , said the pilots had been aware of the imminent crash as the last seconds of the voice recordings " were dramatic " .
He did not elaborate .
One of the three black boxes on the Soviet - built Tu-154 Polish government jet has been returned to Poland while the other two are being examined in Moscow , Polish prosecutors ' spokesman Jerzy Artymiak said .
Mr Artymiak said investigators had hoped to disclose the contents of the black boxes officially on Thursday but would wait until after the weekend 's funerals .
A state funeral for those killed along with the presidential couple is due to be held on Saturday .

Think Again : The Internet
“ The Internet Has Been a Force for Good ”
No .
In the days when the Internet was young , our hopes were high .
As with any budding love affair , we wanted to believe our newfound object of fascination could change the world .
The Internet was lauded as the ultimate tool to foster tolerance , destroy nationalism , and transform the planet into one great wired global village .
Writing in 1994 , a group of digital aficionados led by Esther Dyson and Alvin Toffler published a manifesto modestly subtitled “ A Magna Carta for the Knowledge Age ” that promised the rise of “ ‘ electronic neighborhoods ’ bound together not by geography but by shared interests . ”
Nicholas Negroponte , then the famed head of the MIT MediaLab , dramatically predicted in 1997 that the Internet would shatter borders between nations and usher in a new era of world peace .
Well , the Internet as we know it has now been around for two decades , and it has certainly been transformative .
The amount of goods and services available online is staggering .
Communicating across borders is simpler than ever : Hefty international phone bills have been replaced by inexpensive subscriptions to Skype , while Google Translate helps readers navigate Web pages in Spanish , Mandarin , Maltese , and more than 40 other languages .
But just as earlier generations were disappointed to see that neither the telegraph nor the radio delivered on the world - changing promises made by their most ardent cheerleaders , we have n’t seen an Internet - powered rise in global peace , love , and liberty .
And we ’re not likely to .
Many of the transnational networks fostered by the Internet arguably worsen — rather than improve — the world as we know it .
At a recent gathering devoted to stamping out the illicit trade in endangered animals , for instance , the Internet was singled out as the main driver behind the increased global commerce in protected species .
Today ’s Internet is a world where homophobic activists in Serbia are turning to Facebook to organize against gay rights , and where social conservatives in Saudi Arabia are setting up online equivalents of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice .
So much for the “ freedom to connect ” lauded by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her much - ballyhooed speech on the Internet and human rights .
Sadly enough , a networked world is not inherently a more just world .
Twitter Will Undermine Dictators .
# Wrong .
Tweets do n’t overthrow governments ; people do .
And what we ’ve learned so far is that social networking sites can be both helpful and harmful to activists operating from inside authoritarian regimes .
Cheerleaders of today ’s rapidly proliferating virtual protests point out that online services such as Twitter , Flickr , and YouTube have made it much easier to circulate information that in the past had been strictly controlled by the state — especially gruesome photos and videos and evidence of abuses by police and the courts .
Think of the Burmese dissidents who distributed cell - phone photos documenting how police suppressed protests , or opposition bloggers in Russia who launched Shpik .info as a Wikipedia - like site that allows anyone to upload photos , names , and contact details of purported “ enemies of democracy ” — judges , police officers , even some politicians — who are complicit in muzzling free speech .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown famously declared last year that the Rwandan genocide would have been impossible in the age of Twitter .
But does more information really translate into more power to right wrongs ?
Not necessarily .
Neither the Iranian nor the Burmese regime has crumbled under the pressure of pixelated photos of human rights abuses circulated on social networking sites .
Indeed , the Iranian authorities have been as eager to take advantage of the Internet as their green - clad opponents .
After last year ’s protests in Tehran , Iranian authorities launched a website that publishes photos from the protests , urging the public to identify the unruly protesters by name .
Relying on photos and videos uploaded to Flickr and YouTube by protesters and their Western sympathizers , the secret police now have a large pool of incriminating evidence .
Neither Twitter nor Facebook provides the security required for asuccessful revolution , and they might even serve as an early warning system for authoritarian rulers .
Had East Germans been tweeting about their feelings in1989 , who knows what the Stasi would have done to shut down dissent ?
Even when Twitter and Facebook do help score partial victories , a betting man would n’t put odds on the same trick working twice .
Take the favorite poster child of digital utopians :
In early 2008 a Facebook group started by a 33 - year - old Colombian engineer culminated in massive protests , with up to 2 million people marching in Bogotá ’s streets to demonstrate against the brutality of Marxist FARC rebels .
( A New York Times article about the protests gushed : “ Facebook has helped bring public protest to Colombia , a country with no real history of mass demonstrations . ” )
However , when the very same “ digital revolutionaries ” last September tried to organize a similar march against Venezuelan leader and FARC sponsor Hugo Chávez , they floundered .
The reasons why follow - up campaigns fail often have nothing to do with Facebook or Twitter , and everything to do with the more general problems of organizing and sustaining a political movement .
Internet enthusiasts argue that the Web has made organizing easier .
But this is only partially true ; taking full advantage of online organizing requires a well - disciplined movement with clearly defined goals , hierarchies , and operational procedures ( think of Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign ) .
But if a political movement is disorganized and unfocused , the Internet might onlyexpose and publicize its vulnerabilities and ratchet up the rancor ofinternecine conflicts .
This , alas , sounds much like Iran ’s disorganized green movement .
Google Defends Internet Freedom .
Only when convenient .
If the world ’s human rights community had to choose its favorite Fortune 500 company , Google — the world ’s overwhelming leader in Internet search and a trendsetter in everything from global mapping to social networking – would be a top contender .
Decrying the Chinese government ’s censorship demands , Google recently decided to move its Chinese search engine to Hong Kong and promised to spare no effort to protect identities of Chinese dissidents who use Gmail .
Much of the Western world applauded , as Google seemed to live up to its “ do n’t be evil ” corporate motto .
Let ’s remember that Google , like any company , is motivated by profit rather than some higher purpose :
The company entered China not to spread the gospel of Internet freedom , but to sell ads in what is now the world ’s largest online market .
Only four years after agreeing to censor its search results did it refuse to do so any longer .
Yet had it managed to make greater inroads among Chinese consumers , does anyone doubt that its decision to defy Beijing would have been much more difficult ?
Sometimes Google really does operate on principle .
In early March , Google executives held a joint event with Freedom House , bringing bloggers from the Middle East to Washington to participate in a series of talks on such topics as “ digital media ’s power in social movements ” and “ political parties and elections 2.0 . ”
Last summer , Google stood up to protect Cyxymu , a Georgian blogger who found himself the target of intense cyberattacks — supposedly from Russian nationalists unhappywith his take on the 2008 Russia - Georgia war — by keeping his Google - hosted blog online .
Following the incident , the company ’s public - policy blog even boasted of Google ’s commitment to “ giving a voice to ‘ digital refugees . ' ”
But the company ’s reputation as a defender of Internet freedom is decidedly mixed .
For example , its Internet filtering process in Thailand — driven by the country ’s strict laws against insulting the monarchy — is not particularly transparent and draws much criticism from the country ’s netizens .
In India , Google faces understandable government pressure to remove extremist and nationalist content from Orkut , its social networking site ; yet some Indian critics charge that Google is overzealous in its self - censorship because it fears losing access to the vast Indian market .
Google ’s defense of Internet freedom is , ultimately , a pragmatically principled stance , with the rules often applied on a case - by - case basis .
It would be somewhat naive — and , perhaps , even dangerous — to expect Google to become the new Radio Free Europe .

The Internet Makes Governments More Accountable .
Not necessarily .
Many Internet enthusiasts on both sides of the Atlantic who were previously uninterested in policy debates have eagerly taken on the challenge of playing government watchdog , spending days and nights digitizing public data and uploading it into online databases .
From Britain ’s TheyWorkforYou to Kenya ’s Mzalendo to various projects affiliated with the U.S. - based Sunlight Foundation such as MAPLight.org , a host of new independent websites has begun monitoring parliamentary activity , with some even offering comparisons between parliamentarians ’ voting records and campaign promises .
But have such efforts resulted in better or more honest politics ?
The results , so far , are quite mixed .
Even the most idealistic geeks are beginning to understand that entrenched political and institutional pathologies — not technological shortfalls — are the greatest barriers to more open and participatory politics .
Technology does n’t necessarily pry more information from closed regimes ; rather , it allows more people access to information that is available .
Governments still maintain great sway in determining what kinds of data to release .
So far , even the Obama administration , the self - proclaimed champion of “ open government , ” draws criticism from transparency groups for releasing information about population counts for horses and burros while hoarding more sensitive data on oil and gas leases .
And even when the most detailed data get released , it does not always lead to reformed policies , as Lawrence Lessig pointed out in his trenchant New Republic cover story last year .
Establishing meaningful connections between information , transparency , and accountability will require more than just tinkering with spreadsheets ; it will require building healthy democratic institutions and effective systems of checks and balances .
The Internet can help , but only to an extent :
It ’s political will , not more info , that is still too often missing .
The Internet Boosts Political Participation .
Define it .
The Internet has certainly created new avenues for exchanging opinions and ideas , but we do n’t yet know whether this will boost the global appeal and practice of democracy .
Where some see a renewal of civic engagement , others see “ slacktivism , ” the new favorite pejorative for the shallow , peripheral , and fluid political campaigning that seems to thrive on the Internet — sometimes at the expense of more effective real - world campaigning .
And where some applaud new online campaigns purportedly aimed at increasing civic participation , such as Estonia ’s planned 2011 launch of voting via text - messaging , others , myself included , doubt whether the hassle of showing up at a polling place once every two or four years is really what makes disengaged citizens avoid the political process .
The debate over the Internet ’s impact on participation echoes a much earlier controversy about the ambiguous social and political effects of cable television .
Long before blogs were invented , scholars and pundits were arguing over whether the boob tube was turning voters into passive , apolitical entertainment maniacs who , when given greater choice , favored James Bond flicks and Happy Days reruns over nightly news broadcasts — or whether it was turning them into hyperactive , obsessive citizens who watch C - SPAN nonstop .
The argument then , and now , was that American - style democracy was turning into niche markets for politics , with the entertainment - obsessed masses opting out , on TV and at the polling booth , and news junkies looking for ever - quicker fixes in the sped - up news cycle .
The Internet is cable television on steroids ; both tuning in and tuning out of political discourse have never been easier .
Another danger is that even the news we read will come increasingly from selective sources , such as our Facebook friends , which might decrease the range of views to which we ’re exposed .
Three - quarters of Americans who consume their news online say they receive at least some of it through forwarded emails or posts on social networking sites , according to a 2010 study by the Pew Research Center ’s Internet & American Life Project .
Presently , less than 10 percent of Americans report relying on just one media platform .
But that could easily change as traditional news sources lose market share to the Web .
The Internet Is Killing Foreign News .
Only if we let it .
You wo n’t hear this from most Western news organizations , which today are fighting for their financial survival andclosing foreign bureaus , but we ’ve never had faster access to more world news than we do today .
Aggregators like Google News might be disrupting the business models of CNN and the New York Times , forcing substantial cutbacks in one particularly costly form of news - gathering — foreign correspondents — but they have also equalized the playing field for thousands of niche and country - specific news sources , helping them to reach global audiences .
How many people would be reading AllAfrica.com or the Asia Times Online were it not for Google News ?
While we decry the Internet ’s role in destroying the business model that supported old - school foreign reporting , we should also celebrate the Web ’s unequivocally positive effects on the quality of research about global affairs done today on the periphery of the news business .
The instantaneous fact - checking , ability to continuously follow a story from multiple sources , and extensive newspaper archives that are now freely available were unimaginable even 15 years ago .
The real danger in the changing face of foreign news is the absence of intelligent and respected moderators .
The Internet may be a paradise for well - informed news junkies , but it is a confusing news junkyard for the rest of us .
Even fairly sophisticated readers might not know the difference between the Global Times , a nationalist Chinese daily produced under the auspices of the Communist Party , and the Epoch Times , another China - related daily published by the Falun Gong dissident group .
The Internet Brings Us Closer Together .
No .
Geography still matters .
In her best - selling 1997 book , The Death of Distance , the Economist ‘s then senior editor Frances Cairncross predicted that the Internet - powered communications revolution would “ increase understanding , foster tolerance , and ultimately promote worldwide peace . ”
But pronouncing the death of distance was premature .
Even in a networked world , the hunger for consumer goods and information is still taste - dependent , and location remains a fairly reliable proxy for taste .
A 2006 study published in the Journal of International Economics , for instance , found that for certain digital products — such as music , games , and pornography — each 1 percent increase in physical distance from the United States reduced by 3.25 percent the number of visits an American would make to a particular website .
Not only user preferences , but also government and corporate actions — motivated as often by cost and copyright as by political agendas — might mean the end of the era of the single Internet .
That is to say , the days in which everyone can visit the same websites regardless of geographic location might be waning , even in the “ free ” world .
We are seeing more attempts , mostly by corporations and their lawyers , to keep foreign nationals off certain Web properties .
For instance , digital content that is available to Brits via the BBC ’s innovative iPlayer is increasingly unavailable to Germans .
Norwegians can already access 50,000 copyrighted books online for free through the country ’s Bookshelfinitiative , but one has to be in Norway to do so — the government is footing the annual $ 900,000 bill for licensing fees and does n’t plan to subsidize the rest of the world .
Moreover , many celebrated Internet pioneers — Google , Twitter , Facebook — are U.S. companies that other governments increasingly fear as political agents .
Chinese , Cuban , Iranian , and even Turkish politicians are already talking up “ information sovereignty ” — a euphemism for replacing services provided by Western Internet companies with their own more limited but somewhat easier to control products , further splintering the World Wide Web into numerous national Internets .
The age of the Splinternet beckons .
Two decades in , the Internet has neither brought down dictators nor eliminated borders .
It has certainly not ushered in a post - political age of rational and data - driven policymaking .
It has sped up and amplified many existing forces atwork in the world , often making politics more combustible and unpredictable .
Increasingly , the Internet looks like a hypercharged version of the real world , with all of its promise and perils , while the cyber utopia that the early Web enthusiasts predicted seems ever more illusory .
On Saturday , Dec. 9 , 2006 , Hannah * woke up in her Howard University dorm room with a piece of her life missing .
Hannah , a 19 - year - old sophomore , had unexplained pain in her rectum and hip .
Her panty liner , which she had worn the night before , was missing .
Vomit dotted her gloves and coat .
Her friend Kerston lay beside her in the skinny dorm room bed .
Kerston told Hannah not to shower — they had to go back to the hospital to secure a rape kit .
That weekend , Hannah claims that she was provided the following excuses for why she could not receive a sexual assault medical forensic examination :
She was drunk ; she ate a sandwich ; she was a liar ; she did n’t know her attacker ’s last name ; the police had to authorize the exam ; she was outside the hospital ’s jurisdiction ; she was n’t reporting a real crime ; she was blacked out ; she changed her story ; her case was already closed .
This is the story of the night Hannah was not officially raped .
And so far , Hannah has not officially accused anyone of raping her .
In the summer of 2007 , she filed a lawsuit against the District of Columbia , Howard University Hospital , George Washington University Hospital , both universities , and several doctors she says denied or interfered with her medical care .
She seeks damages for medical malpractice and negligence from the medical defendants and the D.C. police , which she says resulted in “ the probable loss of the opportunity to see her assailant brought to justice . ”
Across the board , the defendants denied Hannah ’s claims .
The parties in the case , which has yet to go to trial , were not interviewed for this story ; this account is reconstructed from sworn deposition testimony taken in Hannah ’s suit .
It was a Friday night in the middle of finals , the end of the first semester of sophomore year .
Some Howard guys who lived in an off - campus house on Bryant Street were throwing an off - campus birthday party for Daniel , a friend of Hannah’s .
She convinced a couple of friends to come with her .
They pre-gamed in Hannah ’s friend Sade ’s room , sipped on cups of Malibu mixed with fruit punch , and then walked the half - mile to the house .
There , Hannah , Sade , and Kerston engaged in normal college party activities — they filled their cups with red spiked punch from the Gatorade containers in the kitchen , danced in the darkened living room , and chatted on the couch in the middle of the house .
Amanda , another friend from school , arrived later and joined the group .
They all obeyed the Howard boys ’ house rule : Nobody goes upstairs .
Enforcing the directive was Tito , a big , muscular guy who grew up in the shadow of the university .
Hannah had seen Tito around campus before .
They met through her older sister , a bank employee and Howard grad six years her senior .
Tito testified that he met Hannah ’s sister when she sprained her ankle playing tennis and took an ambulance to the hospital .
Tito , the EMT who responded to the scene , managed to secure her number on the ride , and they went out a few times .
When Hannah started school at Howard , Tito introduced himself to her , gave her a ride home from the movies once , and hit on some of her friends .
Tito had worked security at area nightclubs when he was n’t on duty , and he sometimes volunteered his services to Howard house parties .
At the Bryant Street party , he stood inside the door , screened kids for drugs and knives , and stopped anyone who tried to mount the stairs .
As reinforcement for Tito , the housemates had erected a furniture barricade at the foot of stairs — a few chairs stacked together to prevent partygoers from sneaking up to the second floor .
Brandon , one of the Howard boys hosting the party , told partygoers that he had blocked off the stairs because the bathroom was n’t working .
Actually , the toilet was fine — Brandon was so fastidious about protecting his stuff that he blocked off the house ’s only toilet .
Guests were forced to pee at another party across the street , or in the alley behind the house .
A couple of hours of partying later , the music started to slow down , the lights turned on , and the girls decided it was time to go .
By then , it was early morning .
In a deposition , Hannah testified that she was dancing with Bilal , a Howard student who lived with Brandon in the house .
When Hannah woke up the next day , this is the last thing she would remember : “ He was getting a little rough , and I remember trying to kind of just get away from him , ” she recalled in the deposition .
“ I remember I tried to stop dancing with him .
…[ There was ] a little too much of sexual suggestion .… just touching me too much . ”
She started to feel blurry , woozy , dizzy , “ and then nothing . ”
As the party wound down , Kerston , Sade , and Amanda briefly left the room to retrieve the crew ’s coats .
When they returned to the living room , the girls testified that Hannah and Bilal were gone .
They called her cell phone .
She did n’t pick up .
They looked for her around the first floor of the house , on the stoop , in the back alley .
She was n’t there .
They asked other students at the party if they had seen her .
They had n’t .
They start calling her name .
No response .
After looking for her for several minutes , there was only one place she could be .
“ So I go to the steps , ” Sade testified in a deposition .
“ I move [ the barricade ] , ” she said .
“ I ’m walking up the steps , and Tito like just comes behind me .
He grabs my arm…and he literally like brings me back down the steps .
… And I ’m like get off me , what are you talking about ? ”
The three girls gathered around Tito and told them they were just looking for their friend ;
Tito explained that he ’d been hired to keep people from reaching the second floor .
At first , the girls had suspected that Hannah had just gone upstairs to use the restroom , but after a few minutes of arguing with Tito , they grew more concerned .
“ So at this point like I ’m mad , ” Sade testified .
“ At this point we ’re yelling .
I do n’t know what I ’m saying exactly , but I ’m yelling . ”
The girls began screaming Hannah ’s name up the stairs , hoping she ’d hear them and come down .
She did n’t .
After five minutes of yelling , the girls insisted that Tito go up the stairs to look for her himself .
Tito testified that he climbed the stairs , saw an empty bathroom and some locked bedroom doors — but no Hannah — and reoccupied his post at the foot of the stairs .
When he returned , “ he was sweating , ” Kerston testified .
“ I remember him taking off his hat and rubbing , like wiping his forehead and he was just like shaking his head .
… Just sitting there , sweating . ”
In her deposition , Sade testified , “ Tito looked nervous , like he knew that something was going on that should n’t have been going on , ” she said .
“ I know Tito knew her before this , so maybe his conscience was getting to him or something .
… Why are you acting this funny about a bathroom ? ”
The girls started screaming again .
“ At this point I know she could hear us , if she was in the bathroom , ” Kerston testified .
“ So she would have came down the stairs by now .
We were yelling her name , we were yelling at him to bring her down , I mean she would ’ve — she would ’ve came downstairs by now . ”
Then , Brandon came running down the stairs swearing at them to leave his house .
“ He came past Tito and he was like in our , like close to our faces , yelling at us , ” Kerston testified .
“ He was telling us to get out of his house , and we were like , ‘ No , we ’re not leaving without our friend , ’ so we did n’t leave . ”
In a deposition taken two years later , Brandon testified that he could n’t recall the specifics of the interaction .
According to the testimony of the three girls , Tito then changed his story .
“ He said , ‘ Oh , she ’s coming , ’ ” Amanda said .
“ Well , first he told me she was n’t up there .
I knew he was lying . ”
Testified Sade , “ They were acting way too nervous , and they really wanted to get us out , like they were very persistent about getting us out of there , and there ’s no reason for that if everything is fine and my friend is just using the bathroom , ” she said .
“ It does n’t take that long to use the restroom . ”
Finally , Hannah appeared at the top of the staircase .
“ She looked drunk , like her eyes were closed , ” Amanda testified .
“ She could n’t really walk .
She was trying to hold her balance down the steps .
She was walking slow . ”
The girls , Tito , and Brandon watched her descend the stairs .
“ She looked very unaware of what was going on .
She just looked out of it , ” Sade said .
“ She was fixing herself , but she was n’t fixed when she got done , you know ?
… She looked like she did n’t know what she was doing . ”
The girls took Hannah by the arms , helped her into her coat , and led her slumped figure out of the house .
The girls testified that Hannah had consumed a limited amount of alcohol at the party , and they could n’t figure out why she seemed so drunk .
“ I ’m just like what ’s wrong , like what ’s wrong with you , ” Sade testified .
“ She just sort of mumbled , ‘ah , ah , ah , ah . ’ ” The girls got about half a block down the street , grilling her all the way , before Hannah managed to indicate that someone had touched her while she was upstairs .
Then she threw up orange - red vomit all over the sidewalk .
Sade kept her grip on Hannah ; Kerston and Amanda headed back to the house and banged on the boys ’ door .
Brandon and Bilal were downstairs .
“ It was a yelling match , ” Amanda testified .
“ Like ‘ Where is — what happened to our friend , and what did you all do , ’ ” she said .
According to the girls ’ testimony , the boys screamed at them to get away .
The girls threatened to call the cops , and demanded to know who took Hannah upstairs .
“ Adam Joseph , ” the boys told them , before slamming the door in their faces .
The girls later discovered that the two remaining Bryant Street housemates were not at the party that night — one with the first name “ Adam ” and the other with the last name “ Joseph . ”
Down the street , Hannah vomited incessantly onto the sidewalk .
“ She was too out of it to know where she even was , ” Sade said .
“ And she looked sad . ”
When Kerston and Sade returned , the girls verbalized their suspicions .
“ I think she ’s been raped , Sade , ” Kerston said .
“ We need to go to the hospital .
… She might have been like — she might have been drugged . ”
The girls headed toward the hospital .
Hannah threw up again .
They stopped a Howard University student shuttle , hopped in , and instructed the driver to take them to the hospital .
Hannah threw up while getting into the shuttle .
Inside , “ she was just leaning to the side , ” testified Sade , “ she was like awake but not really there . ”
They exited the shuttle .
She threw up again .
They entered the Howard University emergency room around 3:30 in the morning .
Hannah threw up .
“ We think she ’s been raped , ” Kerston and Sade informed an orderly as they dragged her into the hospital .
Hospital officials handed Sade some paperwork to fill out on Hannah ’s behalf .
In the box indicating the reason for the ER visit , Sade testifies that she wrote , “ raped , possibly drugged . ”
A nurse sat Hannah down and took her blood pressure .
Hannah threw up on the floor .
Kerston and Sade helped to clean it up off of the ground .
The nurse put a vomit bag in Hannah ’s hands .
She was incoherent and barely conscious .
She threw up into the bag .
According to the girls ’ testimony , when a doctor finally saw Hannah , she determined that she was too incoherent to consent to receive a rape kit , because she could n’t verbally confirm that she had been raped .
According to the girls , the doctor told them to take Hannah home , let her sleep it off , make sure she did n’t shower , and then return to Howard University Hospital for a rape kit the next day .
When the girls begged the doctor to treat Hannah ’s symptoms of sexual assault and drugging , the girls claim that the doctor told them to leave the ER .
( The doctor testified that she informed Hannah ’s friends that they would have to wait six to eight hours before Hannah was treated , and that the girls chose to leave the hospital without treatment ) .
When Kerston and Sade took Hannah back to her dorm , she threw up again .

A standard rape kit includes the following materials for collecting evidence from a rape victim ’s body : swabs for collecting fluids from the lips , cheeks , thighs , vagina , anus , and buttocks ; clear glass slides ; a comb used to collect hair and fiber from the victim ’s body ; a nail pick for scraping debris from beneath the nails ; white sheets to catch the physical evidence stripped from the body ; envelopes for preserving the victim ’s clothes , head hair , pubic hair , and blood samples ; labels for all the evidence .
But more than what ’s in the box , a rape kit is a system , a protocol followed in order to streamline the city services deployed in the wake of a sexual assault — including medical care , police investigation , and rape crisis counseling .
The contents of the kit are standard - issue hardware for any hospital emergency room .
But in Washington , D.C. , a rape kit can sometimes be hard to come by .
In 2000 , the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner ( SANE ) program was established at Howard University Hospital in order to facilitate care for the city ’s rape victims .
Before SANE , the District ’s sexual assault survivors were encouraged to report to the OB - GYN section of D.C. General Hospital .
According to Denise Snyder , executive director of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center ( DCRCC ) , rape survivors often waited in the D.C. General ER for up to 12 hours while the OB - GYNs attended to more immediate emergencies , like births .
When the kits — which can take hours to complete — were finally initiated , the residents administering them were n’t experts in medical forensic exams .
Some of the residents were so inexperienced that they would have to read the instructions off the back of the box while performing the invasive exam ; as non-experts , they also made for shoddy witnesses at trial .
The SANE program was meant to solve all of these problems .
The program gives sexual assault survivors access to nurses who are specifically trained in performing medical forensic exams .
If the victim consents to an investigation , the program alerts local police of the assault .
It ensures that the completed rape kit is entered into a proper chain of custody to prevent evidence from being corrupted .
It provides the victim an expert witness to testify at her trial .
It gives her the option of taking STD prophylactics and emergency contraception .
And it provides a rape crisis advocate to help provide emotional support throughout the hospital and police processes .
But when the DCRCC secured grants to fund the SANE program a decade ago , Snyder had trouble finding a hospital that was interested in hosting such services .
In an interview , Snyder said that she contacted “ all the major hospitals in the city ” looking for one that would take it on .
Some hospitals refused to even respond to her .
Some voiced “ economic concerns about how much of a drain it would be , ” Snyder said .
Others were more concerned with image : “ One hospital ’s response literally was , ‘ We do n’t want to be the rape hospital , ’ ” Snyder says .
Finally , Howard University Hospital agreed to host the program , providing local rape victims a greater chance of seeking justice from their attackers .
But once the program was established at Howard , rape victims encountered another problem :
All victims would have to receive police authorization before receiving an examination .
“ It ’s not just the hospitals who are skittish about being associated with rape , ” says Snyder .
“ This is one of the greatest struggles we experience with law enforcement :
The pressure on law enforcement is to always get their numbers down .
But with sexual assault , seeing higher numbers should often be interpreted as a positive sign , if it means that more women are feeling comfortable to step up and say , ‘ I was raped , and I demand justice . ’ ”
Snyder says she ’s encountered many cases in D.C. where “ the police ’s assessment of what happened did not match up with what the survivor said happened , ” she says .
“ For a sexual assault survivor who has already experienced an intense violation , to have your governmental system essentially say to you , ‘ This did n’t happen , if it did happen it does n’t really count , ’ is devastating . ”

Each year , D.C. police report a handful of rape cases as “ unfounded ” — meaning that after an investigation into a rape allegation , it is determined that no crime actually occurred .
But D.C. ’s record of unfounded cases does n’t include all the sexual assault allegations that are dismissed without so much as a report , nevermind an investigation .
According to MPD officer Tandreia Green , who was deposed in Hannah ’s case , the police department will often quickly determine whether a rape allegation has “ ground basis for furthering their investigation ” or not .
If it does n’t , Green testified that she wo n’t take a report at all and will abandon the case with no paperwork .
Of all the sexual assault complaints to which Green has responded , she testified that “ probably half ” ended in the determination that no police report would be filed .
What kinds of allegations are discarded without an investigation ?
Detective Elgin Wheeler , who joined the Sexual Assault Unit in 2006 and was also deposed in Hannah ’s case , provided the example of the “ evangelist computer . ”
According to Wheeler ’s testimony , one woman reporting an assault to the SAU claimed that she had been attacked by “ a spiritual computer ” which , “ once you type on it , the images jump off the computer and jump onto you which sexually assaults you , ” Wheeler said .
“ She walked away and had , quote , hot semen running down her leg . … the reason why she was at the hospital was because she woke up and she had , quote , balls of fire on her pubic hair .
So I do n’t go out for that . ”
Detective Vincent Spriggs , who spent 14 years with the Sexual Assault Unit and was deposed in Hannah ’s case , can rattle off a handful of rape allegations that did n’t call for a serious investigation from the SAU .
In one case , Spriggs testified , “ A young lady was found .
She was nude ,
As a matter of fact , in the middle of the street .
It was learned that she was actually high on PCP and was never touched . ”
Then , there was the alleged victim who framed her sex partner because she was “ just pissed at him ” ; the woman who was “ trying to get a boyfriend in trouble ” ; the kid who was “ trying to get out of trouble with their parents ” ; the wife who had “ gone over to someone ’s house and … needed an explanation to get back in the house without getting into trouble with their husband ” ; the woman who had unprotected sex and “ used [ the rape kit request ] in order to have a pregnancy test done or the morning after pill administered , ” Spriggs testified .
And then there was Hannah ’s case .
Green ,
Wheeler , and Spriggs were all involved in the D.C. police response to Hannah ’s rape allegation , and all contributed in the decision to abandon her case without completing a sexual assault allegation report .

When Hannah woke up the night after the party , Kerston called Sade and filled her in on Hannah ’s condition .
“ She ’s really just confused but really mad that she ’s confused , and even more mad that like we ’re like , ‘ we think you ’ve been raped , ’ and the fact she ca n’t sit down and it hurt , ” Sade testified that Kerston told her over the phone .
But Hannah decided to return to Howard University Hospital to get the rape kit she had been promised .
When Hannah arrived back at Howard , she was limping from the pain in her rectum and hip and nursing an upset stomach .
She had not showered , eaten , brushed her teeth , or defecated .
“ I told them that I had been raped , and that I needed to receive a sex kit , ” Hannah testified .
Then she “ waited for God knows how long . ”
Before coming to the hospital , she had picked up a six - inch sandwich at Subway .
In the waiting room , she ate about three inches of it .
When a nurse saw her eating , Hannah testified that the nurse admonished her for eating before receiving the rape kit — even though Sade and Kerston say they were never instructed that eating was off - limits .
“ Basically , she said you have a lost cause ’ cause you ate , ” Hannah testified .
Later , D.C. police officer Michael Minor reported to the hospital to take a report from Hannah .
In a notebook , he recorded Kerston ’s information as a witness , noted the location of the party , and sketched a description of the suspect .
Then , he called the Sexual Assault Unit , where he was patched into Spriggs .
Minor told Spriggs he had a victim complaining of sexual assault and needed a rape kit authorized .
Though D.C. police policy requires detectives to report to the scene to interview the victim in person , Spriggs decided to do this one by phone .
Spriggs told Minor to put Hannah on the line .
Spriggs , sitting in the SAU office , determined that Hannah had n’t been the victim of a crime .
“ She told me that she was at a party .
And she remembered kissing a guy , ” Spriggs testified .
“ I repeated back to her what she said to me .
And there was a pause , ” he said .
Back on the phone with Minor , “ I said , this young lady , she ’s not reporting anything , she ’s not reporting a crime to me .
I ’m not bringing a sex kit up here . ”
Spriggs then testified as to why he did n’t press Hannah to explain why she needed a kit : “ I ’m not going to feed you any information to give you an opportunity to embellish you story , ” Spriggs testified .
“ If you are reporting something to me , then you should be able to tell me what that is .
And she did not report any crime to me . ”
Hannah testified that she did tell Spriggs she had been raped , but that he informed her “ I would not be able to receive a sex kit because I do not know the person or whoever it was last name , ” she said .
“ I did n’t know the last name .
So I could not receive the sex kit . ”
Minor left without filling out a police report documenting Hannah ’s sexual assault allegation .
When Hannah ’s sister arrived at the hospital — having been notified of the crisis over the phone — she could n’t understand why no report was taken .
So she called 911 and was told that officers would respond to the scene .
After a significant wait , she called the police again , and two more officers showed up — Officer Green and Officer Ginette Leveque .
When they arrived , Green and Leveque called SAU ’s Detective Wheeler to see if the SAU would authorize a kit ;
Wheeler then posed the rape kit question to his supervisor , Sergeant Kevin Rice .
Rice determined no investigation would be opened , and no rape kit authorized , because Spriggs had already spoken to the victim and determined that she did n’t have a case .
Rice later supported Spriggs ’ determination that no crime had occurred , testifying that “ blacking out is not a crime . ”
Hannah and her sister testified that Green and Leveque approached her rape accusation with hostility ; Green and Leveque testified that Hannah was a liar .
“ They were barking at me , ” Hannah testified .
“ They did nothing …to help me or to even try to make me feel like they would help me .
… They just did not do their job , and they were rude and not being police officers to me .
… And the way my case was just dismissed , the way I was dismissed , the way my story was not heard all the way through , was wrong , negligent . ”
Hannah ’s sister testified that she attempted to reason with the officers .
“ I was trying to just ask them some simple questions about the procedure and what the protocol would be .
I was told , you know that they were no longer going to answer any questions from me to the point where I felt threatened , ” she testified .
“ I felt like if I was going to ask more questions [ that ] they were going to , like , try to detain me .
… And I did n’t want any trouble with the police . ”
The SAU again decided not to take a sexual assault report in Hannah ’s case .
Its officers did not interview any witnesses or attempt to go to the Bryant Street house .
But Green did complete a miscellaneous report — which Rice later testified was meant to “ cover ” the officers .
Unlike with a standard sexual assault report , Hannah ’s full name and private information were entered into a public document .
In the report , Green wrote , “ [ The complainant ] C1 reported to both officers on the scene she attended a house party at the listed location and does n’t know if anything happened to her .
C1 reports she blacked out .
C1 was informed that a report could not be taken based on the statement she thinks something happened .
Then C1 stated she went into the bathroom and a guy followed her in there and touched her breast and private parts and then she blacked out .
C1 was asked what do you mean by private parts and C1 stated her rectum hurts .
C1 stated she went from one extreme to another so someone had to put something in her drink , then C1 changed her story and said , ‘ I was drunk . ’
C1 was then advised that in order to take a report I have [ to ] have something concrete and not have any guesses .
C1 then stated she only wanted to have a sex kit done to see if anything happened and she just needs for us to say something happened .
C1 was informed that we can not lie and say something happened just so she can get a kit done .
C1 then asked if we had sisters or kids and would n’t we want them to be tested .
C1 was informed again that we are not going to lie .
C1 then stated OK I ’ll just say I was rape to get the kit done .
C1 was advised that it does n’t work like that and advised about the importants of truth . ”
Trinka Porrata , a former Los Angeles police officer and national expert on drug facilitated sexual assault , was deposed in Hannah ’s case as an expert witness for the plaintiff .
Porrata testified that the D.C. police response to Hannah ’s report was extremely lacking .
“ The whole point of investigation is putting it all together , ” Porrata said .
“ And you do n’t say , ‘ Well , she said she was drunk .
Screw it . ’
Voluntary intoxication is not consent to have sex .
It may still be a sexual assault .
And that ’s the purpose of a proper investigation . ”

Back in the waiting room , Hannah spoke over the phone with a SANE nurse , who explained that Hannah could n’t receive a rape kit because the police had refused to authorize it .
According to testimony by Hannah and her sister , the SANE nurse instructed them to take a sample of Hannah ’s urine just in case the police later agreed to authorize the kit .
When Hannah was finally taken back into an examination room , she testified that she told the doctor , “ I was raped .
I believe I need a sex kit or I would like to receive one .
Is there anything you can do , ” she said .
“ He said he could not ’cause he was directed not to . ”
Hannah said that she was n’t offered a pelvic exam , but the doctor did prescribe her some prophylactics to prevent against contracting STDs .
She did n’t even take off her clothes .
After being stonewalled at Howard , Hannah and her sister went to George Washington University Hospital to attempt to receive a rape kit and additional medical care there .
It was now early evening on Saturday , and Hannah still had n’t showered , brushed her teeth , defecated , or eaten anything besides the sandwich since she was possibly drugged and sexually assaulted the night before .
“ I was sick .
I had been holding my bowels for hours because I was still in hopes of getting a sex kit , ” Hannah testified .
“ I had just taken a — the prophylactics from Howard , so the side effects from that were kicking in .
I mean , I still felt nauseated .
Head was hurting .
I had n’t eaten in hours .
I was still uncomfortable .
My leg was still hurting .
I was just overall in discomfort and pain . ”
After waiting for hours in the public waiting area , Hannah testified , a nurse at G.W. informed her that she was not authorized to receive a kit there , because she had already been denied one at Howard .
Later , Hannah spoke to another Sexual Assault Unit detective over the phone , who informed her that her case had been closed and that she could not receive a rape kit now .
Hannah cried in the waiting room and begged a G.W. nurse to provide her treatment .
After a long wait , a doctor who had never treated a sexual assault patient before prescribed her some HIV prophylactics and discharged her .
After leaving G.W. , Hannah went back to her dorm room and slept for a long time .
When she awoke , she did n’t shower .
She and her sister drove to Maryland , where they had heard that she might be able to receive a rape kit .
At Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring , they were told that Hannah would n’t be able to receive a kit because she was outside of the jurisdiction in which the rape occurred .
SANE exams can be performed up to 96 hours after an assault , but the earlier an exam is performed , the more likely that evidence of the rape can be detected on the victim ’s body .
In the days following her assault , Hannah attempted to receive a rape kit four times at three different hospitals .
“ A lot was lost at that moment , ” Porrata testified .
“ The fact that there was witnesses there in that time point — two witnesses there who could have provided some details as to the change in behavior and the location and the possibility of a follow - up , you know , to the scene , the possibility of still finding witnesses at the scene , of evidence at the scene , ” she said .
“ By the ongoing failure to do an exam all three times , by the ongoing failure for the police department , after that first time , to do an investigation , we have lost all possibility of knowing for sure whether or not she was sexual assaulted and whether or not she was drugged . ”
For the 30 days following the party , Hannah took her daily HIV prophylactic medication , which caused extreme nausea , headaches , fatigue , and weight gain .
The symptoms lasted into the middle of January .
For almost a year after the event , Hannah suffered from insomnia .
“ I was lethargic .
… I could n’t sleep , I could n’t sleep , ” she testified .
“ At most , I would sleep what , three to four hours . ”
When she did sleep , she had nightmares — “ sexual dreams , not in a good — not in a good , uh , way . ”
When she was awake , she was “ in a depressed mood , angry .
I was really angry , um , just a mean , surly demeanor , not myself .
Not myself . ”
On campus , she did everything possible to avoid running into Tito , Brandon , and Bilal .
Months after the party , Hannah went out to a club with her friends .
Tito was working the door as a bouncer .
According to her sister ’s testimony , Hannah was so frightened to enter the club that she called her sister and asked what to do .
The next day , her sister called Tito to ask him about the events of that night .
“ We greeted each other .
We had n’t talked in a long time , ” her sister testified .
She remembered telling Tito that “ something happened to my sister the night of the party , and I want to know how you were involved and everything that occurred from what you can recall . ”
“ He seemed uneasy , ” she testified .
“ He went right to what I was calling for …he naturally assumed that I was calling because something had happened to her sexually .
And he went straight to um , rape or sexual assault being the issue and stating that it ’s a very , you know , serious thing , ” she testified .
“ And he concluded that I was speaking of rape and immediately wanted to contact another member of the party so that he could provide me with his side of the story as well . ”
A little while later , Bilal called .
Tito was there on the line .
“ [ Bilal ] said that , um , Tito had pointed my sister out to him …and that was the only time he saw my sister , ” Hannah ’s sister testified .
“ He said something to the effect of , um , ‘ I ’m sorry that something happened to your sister and if it was something that I knew about , I want you to know … that I would have never , ever let anything happen to your sister . ’”
Later ,
Tito would testify that if a sexual assault had actually occurred at the party , he would have taken it seriously — but that there ’s no way Hannah could have been raped .
“ You ’ve got your church girls and your street girls , ” he testified .
Tito had determined that Hannah was a “ street girl , ” meaning that she was sexually promiscuous .
“ [ I ] f anything went on at this party , ” Tito testified , “ if anything did happen to this girl , she was willing to do it . ”
Hannah eventually showered , brushed her teeth , changed her clothes .
The pain in her rectum and hip subsided and she stopped limping .
By January of 2007 , Hannah had completed the course of HIV prophylactics and recovered from her nausea .
The following summer , she went on a diet and lost the weight she had gained after the assault .
The nightmares became less frequent .
Now , the only evidence Hannah retains of the possible rape are her unwashed panties and T - shirt from the night of the incident , which her sister wrapped in a plastic bag and placed in her closet for safekeeping .
“ I did n’t seek to sue Bilal or anyone because I had no evidence in my hand , ” Hannah testified .
“ I ’m not going to put somebody ’s life in my hand like my life was played with at Howard University Hospital .
If I had received a rape kit , then maybe I could have done something . ”

In 2008 , Howard University Hospital informed the D.C. Rape Crisis Center that it would be terminating its SANE program .
According to minutes from SANE meetings filed in court , finding a replacement for the program was a challenge ; G.W. Hospital was said to be “ historically resistant to providing services outside the university community , ” while other area hospitals were worried about the legal implications of taking on the program .
“ It ’s gotten more complicated since we first started the program , ” says Snyder of the DCRCC ’s second SANE site search .
“ Hospitals were raising issues with a lot more intensity around liability , ” she says .
“ We decided that we really needed to have involvement of the city at a much more direct and intense fashion than we did when we set up the original program . ”
Washington Hospital Center opened the new SANE program under the supervision of the mayor ’s office in 2008 .
In 2009 , the Violence Against Women Act of 2005 went into effect , which requires jurisdictions to provide rape kits to victims regardless of police authorization .
Now , when a rape victim reports to the hospital , she can receive a rape kit even if she ’s reluctant to report the crime to police — or if police are reluctant to investigate her claims .
According to Jana Parrish , a SANE nurse who works out of Washington Hospital Center , rape kits completed at the hospital are transferred to D.C. police , who preserve the kits for 90 days following the assault , waiting for victim and detectives to authorize an investigation .
At that point , “ The police would ultimately still need to agree to that the elements of the crime are present and declare it a case , ” Snyder says .
After the three months are up , “ [ The police ] decide how to dispose of them , ” Parrish said in an interview .
“ I do n’t know what they do with them at that time . ”
Rachel repeatedly pressed Paul on the issue , in fact the entire interview was about this issue , but Paul refused to budge .
He said he would have tried to change that Title if he had to vote on the Civil Rights Act .
Rachel correctly pointed out that without government enforcing non-discrimination at private businesses , businesses could refuse to serve people based on their race or sexual orientation or on any other basis the business decided .
Paul was unmoved and called the issue a red herring , while saying he was personally against discrimination and institutional racism .
Rachel pointed to the concrete example of Walgreens refusing to serve blacks at lunch counters back in the 60s , yet Paul stuck to his guns .
Paul repeatedly tried to bring the discussion to a theoretical discussion , asking if restaurants were private or public and then he weirdly said that he did n't want to step on the First Amendment , saying that he abhors ( of course ) racism but people should have the right to say racist things .
Does Rand Paul believe that the First Amendment gaurantees private businesses the ' right ' to refuse to serve customers on the basis of their race , or sexual orientation or on any other bias of the owner ?
I do n't know the answer to that question but it sure seemed that he was suggesting that .
I 'll post the video as soon as I can find it , but I really do n't think we have any business losing to a person with Rand Paul 's beliefs , even in a conservative state like Kentucky .
UPDATE 1 : As Drewid reminded me in the comments , Paul suggested to Rachel that the discussion could be turned on its head by saying that Rachel 's line of thinking made it possible for the federal government to mandate that private businesses could not refuse entry to gun carrying people .
Because of course , refusing to serve someone because they have a weapon and there might be a public safety issue , is the same as refusing to serve someone because they are black , gay or for some other bias of the owner
UPDATE 2 : Thank you everyone for recommending this diary - its my first time on the rec list !
UPDATE 3 : Thanks to weatherdude in the comments for pointing me to the video .
Here 's
Paul melting down as he tries to explain his very strange position .
UPDATE 4 : On reflection , I think he was referring to Title II of the Civil Rights
Act that deals with public accommodations ( I 'm not a legal expert so feel free to correct me ) .
Also , some commenters have said that he did n't really meltdown .
And I agree with this in the sense that he did n't breakdown on camera and he stuck to his position , but if his goal is to get elected , tonight 's interview ( hopefully ) will go a long way to stop him .
He argued for the freedom of a business to put up a ' No blacks served ' sign !
UPDATE 5 : ( May 20 ) I guess his campaign has enough sense to realize that his view on defending the ' rights ' of private businesses to discriminate was n't an electoral winner .
Here 's Paul 's spokesman ( via Greg Sargent ) , Jesse Benton , today :
" Civil Rights legislation that has been affirmed by our courts gives the Federal government the right to ensure that private businesses do n't discriminate based on race .
Dr. Paul supports those powers . "
Earlier today Thinkprogress sought Jim DeMint 's comment on Paul 's positions and DeMint refused to comment on Paul 's comments , saying only that he was ' going to talk to Rand about his positions ' .
DeMint stated that he supported the Civil Rights Act .
When you 're too far out there for Jim DeMint ...
UPDATE 6 : ( May 20 ) As science geek pointed out in the diary , it seems Rachel misspoke and meant to refer to the sit-in at the Woolworth 's lunch counter in Greensboro , NC of 1960 rather than the Nashville sit-in of 1960 .
Results from last chapter :
Last chapter , I asked you all whether you would drink the darkest beer in the worst bar in Ireland .
2/5 said they would , which I respect .
2/5 said they would drink whiskey or vodka , which I must find myself regretting .
Without a bar tender , it ’s way harder for people to get whiskey .
Especially if they ’re in a rush .
Chapter 3 :
Leon , ignoring the suggestion to continue his explanation , gaped at the scene before him .
He took in the scattered wreckage of the tourist ’s dinner , broken glass mixed with shapeless meat topped with slowly spreading beer .
He turned to the bar , still devoid of bartender or any noise emanating from the kitchen .
When he saw the door , a hint of fear crossed his features as though he expected the police to arrive that very second .
When the second passed , he turned on Rob , confusion replaced with expanding rage .
He opened his mouth to speak but was cut off , “ 29 minutes . ”
Leon closed his eyes and took a long , deep breath before attempting to continue .
He opened them and said , “ There is no way you ’re getting away with this .
The authorities will be here any minute .
How are we possibly going to catch our flight from an Irish jail ?
They all saw our faces .
Oh God , everything is going wrong and we have n’t even arrived at Oceanus yet . ”
Rob looked up from his drink and smiled , “ Ah , so we are going to Oceanus .
That ’s a start .
Please continue .
You have 27 minutes . ”
“ How can you be so calm ?
After what you just did , you could at least be worried about the consequences of … ”
“ Eh , no big deal .
All the cops are going to have are fake names and the words ‘ Irish Republican Army . ’
Nobody got hurt and I ’m sure those kids will be laughing about it in no time .
In fact , I think I just did that family a favor .
You see how bored they were ?
Besides , this is no place for them .
They could get hurt in a bar like this . ”
“ What ?
No .
You do n’t understand .
Those people do n’t matter .
I do n’t care if that little brat is terrified of everybody in a suit for the rest of his life .
What matters is that you and I can do our jobs . ”
Rob laughed bitterly and , quietly , said “ Of course you do n’t . ”
Before the other man could wonder , he continued , “ And what , Mr. Evans , are our jobs ? ”
“ Over the past several months , there have been a number of unexplained events on and related to our research at that station .
I was hoping to have more time to give you the details … ”
“ 17 minutes , ” Rob pointed out .
“ … but that is out of the question , given recent events .
For now , all you need to know is that we ’ve been tasked to travel out to Oceanus …
“ You mind taking a minute to explain Oceanus .
All I ’m going off of are rumors ”
“ I ’d hoped somebody would have briefed you about this before now .
The Oceanus offshore research platform is among the world ’s foremost research laboratories .
The Company built it off the coast of Ireland to avoid intrusive governments . ”
“ Seems a bit overkill to me , could n’t they just use a normal lab like everybody else ? ”
“ The research being conducted at Oceanus is both highly sensitive and potentially dangerous .
Management decided it was worth the investment to locate it far enough away from government restrictions to avoid any messy entanglements . ”
“ Ah , interesting .
Well , I can certainly appreciate wanting to avoid getting caught . ”
Rob glanced over his shoulder at the floor .
“ As I was saying , we are going to Oceanus to discover whoever is sabotaging our recent research initiatives .
I ’m going to find the traitor , ” Leon spit the word out , “ and you ’re going to deal with him . ”
“ Oh . ”
“ Oh ? ”
“ I was n’t expecting , ” Rob stopped to sip his beer and grimace , “ something so easy , that ’s all . ”
After glancing once more around the bar , Leon turned a calm gaze on Rob , “ I guess nothing is easy with you , is it ?
At any rate , I need to give you some info about the employees we ’ve come to suspect . ”
“ You ’d better hurry .
We only have 13 minutes left . ”
“ Pardon me for asking , but how do you know so exactly when we ’ll need to flee the scene of your crime ? ”
“ Well , between you and me , this place has something of a reputation , ” Rob waved his hand , gesturing around the bar , “ It ’s not hard to find police response times . ”
“ Hm , clever . ” Leon paused a moment , giving Rob a searching look , “ Anyway , I have full employee profiles of our suspected moles .
Again , due to our lack of time , I ’ll have to just give you the brief versions . ”
He reached into his pocket , pulled out his phone and , after a moment of fiddling , continued , “ On the helicopter , you will meet Paul Shannon , Susan Coleman , and Dr. Eric Carr .
Mr. Shannon is one of our Offshore Installation Managers .
We know he gambles regularly and suspect he has a sizable debt but none of the casinos he visits have any credit with his name on them and his credit cards are clear .
Ms. Coleman is one of our lab techs onboard Oceanus .
A number of her coworkers have reported unexplained absences and a change in appearance .
We have a strict health policy for anybody working at Oceanus and I suspect a violation of our substance abuse policy .
Normally , I would just have her replaced , but she has also been having secretive meetings ashore and we need to know if she is trading in Company secrets . ”
“ 5 minutes . ”
“ Dr. Carr is one of our Senior Research Scientists .
He takes less shore time than anybody else aboard the station until a month ago when he left for an extended vacation and promptly vanished .
We do n’t know what he did during that month , but the information he has access to is highly sensitive .
When we arrive at Oceanus , we will be briefed on the current research being performed by Dr. Louis Williams , the Chief Research Scientist .
He is known to be territorial of what he considers his station , so we ’ll have to tread lightly or he will attempt to make our work more difficult . ”
“ 2 minutes . ”
“ That ’s everybody of significance .
I ’ll fill you in on any other details as they come up .
I ’m leaving before anything else goes amiss . ”
Leon was starting to rise out of his seat when Rob motioned him to remain seated .
“ Hold up , let me finish my drink . ”
He raised his glass in his left hand and quickly drained the remaining black liquid in one gulp .
“ Now , allow me to correct you on a few points before we finish .
First off , you are n’t going anywhere . ”
In one smooth motion , Rob reached into his jacket , drew a small , suppressed pistol and shot Mr. Evans in the shoulder .
The small cough of the gun bled into a shocked moment of silence which was eventually broken by a pained shriek .
The scream was quickly followed by several more coughs and the loud crashing of a dying man falling to the ground .
Rob crouched by the side of the dying man , “ Your second mistake was that we ’ve discussed ‘ everybody of significance . ’
We have n’t talked about you . ”
Leon tried to open his mouth but Rob quietly shushed him , “ We do n’t have time .
Just listen .
You ’ve been a Company man for quite a few years now .
You have more than a little clout with management .
Now , we both know that The Company has some seedier connections .
So when you suggested the Company double - check those connections , like the mob , by hiring private investigators to check out corruption charges and killing them when they finished , management loved your idea .
It seemed so foolproof .
Find your weak links and then kill the messenger .
It was quite clever .
I ’m sure you got a handsome raise for it . ”
“ Of course , you did n’t expect one of them to escape .
And you certainly did n’t expect one of them to get a job with the Company .
And you most certainly did n’t expect one of them to be me . ”
Rob stood up again , pointing the gun down at the terrified face lying before him , “ And how could you possibly have expected that one to be pissed you killed his partner and best friend just to further your career .
So when you said you had a traitor in the Company , you were mostly right .
You have at least one . ”
He pulled the trigger once more .
Rob took a deep , ragged breath .
He grabbed Leon ’s phone and pocketed it before reaching under the table and pulling out his black bag .
He reached in and removed the homemade bomb located inside .
He set the small timer for two minutes and calmly walked through the kitchen and out the back entrance .
The first police sirens could be heard on the air when the bomb went off .
Your question :
Between Paul Shannon , Dr. Eric Carr , Susan Coleman , and Dr. Louis Williams , how many ‘ traitors ’ do you expect to find ?
UPDATE ( 2014-11-02 ) : please note that this post is from 2010 .
These days , it is much simpler to create docx files from R using knitr + pandoc .
Using pander ( links : [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] ) can also help make the markdown output look nicer in the file .
Creating reports is one of the basic tasks in data analysis .
R provides numerous functions and packages to export it ’s ( beautiful ) output and help compile it into a report .
In this post I will present one such ( basic ) solution for Windows OS users for exporting R output into Microsoft Word using the R2wd ( package ) .
There are more ways and strategies for doing this , and if encouraged by comments , I will gladly write more on the subject .
* * *
R to Word using { R2wd}
The package R2wd ( available through CRAN ) relies on rcom .
It is a wrapper that uses the statconnDCOM server to communicate with MS - Word via the COM interface .
R2wd can perform the basic tasks you would expect to need when creating a report from R . It allows you to :
Create a new Word file
Create headers and sub-headers
Move to a new pages in the document
Write text
Insert tables ( that is “ data. frame ” and “ matrix ” objects )
Insert plots
Save and close the Word document
… ( and more )
The current R2wd can still be seen as being in BETA stages .
Some features are not yet available , such as :
Choosing text font ( which means most of us will need to manually change the font in the document to “ couriers new … ” , in order for the formatting to look good )
Inserting of complex object outputs ( such as summery.lm , although in the example bellow I show how that can be achieved using a simple function )
Speed – the speed of inserting a table is somewhat slow , I am not sure how it would scale to large documents
But from a ( pleasant ) correspondence with the package developer , I was assured the next release will supply us with more options and features .
R2wd package developer , Christan Ritter , invites feedback from users .
So if you have features you are missing in this packages , I believe he would like to know about it ( you can e-mail Christan at : christian.
ritter <- at-> ridaco <- dot -> be )
Getting R2wd 1.3
The current version of R2wd is 1.1 and Christan Ritter ( the package developer ) , says it is a “ first idea ” and that a more elaborate version will soon ( e.g : around July ) be available on CRAN .
In the meantime , Christan was so kind as to send me a more recent version of the package , which you ( until it gets uploaded to CRAN ) , you are welcome to download from here :
R2wd 1.3 download link
How to use R2wd to create a report – a sample session
Being young does n’t prevent from R2wd to do some nice things .
Here is the text from the library ( help= R2wd ) :
If Word is not already running , wdGet ( ) opens a new Word document , otherwise , it establishes a COM handle to the instance which is already running .
The functions wdTitle , wdHeader , wdBody , and wdParagraph can be used to inject text elements into Word .
Moreover , bookmarks can be added via wdInsertBookmarks and wdGoToBookmark allows to navigate among the bookmarks which also exist .
There is another set of convenience functions , wdSection , wdSubsection , and wdSubsubsection which insert headers of level 1 , 2 , or 3 , start new ’ Sections ’ in Word , and add bookmarks .
Graphs and dataframes can be inserted intoWord , by the wdPlot , wdTable commands .
The wdTable command takes a dataframe or an array as arguments , creates a Word table of the appropriate dimensions and injects the content of the dataframe or array into it .
It then formats the table in Word using elementary formating elements .
The functions wdApplyTheme and wdApplyTemplate allow to work with themes and templates .
Here is an example sessions to demonstrate some of what is said :
# install.packages ( " R2wd " ) # library ( help=R2wd ) require ( R2wd ) wdGet ( T ) #
If no word file is open , it will start a new one - can set if to have the file visiable or not wdNewDoc ( " c: \This.doc " ) # this creates a new file with " this.doc " name wdApplyTemplate ( " c: \This.dot " ) # this applies a template wdTitle ( " Examples of R2wd ( a package to write Word documents from R ) " ) # adds a title to the file wdSection ( " Example 1 - adding text " , newpage = T ) #
This can also create a header wdHeading ( level = 2 , " Header 2 " ) wdBody ( " This is the first example we will show " ) wdBody ( " ( Notice how , by using two different lines in wdBody , we got two different paragraphs ) " ) wdBody ( " ( Notice how I can use this : ' n' ( without the space ) , to n go to the next line ) " ) wdBody ( " האם זה עובד בעברית ? " ) wdBody ( " It does n't work with Hebrew ... " ) wdBody ( " O.k , let 's move to the next page ( and the next example ) " ) wdSection ( " Example 2 - adding tables " , newpage = T ) wdBody ( " Table using ' format ' " ) wdTable ( format ( head ( mtcars ) ) ) wdBody ( " Table without using ' format ' " ) wdTable ( head ( mtcars ) ) wdSection ( " Example 3 - adding lm summary " , newpage = T ) ##

Update :
Upon reading my post , Chris suggested that I ’ll also add a note here about SWORD , a tool written by Thomas Baier ( the creator of the StatconnDCOM server ) which allows to include R - code in a Sweave - like fashion in Word documents .
Here is a link to the project : http://rcom.univie.ac.at
A warning sign is seen at the base of the Myrdalsjokull glacier , which is part of the ice cap sealing the Katla volcano , near the Icelandic village of Vik .
The Katla volcano neighbouring Eyjafjoell , whose eruptions paralysed Europe 's skies last month , could come to life in the near future , experts say .
An Icelandic volcano neighbouring Eyjafjoell , whose eruptions paralysed Europe 's skies last month , could come to life in the near future , according to experts .
" An eruption in the short term is a strong possibility , " experts said , referring to Katla , which is larger and fiercer than Eyjafjoell , in a report from the University College London ( UCL ) institute for risk and disaster reduction .
The researchers also cautioned that Europe 's skies were likely to be hit by further ash cloud shutdowns , following April 's widespread closures and several smaller scale shutdowns since .
The report warned that " future moderately to highly explosive Icelandic eruptions combined with appropriate weather conditions are highly likely to cause a repeat of the recent air transport disruption . "
The Eyjafjoell volcano began erupting on April 14 , and spewed out an ash cloud that drifted over Europe and led to massive flight disruption throughout the continent for several days .
It caused the biggest airspace shutdown in Europe since World War II , affecting more than 100,000 flights and eight million passengers .
The UCL experts -- encompassing scientists , engineers and statisticians also criticised the response to the eruption .
" The severe disruption to European airspace in April from ( the volcano 's ) ash clouds reflect a lack of integration between the monitoring , warning and risk management systems , " said Carina Fearnley , of UCL 's hazard research centre .
In a second report released Thursday , a team of British researchers said they had discovered a significant electrical charge in the ash plume .
The scientists , from the Institute of Physics , said they found that " the ash plume which hovered over Scotland carried a significant and self - renewing electric charge . "
They warned that the charge could pose a risk to both planes and passengers .
" Charged particles can cause aircraft radio interference and , if introduced into aircraft cabins , charged ash may present an electrostatic hazard to occupants or aircraft systems , " said the report .
The scientists used a specialist weather balloon to conduct research on a section of the ash cloud floating over Scotland .

Police say up to 2,000 people were involved in a protest that turned into a riot at a tyre shop in Oakleigh in Melbourne 's south - east .
Racing fans had gathered at the intersection of the Princes Highway and Warrigal Road to protest over the cancellation of the Easternats race meet .
They were targeting Bob Jane , the tyre company that sponsored the event .
Easternats organisers say Bob Jane cancelled the event after failing to finalise contract negotiations .
Police were called in about 11:30 pm ( AEDT ) when the protest turned violent .
Acting Assistant Commissioner Neville Taylor says the event started peacefully , before people started smashing windows and damaging a car .
" At one particular time , some person decided it would be smart to throw a flare towards one of our police officers , and this has really sparked the riotous behaviour , " he said .
" We had about 50 police units that were in attendance in response to this , and our aim was about dispelling that crowd , to maintain the community safety . "
He says police have video footage of what happened .
" We 've got some very good footage of that riot that took place there , so they 'll be aiming to identify probably the key people who were involved in the actual behaviour in the riot , as well as the large crowd that was there , " he said .
It is believed tyres and other items were also stolen .
Traffic was stopped at the intersection for two hours , and members of the air wing , dog squad and force response units were brought in to disperse the crowd .
No major injuries have been reported .
Police have called on those responsible to hand themselves in .
Darrelle Revis ,
one of a handful of young Jets who are in line for a pay raise
sometime soon ,
has asked the team for a contract extension that will net $ 20 million a year
, according to a report on the nationalfootballpost.com
Only three players last season -- Giants quarterback Eli Manning , Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers and Bears quarterback Jay Cutler -- took in salaries in excess of $ 20 million last season .
The highest paid cornerback in the NFL last season , Dunta Robinson , formerly of the Houston Texans , earned $ 9.957 million .
Revis said last week that he had begun contract negotiations with the Jets , and general manager Mike Tannenbaum has said he is committed to keeping the All - Pro cornerback in a Jets uniform for the rest of his career .
However , with such a hefty price tag reported , the two sides could be farther apart than initially anticipated .
The blades began turning at Germany 's first offshore wind farm on Tuesday , 45 kilometres off the coast in the North Sea , with 12 turbines producing energy for 50,000 households .
The turbines , each 150 metres high , produce 12 megawatts of power and the total cost of the project was 250 million euros ( $ A361.01 million ) , the consortium of energy companies that built the farm said .
The wind farm was designed as a " test ground " to examine the environmental damage on local species from such turbines , which are embedded 30 metres below the surface .
Germany aims to achieve a capacity of 25,000 megawatts in offshore wind energy by 2030 , said Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen , formally opening the park .
The project , named Alpha Ventus , was financed by Germany 's number one energy provider EON , Vattenfall Europe , a subsidiary of the Swedish energy giant , and EWE .
As Dante Atkins noted earlier today , right - wing conspiracy theorists might be undermining their own cause .
By railing against the government , and even including the Census Bureau in their web of evil government agencies , they have apparently stunted the rate of response for the decennial census among likeminded citizens .
Of course , it 's possible that this is merely a coincidence that will work itself out in the coming months .
If not , however , there is something pretty delicious about the census return rates emanating from the Lone Star State .
How sparse are the return rates for deep red counties ?
Consider that urban ( and mainly left - of - center ) Houston has had a return rate thus far of about 21 % .
While this is far below the national average ( African - American and Latino respondents have been historically tougher to track down for the Census ) , it is well ahead of some of the very white , very Republican small counties which dot the Texas landscape .
Just look at the return rates for some of the GOP - saturated counties :
Newton County ( East Texas ) : 65 % for McCain , 18 % Return Rate
Briscoe County ( Panhandle ) : 74 % for McCain , 8 % Return Rate
King County ( near Lubbock ) : 92 % for McCain , 5 % Return Rate
Of course , the reluctance of Texas Republicans to complete the Census might be owed to their representation in Congress , which has been quite vocal on the subject :
Earlier this month , Texas Rep. Ron Paul voted against a congressional resolution asking Americans to participate in the census .
“ The invasive nature of the current census raises serious questions about how and why government will use the collected information , ” the Lake Jackson Republican recently said .
“ It also demonstrates how the federal bureaucracy consistently encourages citizens to think of themselves in terms of groups , rather than as individual Americans .
” Houston - area GOP lawmakers say anti-census feelings run deep among their constituents .
“ People are concerned about the apparent intrusive nature of the census , ” said Rep . Ted Poe , R - Humble .
“ People are very concerned that the government is going too far . ”
The irony , of course , is that the lunatic rants of GOP Congressman like Poe and Paul , should they prove successful , will have one near - certain consequence : fewer Republican districts .
Meaning , of course , fewer Republican Congressmen .
Thierry Henry has reportedly signed an initial deal that will see the Frenchman play in the United States next season ...
As reported by Sport , Barcelona striker and French goalscoring legend Thierry Henry has signed a pre-contract agreement that will see him move to the United States ' Major League Soccer to play with the New York Red Bulls after the World Cup .
After an initially rocky start in his first season at Barcelona , Henry had a successful year with the Blaugrana under coach Pep Guardiola .
This season , however , the Frenchman has struggled with injury , and has seen his minutes cut down substantially with the club .
He has been linked to a summer transfer away from the Camp Nou for much of the season .
Despite his age , ' Titi ' remains a prolific goalscorer .
During his time at Arsenal , the Frenchman scored 174 goals in 254 matches , while at Barcelona he found the back of the net 35 times in 78 games .

Today was meant to be a talk by Tariq Ali at the ‘ Transversal Space ’ of occupied Mansion House , Middlesex University .
Instead of a lecture , however , people arrived to discover that the whole building had been surrounded by security guards .
An injunction had been served to the occupiers by university management , and individual students had been named in the document .
These tactics obviously worked , because after holding the entire building for a week , the occupiers decided to leave as a group — using Ali ’s talk outside on the lawn as the focus for a post- occupation rally .
I am never sure how to feel at these moments .
Despite the applause all round — which the students obviously deserved after their heroic actions — applauding the exit leaves me feeling cold .
Although the vacation of Mansion House by no means implies the end of the struggle , it provided a focus for activities with a real , corporeal commitment and , crucially , an expropriation of the university ’s resources , i.e. its teaching space .
The importance of this should not be underestimated .
The deflationary feeling was compounded by a bizarrely uninspiring speech by Tariq Ali .
Meandering and obviously unprepared , it lacked the fire and brimstone befitting such a militant action .
Even worse was the content .
Whilst liberal types are wont to bemoan the ‘ unrealistic ’ radical left , it seems to me that , quite the contrary , the radical left often suffers from far too little radicalism .
Ali argued that all students should stand together to defend ‘ high quality education ’ ; that vice - chancellors should get a pay cut ; and , most disturbingly of all , that a popular front should be formed with the centre and the right to defend public education .
Could these words have been spoken by a figure such as , say , Nick Clegg ?
After all , Tory - Lib Dem ministers have just agreed to take a pay cut .
Tick .
All profuse a commitment to high quality education .
Tick .
And all appeal to a broad base of liberal - left and rightwing libertarian sentiment .
Tick , again .
Surely at an event like this we should pushing exactly the kind of ‘ unrealistic ’ ideas to give the prefix radical in front of left its worth .
These could include , for example : the abolition of all tuition fees and the democratic management of all universities by academics and students .
It could also be linked into the wider struggle against cuts across the public sector , which will doubtless become the focus of a working class struggle in the coming years .
In general , I would have much preferred to hear more of the occupiers speak — to find out more of what they had learned through the experience , and their thoughts on the way forward .
Figures of radicalism past like Ali , weary with the defeats of the 1980s , are probably not what is need to inspire a new generation , or push the ideas needed today .

Chip Reid and Helen Thomas gave White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs a four - minute chunk of grief over trying to “ control the press ” in a way Thomas said was worse than even Richard Nixon .
Thomas , who has been covering White House press briefings I think since Taft was in office , has had a bit of internet fame due to her part in Stephen Colbert ’s epicly awesome GWB send - up during the White House Correspondents ’ Association Dinner in 2006 .
If you recall , Thomas chased a terrified Colbert around in his fantasy of being the White House Press Secretary , badgering Colbert about the reasons behind invading Iraq .
Thomas proved that her biting critique showed no partisan leanings yesterday when she and Reid laid into Gibbs for ridiculous executive branch policies that actually use social media to limit and “ tightly control ” the content of Townhall meetings and press briefings .
The debate begins when Gibbs insists that Reid submit questions via Facebook and Twitter to be answered “ tomorrow ” rather than just opening the forum to on - the - spot questions .
Gibbs plays dopey , telling Reid to “ get on his e-mail address ” while Reid tries to explain how refusal to answer questions is n’t open or transparent .
Gibbs giggles throughout the exchange in a way that makes you want to slap him , and really only proves the two annoyed reporters right by dancing around answering questions .
Two minutes in Thomas brings it , saying , “ I ’m amazed … I ’m amazed at you people who call for openness and transparency , ” and cites a pattern of “ controlling the press . ”
She tells Gibbs that the Obama administration ’s “ formal engagements are prepackaged , ” and says that “ calling reporters the night before , telling them they ’re going to be called on - that ’s shocking . ”
When asked if she sent in a question , she goes all grand ma - do n ’t - play - that by snapping , “ I do n’t have to email it - I can tell you right now ! ”
Indeed , the exchange raises some interesting questions about the role of social networking and new media in the Obama administration .
With all the Obama love being spread thickly and freely around the blogosphere , we kind of took it for granted that this presidency would use the technologies we all embrace - Facebook , Twitter , e-mail - to advance communication between press and the executive branch , or even your average dude and the White House .
I ’ll go a step further - we were lead to believe that .
Obama sends me Facebook updates more than my best friend .
But is the Obama administration now using our “ friend status ” to filter valid questions and create an illusion of rapport with the press and by extension , the people ?
Bill Maher called Obama out early on for mocking the most popular question at one of the first Townhall meetings he had as president .
In the meeting , Obama laughed at “ the internet ” for wanting to know if he had plans to consider legalizing and taxing marijuana to create jobs and create some desperately needed capital .
Maher fumed :
“ For Obama to mock , ‘ I do n’t know what ’s going on the Internet , ’ well excuse me …the Internet is America now .
That sounded like John McCain . ”
Well yeah , I want to know to - do they not know what ’s going on on “ the internet ” or do they not care ?
Yesterday , a co-worker asked if I had seen the new Armor All wheel protector stuff , because it looked quite impressive .
I told him that I had n’t , but I ’d like to see it because cleaning wheels is the most miserable job ever .
He pointed me in the direction of this video , which I found pretty darn impressive .
Surely , neither you nor I will be spraying honey on our wheels anytime soon , but it ’s nice to know that we can without having to use brake cleaner to get it off .

Has anybody used this stuff before in real world conditions ?
Maybe I will buy a bottle of this and put it to the test … .
Step one : Drive through a pool of maple syrup .
Full Disclosure : I have absolutely nothing to do with Armor All .
I do n’t sell it , I do n’t get it for free , and I do n’t have any reason to promote it other than it being a clever product advertisement .
A TOURIST who refused to take his clothes off at a swinger sex party has been blamed for " a mini-riot " at a north Queensland nudist colony .
Police were called amid threats of violence and lewd behaviour and ordered the Brisbane man and his wife from the adults - only " anything goes " sex party .
In pictures : Naked ambition around the world
In pictures :
The joy of streaking The White Cockatoo resort at Mossman , near Port Douglas , is promoting swingers and sex parties in a month of hedonism for March in a bid to boost sagging tourism figures .
Once billed as the nation 's top group - sex hotspot for swingers , the resort made international headlines last year when The Courier - Mail first reported plans to lift a self - imposed swinger ban .
Owner Tony
Fox said the " mini-riot " erupted when four naked female guests protested when confronted by the fully - clothed man .
" They felt uncomfortable with him eyeing them off and I asked him to show some respect and take his clothes off , " said the nudist colony manager .
" He then threatened to bash me , there was some argy - bargy and I ordered him off the premises and police were called . "
' Young Eagles ' director Allison Meyers fired from RNC in bondage club controversy
By Dan Eggen
The staffer fired by the Republican National Committee for authorizing a $ 2,000 payment for a night out at a bondage - themed club was the head of the Young Eagles , a GOP program aimed at cultivating major donors under 45 years old , Republicans familiar with the details of the case said Tuesday .
Allison Meyers , the Young Eagles director , asked the RNC to reimburse a GOP consultant for the costs of a Jan. 31 after - party event for young Republicans at Voyeur in West Hollywood , Calif. , which features topless female dancers wearing bondage gear and simulating sex acts .
Meyers ' identity was first reported by the National Journal 's Hotline .
The disbursement of money for the Voyeur gathering has become a major embarrassment for the RNC and its high - profile chairman , Michael S. Steele , at a time when the GOP is hoping to capitalize on an energized conservative base for this year 's midterm elections .
The RNC acknowledged late Monday it had fired an unnamed staffer over the affair , but spokesman Doug Heye declined to comment Tuesday on whether Meyers was the staffer who was let go .
The trip to Voyeur took place after an official RNC Young Eagles dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel attended by about 50 young Republican donors , according to the RNC and other officials .
Hotline , citing several unidentified sources , said Meyers organized both the official RNC event and the after - party at the club .
About a dozen young Republicans , including Meyers , attended the Voyeur gathering , GOP officials said .
One of those in attendance was Erik Brown , a GOP consultant and donor whose company , Dynamic Marketing Inc. , has earned about $ 160,000 from GOP campaigns .
GOP officials said Meyers tried to put the $ 1,946.25 tab on a credit card but was rejected ; Meyers then asked Brown to cover the bill with promises that the RNC would reimburse him , these officials said .
Brown has not responded to e-mails and telephone messages seeking his side of the story .
The RNC cut a check to Brown on Feb. 4 , which was dutifully reported on a Federal Election Commission expense form that exploded into the news cycle this week .
Brown has already lost business because his name immediately became linked to the scandal .
Chuck DeVore , a conservative GOP candidate for U.S. Senate in California , announced Monday that he was severing ties with Brown and DMI , which has offices in Washington and Los Angeles .
The RNC , for its part , has been eager to distance itself from the Voyeur visit , emphasizing that Steele was flying back from Hawaii at the time of the gathering and had no idea about the expense reimbursement .
In an internal e-mail obtained Monday by The Washington Post , RNC chief of staff Ken McKay wrote : " Our investigation has determined that following a Young Eagles event in Los Angeles , a group of individuals did attend such a club on their own .
This was not an RNC sanctioned event and was not associated in any way with any RNC official event . "
McKay also wrote that the fired RNC staffer , who is not named in the memo , " was aware that this activity was not eligible for reimbursement and had been previously counseled on this very subject . "
The RNC 's young donors program , which requires annual donations of $ 2,500 to $ 7,500 per person depending on age , has come under fire for its sometimes edgy approach to fundraising .
For example , Young Eagles donors are scheduled to gather for a retreat in North Carolina on April 22 at a firearms training facility run by Xe Services , the controversial military contractor previously known as Blackwater , which has been dogged with allegations of civilian killings and other abuses in U.S. war zones .

M�xico , anfitri�n de la cumbre mundial contra el cambio clim�tico , retom� el uso del carb�n , uno de los combustibles m�s contaminantes , para generar energ�a .
Informes de la Comisi�n para la Cooperaci�n Ambiental de Am�rica del Norte se�alan que las tres carboel�ctricas que operan en el pa�s emiten al ambiente 20.8 millones de toneladas de di�xido de carbono ( CO2 ) , 30 % del total nacional .
El di�xido de carbono es uno de los gases causantes del calentamiento global .
La misma comisi�n agrega que las carboel�ctricas tambi�n arrojan di�xido de azufre , �xido de nitr�geno y mercurio , que producen serios da�os a la salud humana , as� como al medio ambiente .
La Comisi�n Federal de Electricidad anunci� que incrementar� la demanda de carb�n de 10 millones de toneladas , a 25 millones en 2024 , un aumento de 137 % .
El director general de Investigaci�n en Pol�tica y Econom�a Ambiental de la Secretar�a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales , Carlos Mu�oz , explic� : la expansi�n de las carboel�ctricas es parte de la cartera del gobierno federal y no podemos negarnos a ninguna opci�n .
Aclar� que M�xico no tiene compromiso de reducciones de contaminantes , por lo que puede emplear el carb�n .
Actualmente , dijo , no hay l�mites , porque no hay acuerdos internacionales .
Greenpeace M�xico advirti� que con esa decisi�n el pa�s se ha colocado en la ruta del “ suicidio ecol�gico ” .
The most compelling story in Hollywood right now is the fumbling and stumbling and almost entirely top - secret wheeling and dealing going on inside today 's movie studios as they try to figure out a replacement for their dying business model .
In the old days -- meaning up until yesterday -- studios prospered by having an orderly sequence of windows - style releases for their product .
First movies hit the theaters , then four to six months later they arrived on DVD , then on to pay TV and cable and network and all sorts of other ancillary areas .
But now the studios see disaster lurking on the horizon .
Even though theatrical box office is up , largely thanks to sky - high 3 - D ticket prices , DVD revenues are plunging , having dropped as much as 25 % at some studios .
People are renting movies for a couple of bucks or , as is the case with tons of young moviegoers , watching them in various , not entirely legal fashions , on the Internet .
That 's why , as this fascinating Wall Street Journal story revealed over the weekend , the Hollywood studios are in discussions with executives from Time Warner Cable about a premium video - on - demand proposal that would allow consumers to watch movies at home just 30 days after their theatrical release for $ 20 to $ 30 per film .
No one has officially signed on to the deal , but with Comcast taking over the reins at Universal , with Disney clearly moving ahead with significant window - smashing experiments and with Warners looking to exploit its cable muscle , it 's a plan whose time is a coming .
Frankly , with the studio's DVD - fueled profit margins quickly melting away , the only people standing in the way are movie theater owners .
You know them -- they 're the people who have been resistant to nearly every trend in the history of the business , starting with the arrival of sound .
Whenever a studio tried to cut its DVD window , exhibitors raise a hue and cry , beat their chests and threaten to pull the studio's product from their theaters .
What to do ?
Here 's my own modest proposal .
I think its time for an even more radical experiment , but one that could work if the studios were willing to make exhibitors their partners .
Why not let us see a movie right away , not just 30 days down the line , but the same weekend that it opens in the theaters , and pay an even bigger premium to watch it at home in our living rooms , the same rooms millions of people have spent thousands of dollars outfitting with flat - screen TVs and fancy sound systems ?
Studios routinely spend $ 50 million marketing big new theatrical releases .
Why not get even more bang for your buck right away , instead of waiting to ramp up the campaign again months later when the DVD arrives ?
The perfect opportunity would have been with a film like DreamWorks ' " Shrek Forever After . "
The fourth film in the long - running " Shrek " series , it stumbled to a disappointingly soft $ 71 million at the box office , either because " Shrek " - mania had abated or , as some experts theorize , because families were put off by the higher 3 - D prices and either stayed home or paid $ 4 less to see it in 2 - D .
It was n't a bad movie , since it earned an impressive A from CinemaScore .
It just was n't a must - see in a theater movie , at least not at today 's high prices .
If you 're a studio with a top - of - the - line film , like " Iron Man 2 " or the upcoming " Toy Story 3 , " there 's no way you 'd want to discourage anyone from paying full freight to see it in a theater .
But if you have a tired franchise , or a modest romantic comedy , why not experiment with a day and date release -- and make the experiment palatable to exhibitors by cutting them in on the action ?
Once you factor in popcorn , sodas and parking , a family of four could easily have spent more than $ 100 to see " Shrek " at their local multiplex this last weekend .
So why would n't they be just as happy to pay $ 50 to stay at home , invite over a few friends and watch it on a big TV , especially since 3 - D clearly was n't a drawing card for the film ?
To overcome exhibitor objections , DreamWorks could have made the theater owners their partners , splitting the proceeds or allowing for some sort of sliding scale of shared income , depending on different potential models for potential loss of theater ticket sales .
It would n't necessarily be a goldmine for the studio who breaks the ice , since they would have to offer a sweet deal to theater owners in order to overcome their resistance .
But on the other hand , it would allow everyone to see some real - life results that might open some eyes .
There 's a legitimate debate about whether day - and - date releases would cannibalize the potential viewing audience or significantly expand the potential viewing audience .
On the other hand , I 'd argue that you would still get plenty of DVD sales down the road , since a $ 50 day and date release would simply be creating another window of opportunity for moviegoers who want the instant fix of seeing a movie , but prefer to watch it at home .
Either way , it 's time someone started doing some serious experimentation .
I hardly need to remind anyone of what happened to the music business when it tried to hold on to its old business model until it was too late to salvage anything .
It seems all too obvious that the movie business ' most loyal customers are voting with their wallets , abandoning DVDs for cheap movie rentals and illegal downloads .
When it comes to new technology , there 's no stopping change .
All you can do is co-opt it .
And if movie studios are going to make the leap into the brave new world , they 'll have to find a way to drag stodgy theater owners along with them .
So it 's time someone hammered out a formula that could allow for a few visionary experiments to unfold .
It 's pretty obvious " Shrek Forever After " did n't have the goods to drag enough families out of the house this last weekend .
But what if the movie could 've come to them instead ?
My bet is that the audience would have expanded , not contracted , but it 's long overdue for someone to test that theory out in the marketplace .

While the world media was focused on a boring battle between the Tories and their New Labour cousins in Britain , a historic struggle was underway in Nepal .
Nine months after the victory of the Maoists in the 2008 constituent assembly ( CA ) elections , bourgeois forces , with support from the Indian government , succeeded in forcing them out of power .
They were replaced by a 22 - party coalition , dominated by the Nepali Congress ( NC ) and the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxist Leninist ) ( UML ) , that has unsuccessfully tried to govern the country since May 2009 .
A constitutional crisis looms , since the interim constitution will expire on May 28 ; the new constitution is far from written and the CA cannot be extended without a deal between the Maoists and the ruling coalition or the declaration of an emergency .
It was in this context that the Maoists called for an indefinite countrywide general strike demanding the resignation of the incumbent Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal and the formation of a national unity government .
1
It is difficult to describe the scale and character of the general strike .
In terms of sheer numbers , the strike was impressive ; various estimates suggest that , on May Day and the first few days of the strike ( which lasted from May 2 - 7 ) , the Maoists succeeded in mobilizing several hundred thousand activists in Kathmandu alone .
However , it is two distinctive features , which on the surface appear dichotomous , that combined to make this mass mobilization unique .
The first is that the Maoist activists were not only superbly organized with clear chains of command and impressive discipline — they were also bound together by a unity of purpose driven by high levels of political awareness .
While this might suggest a forbidding paramilitary gathering , the reality of the Maoist gathering in Kathmandu was just the opposite .
Much of the day and significant parts of political rallies were spent in cultural activities ; street intersections became sites for hours of singing and dancing .
The women and men who were part of this were very curious about outsiders but also remarkably open , honest and friendly .
These two features were reflected in the character of the strike .
Since a hundred thousand disciplined activists make for a veritable army , the strike was extraordinarily successful .
For six days , material forces bowed to political will as the wheels of the economy across Nepal ground to a halt .
In Kathmandu , almost all shops ( except for chemists ) were closed although the markets were allowed to open each day between 6 - 8 p.m .
What is striking is that it was achieved with almost no violence .
2
While businesses were shut , the atmosphere on the streets was remarkably relaxed .
People walked about freely and in the early days of the strike a superficial observer would have concluded that the country was on vacation !
The response of the government was very curious ; it did nothing at all .
The state simply melted away in the face of the Maoist mobilization .
Although small groups of the “ Armed Police Force ” stood guard at a few crucial spots , most policemen vanished from the streets .
Even the tiny flow of traffic ( comprising ambulances , diplomatic vehicles and human rights observers ) was regulated by the Maoist cadre .
Credible information suggests that the Prime Minister was unable to travel the few kilometers from his official residence to his office and ended up operating from home !
On May Day , the UN representative in Nepal explained that “ rights to peaceful assembly . . . were exemplified , ” but this misses the point .
The state cannot cede control so completely to another political force without tremendous loss of legitimacy .
What is more , strength on the streets is absolutely critical for politicians .
Politicians build capital by helping their constituents in times of need .
Who would vote for a party whose grip on the levers of the system was so weak that it was unable to resist the Maoists effectively even in a single neighborhood ?
How would such a party ever push the interests of its constituents ?
The fact that the ruling coalition had no problem acknowledging its helplessness is very revealing .
The obvious conclusion is that the NC - UML combine is not even interested in maintaining a popular base .
The government survived not because of its popular appeal but because of support from the domestic elite , the Indian government and the security establishment .
Paradoxically , the strike was a victim of its own success .
The complete economic shutdown had a deleterious impact on daily wage earners and small shopkeepers .
Second , once the Maoists had succeeded in demonstrating the impotence of the state , popular resentment started to be directed not at the government but at the Maoist establishment .
Eventually , faced with an intransigent government that evaporated from the streets but refused to relinquish power , the Maoists were forced to end their strike .
While the withdrawal of the strike might appear to be a setback , its effectiveness completely de-legitimized the NC - UML coalition .
While the strike did result in resentment against the Maoists , almost none of this translated into increased support for the government .
If anything , their formidable show of strength might well lead many of those who opposed the strike to vote for the Maoists in the next election .
However , the strike had another important consequence that has not attracted much attention : the formation of a fresh counter - revolutionary force .
On the morning of May 7 , big business , small traders and sections of the ruling coalition organized a “ peace rally ” to oppose the strike .
Text messages were crucial in getting people to the event .
A typical SMS that did the rounds was the following : “ FNCCI [ Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry ] , Nepal Chamber of Commerce , PAPAD [ Professional Alliance for Peace and Democracy ] & other non political organizations are going to organize a peace rally to oppose the Bandh [ strike ] .
. . .
Please join the rally with your family to show the strength & solidarity ” ( emphasis added ) .
This rally ended up being much bigger than either the organizers or the Maoists expected ; between thirty to fifty thousand people showed up .
The rally later overflowed into a march that ran into a small settlement of Maoists and proceeded to deliberately provoke a clash .
The possibility that such clashes might recur and spiral out of control worried the Maoists and probably played a part in their decision to end the bandh .
The unifying cry at the “ peace rally ” was that “ politics is bad . ”
Two popular comedians Madan Krishna Shrestha and Hari Bansha Acharya regaled the crowd by making fun of the entire political establishment , i.e. both the Maoists and the ruling coalition .
While the claim that all politicians and , by extension , politics itself are bad is superficially attractive , it is , in fact , representative of a deeply conservative viewpoint .
The notion that political movements should step back and allow the economy to run unhindered is a recipe for maintaining the status quo .
Whether or not these implications were clear to the majority of attendees and cultural activists at the rally , they were undoubtedly clear to its organizers .
While the Maoists leadership has attacked “ government infiltrators ” in the march for provoking a confrontation , it has been soft on the central de-politicizing message of the rally itself .
This is problematic because there is a very real danger that , in a few years , this “ peace rally ” coalition will turn into the dominant counter - revolutionary force in Nepal .
The Nepali elite probably recognizes that it cannot , any longer , defend the status quo through the current huddle of demoralized bourgeois political parties ; its only option is to attack the process of change .
However , this metamorphosis will take time and , even if the NC - UML coalition collapses ( as might happen soon ) , several more immediate battles loom in the coming weeks .
To summarize , the general strike marked a watershed in the Nepali revolution because it demonstrated the extent of the mass base that the Maoists have developed .
In this new phase of mass politics , international solidarity will be important .
While the Nepali revolution has not received the same degree of support from the international left ( especially the “ new left ” ) that Latin American revolutions have received , it represents a possibility that is different but just as exciting .
We should not lose sight of a central fact : after more than a generation , the movement in Nepal presents the first real opportunity for radical change in Asia .
So , we should do all we can to defend its gains and advance its objectives .
1 The key disagreements between the Maoists and the bourgeois parties that have held up the peace process are on the integration of Maoist fighters into the regular security forces and the form that the Nepali republic should take ; this includes questions of federalism and whether the government should be presidential or parliamentary .
2 Of course , at points , the strike was imposed using an implicit threat of violence but this is very similar to the way the state imposes its laws .

Christian can drive a car Every morning Christian Kandlbauer wakes up , dresses himself , and gets in his car to drive to work .
This may sound mundane , but for the 21 - year - old Austrian these are remarkable feats .
Doctors say he is the first person in the world to drive a car using a mind - controlled robotic limb .
Four years ago Christian lost both his arms after being electrocuted by 20,000 volts .
Now he is able to control all of the joints in his left prosthetic arm by merely thinking about what he wants his arm to do .
He has a conventional prosthetic fitted on his right side .
Experts at the medical technology company , Otto Bock Healthcare , which developed the mind - controlled arm , say it is the first project of its kind in Europe .
On Wednesday , they will announce at an international conference in Leipzig , Germany , that the technology is ready to leave the laboratory and be put to everyday use .
It is like my earlier arm - I feel that my arm is a part of my body
Christian Kandlbauer " UK patients could benefit in the next few months , " says Dr Hubert Egger , head of the research and development project for the mind - controlled arm .
" Christian is the first patient in Europe where this surgery was done , and the first person in Europe with this mind - controlled prosthetic .
In the future we hope to fit patients in the UK with prosthetics like this . "
Dr Egger 's team is publishing detailed surgical and technical guidelines for the mind controlled arm .
It involves a new technique known as targeted muscle reinnervation ( TMR ) , where nerves that once controlled a lost limb are used to control a prosthesis .
A ' sensory hand ' may follow Christian was the " guinea pig " for the four - year research project .
Surgeons at Vienna General Hospital transplanted the nerves that previously controlled his healthy limb to the chest muscles in a six - hour operation .
The transplanted nerves allow electrical impulses from the brain to reach the muscles in the chest .
The muscles act like a booster , amplifying the signal to a level that can be picked up by electrodes on the surface of the chest .
These signals are interpreted by a micro-computer , and used to control a prosthesis which responds in real time to thoughts from his brain .
This allows him to control his prosthetic arm as if it were his real arm .
Now Christian can drive , hold down a job , and even grasp a glass of beer .
" I feel very happy , " he told the BBC in a telephone interview .
" It is like my earlier arm - I feel that my arm is a part of my body . "
Lighter , stronger Scientific improvements are bringing prosthetics ever closer to the real thing .
They are now lighter , stronger , and more cosmetically appealing .
But not all amputees may be able to afford advanced prosthetics .
There is already a large discrepancy between what is available on the NHS and the expensive prosthetics provided to soldiers .
How it works
When phantom limb is ' moved ' electrical impulses from the brain move along grafted arm nerves into chest wall Muscles boost electrical sensors and they are picked up by electrodes on surface of skin Signals analysed and converted into a pattern that can be used to control the prosthetic using artificial intelligence Ernie Stables of the British Limbless Ex-Service Men 's Association ( Blesma ) says anything that is likely to improve the quality of life for amputees is welcome .
But he says expense will be a factor .
" Limb centres across the country are pretty poorly funded as it is , " he explains .
" And I expect this initiative will be prohibitively expensive in NHS circles .
" So yes , it is a significant advance , and UK patients could potentially benefit if the funding is there .
" The private option is an avenue but only very few people can afford to go down that route . "
Otto Bock says it is difficult to put a cost on the procedure .
The research project behind Christian 's prosthetic cost several million euros .
It says the cost will come down when the prosthetic goes into production .
Four years on , Christian has returned to work as a warehouse clerk at the garage that once employed him as a mechanic .
He has little memory of his accident and the days that followed .
He says it was strange when the limb was first fitted as he could n't imagine that it would work .
Now , he is simply grateful that he has the freedom to get on with his life .
" With the prosthesis I am able to do things in my daily life alone without the help of another person , " he says .
" I am independent . "

Recently by Gary North : Breakfast at the Church of the Electoral College ; Or , How Presidents Suck in Christian Suck - Ups
“ Mirror , mirror on the wall .
Who ’s to say the economy has stopped its fall ? ”
“ The NBER , dummy ! ”
The National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) is a private , nonprofit organization .
Begun in 1920 , it has focused on collecting and analyzing economic data on the U.S. economy .
It is nonpartisan .
Sixteen of the past 31 American economists who have received the Nobel Prize have been members of the NBER .
It is noted by the precision of its research and the uniquely boring style of its publications .
As young assistant professors learn early in their careers , nobody ever gets fired for quoting an NBER publication . . . or promoted .
The NBER somehow is universally regarded as having the final say about when a recession begins and ends in the United Stares .
This is not to say that other organizations slavishly adhere to the NBER ’s assessments .
But , as far as textbook accounts of when a recession begins and ends , they conform to the NBER ’s assessments .
There is an NBER committee that makes this assessment : the Business Cycle Dating Committee .
It meets infrequently .
From July 2003 until January 2008 , there were no meetings .
In December 2008 there was another meeting .
The committee announced that a recession had begun in December 2007 .
This , you may recall , was after the U.S. government had nationalized the mortgage market ( September ) , followed by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the conversion of the major investment banks to commercial banks that were eligible for TARP bailout money ( October ) .
You could n’t fool the committee !
A recession was in progress .
The committee had its first meeting since December 2008 on April 8 , 2010 .
It did not announce the end of the recession that began in December 2007 .
It released this statement .
The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research met at the organization ’s headquarters in Cambridge , Massachusetts , on April 8 , 2010 .
The committee reviewed the most recent data for all indicators relevant to the determination of a possible date of the trough in economic activity marking the end of the recession that began in December 2007 .
The trough date would identify the end of contraction and the beginning of expansion .
Although most indicators have turned up , the committee decided that the determination of the trough date on the basis of current data would be premature .
Many indicators are quite preliminary at this time and will be revised in coming months .
The committee acts only on the basis of actual indicators and does not rely on forecasts in making its determination of the dates of peaks and troughs in economic activity .
The committee did review data relating to the date of the peak , previously determined to have occurred in December 2007 , marking the onset of the recent recession .
The committee reaffirmed that peak date .
This press release is representative of the style of NBER publications .
Wise people do not read NBER publications while smoking in bed .
Translating from official NBER prose , this document reveals what most people except stock market investors already know : the economic recovery is weak at best and non-existent at worst .
The December 2007 date was a good indication of when the recession began .
There are insufficient unambiguous data available to indicate when the trough occurred .
At the next meeting , held perhaps a year from now , the committee may decide that the trough took place in the spring of 2009 .
Or it may identify another period .
Or it may again refuse to identify any end .
But the fact that the committee refused to commit at the April 8 meeting is additional evidence that experts among business cycle economists are not impressed with the extent of the recovery .
“ SELL IN MAY AND GO AWAY ”
This familiar slogan refers to stock market investing .
The summer is usually a good time to be out of the market .
Home sellers do not sell in May and go away .
They list in May and begin to pray .
They wait for June to bring Prince Charming .
Then July .
In early August , they begin to panic .
They have had no visitors .
That is when price - cutting begins in earnest .
This year , price cutting may begin in July .
The Federal Reserve has ceased to purchase the bonds of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Mortgage rates have begun creeping up .
This may lead to home purchases in the next few weeks , because the tax credit expires on April 30 .
Borrowers who want to take advantage of the tax credit must sign the papers by April 30 .
They also want to get their loans at a low rate .
What happens if rates continue to climb , as expected , and the tax credit law is not renewed again , also as expected ?
The overhang of as many as 7 million houses scheduled for foreclosure is the sword of Damocles over the residential real estate market .
Robert Shiller , whose name is on the Case - Shiller index of home prices , said on April 1 that he thinks there is a 50 - 50 chance that the housing market will go into reverse .
This is rare , he said .
We saw home prices decline between 2006 and 2009 — three years of decline .
And now that [ the market is trending ] up , you know , it ’s perfectly plausible to think we ’ll have three years or more of increases .
But I ’m not so sure .
We do n’t know how much of this is transitory because of the government support .
We ’re in such an unusual economy now that [ a double dip ] has substantial probability .
He understands that at least 80 % of the U.S. housing market is supported by the U.S. government .
It may be as high as 90 % .
“ Really almost the whole market now is government .
And we know this ca n’t last . ”
Prices are artificially inflated .
He thinks we need another Federal stimulus .
These days , what Keynesian does n’t ?
They think that the Federal Government is able to stimulate aggregate consumer demand by increasing its spending , despite that fact that the government must pull the money it spends from the public , either through taxes or borrowing .
The only other option is the Federal Reserve : fiat money .
As for the Federal Reserve , Shiller thinks it should have more regulatory power .
I think the Fed should have a lot of regulatory power .
The central banking tradition is really one of understanding market psychology .
It ’s part of what central bankers do …so that ’s the organization that should be in charge of systemic risk management .
In short , he is typical of academic economists everywhere .
He sees government spending and central banking as the twin pillars of economic recovery .
The trouble is , from the economists ’ point of view , millions of voters are beginning to figure out that the government and the FED are the problem , not the solution .
Shiller has described the new mood of a growing minority of voters .
One thing George Akerlof and I talk about in our book , Animal Spirits , is that the economy is driven by stories .
And there ’s a story at any point in time that colors people ’s thinking .
Right now the story is one of anger , frustration , and disillusionment — mistrust .
The Tea Party movement is one result of that .
And that is potentially holding back the economy .
The public has caught onto the fact that the Federal government and the Federal Reserve System have , in the immortal words of astronaut Gus Grissom , screwed the pooch .
The economy is still weak , unemployment remains high , businesses are not hiring , commercial banks are not lending , the crash in commercial real estate is accelerating , the Option ARM and Alt - A mortgages re-sets are beginning their two - year acceleration .
Meanwhile , politicians are not cutting taxes or cutting the deficit .
They are raising both .
Now the Federal Reserve and the Federal government are pulling the plug on the housing market subsidies .
Foreclosure rates are about to climb .
Housing had been an engine of growth , debt , and widespread optimism until early 2007 .
Housing was widely regarded as the engine of the recovery out of the 2001 recession .
It no longer is .
In January , about 29 % of all U.S. home sales were distressed sales .
This is going to rise .
This is because short sales will increase .
So will foreclosures .
This means that the number of non-distressed sales will have to rise sharply in order to keep the distressed - sales figure at 30 % .
But the government has ended the subsidies .
Economist John Lounsbury has estimated that if distressed sales increase to 35 % in 2010 , this could sharply reduce home prices .
The price discount on distressed homes three years ago was 45 % .
Last year , it was 20 % .
It is now averaging over 30 % : past 12 months .
Because of the increase in distressed sales coupled with an increase in discounting , he thinks that an overall housing price drop of 30 % is possible this year .
I am not this pessimistic .
I think 15 % is more likely , January to December .
But there is nothing I see on the horizon that will keep this from repeating in 2011 .
The grinding reduction in household equity that began in 2007 is going to continue in 2010 and 2011 .
The average American family ’s main source of equity has been its home .
This investment is now producing losses .
As this process continues , middle - class Americans will finally abandon hope in a reversal in this decline .
They will hope for the stabilization of the housing markets .
They will hope only not to lose any more capital .
The housing market for the rich is worse than the housing markets of the middle class .
There are fewer buyers .
Jumbo loans are more expensive to finance and fewer people are qualifying for them .
Buyers know this is a buyers ’ market .
They are holding out for lower prices .
They do not have to move up .
They can wait for prices to move down .
At some point , present owners will move out .
CONCLUSION
When the academic experts in recessions and recoveries postpone a decision to announce the end of the recession , the economy is weak .
When the engine of recovery — residential real estate — is headed for rising mortgage rates , rising foreclosures , and the end of the tax credit , the recovery looks less sustainable .
When Keynesian economists call for another stimulus , the traditional Keynesian policy is failing to deliver the goods .
The public is catching on to the games Congress plays .
This will increase over the summer .
A political earthquake has begun .
We have felt a few tremors .
I think a major quake will hit in November .
This is all to the good politically .
But it does not solve the problem of the faltering recovery .

* Travel / Places Category Winner * " This shot was half planned and half happy accident .
I was on vacation in Cape May , NJ , last July , and found this lighthouse while exploring the beach .
I knew I had to shoot it — just did n't know what I wanted it to look like .
Then the idea of a composite came to me .
I captured just the lighthouse one day , shooting close - ups and from a distance to cover enough angles to choose from .
Then I went back the next day at roughly the same time to photograph the seagulls .
The sun was n't as much of a difficulty as you would expect — framing it behind the lighthouse , I bracketed all my shots so I knew I would get the look I wanted .

Taking advantage of the Easter floods in southern Illinois , a small crew of Peeps set sail on the Mississippi River .
A risk , perhaps , but when considering the alternative , it was one worth taking .
For the record , they made it to the main channel and drifted out of sight .
Here 's to the Peeps .
May they reach New Orleans .

Hi !
Welcome to my old webcomic .
Maybe I 'll update it again sometime !
For newer stuff you should check out my tumblr .
Luge Crash at the Olympics
Nodar Kumaritashvili , a luge athlete , was killed during a training run Friday on the Olympic track , which is the fastest in the world .
The Baja California Earthquake on April 4 , 2010 left a fair amount of localized destruction and wide - spread shaken nerves in its wake , but thankfully it was not nearly as devastating as could have been .
At 7.2 on the Moment Magnitude Scale ( an updated , more precise measurement than the Richter scale for large earthquakes ) , the quake released more energy than the Loma Prieta earthquake that knocked down many parts of San Francisco and Oakland in 1989 .
This was a butt - kicking earthquake .
It lasted for approximately a minute ( compared to 10 - 15 seconds for Loma Prieta ) .
The power of it can be seen through some phenomenal photos taken during and just after its occurrence – Route 5 heading south of Mexicali has developed massive cracks , and the dust rising off the surrounding mountains show how an earthquake this size treats the surface of the planet like someone trying to shake the sand out of a beach blanket .
Fortunately , the area where the earthquake occurred is not a densely populated metropolitan zone such as San Francisco or Los Angeles .
Mexicali and its surroundings are largely agricultural , with a desert that stretches far beyond .
The principal buildings are low - rise , and there is no major transportation / freeway network in the area ; disruptions will be quickly re-routed .
Incidentally , every time I ’ve passed through the city I ’ve managed to get completely lost , and once even had an early - morning police escort to the border .
But that ’s unrelated 😉
Here ’s how seismometers work , and how to build one of your own :
Earthquakes are measured by seismometers ( or seismographs , if the instrument includes the ability to graph the strength of the earthquake . )
The main component is an internal weight that is suspended by a spring system , or electronically on modern units .
The mass of the weight keeps it in a steady position while vibration or shaking moves its casing .
A sensor connected to the unit detects this motion ( magnetically , optically or electrically ) and sends a signal to an amplifier and processor that translates the motion into interpretable signals .
Professional seismometers are highly sensitive , measuring movement in three directions ( north / south , east / west , and vertical ) , and carefully mounted on bedrock in locations that are resistant to temperature , weather , tidal and humidity effects .
=================
The simplest way to play with a rudimentary seismograph is to install Seismac onto a MacBook or MacBook Pro laptop .
The software accesses the built - in sudden motion sensors ( designed to protect the hard drive in case of a fall ) , displaying an X - Y - Z graph .
The sensitivity is quite impressive – placed on a cement floor , you can jump up and down a few feet away and observe the vibration it causes .
I used this software a bit on the Catch It Keep
It TV show to check the amount of ground movement caused by the explosions in our “ Pyramid of Beer ” episode .
=================
Amazon sells a very simple seismograph model that uses the same basic principles that more advanced units work on .
Good for classroom demonstrations on how these units operate : SciEd Seismograph Model
=================
A more advanced and sensitive seismometer unit is the AS - 1 . Developed by Jeff Batten , aka Amateur Seismologist .
You can buy a pre-built unit from Jeff through his website ( around $ 675 ) , or build your own using easy to find materials as many have done .
Pretty much everything you need to build the unit can be found at Lowes Hardware .
The AS - 1 is a well - regarded unit that is used by scores of amateur seismologists and in many classrooms around the globe .
Because of this , there is an incredible amount of information available on its construction , calibration , and use .
One good place to start is the IRIS site .
“ IRIS is a consortium of over 100 US universities dedicated to the operation of science facilities for the acquisition , management , and distribution of seismological data . ”
This organization and the network of home - run DIY seismographs provides a useful element to compiling and understanding earthquakes .
The AS - 1 unit works by suspending a magnet over a sensing coil .
Any magnet movement ( ground shake ) imparts an electrical signal that is amplified and processed ( similar in principle to how the strings of an electric guitar interact with the pickups and amplifier ) .
The magnet is affixed to a hinged arm that is held steady with a spring that is tuned to give it a slower frequency , which helps eliminate minor vibrations .
The oscillations of the unit are dampened by an oil - filled unit that acts like the hydraulic shock absorbers on a car .
By forcing a branch of the arm to push itself through a resistive path , the spring ’s tendency to continue vibrating is diminished greatly .
A magnetic dampener is also an option , as seen on Mckimzey ’s unit ( he also has many useful photos in his writeup ) .
Here is a series of videos on the assembly and setup of the AS - 1 unit .
These will assist greatly in putting your unit together .
And a few diagrams and photos to help with assembly as well :
( Make sure to check Dewayne Hill ’s , John Lahr ’s , and Mckimzey ’s pages for more photos and info ) :
If you want to get technical with it , the preamplifier can be home - built using the schematics found on Andy Loomis ’ site .
A list of details on setting up the completed unit are available from San Diego State University ’s AS1 page .
Another option to the AS - 1 is following the instructions on Infiltec ’s How To Build a Low - Cost Seismograph site .
A lot of good information on here about the electronics , which can be the trickiest part .
They make a kit to assemble for this .
Cool stuff .
The final piece is the software that allows you to record and chart the seismic activity your unit is now measuring .
A widely used freeware is available called AmaSeis , developed through the IRIS organization .
A very useful PDF for setting up the AS - 1 and AmaSeis can be downloaded here .

It is well known that one can not simply look at the temperature and cloud cover of different * regions * to deduce cloud feedbacks .
Even [ the ] examples of regions which have experienced “ higher than average warming ” do not make any sense : deserts , forests , ice sheets and glaciers , the Arctic and Antarctic .
Of these , only the Arctic has obviously experienced higher than average warming .
But this is a red herring anyway .
Cloudy and clear regions are interconnected as a single system , and cannot be pointed to separately to infer much of anything about cloud feedbacks .
Generally speaking , cloudy regions are where rising air driven by latent heat release in clouds exists , and clear regions are where air sinks in response to the rising air , sometimes thousands of kilometers away .
Determining cloud feedbacks is not a matter of comparing these cloudy regions to the clear regions , but a matter of determining how the whole system changes with warming , e.g. , when averaged over the whole Earth , does average cloudiness increase or decrease with warming ?
This is what I am talking about , and what researchers of the subject publish results on .
[ Patrick Lockerby 's ] criticism of the simple climate model I use to demonstrate basic concepts is that my assumed ocean depth for mixing of heat ( 50 meters ) is a poor choice ... [ I ]t is clear he has not read any of my writings on the subject since the cloud ' illusion '
I am talking about exists independent of the assumed ocean depth , independent of the time scale of the forcings that cause temperature change , and independent of whether the model experiment assumes positive or negative cloud feedback .
These are all adjustable parameters in the model , which is publicly available .
In conclusion , I should point out that the handful of top climate researchers who provided the peer review of our papers on this subject do indeed understand what I am talking about .
It would behoove Mr. Lockerby to also come up to speed before he criticizes that which he does not understand .
Two weeks ago , I interviewed Dr. Roy Spencer from the University of Alabama , Huntsville .
Spencer is a trained atmospheric scientist and actively publishes in peer - reviewed journals – he is also a global warming skeptic .
Given his background and contrarian views , I asked Spencer what evidence there is to suggest that a majority of the climate science community is wrong about global warming .
He explained that the IPCC climate models used to forecast drastic temperature increases assume that low level clouds , which tend to cool the climate , dissipate in response to warming from CO2 emissions .
The assumption is based on the observation that warmer years tend to have less cloud cover than cooler years .
Spencer argues that the IPCC is mixing up cause and effect ; the warming could actually be caused by decreases in cloud cover .
If he is correct , there are good reasons to believe that increases in cloud cover will mitigate the warming caused by CO2 emissions , and , as a result , global warming may not be the disaster many scientists anticipate .
Some readers took issue with that theory .
Patrick Lockerby was so moved by the interview that he wrote a fairly lengthy rebuttal to it .
Given the detailed criticism , I asked Spencer to briefly respond .
Patrick Lockerby argues that Spencer 's theory has been falsified because regions of the earth with both the least and most amounts of cloud cover are experiencing above average warming .
If both regions are warming , how can clouds mitigate global warming ?
Roy Spencer : Lockerby also took issue with the assumed 50 meter ocean depth in Spencer 's model .
The argument being that any model making unrealistic assumptions cannot accurately explain what is really happening .
An ocean depth of 50 meters is not realistic ; therefore , Spencer 's model has little scientific value .
Roy Spencer :
Companies that operate critical infrastructures and do not voluntarily allow the federal government to install monitoring software on their networks to detect possible cyberattacks would face the " wild " internet on their own and place us all at risk , a top Pentagon official seemed to say Wednesday .
Defense Deputy Secretary William Lynn III , speaking at the Strategic Command Cyber Symposium in Nebraska , said we need to think imaginatively about how to use the National Security Agency 's Einstein monitoring systems on critical private - sector networks – such as those in the financial , utility and communication industries – in order to protect us .
" Operators of critical infrastructure could opt in to a government - sponsored security regime , " Lynn said .
Otherwise , " individual users who do not want to enroll could stay in the wild wild west of the unprotected internet . "
Failure to protect the power grids , transportation system , or financial sector , he said , " could lead to physical damage and economic disruption on a massive scale . "
Privacy and civil liberties groups , however , have raised concerns about the Einstein systems with regard to what information they would collect and share with the government and what oversight , if any , would be put in place to ensure that federal privacy and wiretapping laws are not violated .
The Einstein programs are intrusion - detection and response systems developed by the National Security Agency .
The government is in the process of deploying Einstein 2 to federal networks to inspect traffic for malicious threats , but there has been talk of deploying it to private - sector networks as well .
Intrusion - detection systems are already a standard tool in the defense arsenal of private - sector businesses , and the government has been unclear about how its system surpasses those already available to companies .
Einstein 2 is designed to perform automated full - packet inspection of traffic entering and exiting government networks using signature - based intrusion - detection technology , according to the government 's secret cybersecurity plan , part of which was recently declassied .
The system has the ability to alert the government 's Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US - CERT ) in real time , if it detects potentially harmful activity .
Einstein 3 is another system in development that aims to go one step further to block cyberattacks in real time .
According to the government , Einstein 3 will allow US - CERT to automatically share information about threats with other federal agencies " and , when deemed necessary by DHS , to send alerts that do not contain the content of communications to the National Security Agency ( NSA ) so that DHS efforts may be supported by NSA exercising its lawfully authorized missions . "
In 2008 , DHS 's Privacy Office published a Privacy Impact Assessment ( .pdf ) on early versions of Einstein 2 , but has not published one on Einstein 3 .
The assessment left many questions unanswered , such as the extent of the NSA 's role in the programs and whether information obtained by the monitoring systems will be shared with law enforcement or other intelligence agencies .

Fellow Workers :
In my allotted time , I hope to drill down a bit , and to say something about the structural features , and some of the mechanisms of what we might call state capitalism — of how , in this actually existing economy , the political structure of capitalism 2 ( to use Gary Chartier ’s threefold distinction ) tend to produce and sustain the material conditions of capitalism 3 — how state corporatism promotes the bosses ’ economy .
Most of my remarks will be broadly historical and economic in character — although necessarily of a sketchy or programmatic sort , given the constraints of time and format .
So consider this an outline of directions for inquiry and discussion ; an attempt to show you briefly where key landmarks of the free market anti-capitalist analysis are at , rather than an attempt at a full guided tour .
I think it important to at least sketch out the map because the chief obstacle that free market anti-capitalists confront in explaining our position is not so much a matter of correcting particular mistakes in political principles , or economic analysis ( although there are particular mistakes we hope to address and correct ) .
It is more a matter of convincing our conversation partners to make a sort of aspect - shift , to adopt a new point of view from which to see the political - economic gestalt .
When I was growing up , respect was the most important thing to my father .
That ’s what he talked about every day to me , Jose and Yadier .
You play the game with respect , yes — but it ’s not only about the game .
You respect your parents and your teachers and your fellow human beings .
That ’s why ESPN ’s sarcastic depiction of me running in slow motion down third base and getting thrown out at home in the Marlins ’ game was hard to take .
I appreciated That ’s why ESPN ’s sarcastic depiction of me running in slow motion down third base and getting thrown out at home in the Marlins ’ game was hard to take .
I appreciated Henry Schulman ’s blog entry about it .
Until recently , I had thought of ESPN as a network run by professionals who know sports .
I thought the people at ESPN , because they focus only on sports , actually understood the game and what pro athletes do to reach the highest level of their sport .
In that Marlins game , which we won , Nate Schierholtz went three - for - three with his first home run of the season .
Matt Cain pitched six innings of no -hit ball .
And the one highlight ESPN shows of that game is me getting thrown out at home ?
And they ’re doing it just for laughs ?
Look , you can say I ’m the slowest guy in baseball or in all of sports or in the entire world .
I do n’t take issue with that because I AM the slowest guy .
I have always been the slowest guy .
I ca n’t challenge that criticism .
But ESPN ’s intention was not to criticize but to humiliate .
I take what I do very seriously , which is why – despite my obvious lack of speed – I have managed to play in the major leagues for 11 seasons .
I play hard .
I play hurt .
I respect the game , my teammates , the press , the fans .
That ’s how I was raised .
It was the No. 1 thing .
I know I ’m a public figure and I just have to take my lumps .
But I would like those people at ESPN who , from a safe distance , make fun of players for a cheap laugh , to remember that players are actual people .
With wives and mothers and fathers and children and brothers and sisters .
My mother saw the clip .
She does n’t speak English so she asked Yadier ’s wife what the announcer was saying .
Yadier ’s wife did n’t want to tell her .
My mom was pretty upset .
She did n’t understand why they were making fun of my running when there are so many other things I do every day to help the team win .
I told her I did n’t understand it , either .
All I can do is play the way I always have – with respect and professionalism .
It ’s shame that ESPN , a once great network , wo n’t have any idea what I ’m talking about .
Sharp has developed a 3D camera module for mobile devices capable of capturing high - definition 720 p 3D video images , an industry first .
Mass production of these modules will begin within 2010 .
Sharp said they will start shipping samples in July .
3D images are composed of two views taken using two cameras that simultaneously capture separate images for the right and left eyes .
Consequently , a 3D camera requires peripheral circuitry to apply image processing to the two images , for example , to adjust color or to correct positioning between the images from the two cameras .
Manufacturers have thus been pursuing designs that reduce the size and weight of 3D cameras and seeking ways to shorten their development period .
According to Sharp , their new 3D camera incorporates functions to process the image data output by the left and right cameras , including Color Synchronizing Processing to adjust color and brightness , Timing Synchronizing Processing to synchronize the timing of the video signals , and Optical Axis Control Processing to correct positioning .
Fast Readout Technology transfers video data from the image sensor , enabling 3D images to be captured in high - resolution HD mode .
In developing this camera module , Sharp also applied high - density mounting technology to achieve a compact form .
" Embedding this camera module in mobile devices such as digital cameras , mobile phones , and smartphones will contribute to the development of a wide range of new , innovative communications tools , " the company said .

Sources close to the Swedish Elite League informed LitterBoxCats.com on Friday evening that Panthers goaltending prospect Jacob Markstrom - whom many observers consider the best netminder currently outside the NHL - has signed a 3 - year entry - level contract with Florida .
Details of the deal have not been disclosed .
Markstrom - fresh off a bronze medal in the recently concluded IIHF World Championship in Germany - is a second round selection ( 31st overall ) by Florida in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft , and is widely viewed as the Panthers ' " future " in net .
This was an expected development , as GM Dale Tallon recently stated he and Markstrom 's agent were speaking regularly .
More to follow soon .
UPDATES :
Robertson , who first revealed that she had an eating disorder in 2017 , also shared how her faith in God helped her get through it .
In February of 2010 , I began collecting information from professionally published novelists .
My goal was to learn how writers broke in and made that first big novel deal , and to use actual data to confirm or bust some of the myths about making it as a novelist .
My thanks to everyone who participated , as well as the folks at Smart Bitches Trashy Books , Book View Cafe , SFWA , SF Novelists , Absolute Write , and everyone else who helped to spread the word .
The survey closed on March 15 , 2010 with 247 responses .
For those interested in the raw info , I ’ve posted an Excel spreadsheet of the data with all identifying information removed .
You can download that spreadsheet here .
I ’ve broken my write - up into nine parts :
The Data
For this study , I was looking for authors who had published at least one professional novel , where “ professional ” was defined as earning an advance of $ 2000 or more .
This is an arbitrary amount based on SFWA ’s criteria for professional publishers .
No judgment is implied toward authors who self - publish or work with smaller presses , but for this study , I wanted data on breaking in with the larger publishers .
247 authors from a range of genres responded .
One was eliminated because the book did n’t fit the criteria ( it was a nonfiction title ) .
A random audit found no other problems .
The results were heavily weighted toward SF / F , which is no surprise , given that it was a fantasy author doing the study .
But I think this is a respectable range :
The year in which authors made their first sale covered more than 30 years , from 1974 to 2010 .
The data is heavily weighted toward the past decade .
There ’s the background information in a nutshell .
With that out of the way , let ’s get to the first myth .
The Short Story Path to Publication
Back when I was a struggling young author in the late 90s , I received a great deal of contradictory advice about how to break in .
Many writers told me I had to sell short stories first to hone my craft and build a reputation so agents and editors would pay attention to me .
Others said this was outdated , and these days I could skip short fiction if I wanted and just jump straight into novel writing .
So do you really have to sell short fiction first ?
I asked how many short stories people sold , if any , before making that first professional novel sale .
Answers ranged from 0 to 400 short fiction sales .
On average , authors sold 7.7 short stories before selling the novel .
Next I looked at the median , the midway point in the sample .
The median number of short fiction sales was 1 , meaning half of the authors sold more than this many , and half sold fewer .
But let ’s make this even simpler .
Of 246 authors , 116 sold their first novel with zero short fiction sales .
Possible Data Quality Issue :
The question was “ How many short fiction sales , if any , did you have before making your first professional novel sale ? ”
Several authors noted that they only included “ professional ” short fiction sales , which might reduce the numbers .
But even so , the idea that you must do short fiction first appears busted .
Not only that , but looking at a scatterplot of the number of short fiction sales and the year of the first novel sale , this appears to be busted going back at least 30 years .
I believe short fiction sales can help an author .
One author noted that they were contacted directly by an editor who had read the author ’s short fiction and wanted to know if the author had a novel .
Personally , I found that short fiction helped me a lot with certain aspects of the craft .
And of course , a lot of us just enjoy writing short stories .
But it ’s not a requirement to selling a novel .
Self - Publishing Your Breakout Novel
For as long as I ’ve been writing , some authors have been announcing the death of traditional publishing .
Especially with the growth of print - on - demand and electronic publishing , I hear that self - publishing is the way to go .
The idea is that if you self - publish successfully , you ’ll attract the notice of the big publishers and end up with a major contract , like Christopher Paolini did with Eragon .
One of the survey questions asked how authors sold their first novel to a professional publisher .
The options were :
Self - published , then sold the book to a professional publisher
Published with a small press , then sold the book to a professional publisher
Submitted directly to a professional publisher , who bought it
Submitted to an agent , who sold the book to a professional publisher
Other
To those proclaiming queries and the slush pile are for suckers , and self - publishing is the way to land a major novel deal , I have bad news : only 1 author out of 246 self - published their book and went on to sell that book to a professional publisher .
There was also 1 “ Other ” response where the author published the book on his web site and received an offer from a professional publisher .
( It should be noted that this author already had a very popular web site , which contributed to the book being noticed and picked up . )
Just to be safe , I ran a second analysis , restricting the results to only those books that sold within the past five years .
PoD is a relatively new technology , so it ’s possible the trends have changed .
But the results are pretty much identical .
This does not mean self - publishing can never succeed , or is never a viable option .
( I.e. , please do n’t use this as an excuse for a “ Jim hates self - publishing ” rant . )
However , for those hoping to leverage self - published book sales into a commercially published breakout book ( a la Eragon ) , the numbers just are n’t in your favor .
For the moment at least , the traditional pathways — submitting to an agent , submitting directly to the publisher — still appear to be the way to go .
Also , please see below for Steven Saus ’ graph showing the trend away from submitting directly to the publisher and more toward querying agents in recent years .
The Overnight Success Story
When I started writing , I figured it was easy .
I thought anyone could do it .
Having zipped off my first story , I assumed fame and fortune would soon be mine .
And why not ?
How often do we see the movies where someone sits down at the computer , and after a quick writing montage , voila !
They ’re a published author .
( Generally this seems to mean big book tours , winning awards , hanging with Oprah , and living the good life . )
So how long does it take to sell that book ?
Of our 246 authors , the average age at the time they sold their first professional novel was 36.2 years old .
The median was also 36 , and the mode was 37 .
Basically , the mid-to - late 30’s is a good age to sell a book .
But that does n’t tell us how long these authors were working at their craft .
So the very next question in the survey asked , “ How many years had you been writing before you made your first professional novel sale ? ”
The responses ranged from a single respondent who said 0 years , all the way to 41 years , with an average of 11.6 years .
Both the median and the mode came in at an even ten years .
You could argue that the single response from someone who had been writing for 0 years proves that overnight success can happen , and you ’re right .
It can happen .
So can getting struck by lightning .
Here ’s the breakdown in nice , graphical form :
I also asked how many books people had written before they sold one to a major publisher .
The average was between three and four .
Median was two .
I was surprised , however , to see that the mode was zero.
58 authors sold the first novel they wrote .
Still a minority , but a larger minority than I expected .
I ’m still going to call this one busted .
Not as thoroughly busted as I would have guessed , but the bottom line is that it takes time and practice to master any skill , including writing .
You Have to Know Somebody
This one goes back to the idea that it ’s nigh impossible to break in as an unknown writer .
You have to have an in .
Without those connections , editors and agents will never pay you the slightest bit of attention .
This was a little trickier to test .
I asked two questions :
1 . What connections did you have , if any , that helped you find your publisher ?
Met editor in person at a convention or other business - related event
Knew them personally ( not business - related )
Introduced / referred by a mutual friend
Other
2 . What connections did you have , if any , that helped you find your agent ?
Met editor in person at a convention or other business - related event
Knew them personally ( not business - related )
Introduced / referred by a mutual friend
I sold my book without an agent
Other
The most popular response in the “ Other ” category was “ None ” or “ No connection at all . ”
Ignoring the “ Other ” category for the moment , all other responses were selected a grand total of 162 times .
More importantly , 185 authors listed no connections whatsoever to their publisher before selling their books .
115 listed no connections at all to any agents , either .
( 62 others added that they did not use an agent to sell their first book . )
Combining the agent and publisher questions , a total of 140 — more than half — made that first professional novel sale with no connections to either the publisher or the agent .
Here ’s the percentage breakdown :
Met editor at a convention : 17 %
Knew editor personally : 3 %
Referred to editor : 11 %
Met agent at a convention : 11 %
Knew agent personally : 4 %
Referred to agent : 21 %
Did not use an agent : 25 %
The “ Other ” categories also included a small number of authors who reported winning contests , short story sales that attracted interest , industry connections , and in one case , SFWA membership .
My conclusion is that connections can certainly help .
Agent referrals in particular — it ’s always nice to check with other authors to see who represents them , and if you can get a referral , so much the better .
But the idea that you have to have a connection ?
Or even that most authors knew someone before they broke in ?
Busted .
Can You Boost Your Odds ?
As has been pointed out ( by my own agent , among others ) , while connections are n’t required , they can be helpful .
I wanted to know what other steps authors took to try to improve their chances , and asked whether participants had done any of the following :
Attended conventions
Attended one or more writers groups
Earned an undergrad degree in English / Writing
Earned a graduate degree in English / Writing
Attended a weekend writing workshop
Attended a week - long writing workshop
Attended a longer writing workshop
None of the above
By far , the two most popular choices were conventions and writers groups , both of which were reported by more than half of our novelists .
The least popular choice ?
The graduate degree in English / Writing .
( As someone who holds an MA in English , I ’m trying not to be depressed about that one . )
The full breakdown looks like so :
Remember , this is correlative data , not causative .
However , I decided to take a look at a few more correlations , taking the writers from each of these categories and examining how many years it took to make that first pro novel sale .
I bolded the highs and lows .
Full Group : Average 11.6 years , median 10 , mode 10
Conventions : Average 10.5 years , median and mode unchanged
Writers Groups : Average 10.5 years , and median drops to 9.5
Undergrad Degree : Average 9.8 years , median 6.5 , mode 3.5
Graduate Degree : Average 11.8 years , median 10 , mode 6
Weekend Workshop : Average 10.7 , median 8.5 , mode 3
Week - long Workshop : Average 10.7 , median 8.5 , mode 6
Longer Workshop : Average 11.6 , median 10 , mode 6
None : Average 15.7 years , median 15 , mode 9
I ’m reluctant to draw too many conclusions from this , or to say that any one category will definitely help you break in .
But looking at the “ None ” category , I think it ’s safe to say that writers who are more actively trying to get out and build their careers — in any one of a number of ways — tend to break in faster than those who are n’t .
Survey Flaws
This was not a perfect study .
It was n’t meant to be .
I wanted a large enough sample to start to see some trends , but I ’m not qualified to run a full - scale , controlled study .
Nor do I have the time .
In the interest of full disclosure , here are the flaws I ’m aware of .
1. Sample bias .
I ’m a fantasy author .
When I announced the survey and asked for authors to participate , I knew the results would be heavily skewed toward SF / F writers in my network .
I did some outreach to spread the word to other writing groups and blogs , but the results are still weighted toward SF / F and may not apply as strongly to other genres .
2. Question imprecision .
Several questions were imprecisely worded .
For example , one question asked “ How many times , if any , was your novel rejected before it sold to a professional publisher ? ”
I received enough comments and questions about this , asking whether I meant publisher rejections , agent rejections , or both , that I did not include the final data in my write - up .
I ’m also unhappy with one of the networking questions which asked if you were introduced / referred to your agent or editor .
“ Referral ” is fairly broad , and could mean everything from a personal letter of recommendation to an author saying “ Oh yes , Bob ’s my agent and I think he ’s open to queries right now . ”
3 . Ca n’t prove cause / effect .
This is a weakness of correlative data .
I think the data worked well for busting certain myths , but if I catch anyone saying things like “ Jim Hines proved that if you get an undergrad degree in English , you ’ll sell a novel faster , ” then I will personally boot you in the head .
See here for a good example of correlation =/= causation re : pirates and global warming .
4. Limited scope .
I restricted this survey to authors who had published at least one novel with a professional ( $ 2000 or higher advance ) publisher .
Not everyone shares the goal of publishing professionally .
For those who prefer the small press , non-fiction , script writing , short fiction , or other forms of writing , the path to breaking in might be very different .
I ’m sure there are other flaws .
However , it was my goal and my hope that even with these problems , the data I gathered would be useful in talking about how writers break in , and would be much better than the anecdotal “ evidence ” usually cited in such conversations .
Other Resources
Steven Saus’ Analysis of my Survey Data : Steven ran my numbers through some heavy - duty statistical software and came up with all sorts of info , including this graph showing the apparent trend in how submissions have moved from direct - to - publisher more toward querying agents over the past few decades .
For those who like to geek out on numbers and statistics , I recommend checking it out .
Tobias Buckell ’s Author Advance Survey : Data from 108 authors about novel advances , showing trends over time and over the course of authors ’ careers .
Megan Crewe ’s Publishing Connections Survey : Data from 270 authors on whether you need connections to break in .
Her results tend to match my own on this one .
SFWA ’s Online Information Center : Includes essays , resources , and advice for new writers from the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America .
( Thanks to Charlie Stross for the link . )
Final Thoughts
My thanks once again to everyone who participated in the study , who spread the links to other writers , and for all of the support and encouragement .
I ’m quite pleased with the way this turned out , and I hope it ’s helpful to others .
In conclusion ( and in true Mythbusters style ) I present you with this artistic rendering of my editor when she learns how much time I ’ve spent on this survey instead of working on my next book :
Update , 2 pm PT : HOW TO HELP , after the jump .
Above , this photo just posted to the Guatemalan Government 's Flickr feed shows a spontaneous sinkhole ( " hundimiento " ) 20 meters deep and 15 wide that appeared today in Zone 2 of Guatemala City , after overwhelming saturation of rains from tropical storm Agatha .
Local press reports that it swallowed an entire 3 - story building .
Not Photoshop , sadly : these happen from time to time during major storms in part because of unstable geology , and in part , bad urban engineering — read more about it in the comments .
A break in the over - stressed sewage pipes after the storm was the cause for this one .
There are rumors of other sinkholes now forming nearby .
See it on Google Maps .
( News reports : Prensa Libre , and blogs )
Guatemala is in a state of crisis today after twin natural calamities struck : First , on May 27 the Pacaya volcano ( just 19 miles from the capital ) woke up in a bad mood .
Lava flowed , black sand and rock and ash spewed everywhere .
A newscaster covering the news near the volcano was killed by flying rocks .
Two days later on May 29 , tropical storm " Agatha " struck , destroying homes , causing floods , and creating tens of thousands of internally displaced .
Infrastructure in this country — where the majority live in poverty — is very poor , and ill - equipped to handle such a double blow .
As of last night , official numbers on storm : about 30,000 " refugees , " close to 120,000 evacuated , 93 dead and rising .
Guatemala's one international airport has been has been closed for days , and just as it prepares to reopen today , there 's word of new volcanic activity .
The poor always suffer the most when events like this happen , and the two events together caused surreal conditions : knee - deep black sand mud , and " instant concrete " that forms when rain meets ash , clogging up drains and fragile sewage systems .
Said a friend on Twitter , " Water and sand everywhere … it 's like the beach , only a lot less fun . "
Today I learned that in the rural K'iche Maya pueblo where I volunteer with a non-profit , a local committee of community leaders is organizing to walk to other villages in the region , and check on damage , injuries , casualties .
In rural areas , phones still are n't working , and many communities are only accessible by foot .
Guatemala is n't the only Central American nation affected : at least 10 are dead in El Salvador , and Honduras has declared a state of emergency .
Inset above , an image from the Guatemalan government 's Flickr feed , of a child evacuated from a village near the volcano .
Here are documents related to the disaster ( in Spanish ) .
Reading and photos , and a guide to Twitter accounts and hashtags : Antigua Daily News , " Stop , Agatha , Stop ! "
And here 's an item by Juliana Rincón Parra in Global Voices .
HOW YOU CAN HELP
Renata Avila of Global Voices in Guatemala says ,
I think that the best way to help now is to save the energy to help later : after the storm I am pretty sure we will face a nutrition crisis again because of lost crops and also a titanic task to rebuild communities .
But if someone wants to donate in kind stuff here are the list of centers collecting items , and people can donate to untechoparamipais.org .
These kids are amazing and are NOT corrupt .
I second the understanding that food crisis is imminent , and the best place to focus a desire to help .
I traded texts with the K'iche village yesterday , and word is that most of the corn crops were devastated throughout that part of the highlands .
I 'd expect similar throughout the land .
We 're talking about a nation in which a large number of indigenous communities are still subsistence maize farmers , and Guatemala was already in the middle of an economic crisis and a hunger crisis — the success or failure of a corn crop can be a matter of life or death .
A nswer : Cloudy water , also known as white water , is caused by air bubbles in the water .
It is completely harmless .
It usually happens when it is very cold outside because the solubility of air in water increases as water pressure increases and / or water temperature decreases .
Cold water holds more air than warm water .
In the winter , water travels from the reservoir which is very cold and warms up during its travel to your tap .
The air that is present is no longer soluble , and comes out of solution .
In addition , once water from our reservoir enters the transmission and distribution pipes , the water is pressurized .
Water under pressure holds more air than water that is not pressurized .
The digits 1 - 9 can work some impressive tricks :
The first formula , found by B. Ziv in 2004 , produces the first 10 digits of pi .
The second , astonishingly , reproduces e to 18,457,734,525,360,901,453,873,570 decimal places .
It was discovered by Richard Sabey , also in 2004 .

The Story of Stagger Lee originates from a shooting that occurred on Christmas night , 1895 , near the Third ward , also known as " Chestnut Valley " or the " Bloody Third district . "
The central character was a main named Lee Shelton , variously referred to in legend as Stagger Lee , Stagolee , Stack - A - Lee , and Stack O'Lee .
On Dec. 28 , 1895 , the Globe - Democrat described him as a cab driver , identifying him as " Lee Sheldon " — also known as " Stag . "
Newspaper reports and death certificates refer to him as " Stag , " " Stack " or " Stock " lee .
Shelton , it 's said , owned a nightclub called the Modern Horseshoe Club .
" Lee Sheldon belonged to an exotic group of pimps in St. Louis called ' Macks ' , " writes Cecil Brown .

These men , Brown writes , were " not just ' urban strollers ' ; they presented themselves as objects to be observed . "

Yes , the latest indie game to jump aboard the high - speed pay - what - you - what bandwagon is Jason Rohrer ’s splendid 2 - play storytelling game Sleep Is Death .
He ’s set a minimum spend of $ 1.75 , but apart from that , lob him whatever you think the game ’s worth in return for two copies of the splendid thing .
The RPS Hivemind will have to decide how frequently we cover these sort of deals if we ’re to avoid every other post documenting bargains , but as this one is so soon after the game ’s release , it ’s definitely An Awesome Thing .
Get to it .

HEARD the latest ?
The swine flu pandemic was a hoax : scientists , governments and the World Health Organization cooked it up in a vast conspiracy so that vaccine companies could make money .
Never mind that the flu fulfilled every scientific condition for a pandemic , that thousands died , or that declaring a pandemic did n’t provide huge scope for profiteering .
A group of obscure European politicians concocted this conspiracy theory , and it is now doing the rounds even in educated circles .
This depressing tale is the latest incarnation of denialism , the systematic rejection of …

Discovery 's Cloud

Explanation :
The space shuttle orbiter Discovery is now docked with the International Space Station , some 350 kilometers above planet Earth .
Last Monday , its launch to orbit was a beautiful one as it rose into clear , predawn skies at 6:21 am EDT from Kennedy Space Center 's pad 39A .
Looking east , this time exposure was taken shortly after lift off from a marina about 13 miles west of the launch site in Titusville , Florida .
It shows the dawn 's emerging colors along the horizon , with wafting rocket contrails at the upper right .
The bright streak surrounded by the remarkable , elongated , vapor cloud near the center of the image is the actual track of Discovery , arcing toward the horizon and its orbital rendezvous .
Gold is skyrocketing this week .
Gold neared $ 1,250 per ounce today as investing continues to move away from fiat money .
Pham - Duy Nguyen reports at Bloomberg :
The metal reached an all - time high of $ 1,249.70 an ounce in New York .
The euro fell to a 14 - month low against the dollar amid speculation that cost - cutting measures by European nations will undermine economic growth .
Yesterday , former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said the euro faces “ disintegration . ”
Gold priced in European currencies also climbed to records .
“ This is euro - generated panic buying , ” said Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago .
“ It ’s not a good situation for the Europeans .
They see continued erosion of their currency , and they ’re buying gold . ”
It was called “ nuts ” when gold reached a record of $ 1,235.20 earlier in the week soon after the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank committed to printing fast funny - money to bail out international banksters in what ’s dubbed the ‘ Greece bailout ’ .
The first invoice for the bailout shows $ 9.2 billion coming from the Fed .
The plummeting euro “ will reach $ 1.15 by December and $ 1.10 by the end of 2011 , UBS said , trimming its previous forecasts for the currency to trade at $ 1.30 and $ 1.25 , respectively ” , Candice Zachariahs at Bloomberg today .
It fell blow $ 1.2388 today .
Here ’s the downfall , as posted by “ Tyler Durden ” at Zero Hedge :

Alex White Plume in front of some of his hemp crop .
Wild THC - Free mutated hemp growing in parking lot of Alex White Plume 's house .
Note the seeds in the bud , obviously this is NOT weed grown for recreational purposes .
The Treaty of Ft. Laramie of 1868
Hemp
Stalk chaff showing its place in a structure as insulation
Alex is the former Tribal President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe of South Dakota .
He lives on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation of South Dakota .
Alex bears the remarkable distinction of being the only person in the United States to successfully farm and complete a legal hemp crop within the borders of the USA since 1968 .
comment I had the rare & unique opportunity to meet Alex while visiting the Indian Nations of the Pine Ridge Reservation last September .
He graciously allowed me to photograph him , and some of his hemp plants while there .
The hemp that Alex grows is NOT the kind that gets you high .
It is a mutated form of hemp that is THC FREE !
This is confirmed by independent USDA laboratory testing done at the request of the DEA .
Alex 's weed is grown for its industrial applications , and is used as a building materiel and for paper - making .
This is VERY IMPORTANT .
The Pine Ridge Reservation is one of the poorest , most impoverished places in the USA , if not THE most impoverished .
By being able to use industrial hemp as a construction materiel , it allows inhabitants of the " Res " to produce buildings at virtually no cost for the physical load bearing structures themselves .
( Walls , ceilings , etc ... ) This allows affordable housing in a place with the highest unemployment rate in America .
Here 's how it works .
In 1868 , General William T. Sherman negotiated and signed the " TREATY OF FORT LARAMIE OF 1868 " , on behalf of the United States , and the Lakota nation , Yanktonai Sioux , Santee Sioux , and Arapaho peoples .
The treaty ended Red Cloud 's War , and it also recognized limited sovereignty of the Indian nations named above , granting them ownership of the Black Hills .
There is also language in the treaty granting federal assistance to any Indians who want to engage in farming on the reservation .
With the local autonomy granted to the Indian Nations under treaty law , the Oglala Sioux on Pine Ridge are exempt from much of US law .
Local traditional Indian law takes precedence instead .
As a Tribal President of the Oglala Sioux , Alex exercised his tribal sovereignty by planting the 1st legal crop of industrial hemp grown in the US since 1969 .
When harvest time came , he invited the DEA to come observe his harvest .
The showed up about 2 weeks early , & surrounded his home and fields with snipers and infantry , and they brought a tank .
Then the DEA proceeded to plow the crop under , and destroy the harvest .
However , when it came time to go to court to prove that Alex was actually breaking the law , the DEA was unable to actually PROVE that the industrial grade hemp was actually illegal , because the strain of wild hemp grow on the Reservation was a mutated strain that was , ( To everyone 's surprise ! )
THC FREE !
The following season , to the delight of the Indians , it turned out that when the DEA plowed their crops under in an attempt to destroy them , the seeds on those plants germinated & started growing , right in the same fields where they had been plowed under !
Well , I guess it IS a " weed " , and um , grows like ... weeds .
Since then the Oglala have managed to complete several harvests , converting their locally grown strain of industrial grade Indian hemp into building materiels .
The harvested hemp is stripped in the fields where it is grown .
allowing the seeds to drop into the field where it grows , to insure future crops , and allowing the decomposing leaf matter to compost in place , to provide fertilization for the field for future crops .
Then the stripped hemp stalks are dried and chipped , to provide the basic filler materiel for insulation in buildings built on the reservation , and to provide the needed chaff to reinforce an adobe mixture used in those same structures .
This allows for the construction of buildings on the reservation that are effectively cost - free , because by using resources that the reservation has in abundance ( Hemp , mud , water ) they can build houses without having to pay for construction supplies , and with labor being provided on a sweat - equity basis by the people who will use or inhabit those buildings , labor costs become minimal .
In a place with 85 % unemployment , this is really important , as it provides not only cost free housing , but it also allows the development of a source of employment and tools for the development of a skilled labor force .
It 's truly an elegant model for economic self - help and development for the Indian nations of Pine Ridge .
When I interviewed Alex , he said that " You HAVE to have respect for the dirt , for the soil , it 's alive " .
The Oglala words for the dirt are " Ma Kanea " , and the dirt is very important to the Oglala .
"
If you lay in the dirt for a couple of weeks , the dirt will start to consume you " says Alex , who also tells me that " Ashes to ashes , dust to dust , All this these things that the Christians believe , the Oglala have been practicing for thousands of years " .
Considering that the hemp he grows is mixed in with dirt and water to make adobe , it makes it clear to me how respect for the dirt is an integral part of his program .
If only the rest of the country could see how respecting the natural surroundings and integrating it 's locally available resources into it 's local economies would aid in developing those same economies and ecologies , we would all be a bit better off , and have saved a considerable deal of money at the same time .
What should humanists do when they find themselves at a public ceremony that is religious or quasi-religious ?
Protest loudly ?
Protest quietly ?
Or go with the flow ?
Two recent events made me think of this issue .
My wife , who is a teacher , received an award from Fairfax County , Virginia .
The award was bestowed at a meeting of the school board .
Before the awards ceremony began , the board chair asked everyone to rise to recite the Pledge of Allegiance .
I was in the middle of the auditorium with my wife ’s colleagues nearby , so I could hardly exit quietly .
I decided to stand but keep my arms at the side and remain silent .
I was not going to take part in a mandated pledge of fidelity to a nation " under " an imagined deity .
I wonder only whether I should have remained seated .
I did remain seated at another recent event .
I am not a big sports fan , but I do attend an occasional ballgame , although apparently not often enough to be aware of a practice that has been adopted in the Major Leagues .
Baseball fans will know that at the seventh - inning stretch , those in the stadium are supposed to stand ; they are then invited to sing some traditional tune , such as " Take Me Out to the Ballgame . "
But the music menu has changed .
At the recent game , the announcer told everyone to sing " God Bless America . "
I declined and sat back down .
A few hard glances in my direction were all that resulted .
( By the way , someone informed me afterward that the Major Leagues had adopted this practice for all games sometime after 9/11 , but I have not been able to verify this . )
Some may think that I am making too much of events that are essentially meaningless .
No one really cares who participates in these ceremonies .
And " God Bless America " is only a song , after all .
Some atheists sing gospel songs or join choruses that perform Handel ’s " Messiah . "
Ceremonies that contain references to God are a non-issue .
I disagree .
Words have meaning .
Symbols have significance .
The importance of symbolism is underscored by the fact that many of the religious fight tenaciously to keep religious symbols on public property .
The Supreme Court does not rule on the constitutionality of crosses in remote national parks because nobody cares .
And what nonbelievers voluntarily do is an entirely different matter than what nonbelievers are pressured to do .
You can hum a hymn in the shower and still resent being told to bow your head at a city council meeting .
Incorporating God references into public ceremonies in which everyone is expected to participate is a not very subtle reminder that belief in God is considered the default view .
It ’s what every American should believe .
Atheists may be tolerated , but they are decidedly second - class citizens .
Moreover , if we simply shrug our shoulders and participate in these ceremonies , we feed the myth that no one really objects to these ceremonies , except a few " militant atheists . "
Perhaps if more of us remain silent and / or seated , others will begin to realize these ceremonies serve to exclude , not unite .

05/03/2010 : Not Lovin' It
Here 's how NOT to tell a joke .
There is a currently running McDonalds commercial in which customers talk about bad situations .
A man talks of " ... when my luggage went to the Bahamas ...
And I did n't . "
Oh , the attempted joke is so painful !
Jokes are about surprises .
What is the surprise in the second half of that line ?
There is none .
Of COURSE he did n't go .
If he'd gone to the Bahamas he would n't have worded the first part that way !
You do n't say , " My luggage went to the Bahamas and I had a great time there . "
Nonsense .
The thing that makes this really shameful , of course , is the ellipsis .
The pause is a very interesting comedy device .
You can only use it when what follows is really good .
It 's an investment that the writer ( or actor ) is making in the joke .
If it pays off , then if pays off bigger because of the pause .
But if it fails , you lose everything .
In this particular ad , the pause is n't just a short pause either , but a long one , with the actor turning to look down , then a WIDEN TO REVEAL shot change , which shows us that the actor is standing at an almost - empty luggage carousel , and then he looks back into camera for the " And I did n't . "
That is way too much weight for almost any joke !
Especially for one with the fatal flaw of not being a joke .
I give this example to illustrate the opposite of what is called " throwing it away . "
Throwing a joke away usually refers to the performance end of the deal , to delivering a joke in a casual off - handed way , without a pause or other tee - up , and without any apparent awareness of having said something funny .
It can also refer to the way a joke is directed ( for example , without changing the shot ) .
And , important for our purposes , to the way a joke is written .
One way to make sure a joke is thrown away is to make sure you leave out that ellipsis .
You can also use parentheticals or stage directions to tell the actor how to deliver the line : " Casually , " " Without pause " or even " Throwing it away " can help .
Since you 're probably writing a spec script , intended to be read , not performed , you do n't even have to worry that you 'll piss off the actor who does n't want to be told how to deliver a joke .
I realize now that this is what my showrunner on a show called Monty meant when he told us not to put the funniest word at the end of the line , but to make sure the line continued past it .
This seemed to me to go against one of the basic principals of joke writing , but now I see the value in it .
He wanted casual , easy , " thrown away " funny , not needy rim - shot comedy , begging for laughs by hitting every comedy - made - easy rule .
If you want to be funnier than McDonald 's , write actual jokes , and if you really want to be classy , throw them away .

AN American group established to help Muslims escape the tyranny of Islam have been told that ads they put on Miami buses are to be pulled as they may be “ offensive ” to members of the Religion of Peace .
The ads , placed by the Â Stop Islamization of America ( SIOA ) group asks :
Fatwa on your head ?
Is your community or family threatening you ?
The suggested answer is a visit to a website called “ Leave Islam . ”
SOIA , according to this report , is led by Jihad Watch director and author Robert Spencer .
The ads had been purchased for one month and were “ offered in defence of religious liberty . ”
Said a commentary at the SIOA website :
Still think this is a free country ?
At least three of the bus companies that ran the dawah ( invitation to Islam ) bus ads turned down our ad .
And Miami tore the ads down in less than 48 hours .
The way of life of Adam , Noah , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , & Muhammad .
The SIOA ads were a reponse to a series of ads posted earlier by a Muslim group , claiming Islam was “ submission to God ” and :
Karla Damian , a spokeswoman for Miami - Dade Transit agency , said the ads would be censored immediately after complaints had been raised by Muhammed Malik of the South Florida chapter of the Council for American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) .
In a statement to the Miami Herald , he said Muslims reject :
Any extremist interpretation that sanctions the killing of anyone leaving Islam .
But Spencer hit back , citing reports of a specific threat against American teen - ager Rifqa Bary , who fled her Muslim family in fear for her life after she converted to Christianity .
A translation of the fatwa against the girl indicated that death :
Is a very normal part of Islamic law for apostasy and for every muslim its ( sic ) at honor to CLEAN the umma if Rifqa is dead .
Spencer added :
Muslims can run bus ads all across America inviting the clueless to convert to Islam , but we cannot make information available to Muslims who want to leave Islam .
On his Jihad Watch website , Spencer responded to a comment that the ads be “ toned down ” :
What is offensive about our ad ?
What is wrong with its tone ?
Apostates are threatened and killed all over the world .
We offered them help .
What would you suggest we tone down ?
What would you suggest we not say in order to please them ?
Why must we always play this game , instead of speaking the truth without fear ?
There is nothing objectively wrong or offensive about our ad .
You ’re falling into their trap , allowing them to define what is offensive and what is n’t .
I refuse to do so .
He added :
And even if our ad were offensive to someone , so what ?
I am offended by all sorts of things .
I would n’t dream of trying to get them suppressed because they offend me , and no one would take me seriously if I did .
But Muslims are already a de facto privileged class , even in America – if I ’m offended , no one gives two hoots and no one should , but if Muslims are offended , watch out !
Heaven and earth will move !
The group that is allowed to suppress speech with which it disagrees , or which it finds offensive , is a group that can suppress dissent and carry out its will unchallenged .
That is the road to tyranny .

Yesterday the rumour dropped that some of us had been waiting for since the PS3 launched .
And when I say ' some of us ' I mean anyone who 's finished Ico and Shadow of the Colossus three and seven times respectively ( stop judging me with those eyes ! ) .
That 's right , it looks like two of the most beautiful , evocative games ever could be hitting PS3 in shiny Blu-ray form in full HD some time next year .
Below , we 've included some of original hi-res screens from Colossus and ludicrously sharp shots from NeoGAF that show Ico running on a PC emulator .
We 've also got HD footage of both games running on PC using a similar bit of kit .
We call witchcraft on that shit .
Seriously , though , we 'd kill a man to play these in 1080 p with trophy support .
No , really .
Actually kill him stone dead .
Shadow of the Colossus
Ico
Now remember , none of this is actually confirmed .
We contacted Sony for a response this morning and were informed they " do n't comment on rumour or speculation " .
So no putting your pre order in just yet .
That aside , how excited are you about HD Ico and Colossus if the rumours are true ?
Did you love both first time out and can't wait to play them again ?
Or did you miss out and simply want to know what all the fuss is about ?
Hit us up in the comments below with your steaming hot opinions .

In case anyone missed it , Chino found a scary video — designed to scare Mormons and others with the problems in the world today — and claiming that there ’s only one solution : Jesus Christ .
( In the LDS font . )
What that solution translates into in practical terms is hard to say , but I ’d guess it boils down to ( 1 ) be very afraid , ( 2 ) grab your gun , ( 3 ) take it and go hide under your bed .
Some LDS are proposing more practical solutions ( Sustainability summit !
Follow the WoW and eat less meat !
Rethink nuclear weapons !
Plus , a former Mormon is celebrating two years of car - free living ! )
But it ’s hard to hear them over these voices , and Christians too often end up talking like this .
Jon suggests that Glenn Beck is partially responsible for the paranoia ( see here for further commentary ) .
In a related note , the “ Climategate ” results are in .
These two articles are both short and worth reading , but let me pull a couple of teasers :
“ Here the situation is the reverse of whats going on in the troposphere : Climategate really is a hyped - up media phenomenon . ” and “ Our global temperature series tallies with those of other , completely independent , groups of scientists working for NASA and the National Climate Data Center in the United States , among others , ” said Jones .
“ Even if you were to ignore our findings , theirs show the same results .
The facts speak for themselves ; there is no need for anyone to manipulate them . ” )
So do you think Fox News will bother to report this ?
Or will they allow their viewers to go with “ Last I heard , man - made global warming is just a big hoax . ” ..?
Meanwhile , we ’ve seen some botched missionary efforts .

A 7 - year - old girl was shot and killed when an officer 's gun went off during a struggle with a woman in a house where Detroit police were searching for a suspect in the slaying of a teenager , MyFoxDetroit.com reported .
Assistant Chief Ralph Godbee said at a news conference Sunday that Aiyana Jones was hit in the neck by a single bullet and died at a hospital .
" This is any parent 's worst nightmare .
It also is any police officer 's worst nightmare , " Godbee said .
Godbee reportedly said officers with the department 's Special Response Team set off a flash grenade as they entered the home about 12:40 a.m.
Sunday with a warrant to look for a suspect in the Friday slaying of a 17 - year - old boy .
The lead officer encountered a 46 - year - old woman immediately inside the front room of the house and " some level of physical contact " ensued during which the officer 's gun went off , according to the station .
The officers had reportedly identified themselves as police .
Godbee said Sunday that the shooting was being investigated and all information was preliminary .
" We can not undo what occurred this morning , " he said .
" All we can do is to pledge an open and full investigation and to support Aiyana 's family in whatever way they may be willing to accept from us at this time . "
The officers had a search warrant and were looking for a 34 - year - old man suspected in the shooting death of 17 - year - old Jarean Blake .
Blake , a student at Southeastern High School , was gunned down Friday by a store in front of his girlfriend .
Blake stumbled across the street , collapsed and died , police said .
Officers arrested the suspect inside the home where Aiyana was shot , Godbee said .
" This is a tragedy of unspeakable magnitude to Aiyana 's parents , family and all those who loved her , " Godbee said .
" It is a tragedy we also feel very deeply throughout the ranks of the Detroit Police Department . "

The biggest trick to cooking it just right is knowing how long to cook a hard - boiled egg .
You want to be careful about overcooking , as well as undercooking .
Overcooking :
As many of you know , when the egg is overcooked , the outside of the yoke will turn a dark green color .
Some people claim this leaves a sulfuric taste , although most people do not taste this difference .
What overcooking does do is takes away the value of the protein found in the egg .
That is why this method is so excellent because its nearly impossible to overcook using this method .
How to tell if your boiled egg is perfect :
One easy tip is to take it out of the water if it dries in 5 seconds or less , it is perfection !
Another more fun approach is to spin it on the counter , if it spins like a top , then you know it is done .
If it " wobbles like a weeble , " then it is not done .
Uncooked eggs will weeble and wobble .
Who knew !
If you are unsure if it is weebling , then press your fingers lightly on the top while it is spinning , if it continues to turn when you release , then you know it is not yet done .

A lot of wonderful things happen in the blink of an eye , but they are moving too quickly for us to see .
High speed photography is the science of taking pictures of very fast phenomena and allow us to see images that we do n’t usually get to see .
Those , who are taking photographs of high speed action might see something no one ’s ever seen before – a bullet coming out of one side of an apple , or fruit just beginning to explode .
Water drops , breaking glass , gun shots , balloon explosions – are just a few examples of what can be captured with high speed photography .
Freezing fast motion , not only give us some pretty special photographic effects , High Speed Photography is also used in physics , health research , sports and more .
While making high - end high speed photos could cost you a fortune , it is still possible to capture super fast movements using your ordinary camera gear and a little home made electronics ( see DIY ) .

Since I am touring colleges with my daughter this week in advance of the May 1 acceptance deadline , I was particularly struck by the law prof blogosphere discussion ( here and here ) of The Price of Admission : How America 's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges -- and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates , by Daniel Golden .
From the Washington Post 's review :
Stepping into this cauldron of anxiety about admission to elite colleges is Daniel Golden , a Wall Street Journal reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2004 for a series of articles on the inner workings of college admissions offices .
In his provocative and stimulating book , The Price of Admission , Golden makes a powerful case that the number of well - to - do whites given preference to highly selective colleges dwarfs that of minorities benefiting from affirmative action .
He follows this central theme in a wide - ranging series of case studies of systematic preference for the wealthy , the privileged and the famous , as well as legacies , faculty children and -- most innovatively -- athletes in such patrician sports as rowing , horseback riding , fencing and even polo .
A tough investigative reporter , Golden does not hesitate to name names -- not only of specific institutions ( including Harvard , Duke , Brown , Notre Dame , the University of Virginia , Princeton , Stanford and Amherst ) and administrators , but also of individual students ( including the sons of Al Gore and Sen. Bill Frist ) whom he deems to be beneficiaries of preferences for the privileged .
The result is a disturbing exposé of the influence that wealth and power still exert on admission to the nation 's most prestigious universities .
That virtually all elite private colleges give preference to the sons and daughters of alumni will come as a surprise to no one .
But preference also extends to wealthy applicants whose families have been identified as potential donors -- " development cases " in the parlance of the trade .
Golden documents that even Harvard , with its $ 25.9 billion endowment , is not above giving preference to the scions of the super - rich .
His primary example , however , of development cases being central to the admissions process is Duke , where the university embarked on a systematic strategy of raising its endowment by seeking out wealthy applicants .
Golden estimates that Duke admitted 100 development applicants each year in the late 1990s who otherwise would have been rejected .
Though this may be something of an extreme case , special consideration for applicants flagged by the development office is standard practice at elite colleges and universities .
Also enjoying substantial preference at elite colleges , both public and private , are varsity athletes .
In a fascinating case study of women 's sports at the University of Virginia , Golden shows how the effort to comply with Title IX , a gender equity law that has the praiseworthy goal of ensuring equality between female and male athletes , has had the unintended effect of giving an admissions edge to female athletes who play upper - class sports .
Between 1992 and 2002 , the number of college women nationwide in rowing , a sport highly concentrated in private schools and affluent suburbs , rose from 1,555 to 6,690 ; more recently , the number of female varsity horseback riders increased from 633 to 1,175 between 1998 and 2002 .
The net effect of the rise of these overwhelmingly patrician sports , Golden argues , has been to further advantage already advantaged women .
After spending most of the book roundly criticizing the admissions practices of many of the nation 's most prestigious colleges , Golden turns to what he considers a model institution : The California Institute of Technology .
Unlike other leading colleges , Caltech does not allow the prerogatives of privilege -- whether wealth , fame or legacy status -- to affect who gets in .
In stark contrast to other top institutions , Caltech believes that it is possible to raise the funds necessary to maintain a great university without using admission as a bribe , and its own distinguished history supports that belief .
But the Caltech admissions policy , though exemplary in its integrity , is not without problems .
In no small part because of its narrowly conventional definition of merit ( primarily scores on standardized tests , grades and rank in class ) , it has been notoriously unsuccessful in enrolling African Americans ; in 2004 , just one out of 207 Caltech freshmen was black ( for purposes of comparison , the black proportions of the undergraduate student body at MIT , Stanford and Harvard -- all of which use a more flexible definition of merit -- were 6 , 10 and 8 percent , respectively ) .
...
The Price of Admission estimates that the end of affirmative action for the privileged would open up roughly 25 percent of the places in the freshman class at elite colleges and , in so doing , free up spaces for aspiring students of modest origins .
...
In his final chapter , Golden issues a series of sensible and hard - hitting recommendations -- among them , ending legacy preference ( already a fait accompli at Oxford and Cambridge universities in supposedly class - bound Britain ) , abolishing preference for athletes in upper - crust sports and for faculty children , and developing conflict - of - interest policies for the staff of the admissions offices .
Equally important is his suggestion that a firewall be constructed between the admissions office and the development office -- a change of no small moment in institutions where the link between the two now looks more like an autobahn .
Donald N. Frey , the engineer who spearheaded the design and development of the Mustang , the spunky , stylish , affordably priced “ pony car ” that the Ford Motor Company rolled out in the mid-1960s in one of the most successful car introductions in automotive history , died March 5 in Evanston , Ill. , where he lived .
He was 86 .
The cause was a stroke , his son Christopher said .
Though much of the Mustang was borrowed from other Ford vehicles , including a Falcon chassis , the car developed an identity all its own for a younger generation in search of new looks and experiences .
It was designed to appeal to both men and women , had a dash of elegance copied from European sports cars , and featured a galloping steed in the middle of its grille that buyers thought was , well , really cool .
Steve McQueen was almost upstaged by the souped - up Mustang he drove in the movie “ Bullitt . ”
Mr. Frey and his team created the car — from approval by top management to the showroom — in just 18 months , and expectations were modest when it was introduced on April 17 , 1964 , at the New York World ’s Fair .
Ford figured it would sell 80,000 Mustangs in its first year .
It sold more than a million in its first two years .
Mr. Frey ( pronounced fry ) would go on to other achievements .
He was chairman and chief executive of the Bell & Howell Company , recipient of the National Medal of Technology and a member of the executive board of the World Bank .
He was proudest , he said , of helping to introduce safety improvements like disc brakes and radial tires to Ford cars .
Las aseguradoras han preferido no cubrir algunas profesiones en las zonas de guerra , como Reynosa o Torre�n

Aseguradores de Ciudad Ju�rez se negaron a vender seguros de vida a periodistas , ya que consideran la zona como de alto riesgo .
Otras empresas aplicaron una sobretasa al costo de la cobertura .
Jes�s Meza Vega , de la Asociaci�n de Periodistas de Ciudad Ju�rez ( APCJ ) , consider � que esta medida es grave e injusta para los periodistas .
La APCJ lleva varios a�os pagando puntualmente la p�liza , pero en esta ocasi�n se les inform � que ya no la renovar�an , seg�n consigna el portal informativo El Diario .
“ No aseguramos la vida de pilotos , polic�as y periodistas ” , se�al� un agente consultado , y detall� que se trat� de una decisi�n a nivel corporativo , ya que no est�n abriendo p�lizas grupales nuevas en la ciudad , por los altos �ndices de violencia .
Algunas personas ni siquieran aceptan las solicitudes cuando saben que se trata de un grupo de periodistas , mientras que otras rechazan hacer un contrato por el alto riesgo .
“ La situaci�n nos preocupa y afecta , adem�s de que es un indicador m�s de la injusticia que tenemos que afrontar como consecuencia de la llamada guerra contra el crimen organizado ” , afirm � Meza .
Fuentes de la Asocaci�n Mexicana de Instituciones de Seguros revelaron que desde hace meses las compa��as prefieren no cubrir algunas profesiones en las " zonas de guerra " , como Ciudad Ju�rez , Reynosa y Torre�n .
Seg�n la Comisi�n Nacional de Derechos Humanos , de 1999 a la fecha se han radicado 594 expedientes de queja por agravios a periodistas .
El organismo ha emitido 20 Recomendaciones , de 2005 a la fecha y tiene registradas 10 desapariciones de periodistas .
De 2000 a la fecha se tienen registrados 61 homicidios de periodistas : cuatro en el 2000 , cuatro en el 2001 , tres en el 2002 , uno en el 2003 y cinco en el 2004 .
Adem�s de cuatro en el 2005 , 10 en el 2006 , cuatro en el 2007 , 10 en el 2008 , 12 en el 2009 y cuatro en lo que va del presente a�o .
Las amenazas , intimidaci�n , ejercicio indebido de la funci�n p�blica , persecuciones , atentados , privaci�n de la vida y desaparici�n forzada de persona son los principales hechos denunciados contra periodistas en el pa�s .

I just managed get communication between Compojure and Flash ( AS3 ) up and running , by way of HTTP .
No big deal really when all the dependencies and whatnot are in place .
I did not use URLRequest or HTTPService , but AS3HttpClientLib as I got the impression it seems to be more feature complete than the other two that seem more basic and default .
An example of a feature I might want to use in the future is for instance the HTTPS stuff .
Why not use AMF then with something like BlazeDS you might ask and the answer is that I want to avoid these convoluted things that will require even more boiler plate bullshit .
JSON over HTTP is good enough for me for the time being .
It will be a dear problem if I someday have to consider AMF due to massive traffic .
Let ’s get on with the actual demo .
Start with downloading AS3CoreLib and the aforementioned AS3HttpClientLib , link both swc files by going to something like project settings -> ActionScript 3 -> libraries and add the swc files directly .
At first I simply linked to the folder where I put them but Flash complained on missing dependencies until I linked to them separately and directly .
First the AS3 which I simply put in the first frame of my Flash CS4 project :
import flash.net .*; import com.adobe.net .* ; import org.httpclient .* ; import org.httpclient.http.* ; import org.httpclient.events .* ; var client : HttpClient = new HttpClient ( ) ; var uri:URI = new URI ( " http://192.168.0.146:8080/hello " ) ; var variables : Array = [ {name : " fname " , value : " FirstName1 " } , {name : " lname " , value : " LastName1 " } ] ; client.listener.onData = function ( event : HttpDataEvent ) : void { var stringData : String = event.readUTFBytes ( ) ; trace ( stringData ) ; } ; client.postFormData( uri , variables ) ;
This is basically just a combo of the POST and GET demos on the AS3HttpClientLib homepage , note though that we ’re using POST .
I do n’t like the fact that you need to use a whole object for each key and value in the post , it should ’ve been a big object instead with names as keys , that is probably something I will look into changing if I get serious with the Flash and Compojure interop .
Anyway , we need a Compojure server too :
( ns hello - world ( :use compojure.core ring.adapter.jetty ) ) ( defroutes main - routes ( POST " / hello " [ fname lname ] {:status 200 , : body ( str " Hello " fname " " lname ) } ) ( ANY " * " [ ] {:status 404 , : body " < h1 > Page not found < / h1 > " } ) ) ( run-jetty main - routes {:port 8080} )
Note how we receive the two values by name that we post from Flash above , in flash we will of course trace “ Hello FirstName1 LastName1 ” .
And that was that , with the help of the prior tutorial you should now be able to manipulate a Cassandra database with Compojure as the server and using Flash as the GUI .

Earlier this afternoon , San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Clifford V. Cretan ordered the affidavit used to trigger the search warrant on Gizmodo blogger Jason Chen 's home to be unsealed .
The motion was initially filed last week by a number of media organizations including the Los Angeles Times and the AP .
The affidavit does n't really tell us anything that we did n't already know ( such as the identities of the parties ) , but it does confirm that Steve Jobs himself called Gizmodo editorial director Brian Lam to personally request that Gizmodo return the iPhone to Apple .
( Buzzblog : Gizmodo to Jobs : " You can trust us , Steve , honestly " )
Lam subsequently responded to Jobs via an email where he flat out stated that Gizmodo would n't return the phone unless Apple sent them something official that they could plaster up on their website .
The entire email is pasted below , and while you can draw your own conclusions from Lam 's points , it sounds a lot like extortion to me .
" Hey Steve , this email chain is off the record on my side .
I understand the position you 're in , and I want to help , but it conflicts with my own responsibilities to give the phone back without any confirmation that its real , from apple , officially .
Something like that - from you or apple legal - is a big story , that would make up for giving the phone back right away .
If the phone disappears without a story to explain why it went away , and the proof it went to apple , it hurts our business .
And our reputation .
People will say this is a coordinated leak , etc .
I get that it would hurt sales to say this is the next iphone .
I have no interest in hurting sales .
That does nothing to help Gizmodo or me .
Maybe Apple can say it 's a lost phone , but not one that you 've confirmed for production - that it is merely a test unit of sorts .
Otherwise , it just falls to apple legal , which serves the same purpose of confirmation .
I do n't want that , either .
Gizmodo lives and dies like many small companies do .
We do n't have access , or when we do , we get it taken away .
When we get a chance to break a story , we have to go with it , or we perish .
I know you like waltand pogue , and like working with them , but I think Gizmodo has more in common with old Apple than those guys do .
So I hope you understand where I 'm coming from .
Right now , we have nothing to lose .
The thing is , Apple PR has been cold to us lately .
It affected my ability to do my job right at iPad launch .
So we had to go outside and find our stories like this one , aggressively .
I want to get this phone back to you ASAP .
And I want to not hurt your sales when the products themselves deserve love .
But I have to get the story of the missing prototype out , and how it was returned to apple , with some acknowledgement it is Apple's
And I want to work closer with Apple , too .
I 'm not asking for more access - we can do our jobs with or without it - but again , this is the only way we can survive while being out of things .
That 's my position on things .

VENICE , Louisiana ( Reuters ) - Lawmakers and local residents clamored on Sunday for BP and the Obama administration to do more to save the Gulf Coast from an out - of - control oil spill that has become the biggest environmental catastrophe in the country ’s history .
One congressman called the nearly six - week oil gush in the Gulf of Mexico an “ environmental crime , ” while a Louisiana senator demanded BP invest $ 1 billion immediately to protect the region ’s treasured marshlands .
The failure on Saturday of a “ top kill ” technique attempted by London - based BP to try to seal its leaking Gulf well has unleashed a surge of anger and frustration that poses a major domestic challenge for President Barack Obama .
Obama , who has called the leaking BP well a “ man- made disaster , ” is trying to fend off criticism that his administration acted too slowly in its response to the spill , now known to be the worst in U.S. history .
He is in a bind because it appears only BP can stop the leak , although he has made clear the government is in charge .
But critics say he has not directed enough resources to the unfolding disaster and he has been present enough .
The White House said on Sunday that the government will triple clean - up resources in areas affected by the spill , while the administration ’s top energy and environment officials head back to the Gulf this week following Obama ’s second visit on Friday .
“ This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country , ” top White House energy adviser Carol Browner told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
BP , its reputation and market value already battered by the catastrophic spill , and the entire U.S. oil industry face more probing questions about why safety backups did not accompany their pursuit of oil in ever deeper offshore waters .
“ I think without question if the word criminal should be used in terms of an environmental crime against our country , that what ’s going on in the Gulf of Mexico is going to qualify , ” U.S. Representative Ed Markey told CBS ’
“ Face the Nation . ”
Department of Justice officials are part of an ongoing federal investigation into the April 20 rig explosion that triggered the spill , and the Obama administration has not ruled out the possibility of a criminal prosecution .
In Louisiana , which has borne the brunt of the oil spill impact so far , local authorities demanded that BP and the federal government rush a plan to create a sand barrier to the oil by dredging and building up outlying sandbanks and islets .
“ I ’m devastated ...
We are dying a slow death , every time that oil takes out a piece of the marsh , a piece of Louisiana is gone forever , ” said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , where the oil has clogged wetlands .
“ Even the government seems powerless and all the experts .
If these people ca n’t stop it , then who in the name of God can ? ” Father Gerry , a priest at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Port Sulphur , Louisiana , said , his voice heavy with emotion .
‘ OIL COMING UP UNTIL AUGUST ’
After giving up on Saturday an attempt to pump heavy fluids and blocking materials into the leaking well to “ kill ” it , BP is pursuing another option from its undersea toolbox .
But BP warns that the new procedure , which will try to fit a containment cap over the leaking well , could take between four and seven days .
Even then success is not guaranteed because it has never been attempted before at the depth -- a mile down -- where the oil is leaking .
BP Managing Director Robert Dudley told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” the company would know by the end of the week whether the new containment effort worked .

The next BP step would involve undersea robots using diamond - rimmed saws to cut off a pipe over the well to put in place a containment device that would try to siphon off most of the leaking oil and gas up to a tanker ship on the surface .
Dudley said he did not think BP CEO Tony Hayward , who has faced heavy criticism , should be forced to resign .
A surer solution to the leak , a relief well already being drilled , is not expected to be finished until early August .
This means crude oil continues to spew out daily , feeding a huge , fragmented slick that has already polluted marshlands teeming with wildlife and rich fisheries in Louisiana .

“ There could be oil coming up until August . ” Browner told CBS ’s “ Face The Nation , ” “ We are prepared for the worst . ”
Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu called on BP to immediately invest $ 1 billion to protect marshes , wetlands and estuaries across the region .
“ While we may not be able to plug the leaking well right away , there is nothing that should stop us from getting help to the Gulf Coast immediately , ” she said .
OBAMA’S ‘ KATRINA ’?
Gulf residents fear the spilled oil could be whipped further inshore by what promises to be the most active Atlantic storm season since 2005 , the year of Hurricane Katrina .
That deadly storm proved a political disaster for President George W. Bush , who was accused of complacency in handling it , and Obama is fighting to prevent the Gulf spill from becoming his own “ Katrina ” ahead of the November congressional elections .
Louisianans still recovering from Katrina ’s devastation were frustrated by the oil spill response .
“ It ’s been a screw - up from day one .
Nothing was at the ready and no one was in a position to respond , ” said Claude Marquette , a retired physician , 68 , speaking as he sat with his wife in his boat .
BP ’s Hayward had predicted that despite risks , the “ top kill ” had a 60 to 70 percent chance of success .
He said he did not know why it failed to stop the gusher .
The misstep is likely to drive his credibility lower , along with his company ’s market value , which has dropped by 25 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers , and triggering the spill .
The government estimated last week that 12,000 to 19,000 barrels ( 504,000 to 798,000 gallons / 1.9 million to 3 million liters ) a day are leaking from the well .
At that rate , the government now knows that the Gulf disaster has surpassed the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaskan waters .
Wombats are normally not aggressive creatures A man who survived last year 's deadly bush fires in Australia is recovering in hospital after falling victim to a rare attack by a wombat .
Bruce Kringle , 60 , was pulled to the ground by the animal and bitten on the legs and arms after apparently stepping on it by mistake .
He escaped after killing the wombat with an axe .
Animal experts said it appeared the wombat had been suffering from mange , which had made it irritable .
Paramedic Robert Gill said it appeared Mr Kringle had trodden on the animal when he left his caravan in Flowerdale , north - east of Melbourne .
He was living in the caravan while he rebuilt his home after the " Black Saturday " fires .
" The wombat proceeded to get rather nasty and attacked him and inflicted some wounds to his lower legs and also to his arms as well , " ABC News quoted Mr Gill as saying .
" It took about 20 minutes .
He did try to exit the area and get away from the wombat but my belief is that it kept coming at him . "
Kelly Smith , a friend of Mr Kringle , said that once he was on the ground , the wombat had climbed on his chest .
WOMBAT FACTS Herbivorous marsupial or pouched mammal About 1 metre ( 40 in ) in length Tends to graze at night Produces cube - shaped dung Closest relative is koala " Bruce managed to find an axe and killed it , " Ms Smith told the AAP news agency .
" It 's bizarre what happened . "
There were reports that local people had complained about a rogue wombat in the area in recent days .
Wombats , furry marsupials unique to Australia , are one of the country 's most endearing native creatures .
They can grow up to 1 m ( 40 inches ) in length and weigh up to 35 kg .
Geoff McClure of the Department of Sustainability and Environment said wombat attacks were extremely rare , but that the animal in question could have been made aggressive by mange , caused by mites on the skin .
" In the advanced stages wombats become very irritable and anyone who approaches them , they usually view as a threat and may run towards them , " he said .
He told AAP Mr Kringle 's action in killing the wombat was probably merciful , as it would have been suffering .

Spatial compares of the top 3 commonly used spatial databases
Last time we did a survey such as this Cross Compare SQL Server 2008 Spatial , PostgreSQL / PostGIS 1.3-1.4 , MySQL 5 - 6 we had in our mix MySQL instead of Oracle .
Many people wanted to see Oracle in that comparison , so this time , we have replaced MySQL with Oracle .
In our new compare , Compare SQL Server 2008 R2 , Oracle 11G R2 , PostgreSQL / PostGIS 1.5 Spatial Features , we focus mostly on the feature sets as documented by each offering in their manuals .
Given the breadth of functionality we were comparing , its quite possible we missed something .
Please let us know if we made any erroneous statements or missed a critical function , and we will be happy to correct .
Part of the point of this compare is also for migration purposes .
If you are using a feature in databasse X and want to know if you can still do the same or if there is a comparable function in database Y , we hope this will be helpful in ascertaining that .
We really wanted to include SpatiaLite in there , but SpatiaLite fills a slightly different niche from the aforementioned 3 that I think in most cases is complimentary to the 3 rather than direct competition .
The fact that SpatiaLite is built on SQLite and much of the same plumbing that PostGIS is built on ( GEOS / Proj ) , means it lacks some of the enterprise features we have come to expect from an enterprise database -- e.g strong aggregation functions , stored procedures / functions , but on the plus side is much more portable ( suitable for in the field work ) and still has a lot of spatial power under its toolbelt .
PostGIS in Action status
We have received our final set of reviews as well as blog reviews of our book PostGIS in Action and are still making revisions to the chapters based on them and prior reviews .
The reviews were very positive .
The last set of reviews , we got perfect scores .
However there were noted areas of improvement .
For one , I guess people are really into real examples rather than made up ones .
As a result , we have rewritten chapter 1 to be more of a 60 minute quick course in loading geometry / geography , viewing , and writing spatial queries against which will be filled in with greater and greater depth in later chapters .
We 've also tried to sprinkle along the way in the book , non -US examples .
This is tricky though since US data is the data set we have most access to and can esily package in without licensing issues .
Any thoughts on Non-US datasets we can use would be welcome .
There are some things we will have a harder time with such as adding more pictures and more polished pictures .
Those unfortunately just add a lot of overhead .
We will try our best to improve on that where it does n't considerably impact cost .
As far as blog reviews , we thank Bill Dollins and Mark Leslie for their great blog reviews .
It is nice to know that we are hitting the audience and level of depth we had hoped to .
I ’m a 27 - year - old gay man .
I had a really great first couple of dates with a guy , so for the third date I invited him to stay over .
I cooked a nice dinner , we watched a movie , and we had a lovely time in bed together .
In the morning , we had another romp .
At one point , he was rimming me , and unexpectedly , unintentionally , I farted in his mouth a little .
His reaction was along the lines of “ EW ! EWWWW ! EW ! ” Mine was along the lines of trying to apologize through uncontrollable laughter .
I said , “ C’mere ” and pulled him in to kiss me , and we finished with what I thought was minimal awkwardness .
Later in the day , to be cute , and even perhaps start a long - term shared joke , I sent an e-card that read , “ I ’m sorry for farting in your mouth . ”
I then left town for the weekend , and when I got back I tried to get in touch with him .
He sent the following text message : “ i’m not sure about this .
yr a sweet guy but i’m dating some other people … i just ca n’t have farts in my mouth .
i think i would have handled it a bit more respectfully . ”
Is a sense of humor about the inevitable off - color moments too much to expect ?
I mean , this was one strike you ’re out , not even a chance to talk it over .
He dumped me over TEXT , for fuck ’s sake !
Good riddance , I suppose .
But did I really handle this wrong ?
Flatulent Anilingus Result : Termination

You handled this beautifully , FART — that ’s why you got dumped via text message .
They do n’t cover this in sex ed , I realize , but the average idiot knows there ’s just one thing a person wants from someone who ’s just “ unexpectedly ” farted in his mouth , even just a little , and it ’s not an e-card .
It ’s a lengthy , abject , mortified , immediate , and heartfelt apology .
And after a rimmee farts — a blessedly rare occurrence — it ’s the rimmer ’s response that sets the tone for what comes next .
Your guest was horrified and disgusted .
When you saw his reaction , FART , you needed to take your emotional cues from him , make your apologies , reassure him that it was n’t intentional , and express genuine remorse .
Advertisement
Instead , you laughed in his face , pulled him in for a kiss , and sent him a flip e-card .
Basically , you did everything you could to give this guy the impression that you ’re either an inconsiderate asshole incapable of reading another person ’s emotional cues , FART , or that you may actually be into farts — or worse — and that you intentionally farted in his mouth .
I would ’ve dumped you , too .
Yes , a sense of humor about those off - color moments is not too much to expect .
But no relationship progresses to the laughing - off - the - fart - in - your - mouth stage , FART , until after — long after — you ’ve demonstrated to the person you ’re dating that you ’re a fundamentally decent , considerate person , worthy of their time and affections .

Every so often , I have to fight the urge to contact an ex-boyfriend from college .
It did n’t end well ( I cheated ) .
It ’s been over a decade ( more like 15 years ) since we last spoke .
I ’m happily married , have two children , and live in a completely different part of the country now .
Yet I feel sad that we do n’t still know each other .
The reasons for the indiscretion are complicated and include , among other things , stupidity and youth .
( Also the fact that the indiscretion involved a different ex-boyfriend who begged and pleaded for one final hurrah — and then I told the then - current [ now - ex ] boyfriend that it was forced , which it was n’t , which the then - current [ now - ex ] boyfriend rightly did n’t believe . )
Advertisement
I know my reasons are selfish : I want to explain myself , I want to move on , I want to be forgiven .
But if he wanted to be in contact with me , he would be .
And yet , like a crazed idiot , I still hold out hope that someday he ’ll contact me or that we ’ll bump into each other .
Should I contact him ?
Ca n’t Let Go
You should suck it up , CLG .
It ’s killing you that someone out there might hate your guts ( with cause ) , might think you ’re scum ( because you behaved like scum ) , and , we can safely presume at this stage , is content to have you out of his life ( otherwise he would ’ve looked you up on Facebook by now ) .
This bothers you because you ’re not scum , of course ; no person is defined by the two worst mistakes she ever made .
( I ’m referring to 1 ) cheating and 2 ) making a false accusation of rape .
What would ’ve happened if your then - current [ now - ex ] boyfriend had gone to the police ?
Or taken the law into his own hands ?
Thank God your then - current [ now - ex ] boyfriend did n’t believe you . )
Advertisement
I do n’t think you should contact him , CLG , not until you ’re a little more interested in what you could give him ( a long - overdue apology ) and a little less interested in what he could give you ( absolution ) .
My wife and I divorced three years ago .
Six months ago , I began seeing a good friend of my daughter ’s .
I knew this was dangerous territory , but I really liked this girl .
A month ago , we decided to take our relationship public .
My daughter reacted poorly .
She did not demand that we break up , but she did let me know that our relationship made her uncomfortable .
And she was rightfully upset about some personal information my girlfriend had told me about her .
Advertisement
During the past four weeks , my daughter has gradually edged my girlfriend , formerly a close friend of hers , out of her personal life .
She has also begun to spend less time with me .
She tells me she does not want me to have to choose between her and my girlfriend , although , if she stops spending time with me , that ’s exactly what she ’s doing .
I know she ’s upset .
But I ’m a grown man , and I just want to be happy .
And in spite of the age difference , my girlfriend makes me very happy .
What can I do to make my daughter more comfortable with my new relationship ?
Father Does n’t Always Know Best

P.S. The information my girlfriend shared about my daughter was the name of a young man she was seeing and that my daughter had recently purchased an expensive dress .
My girlfriend hardly told me that my daughter was doing something truly dangerous or wrong .
It ’s nice to know that your girlfriend manages to make you happy “ in spite of the age difference . ”
Too many late - middle - aged men succumb to despair in the arms of their much - younger girlfriends .
Anyway …

What can you do to make your daughter comfortable with you fucking her friend while her friend blabs to you ?
Nothing .
Your daughter may eventually become comfortable with your relationship , FDAKB , but there ’s nothing you can do to artificially force up her comfort level .
And while emotional blackmail —
“ My girlfriend makes me happy , but I will sacrifice my happiness for you , darling , if that ’s what you want … ” — may result in your daughter spending more time with you and your girlfriend now , her resentment at being blackmailed will do irreparable damage to your relationship with her over the long run .
So just shut the fuck up , Dad , stop whining , and continue to enjoy the girlfriend in spite of the age difference .
Then go apologize to your daughter for 1 ) keeping the relationship from her for so long ( your daughter may be losing sleep over things she told her friend before she found out you were fucking ) and 2 ) the invasion of her privacy that already took place .
Then give your daughter the space she needs and the privacy she has a right to .

The Southern Poverty Law Center has classified Americans for Truth About Homosexuality as a hate group and “ Porno Pete ” LaBarbera , the group ’s leader , is n’t happy about it .
The SPLC contends that the ATAH “ not merely … opposes legal equality for gays or others , but [ also ] … intentionally utilize[s ] discredited and slanderous propaganda to spread lies about a group of people . ”
LaBarbera , who has always been direct about his opposition to homosexuality , has issue with being called hateful .
According to the Naperville Sun :
“ President of Americans for Truth About Homosexuality Peter LaBarbera says he has ‘ taken issue ’ with that , and is asking for a public apology from the organization and a debate with its president , Mark Potok .
His organization , he says , while against homosexuality , is not a hate group .
‘ You can disagree without being hateful , ’ LaBarbera said . ”
The Liberty Counsel ’s Matt Barber defends LaBarbera with what might be one of the most unintentionally comical quotes I ’ve read all week :
“ But seriously , if [ Peter LaBarbera ’s Americans For Truth About Homosexuality ] is a “ hate group , ” then so is Liberty Counsel , Focus on the Family , Family Research Council , American Family Association , the Southern Baptist Convention and the Roman Catholic Church .
Any group that observes and defends traditional sexual morality would have to be labeled such . ”
Flame wars over one ’s choice of editor are a regular occurrence on almost all the tech mailing lists that I subscribe to .
In fact , in my opinion , the amount of time and energy that is spent on debating this topic can be easily spent on researching the feature set of a perfect editor that would fit everyone ’s needs .
But , since that is really a far fetched thought , I decided to spend some thinking of the best ways to make my workflow as a web developer as editor agnostic as possible .
And what did I come up with ?
Online Code Editors .
These are editors that run online and are available from any computer anywhere in the world .
So , without further ado , here is a list of some of my favorite online editors .
The people behind Kodingen call it the cloud development environment .
It is an IDE for the cloud , and I absolutely agree with them .
Kodingen integrates an image editor , a really excellent code editor and a lot of nifty features into one cool looking package .
It displays line numbers , features syntax highlighting and SVN integration .
The only hitch is that they ’re still in Beta and are only letting limited people through .
EditArea is a free and open source Javascript based editor that can be hosted on your own server .
It offers syntax highlighting , search and replace support , multi language support and a number of other features that you ’d expect from a first class editor .
Bespin is a Mozilla Labs project that aims to create an editor for web development that can be embedded into webpages , much like EditArea .
It is based on some of the latest emerging standards such as HTML 5 and so you ’d need a fairly recent browser if you ’re going to use Bespin .
Like Mozilla ’s web browser – Firefox , Bespin is designed to be easily extensible using plugins developed in Javascript .
In fact , the editor is so good that the guys behind Kodingen also provide an option to use Bespin as one of the editors for their IDE .
Using Amy Editor feels as if you ’re using a OS X based desktop application as that is where this editor get it ’s visual cues from .
Apart from that , Amy Editor is probably one of the most feature rich editors in this roundup .
It has support for opening multiple files in different tabs , syntax highlighting support for multiple languages and let ’s you manage multiple projects from within the editor .
Oh , and there is some basic debugging support present too .
PHPAnywhere is one editor that could easily replace my current PHP programming needs without much effort .
For one , it comes with a built - in FTP editor that lets me edit files directly on my server .
It also has excellent syntax highlighting and project management features .
What more could a PHP programmer ask for ?
Those were some of my favorite Online Code Editors .
Do you guys use any online editors for your needs ?
Do you find them useful ?
Let us know in the comments .
The right wing movement in all its forms ( well , there really is only one at this point ) has been trying to equate the BP oil spill catastrophe to Hurricane Katrina and President Bush 's mishandling of it .
Kevin Drum dispatches that notion effortlessly :
This conflates two very different things .
Katrina was an example of the type of disaster that the federal government is specifically tasked with handling .
And for most of the 90s , it was very good at handling them .
But when George Bush became president and Joe Allbaugh became director of FEMA , everything changed .
Allbaugh neither knew nor cared about disaster preparedness .
For ideological reasons , FEMA was downsized and much of its work outsourced .
When Allbaugh left after less than two years on the job , he was replaced by the hapless Michael Brown and the agency was downgraded and broken up yet again .
By the time Katrina hit , the upper levels of FEMA were populated largely with political appointees with no disaster preparedness experience and the agency was simply not up to the job of dealing with a huge storm anymore .
The Deepwater Horizon explosion is almost the exact opposite .
There is no federal expertise in capping oil blowouts .
There is no federal agency tasked specifically with repairing broken well pipes .
There is no expectation that the federal government should be able to respond instantly to a disaster like this .
There never has been .
For better or worse , it 's simply not something that 's ever been considered the responsibility of the federal government .
FEMA 's job was to handle disasters like Katrina , but Dan Bartlett had to make a DVD for Bush to watch because he did n't even know what every American knew as the tragedy was unfolding .
Newsweek :
The reality , say several aides who did not wish to be quoted because it might displease the president , did not really sink in until Thursday night .
Some White House staffers were watching the evening news and thought the president needed to see the horrific reports coming out of New Orleans .
Counselor Bartlett made up a DVD of the newscasts so Bush could see them in their entirety as he flew down to the Gulf Coast the next morning on Air Force One .
How this could be —how the president of the United States could have even less " situational awareness , " as they say in the military , than the average American about the worst natural disaster in a century — is one of the more perplexing and troubling chapters in a story that , despite moments of heroism and acts of great generosity , ranks as a national disgrace .
I take issue with how Axelrod and his team approached the spill because the president should have been out there sooner , but to draw a parallel to the Bush 's Katrina disaster is completely ridiculous .
The White House knew what was happening and did n't need a DVD of news reports made for them by Robert Gibbs to help alert them to the crisis .
If conservative governance proved anything , it was that without competent oversight , regulations , and a willingness to then implement those tools , horrific things result .
I made the same argument to the very unstable Andrew Breitbart on last Friday 's LA Weekly panel discussion , but he was too busy drinking beers on stage to engage in a real dialogue about anything other than the ACORN thugs who helped cause the global financial meltdown , as he phrased it .

Dorsa Sobhani , a member of the 1 Million Signature Campaign , was arrested this morning in Sari , northern Iran .
The 1 Million Signature Campaign aims to collect a million signatures to a petition to repeal all the discriminatory laws against women in Iran , while raising awareness about this inequality .
Ms. Sobhani is a Baha’i who was denied her right to higher education because of her faith , and she has also campaigned for those rights .
Many students – Baha ’is and politically active – have been banned from attending universities in the past .
The “ Committee for the Right to Education ” , which Dorsa is a member of , campaigned to lift these bans .
Since the disputed June election in Iran , many members of the committee were arrested .
This arrest comes after a raid on Sobhani ’s home on March 2th , when six security officials entered the home in the middle of the night , searched it and confiscated belongings .
On March 4th , six officials returned to Sobhani ’s home , and physically and verbally attacked her father .
He was then arrested , blindfolded , bound and interrogated and threatened for hours .
The security officials told him that unless he turns in Dorsa , he , his wife and young daughter will be arrested and their home will be taken away from them .
This morning Dorsa arrived at her home where she was met by 12 security agents who proceeded to arrest her .
Civil liberties groups fight biometric IDs
ACLU , other groups oppose plan for biometric Social Security cards
Civil liberties organizations oppose a proposal by two senators to require biometric Social Security cards for U.S. workers in an effort to curb illegal immigration .
Sens. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) and Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) published an article March 19 that outlined several principles they intend to include in immigration reform legislation , and described a requirement for biometric Social Security cards “ to ensure that illegal workers cannot get jobs . ”
In response , the American Civil Liberties Union , American Libraries Association and about 40 other groups and individuals wrote to the White House officials and members of Congress on April 13 to urge them to reject a biometric national ID card because the groups claim it would invade privacy , allow for troubling government controls and be risky and expensive .
“ A National ID would not only violate privacy by helping to consolidate data and facilitate tracking of individuals , it would bring government into the very center of our lives by serving as a government permission slip needed by everyone in order to work , ” states the letter from the ACLU and the other groups .
The organizations also contend it would cost approximately $ 285 billion to issue a biometric ID card to each American .
That estimate is based on an extrapolation of the Homeland Security Department ’s estimated $ 1.9 billion cost of issuing identity credentials to a million transportation workers under the Transportation Workers Identity Credential program , the groups wrote .
The cost would likely be covered by fees to obtain the cards , they added .
The letter writers also contend that a biometric Social Security card system would not be effective without establishing a central electronic repository of Americans ’ personal information , which would risk of identity theft .
“ Without recordkeeping , the same Social Security number and birth certificate could be used again and again to issue new cards to different people – defeating the entire purpose of the system , ” the organizations wrote .
Currently , unauthorized workers often circumvent laws by using stolen or borrowed Social Security numbers , and current U.S. systems to verify workers '
Social Security numbers , such as E - Verify , have very imited ability to detect identity theft .
Schumer and Graham did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
I got to know the poet Allen Ginsberg towards the end of his life .
Not very well , just a nodding acquaintance , but after he died I attended a memorial in his honor at the City University Graduate School .
At that service , his personal assistant related a story about Ginsberg 's reaction to the death sentence pronounced on the novelist Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989 .
Rushdie's " crime , " you 'll recall , was writing a provocative , perhaps even blasphemous novel inspired by the life of Muhammad called The Satanic Verses .
Though I might be screwing up a few details , the gist of the story was as follows :
Soon after news of the fatwa broke , Ginsberg and his assistant climbed into the back seat of a taxi in Manhattan .
After a glance at the cab driver 's name , Ginsberg politely inquired if he was a Muslim .
When the cabbie replied that he was , Ginsberg asked him what he thought about the death sentence on Rushdie .
The cabbie answered that he thought that Rushdie 's book was disrespectful of Islam , and that the Ayatollah had every right to do what he had done .
At this point , according to his assistant , Ginsberg , one of the gentlest men ever to walk the planet , flew into a rage , screaming at the cabbie as he continued to drive , " Then I shit on your religion !
Do you hear me ?
I shit on Islam !
I shit on Muhammad !
Do you hear ?
I shit on Muhammad ! " Ginsberg demanded that the cabbie pull over .
The cabbie complied , and , without paying the fare , Ginsberg and his assistant climbed out .
He was still screaming at the cabbie as the car drove off .
I 've had a couple of weeks now to think about Ginsberg cursing out that cabbie , and cursing out Islam and Muhammad .
You see , I live in Manhattan , three blocks from Times Square .
As near as I can determine , I was walking with a friend about thirty feet from the car bomb on May 1st right around the time it was supposed to detonate .
Except for the technical incompetence of a Muslim dirtbag named Faisal Shahzad , I and my friend would likely be dead now .
Note the phrase : " Muslim dirtbag . "
Neither term by itself accounts for the terrorist act he attempted to perpetrate ; both terms , however , are equally complicit in it .
It might have been a crapshoot of nature and nurture that wrought a specimen like Shahzad , but it was Islam that inspired him , that gave his fecal stain of a life its depth and its justification .
Why is that so difficult to admit ?
Let me ask the question another way :
Where 's the rage ?
Why wo n't anyone say in public what Ginsberg said in the back seat of that cab ?
If Islam justifies , or is understood by millions of Muslims to justify , setting off a bomb in Times Square , then I shit on Islam .
There are times for interfaith dialogue , for mutual respect and compassion .
This is n't one of them .
Shahzad 's car bomb was parked in front of the offices of Viacom , the parent company of the Comedy Central , which airs the program South Park .
Last month , the creators of South Park decided to poke fun at the Prophet Muhammad — just as they 'd poked fun at Moses and Jesus many times in the past .
Death threats followed .
It 's too early to connect the Times Square bomb plot to the South Park blasphemy , but police have not ruled it out .
If Shahzad was offended by an animated cartoon and decided to defend the Prophet 's name by killing hundreds of civilians — mothers with their babies in strollers , wide - eyed teenagers in tour groups , husbands and wives out for a night on the town — then I 'll say , along with the poet , I shit on Muhammad .
Americans characterize our collective deference towards the feelings of Muslims as " political correctness . "
The phrase may be apt with respect to certain ethnic and religious minorities , but our tip - toeing around Islamic sensibilities is nothing more than plain , old - fashioned cowardice .
MSNBC stooge Lawrence O'Donnell , for example , repeatedly slandered Mormonism during the 2008 presidential campaign as a sidebar to his creepily obsessive verbal jihad against then - candidate Mitt Romney .
But when asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt whether he would insult Muhammad the way he'd insulted Joseph Smith , O'Donnell replied with rare candor : " Oh , well , I 'm afraid of what the… that 's where I 'm really afraid .
I would like to criticize Islam much more than I do publicly , but I 'm afraid for my life if I do … .
Mormons are the nicest people in the world .
They 'll never take a shot at me .
Those other people , I 'm not going to say a word about them . "
That 's the problem in a nutshell .
But it 's not just O'Donnell 's problem .
It 's our problem .
America 's problem .
The West 's problem .
We lack the moral courage to walk the walk , to put our individual lives on the line in order to defend the principles of free thought and free expression — the very principles that allowed the Judeo - Christian West to leave the Islamic East in the dust , literally and figuratively , three centuries ago .
When Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh was murdered for producing a short movie critical of Islam 's treatment of women in 2004 , where were the public screenings of the film ?
When Muslims in several countries rioted against pen and ink images of Muhammad printed in a Danish newspaper in 2005 , where were the public billboards of those sketches ?
And when the creators of South Park trotted out the Prophet in a ridiculous bear costume , and received death threats in return , where were the mass - produced tee shirts of that image ?
I 'll take a size - medium , cotton if possible , and I 'll wear it in Times Square .
Since 2001 , many Americans have asked how they can contribute in a direct way to the war against totalitarian Islam .
Now we have an answer .
If it 's legal , and likely to offend the radicals , just do it .
That seems straightforward enough .
But how many of us will have the nerve to stand up to a million or so Muslim dirtbags , and to scores of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , of their fellow travelers and psychic enablers , and say in unison , " You want to kill the Enlightenment , you 're going to have to come through me . "
Mark Goldblatt 's new novel , Sloth , has nothing to do with Islam , but he is pleased to announce that the cover image of a cockroach is in fact Muhammad .
You can tell because his antennae form the letter " M . "
You can open a folder into a new window ( or tab ) by holding down the Command key when you double - click on the folder to open it within the Finder of Mac OS X .
A new window will open if new windows are set to open in folders rather than tabs , where as a Mac Finder configured to open new folders into new tabs will open a tab instead with the Command modifier .
Make sense ?
If not , just give it a try in the Finder by going to a location with folders , hold down the Command key as you open them , and you ’ll quickly understand how it works in just a moment or two .
This is a really useful tip if you ’re trying to copy files from inside one folder to another , just open the directories side by side and copy away !

Wildlife agencies in all 48 of the contiguous U.S. states have been put on notice after a mysterious bat - killing disease – white nose syndrome – was recently detected west of the Mississippi River .
The fungal disease , which has a 100 percent fatality rate , was first discovered in bats four years ago in Albany , New York , said Mollie Matteson , conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity .
The disease has subsequently spread into the Midwest , parts of the South , Canada , and most recently , Missouri , Matteson said .
Letters were sent to wildlife agencies to spur agencies to come up with response plans to stop the disease that has baffled scientists , Matteson said .
“ It 's absolutely devastating for the species it has affected so far , ” Matteson said .
The disease seems to strike only bats that hibernate , Matteson said .
WRTV : Bat disease keeping many Indiana caves closed
The disease , typically manifested by a white coat on the nose and in some cases on the animal 's fur , has affected six species of the approximately 45 bat species in the entire United States .
But humans should be concerned .
“ While we have n’t heard anything about transmission to humans , people can spread the disease , ” Matteson said .
“ They can spread it on their clothing and gear , because the fungal spores can be in the caves , particularly if people are crawling on the ground , ” she said .
“ If they leave one cave where the spores are and go into another , they can contaminate it with those spores , ” causing an outbreak , Matteson said .
A nonfatal version of the disease has been found in bats in Europe , Matteson said , but “ bats here in North America have no defense . ”
Although scientists are experimenting with various anti-fungal treatments , there is no known cure or effective treatment for white nose syndrome , Matteson said .
The evolution of belief systems has always been a focus of cognitive research .
In this paper , we delineate a new model describing belief systems as a network of statements considered true .
Testing the model with a small number of parameters enabled us to reproduce a variety of well - known mechanisms ranging from opinion changes to development of psychological problems .
The self - organizing opinion structure showed a scale - free degree distribution .
The novelty of our work lies in applying a convenient set of definitions allowing us to depict opinion network dynamics in a highly favorable way , which resulted in a scale - free belief network .
As an additional benefit , we listed several conjectural consequences in a number of areas related to thinking and reasoning .

The other day , Terry Sanderson — president of the United Kingdom ’s National Secular Society — published a short , scathing indictment of theology in The Guardian , a piece titled “ Theology — truly a naked emperor . ”
This title deliberately recalls H.C. Andersen ’s famous fable , “ The Emperor ’s New Clothes , ” and by implication its ongoing use by popular atheist critics of religion to defang criticism that they know next to nothing about theology .
The fable was first made use of a few years back by atheist blogger ( and biologist ) PZ Myers in a bit of satire called “ The Courtier ’s Reply , ” a response to H. Allen Orr ’s scathing review of Richard Dawkins ’
The God Delusion in the New York Review of Books .
“ The Courtier ’s Reply ” so delighted Dawkins that he quoted it at length in the preface to the paperback edition of his book .
In briefest terms , Orr ’s chief complaint about The God Delusion is that it displays a profound ignorance of relevant theology .
Myers ’ satirical response runs as follows :
I have considered the impudent accusations of Mr. Dawkins with exasperation at his lack of serious scholarship .
He has apparently not read the detailed discourses of Count Roderigo of Seville on the exquisite and exotic leathers of the Emperor ’s boots , nor does he give a moment ’s consideration to Bellini ’s masterwork , On the Luminescence of the Emperor ’s Feathered Hat .
We have entire schools dedicated to writing learned treatises on the beauty of the Emperor ’s raiment , and every major newspaper runs a section dedicated to imperial fashion …
Dawkins arrogantly ignores all these deep philosophical ponderings to crudely accuse the Emperor of nudity .
It goes on , but that is enough to capture its flavor .
Since Myers first published it , this bit of satire has been invoked widely by atheists who want to quickly dismiss those who think atheist critics of religion should engage seriously with important works of theology .
I became painfully conscious of this propensity shortly after Religion Dispatches published an interview with me about my book , Is God a Delusion ?
The link to that interview quickly appeared on Richard Dawkins ’
Web site under the heading , “ Another Flea , ” invoking the practice of Dawkins ’ supporters to call critics of The God Delusion “ fleas . ”
The very first posted comment was this : “ Just from reading the abstract it sounds like another book in ‘ The Courtier ’s Reply ’ category . ”
The subsequent comments were riddled with mockery .
But can theology really be dismissed so readily ?
Myers ’ satire has as its backdrop a story in which a pair of con men have pretended to make a new set of clothes for the emperor but present him instead with nothing but thin air , along with a cockamamie story to the effect that those who are stupid or unfit for their positions ca n’t see these fine clothes at all .
Since no one wants to be accused of these things , everyone pretends to see what they do n’t in fact see .
In Myers ’ version of the story , this pretense has spiraled out of control , becoming an entire literary genre with recognized masterworks , all of it serving only to perpetuate the con game and silence anyone with the temerity to state the obvious .
Myers ’ satire sees theology as a pretentious obfuscation : high - sounding nonsense whose only function is to obscure the obvious truth that there is no God .
But notice : Myers does n’t argue for this conclusion .
He seems to take it as an obvious premise — making one wonder whether this is n’t just a clever bit of question - begging .
After all , there is no real attempt to look at works of theology to see if the judgment fits .
Terry Sanderson , in his recent Guardian piece , might be seen as trying to support Myers ’ presumption by offering up some examples of theology ’s pretentious obfuscation — or at least one , an example from Rowan Williams which Sanderson characterizes as “ convoluted writing that nobody with their feet in reality can comprehend . ”
He describes watching the “ theological ” programs he finds on television as akin to having had “ one of those strokes that make your native language incomprehensible to you .
You recognize the individual words as English , but they have no meaning . ”
And on the basis of this subjective assessment of some unscientifically selected samples , Sanderson is happy to embrace the premise underlying Myers ’ “ Courtier ’s Reply . ”
In Sanderson ’s words , “ Theology is an excuse for grown men to spend their lives trying to convince themselves , and others , that ridiculous fairy tales are true . ”
Put more simply , Sanderson has looked at some theology , found it incomprehensible , and concluded that this must mean it is meaningless nonsense whose only possible function is to hide fictional beliefs behind a cloud of obscurantism .
I might as well conclude that string theory is nonsense , since it ’s incomprehensible to me .
Fortunately , Myers ’ more prominent follower is also a more careful thinker .
Dawkins offers an interpretation of “ The Courtier ’s Reply ” that , at least at first glance , lends it more plausibility .
In the preface to the paperback edition of The God Delusion , Dawkins distinguishes between two kinds of theology : the kind which presupposes God ’s existence , which I ’ll call substantive theology ; and the kind that attempts to make the case for God ’s existence .
We might call this apologetic theology .
Dawkins admits he needs to take apologetic theology into account — which he claims to have done adequately and with “ good humor ” in The God Delusion .
What he need n’t do , he thinks , is pay heed to the other kind of theology .
Now Dawkins does n’t display any understanding of what this other kind of theology is , what its practitioners actually do .
He has n’t studied it , after all .
Whatever it is , it ’s something like fairyology , by which Dawkins has in mind the study of such things as “ the exact shape and colour of fairy wings . ”
In other words , Dawkins takes it that this other kind of theology devotes itself to theorizing about what God is like .
But since all such theorizing is premised on the assumption that there is a God , this other kind of theology begs Dawkins ’ question — and hence can be ignored .
This is what he takes Myers to be pointing out .
Now , the distinction Dawkins makes here seems reasonable enough .
But there are some important questions .
First , does Dawkins really understand and appreciate the force of apologetic theology in all its diversity ?
In fact , I think it ’s quite clear he does n’t .
But since this is an issue I take up at some length in my book , I want to set it aside here so I can focus on another question :
Is Dawkins right that he and other atheist critics of religion do n’t need to take substantive theology into account ?
Are Myers and Sanderson right that they can justifiably ignore theology ’s perplexing techno - babble , making no effort to learn the academic language of theology , on the ground that these theologians are simply assuming as true the very thing that atheists are calling into question ?
I think not .
First of all , the kind of question we are asking when we ask whether or not God exists is a very different kind of question than we are asking when we wonder about the emperor ’s state of undress .
Belief in the existence of the emperor ’s pantaloons involves belief that the empirical world we encounter with our senses includes ( among other things ) a garment of a certain shape and size draped over the emperor ’s nether parts .
But if something lacks all empirical properties , then it ca n’t have a size or shape , let alone cover the emperor ’s naughty bits , and so it ca n’t be a garment .
And so if we conduct an empirical test on the emperor and fail to detect any empirical properties consistent with his wearing pants , then he is n’t .
To be a garment requires the possession of empirical properties .
Take those away , and there is no garment .
But belief in God is n’t primarily a belief about the contents of the empirical world .
It is , rather , a certain holistic interpretation of our experience , one that offers an account of the meaning and significance of the empirical world and the lives we lead within it .
To believe in God is to understand the world of ordinary experience in terms of an interpretive worldview that posits the existence of “ something more . ”
In this respect , belief in God is more like belief in metaphysical naturalism — by which I mean the doctrine that the empirical world exhausts what is real .
Whether or not there is more to reality than meets the empirical eye is n’t a question we can answer through empirical investigation , the way that we can answer whether the poor emperor ’s fruits are hanging free .
So how do we address this kind of question ?
The answer , I think , is that we have to “ try on ” alternative interpretations to see which offers the best fit with the whole of human experience — not merely with what we experience through our senses , but also with the broader and ultimately more important dimensions of our lived experience , including our moral and aesthetic experience and our sense of the numinous .
Is a naturalistic worldview , one which explains away these latter features of our lives ( or at least the last ) , ultimately a better fit with the whole of human experience than some alternative which posits a transcendent element of one kind or another ?
How can we even begin to answer such a question without seriously “ trying on ” the alternatives ?
In its broadest terms , theology is the intellectual project of developing and exploring a range of alternative worldviews that all have something in common — namely , they include belief in a transcendent reality that is in some way both fundamental and good .
As such , theology falls within a much broader intellectual project , one that develops and explores not only theistic worldviews , but other worldviews as well , such as the naturalistic one endorsed by Dawkins , Myers , and Sanderson .
Of course , an interpretive worldview has to fit with our experience , including what science teaches us about the world .
And not every theistic worldview meets this criterion ( Young Earth Creationism comes to mind ) .
But while a specific formulation of theism might have to give way before scientific evidence in just the way that a specific version of Darwinian theory might need to give way to a more nuanced and comprehensive version , the overall theological project — to shape a theistic worldview consistent with experience — remains viable regardless of what science teaches us .
What this means is that in a broad sense a theistic worldview is empirically unfalsifiable … just like a naturalistic one .
Simply put , we do n’t test our holistic worldviews the way we test whether the emperor is naked or clothed .
We test them by trying them on , trying to live them out , and then reflecting on how well they work as organizing principles for individual and communal lives .
We test them not only in terms of their internal consistency and consistency with empirical facts ( something that the best theologians always strive to maintain ) , but in terms of such issues as pragmatic impact on the quality of human life .
We also assess them in terms of simplicity — a criterion according to which naturalism may have an edge ( although some theologians argue otherwise ) .
And all else being equal , a worldview that forces us to explain away huge swaths of our lived experience as nothing but delusion and error is less satisfactory than one which offers a meaningful and coherent account of those same elements .
The task of deciding which worldview to embrace — and hence whether or not we should believe in some kind of transcendent reality or God — is an enormously challenging task that cannot be answered through empirical investigation .
It is a question which , in fact , will probably never be answered wholly or fully .
But we cannot ignore the question , because which worldview we adopt makes a big difference for how we live our lives .
And so we must struggle to assess the relative merits of the alternatives available to us — something that we simply cannot responsibly do by ignoring those thinkers who , as part of a rich traditional of rigorous inquiry , attempt to construct plausible theistic world views and uncover the explanatory power of theism in relation to the full breadth of our human experience .
In other words , we cannot responsibly assess the question of God ’s existence by ignoring in advance the work of substantive theologians .
The strategy of satirical dismissal championed by Myers , embraced by Dawkins , and recently promulgated on the pages of The Guardian by Terry Sanderson , is nothing short of a formula for intellectual irresponsibility .
Laureano said he had studied techniques such as rainwater capture systems , rooftop gardens and underground tunnels that keep water in the subsoil , but that they risk extinction with the advent of intensive agriculture .
Digby told she watched Pam Stout , a tea party activist who was interviewed on David Letterman the other night .
If anyone in the media is still confused by who and what ideas the Tea Partiers represent , they should watch the entire Letterman interview .
( And the media should get a copy of our new book when it 's released in June ) .
Pam is hep to the fact that the Tea Party wants to take over the Republican Party , because a third party would n't help their cause and hey , they are arch - conservatives .
Her hero is Jim DeMint and she wants us to leave Big Business alone and believes people really want to live off welfare checks .
So , there you go .
This is part 2 of the interview .
Digby has all three embedded in her post .
Digby nails it :
Watch the videos here if you have the time .
She was the best tea party representative I 've ever seen --- a perfect face for the angry Bircher club to which she also belongs , the Friends of Liberty .
I was blown away by this interview and frankly , a little bit chilled .
She 's mild - mannered , reasonable , utterly sincere , decent and true .
Yet , she watches Beck because he " makes her think " and she reveres Jim DeMint , the most radical of all the rightwing Senators .
This lovely woman believes in the raw , violent politics of the Hobbesian jungle in which it 's every man for himself .
I 'm sure she does n't see it that way .
Her politics are n't grounded in real life but in abstract concepts .
She certainly does n't seem defensive or even aware that her political heroes are considered radical extremists .
But then if you only watch
Fox news , listen to talk radio and live in the town known for its proximity to Ruby Ridge and the Aryan Nations compound you probably do n't realize that your views are not held by the majority of Americans .
People like Pam show us how powerful the right - wing noise machine is .
She 's clearly living in a Fox News Universe ; people like this have been converted to believing in essentially an alternative universe .
Grover Norquist would be very happy after he watches this because he believes that the more anti-government people that are created ( and believe me , he helped create a great deal of them ) , the more votes the conservative movement gets , all of which helps to eradicate the left entirely , which is their ultimate goal .
The NY Times had a great piece featuring Auntie Pam some months ago ( and Dave discussed it here ) .
Her views resemble the John Birch Society , only she has no clue that 's where she is politically .
About that Mark Kirk claim to have been named the U.S. Navy 's Intelligence Officer of the Year , the Washington Post does a little digging :
Kirk was assigned to a unit based in Aviano , Italy , during the conflict .
A professional group , the National Military Intelligence Association , gave the unit an award for outstanding service , according to a revised résumé posted on Kirk 's Web site Saturday .
The association 's Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Award celebrates " the exceptional achievements of an outstanding Naval Intelligence career professional , " but the citation in 2000 contains no mention of Kirk and instead designates the entire Intelligence Division Electronic Attack Wing at Aviano .
Kirk , whose campaign has emphasized his military service as a reservist , similarly misstated the award during a House committee hearing in March 2002 .
In a remark recorded by C - Span , he said , " I was the Navy 's Intelligence Officer of the Year , " an achievement he depicted as providing special qualifications to discuss national security spending .
Eric Elk , a spokesman for Kirk 's campaign , declined to comment except to say " we found the award was misidentified and corrected the name . "
C'mon , give the guy a break .
It 's a mistake anyone can make .
Say you 're an extra in a movie that wins an Oscar .
It 's totally the same as you winning the Academy Award for best actor .
Right ?
And it explains why you would n't issue a correction , but instead just quietly change a campaign website without acknowledging error .
Update : As Eman points out , according to the Wayback Machine , it 's worse : the military award has been listed on Kirk 's official taxpayer - funded site from 2003 until the present .
Even less effective was the paper currency , for obvious reasons .

TC member unwittingly tells We Are Change activist of plans for world government
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , May 14 , 2010
Trilateral Commission member Mikhail Slobodovsici , a chief adviser to the Russian leadership , unwittingly provided a revealing insight into the plans of the global elite during the group ’s recent meeting in Dublin Ireland , when he mistakenly told a We Are Change Ireland activist he thought was a fellow TC member that the globalists are planning a war with Iran .
According to Jim Tucker ’s fascinating report on the story , Slobodovsici also let slip to We Are Change Ireland ’s Alan Keenan that the Trilateralists and their BIlderberg counterparts are intent on exploiting the economic crisis to finalize plans for a world government , but that this agenda is being severely hampered by so - called “ nationalists ” who are becoming increasingly aware of the impact that global government will have on their freedom and standards of living .
“ We are deciding the future of the world , ” Slobodovsici told Keenan .
“ We need a world government , ” he said , but , referring to Iran , said “ we need to get rid of them . ”
“ Suddenly , Slobodovsici noticed that Keenan ’s nametag was different from the TC label and said : “ I ca n’t talk — we operate under Chatham House rules , ” reports Tucker .
Slobodovsici ’s position on Iran is both alarming and surprising in equal measure , given that Russia has been generally supportive of Iran ’s right to develop a peaceful nuclear fuel program and has directly helped build reactors .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Tucker also reveals that Trilateralists are crestfallen at how their plans for global government and centralization of power are being so fiercely resisted .
“ It gets worse every year , not better , ” one said .
“ Why do we even bother to meet anymore ? ”
“ We ca n’t simply give up and quit , ” another responded .
“ Bilderberg expects us to have a plan outlined . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The fact that the elite had planned to have their world government fully operational by 2000 and are ten years overdue has been much cause for concern amongst Trilateralists , reports Tucker .
“ TC boys are upset they were unable to exploit the economic crisis they helped generate by creating a world “ treasury department ” under the UN .
They blame “ rising nationalism ” and ask “ how those people knew about this , ” according to witnesses inside the TC hotel . ”
The continuing collapse of the euro threatens to derail the entire march towards global governance , a problem the elitists want to address by cranking up the printing presses in an effort to pour more money into failing states like Greece , Portugal and Spain .
The fact that a We Are Change Ireland activist was able to fool a Trilateral Commission member into spilling the beans on the globalists ’ agenda is astounding .
As was underscored recently by members of the Sovereign Independent who confronted David Rockefeller during the same meeting in Dublin , Trlaterals do not enjoy the same intense security that is afforded to the Bilderberg Group during their annual confab .
Bilderberg are set to convene at the Hotel Dolce Sitges near Barcelona Spain from June 4 - 7 for their annual meeting at which they will cover similar ground to the issues that were up for debate at the Trilateral conference in Dublin .

Patients without health insurance , and those who are insured but fear the cost of medical care , are more likely to delay seeking life - saving treatment when having a heart attack .
For the millions of American adults who do n’t have health insurance , and those who have it but worry that illness might ruin them financially , the signs of an impending heart attack do not set in motion the kind of rapid , lifesaving response that medical professionals urge , according to a study conducted at 24 urban hospitals across the nation .
Instead , when uninsured or financially insecure adults feel stabbing chest pain , burning in the shoulders and jaw , or extreme pressure across the midsection , they are more likely than the reliably insured to consider the economic consequences of a false alarm and put off getting help .
That delay , established in a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , may be a costly decision for the nation as well as for those who put off seeking care .
Long - standing research shows that the longer a heart attack victim delays treatment , the greater the risk of dying .
The new study included only subjects who survived , but its authors speculated that delayed care contributed to the death of many others , helping drive the estimated 45,000 annual U.S. fatalities attributed to a lack of health insurance .
And patients who delay getting medical attention for a heart attack are more likely to be rehospitalized for heart problems , to experience heart failure and ongoing chest pains called angina , and to have generally poorer health .
The result : a human and financial toll on which the study ’s researchers are collecting data that they expect to tally next .
Just two weeks after the passage of landmark legislation overhauling healthcare , one of the study ’s lead authors said its findings underscored the need to go beyond the goal of broadening access to health insurance .
Policymakers must now focus on reassuring Americans that they will be able to afford care when they need it , said Dr. Paul Chan -- especially if insurance companies raise premiums or shift costs to those already on their rolls .
“ I think it ’s a wake - up call , ” said Chan , a cardiologist with St. Luke ’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City , Mo . “ The affordability of care despite having insurance is going to be an increasingly larger problem as the lack of insurance becomes less of an issue . ”
Chan and researchers from across the country and Europe interviewed and combed through the case files of 3,721 patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction between April 2005 and the end of 2008 .
Researchers found that 36.6 % with insurance got themselves to a hospital ’s emergency department within two hours of the onset of symptoms .
Among uninsured patients , 27.5 % arrived at a hospital within two hours .
Among uninsured patients , almost half -- 48.6 % -- waited at least six hours to go to a hospital .
Only 39.3 % of those who had secure health insurance waited as long .
Patients who had health insurance , but expressed concern about their finances should they need to use it , fell between those two extremes in both measures : 33.5 % of those patients arrived within two hours at a hospital , and 44.6 % waited six hours or more to get help .
The authors noted that more than half of these financially concerned patients had fee - for - service ( a preferred - provider organization ) or health maintenance insurance plans -- options that sometimes leave patients with high out - of - pocket costs when seeking emergency care .
And most of those patients would be considered working poor .
“ Patients concerned over their ability to pay for treatment , who delay seeking care , are putting themselves at dire risk , ” said Dr. Ralph Brindis , president of the American College of Cardiology , who called the JAMA study important .
In Los Angeles , physicians who treat the uninsured and underinsured said they often saw patients delay getting emergency help for their heart symptoms -- and contend with the consequences .
“ I have seen people I know have delayed because they just could n’t afford it , ” said Dr. Brian Johnston , chief of emergency services at White Memorial Medical Center .
“ They require much more extensive treatment . ”
He added : “ The guy who ’s been breaking out in a sweat and calling it indigestion -- that ’s the guy you want to get to before he has a heart attack .
We will save ourselves and save them an enormous amount of suffering and cost . ”

The coming gold bust
Golden bracelets are displayed at a shop in Jakarta on December 3 , 2009 .
( Fortune ) --
When gold prices turn skyward , like they did for the past two weeks before some recent flattening , some mix of greed , fear and uncertainty are likely ruling the market .
What better time to remember what really drives prices over the long - term : market fundamentals .
Through that lens , gold might not be such a hot investment .
The gold market works much like any other , with supply and demand eventually equalizing , and runaway prices returning to long - term averages .
Since 1980 , the price of gold has averaged about $ 440 an ounce in U.S. dollars .
But much like U.S. home prices over this decade , it can take some time for prices to return to normal .
Barclays Wealth in London predicts gold will fall to a fair value of $ 800 an ounce by 2012 , as investors eventually dump it for riskier trades ; Societe Generale , the French bank , in April 2009 predicted $ 800 gold by the end of 2010 , though it has reversed its stance since then .
Analyst John Nadler of gold deal Kitco predicts gold will fall to $ 900 in 2011 .
( See editor 's note below . )
Their reasoning is simple : investors are keeping prices high even as demand from non-investors is cratering .
Take gold jewelry , which accounts for more than half of the world 's gold market .
Demand there fell 8 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 and is likely to continue to fall amid high prices that turn off shoppers .
For example , in India , the largest gold buying country , high gold prices this week kept Indians from purchasing metal for the gold - buying festival of Akshaya Tritiya , which in turn drove down prices .
Then there 's price pressure from the supply side .
Higher gold prices mean miners work overtime .
The supply of mine gold around the world jumped 7 % last year to 2,572 tons - the second largest increase in history .
Gold bullion dealer Kitco says places like China and Russia will help boost the amount of gold from mining by 4 % to 6 % a year through 2014 .
Because it costs miners about $ 480 on average to extract an ounce of gold , they plow ahead when prices are high , eventually leading to an oversupply situation .
Gold as $ 1,200 also brings out the sellers and resellers .
In 2009 , scrap supply - all those gold pendants , necklaces and coins people have lying around - hit an all - time high of 1,700 tons .
All those " we buy gold " signs , Internet advertisements and late night television commercials ?
Well , they 're starting to work .
That scrap supply high is actually a 27 % rise from 2008 , according to Kitco .
" So long as prices remain above $ 1,000 - $ 1,100 we will continue to see a river of secondary gold actually starting to compete with mine production , " says Jon Nadler , a Kitco analyst .
The real reason for the drop : stabilization in other markets
That 's not to predict an immediate gold crash .
The " fear premium " it commands as a store of value during uncertain financial times could support higher prices indefinitely .
As traders sort out the effects of Europe 's $ 1 trillion bailout and whether inflation or deflation creep up in the U.S. , investors will probably continue parking in gold as long as they can .
Gold has slumped just a bit as a sense of some stability has returned to the markets in Europe .
But some of the smart money is betting that gold keeps rising .
Hedge funds and other big speculative traders boosted their gold bets by 2 % last week , according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
The thing is , no one knows how long their bets are for .
Fast money from hedge funds and speculators can get out while prices are high .
In fact , one of the prevailing themes among speculators seems to be : ride the momentum while it lasts .
Often times their ownership of gold lies in futures , never even taking physical delivery of the yellow stuff .
Essentially , it 's the Rabbit Angstroms ( and now Glenn Beck watchers ) of the world that have to fear the gold Krugerrands in their safe deposit boxes could slowly shed all the value they have picked up over the last year .
Dennis Gartman , a hedge fund manager and newsletter editor who is betting on gold , wrote last week that " the public is selling gold not buying it , as evidenced by the fact that there are as many advertisements on television touting the opportunities one might have in selling one 's gold ... as there are touting gold as an investment .
" Until ... the latter advertisements dwarf those of the former , the Bubble has not yet been blown . "
In other words , bubbles and semi- bubbles rarely last - the market fundamentals are just too powerful to ignore .
Correction :
An earlier version of this article relied on an April 2009 Soc Gen gold report which predicted a price drop .
Societe Generale has since reversed their view on gold .

In the May issue of Wired , there 's a package of stories on Lost __ ( on page 88 in the magazine , available here on the site ) __ reminisces about some of our favorite Easter eggs from the show .
But there were more Easter eggs to collect in the section .
Namely , a few hidden phrases given to us by the creators of Lost .
The importance of those phrases will become clear as the show nears its finale .
Did you find them ?
Do you know what two messages the Island [ or Jacob or the Smoke Monster or the island or perhaps the polar bear ] decided to share with us in the most cryptic manner imaginable ?
Below we will share these two secrets of the Island , and where they were hidden .
__Solution » The first critical clue to two mysterious phrases hidden in a photo of Executive Producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cruse in the Lost writer 's room .
( It 's on page 88 and 89 __in the magazine , and available here on the site . )
On the board , next to writer Damon Lindelof ’s head , are two number strings : ( 3 3 ’2 4 2 ) and ( 3 5 2 3 6 2 6 3 6 6 ) .
These number strings give away the length and formatting of the two phrases .
__Phrase One : __
Let ’s deal with the shorter phrase first .
The writer ’s room ’s enumeration ( 3 3 ’2 4 2 ) tells us we are looking for a four word phrase whose second word has an apostrophe .
Scrolling through the section , a sharp - eyed reader capable of translating from Island - ese to English might have noticed some intriguing extraneous details .
They 're in the pullquotes from admirers of Lost , which are scattered through the package .
Looking closer , you can see that certain graphic elements point to specific letters of each quote .
In Tim Kring ’s quote ( on page 95 in the magazine and here on wired .
com__ ) __ , a small arrow under the first line points to the “ n ” in audience , the “ o ” in to , and to the “ w ” in sprawling on the second line .
Together , these letters spell NOW , our first answer word .
Finding the arrows in the quotes of Dave Howe ( YOU’RE ) and Zack Snyder ( LIKE ME ) , we get the rest of the first phrase .
Together , the elements combine to make our first answer phrase from the white board : “ Now you ’re like me . ”
The meaning of this phrase is clear to longtime viewers of Lost .
In a nutshell , it signifies that — psyche !
Did you really think we were going to tell ?
That would n't be sporting .
Phrase Two :
The second phrase is considerably longer than the first : ( 3 5 2 3 6 2 6 3 6 6 ) .
The solution is also more far more inscrutable — like , as inscrutable as Farraday 's tie .
The first thing we need to solve this phrase is the oddly misspelled Dharma logo ( on page 93 in the magazine , or here on wired.com ) .
There are several elements on this “ Dharma dial ” critically important to figuring out our phrase .
You may have already cursed the typo gods for the misspelling of the company name that is plastered everywhere on the island , but by now you must realize that that ’s no typo in the word “ DHAMAR . ”
The logo also contains a lot of numbers filling up the I Ching slots on the exterior bands of the logo .
Finally , the lighthouse graphic in the center of the image is topped with a Roman numeral XII .
Let ’s deal with the numbers filling up the slots first .
These numbers are ones *
Lost * fans have seen before .
They correspond to the numbers on the wheel at Jacob ’s lighthouse ( referenced by the lighthouse at the center of the dial ) .
To begin , take the numbers in the slots , starting at the topmost number and moving clockwise one cell at a time around the outer band .
Compare these numbers to the ones on the lighthouse wheel ( as described on the Lostpedia wiki . )
The first number , “ 31 , ” refers to “ Toms , ” the person at 31 on the lighthouse wheel .
The next number , clockwise , is “ 103 . ”
On the lighthouse wheel person 103 is Horsman .
As we continue working clockwise and inwards around the wheel and matching names , a pattern forms .
1. __T__oms ( 31 )
2. __H__orsman ( 103 )
3. __E__ipons ( 110 )
4. __H__oward ( 28 )
5. __E__ipons ( 110 )
6. __A__usten ( 51 )
7. __R__eyes ( 8 )
8. __T__homson ( 107 )
9. __O__wens ( 125 )
10 . __F__ord ( 15 )
11 . __T__orres ( 37 )
12 . __H__orton ( 98 )
13 . __E__ipons ( 110 )
14 . __I__nman ( 62 )
15 . __S__hephard ( 23 )
16 . __L__ocke ( 4 )
17 . __A__lmeida ( 119 )
18 . __N__ielson ( 121 )
19 . __D__awson ( 124 )
20 . __I__nman ( 62 )
21 . __S__tanhope ( 48 )
22 . __B__ozarth ( 26 )
23 . __E__ipons ( 110 )
24 . __Y__amada ( 114 )
25 . __O__larti ( 54 )
26 . __N__guyen ( 19 )
27 . __D__avies ( 61 )
28 . __T__oms ( 31 )
29 . __H__oward ( 28 )
30 . __E__ipons ( 110 )
31 . __B__ardfield ( 100 )
32 . __A__usten ( 51 )
33 . __M__oorhead ( 22 )
34 . __B__arnes ( 43 )
35 . __O__wens ( 125 )
36 . __O__larti ( 54 )
The first letters of each name string together to make the phrase : “ The heart of the island is beyond the bamboo … ”
Looking back to our phrase enumeration in the white board photo , we still need a final six letter word .
Examining the center of our misspelled Dharma dial , we find the Roman numeral XII or “ 12 . ”
On the lighthouse wheel , we see that person 12 is named “ Foster . ”
Using the misspelling pattern in the word DHAMAR — that is , 1st letter , then 2nd letter , then 6th letter , then 5th letter , then 3rd letter , then 4th letter — we can rearrange FOSTER to make the word “ forest ” – our final word .
This completes the puzzle and gives us the phrase “ The heart of the island is beyond the bamboo forest . ”
Obviously , this phrase solves every riddle the island has ever given us , laying bare all its secrets !
Or not .
You ’ll have to see for yourself .
The Humble Bundle is a great deal for gamers for a number of reasons .
The games work on Windows , Mac OS X and Linux .
You can pay as little or as much as you want , and you can donate some or all of the money to the included charities .
There is absolutely no DRM on any of the games .
So why does it look like one quarter of the people enjoying the games have pirated them ?
Unpacking the actual numbers behind piracy is often difficult , but Wolfire has been incredibly transparent about its numbers .
The result is strong evidence that no matter what steps developers take , piracy will still be an issue .
Piracy is inevitable
We spoke to Jeffery Rosen , cofounder of Wolfire Games , about the piracy rate of the Humble Bundle .
" I think piracy is absolutely inevitable — this is a really clear example of it , " Rosen said .
" People will literally not pay a penny to a charity in order to legitimately get a bundle of games that they want . "
Rosen points out that the Bundle has stripped away nearly every rationalization for piracy .
" A lot of the common rationalizations for piracy simply do n't exist here : DRM , an agent between you and the developers , or high prices .
Some people rationalize it by claiming they can't pay — but they could have asked their mom .
They could have e-mailed us ( we 're currently at inbox zero for support requests ) . "
Rosen claims they received thousands of technical support questions throughout the week , about 10 of them relating to payment .
Those who e-mailed and said they could n't pay ?
The number was so low that Rosen personally made a contribution on their behalf .
Pirating the Humble Bundle titles is easy .
" When I say this bundle is DRM - free — I really mean DRM - free .
Not only do the games themselves have no copy protection ( not even a simple serial number check ) , but the Humble Indie Bundle website has limited copy protection , " Rosen wrote on the official blog .
" That means there are no download limits , everything is reachable on the command - line with ' wget ' , you can resume downloads , and do anything else you would expect to be able to do with a personal download link . "
Linux users in particular praised these decisions to make the downloads painless .
Are there reasons to pirate ?
Rosen came up with a few reasons people feel the need to pirate games .
Laziness is a big one : it 's simply easier to click a link than to fill out the fields needed to donate even a single cent .
There may be customers who live in an area where PayPal , Google Checkout , and Amazon are not supported , leaving them with no way to pay .
Some people may have made a single large donation for multiple bundles .
Others may simply like the feeling of getting something for nothing .
Rosen lays out these reasons , saying that Wolfire does n't plan on doing anything to thwart those who pirate the games .
" When considering any kind of DRM , we have to ask ourselves , ' How many legitimate users is it OK to inconvenience in order to reduce piracy ? '
The answer should be none . "
This is why the DRM debate is so destructive .
There is no technology that can't be cracked , and invasive strategies only make the companies targets for the more aggressive hackers and crackers .
If you give gamers everything they say they want , there will still be a significant number of people who will grab the game without paying .
" A lot of these people do n't just pirate the game , they take pleasure in spreading the pirated links to their friends or anonymous buddies for fun , " Rosen told Ars .
" They just do n't care , and if you can't get someone to pay a penny in this case — will they really pay full price for a game ? "
While piracy may be frustrating , the bundle has been quite the success : as of this writing almost 84,000 people have paid $ 716,944 in total for the games .
Today we ’re releasing JRuby 1.4.1 as a recommended upgrade for all previous versions of JRuby .
Previous versions contained a bug in JRuby ’s regular expression engine that could allow an attacker to perform , for example , an XSS attack on a web application running under JRuby .
Download the 1.4.1 release .
This vulnerability fix is the only change from the previous JRuby release ( 1.4.0 ) .
Also note that the JRuby 1.5.0 release contains this fix as well .
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name CVE - 2010 - 1330 to this issue .
This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list , which standardizes names for security problems .
Impact
Any Ruby application code that uses regular expressions for string matching and substitution running under JRuby and using $ KCODE = 'u ' is vulnerable .
If a string contains invalid UTF - 8 byte sequences in the ( inclusive ) range \xC0 to \xFD , the immediately following character will not be matched by a regular expression .
Consider the following code :
str = " \x F6 < script > " $ KCODE = '' puts " KCODE : " + $ KCODE puts str . gsub ( /</ , " < " ) $ KCODE = 'u ' puts " KCODE : " + $ KCODE puts str . gsub ( /</ , " < " )
Ruby 1.8.7 ignores the invalid bytes and continues , while Ruby 1.9.2 raises an ArgumentError due to the invalid bytes .
But for JRuby , the effect is to fail to match the character following the invalid byte .
For the example above example run with JRuby 1.4.0 prints the following .
Note that the fourth line should be the same as the second .
KCODE : NONE ?< script > KCODE : UTF8 ?< script >
The effect of this bug is magnified considering that the Rails html_escape or h helper essentially does what the above example does , meaning that any Rails view using the standard ERb escape helper method is vulnerable .
Releases
The JRuby 1.4.1 and 1.5.0 releases ( including release candidates ) all have the vulnerability fixed .
The fix was applied to the jcodings library which JRuby uses .
As such , a source patch against the JRuby source is not available .
Replacing the build_lib / jcodings .jar file in your JRuby source build with the jcodings version 1.0.3 jar file is sufficient to resolve the issue .
If you are unable to upgrade to JRuby 1.4.1 , please contact the JRuby team at security@jruby.org for assistance .
Workarounds
Turn off $ KCODE = 'u ' in your application if you can .
Otherwise , the only approach is to patch application or framework code to be aware of the invalid byte sequences .
Thanks
Many thanks to Jörn Hartmann ( joern dot hartmann at gmail dot com ) for finding and reporting the issue .

Last week , the SEC put out a 667 page proposal regarding disclosures for asset backed securities .
What I found exciting was this :
We are proposing to require that most ABS issuers file a computer program that gives effect to the flow of funds , or “ waterfall , ” provisions of the transaction .
We are proposing that the computer program be filed on EDGAR in the form of downloadable source code in Python . … ( page 205 ) Under the proposed requirement , the filed source code , when downloaded and run by an investor , must provide the user with the ability to programmatically input the user ’s own assumptions regarding the future performance and cash flows from the pool assets , including but not limited to assumptions about future interest rates , default rates , prepayment speeds , loss - given - default rates , and any other necessary assumptions … ( page 210 ) The waterfall computer program must also allow the use of the proposed asset - level data file that will be filed at the time of the offering and on a periodic basis thereafter .
( page 211 )
This is absolutely the right way to go particularly when coupled with the other proposal that detailed asset level data be also provided in machine readable ( XML ) format .
For a securitization of residential mortgages for example , the proposal requires disclosure of as many as 137 fields ( page 135 ) on each of the possibly thousands of mortgages in the pool .
Waterfall provisions in modern securitizations and CDOs are horrendously complicated and even the trustees who are supposed to implement these provisions are known to make mistakes .
A year ago , Expect[ed ]
Loss gave an example where approximately $ 4 million was paid to equity when that amount should have been used to pay down senior notes ( hat tip Deus Ex Macchiato ) .
Even when the trustees do not make a mistake , the result is not always what investors had expected .
A few months ago , FT Alphaville reported on two Abacus deals where the documentation allowed the issuer ( Goldman Sachs ) to use its “ sole discretion ” to redeem the notes without regard to seniority .
People realized that this was possible only when Goldman Sachs actually paid off ( at face value ) some junior tranches of these CDOs at the expense of senior tranches .
When provisions become complex beyond a point , computer code is actually the simplest way to describe them and requiring the entire waterfall to be implemented in open source software is a very good idea .
The SEC does not say so , but it would be useful to add that if there is a conflict between the software and textual description , the software should prevail .
Now to the inevitable question —
Why Python ?
The SEC actually asks for comments on whether they should mandate Perl , Java or something else instead .
I use Perl quite extensively , but the idea that Perl is a suitable language for implementing a transparency requirement is laughable .
Perl is a model of powerful but unreadable and cryptic code .
As for Java and C - Sharp , there is little point in having open source code if the interpreter is not also open source .
I do not use Python myself , but it appears to be a good choice for the task at hand .
It is gratifying that the SEC continues the one good thing that Cox initiated when he was Chairman – the use of technology as a key regulatory tool .
The most lucrative option , of course , was to keep the whole prize and stiff the anonymous partner .
But the Missourians on average shared more than 45 percent of the prize , and some other societies were nearly as generous , like the Ghanians living in the city of Accra and the Sanquianga fishermen on the coast of Colombia .
But most of the hunter - gatherers , foragers and subsistence farmers were less inclined to share .
The Hadza nomads in the Serengeti and the Tsimane Indians in the Amazon gave away only a quarter of the prize .
They also reacted differently when given a chance , in variations of the game , to punish another player for hogging the prize .
Selfishness offended the Missourians so much that they would punish the player even though it cost them money .
But the members of traditional societies showed little inclination to punish others at their own expense .
“ There are lots of norms in these small - scale societies for how to treat one another and share food , ” says Dr. Henrich .
“ But these rules do n’t apply in unusual situations when you do n’t know anything about the kinship or status of the other person .
You do n’t feel the same sense of responsibility , and you act more out of self - interest . ”
The researchers found that people in small communities like the Hadza camp ( population about 50 ) were less willing to inflict punishment than people in larger communities like Hamilton ( about 1,800 ) .
That makes practical sense : the more strangers there are , the more need to keep them from exploiting one another .
But what enabled those larger societies to grow in the first place ?
Dr. Henrich and his colleagues identified two distinguishing factors .
People belonging to a modern “ world religion , ” like the Islamic faith of the Orma cattle herders in Kenya or the Christian faith of the Dolgan reindeer herders in Siberia , tended to share more of their prize than did adherents of local religions .
As larger communities became possible after the invention of agriculture , the researchers write in Science , “ intersocietal competition may have favored those religious systems that galvanize pro-social behavior in broader communities , perhaps using both supernatural incentives ( for example , hell ) and recurrent rituals that intensify group solidarity . ”
But a second factor seemed even more important .
In explaining attitudes toward fairness , Dr. Henrich and his colleagues found that the strongest predictor was the community ’s level of “ market integration , ” which was measured by the percentage of the diet that was purchased .
The people who got all or most of their food by hunting , fishing , foraging or growing it themselves were less inclined to share a prize equally .
The ' War Is Making You Poor Act ' is a powerful idea .
It would eliminate the separate funding for the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , and use that money to eliminate federal income taxes for everyone 's first $ 35,000 of income ( or $ 70,000 for couples ) each year .
And , it would help pay down our national debt .

You know those Oceanic 815 plane crash images that ran after Jack 's ( Matthew Fox ) eye closed and the " Lost " logo appeared on our TV screens ?
Some " Lost " fans and TV critics have wondered if they were a last Easter egg from the producers , a clue meant to lead us to conclude that no one survived Oceanic 815 's crash landing — and therefore everything we 've seen over the last six years never really happened .
Well , ABC wants to clear the air :
Those photographs were not part of the " Lost " story at all .
The network added them to soften the transition from the moving ending of the series to the 11 p.m. news and never considered that it would confuse viewers about the actual ending of the show .
" The images shown during the end credits of the ' Lost ' finale , which included shots of Oceanic 815 on a deserted beach , were not part of the final story but were a visual aid to allow the viewer to decompress before heading into the news , " an ABC spokesperson wrote in an e-mail Tuesday .
That means , Losties , that we were not supposed to think that Christian Shepherd ( John Terry ) is a liar .
What Christian told his son , when they were reunited at the church , should serve as guidance for our interpretation of the series ' ending .
So let 's review : Christian told Jack that he was dead and everyone else in the church was too — some had died before Jack , as we already knew , and some died long after .
The sideways flashes then were a step in everyone 's after - lives , a way to reconnect before moving on permanently .
While there still may be unanswered questions related to that religious and spiritual conclusion to the " Lost " story , the photographs were really just a nostalgic , transitional touch added by ABC executives — and not executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse .
Love or hate it , that 's the final answer .

Review : ' Lost ' Loves
' Lost : '
If you come with me , I 'll show you what I mean
An opinion article about animal rights in the Middle East was taken down on 26 May 2016 as a result of a fact - checking investigation .
Key quotes and an anecdote could not be verified .
US government aerospace agencies have achieved the world 's first hypersonic scramjet flight using hydrocarbon fuel .
The test did not go perfectly , but further flights will follow ; organisers said they were " ecstatic " with progress thus far .
Shockwave riding supersonic - combustion - ramjet hypersonic hotness .
The X - 51A " Waverider " craft was dropped from a modified B - 52 bomber test mothership 50,000 feet above Point Mugu sea firing range off the California coast at about 6 pm last night UK time ( 10 am local ) .
Four seconds later a rocket booster taken from a tactical missile fired , accelerating the Waverider to Mach 4.5 before being jettisoned .
The airframe does n't work like a normal aeroplane : it actually surfs on the sonic shockwaves trailing back from its nose , hence its name .
The hypersonic X - 51A ignited , burning a mixture of ethylene and JP - 7 jet fuel , and once well alight switched over to all - jetfuel operation .
Normal turbojets can't operate at hypersonic speeds ; the Waverider is a ramjet , whose intake air is simply scooped in at the front due to its speed rather than being crammed in by compressor blades .
But normal ramjets have to slow that air down to subsonic speed inside themselves so as to avoid blowing out the flame in their combustion chamber .
This limits them to a top speed of perhaps Mach 3.5 .
The Waverider , though , is a scramjet - a supersonic combustion ramjet - which lets the air blow through it supersonically .
It is thought by its designers to be capable of burning for 300 seconds to reach Mach 6 .
The X - 51A did n't fulfil that potential yesterday , however .
Having lit up it burned for around 200 seconds , reaching approximately Mach 5 and climbing to 70,000 feet .
According to a statement issued by Boeing ( whose Phantom Works plant built the Waverider ) :
Something then occurred that caused the vehicle to lose acceleration .
At that point , the X - 51A was terminated as planned .
It 's possible to speculate that the flame in the Waverider 's SJY61 scramjet , built by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne , simply blew out .
Project officials are still happy with the test , and seem confident that they will be able to achieve the designed speed before running out of test craft - there are three more .
" We are ecstatic to have accomplished most of our test points on the X - 51A 's very first hypersonic mission , " said Charlie Brink , X - 51A honcho at the US Air Force Research Laboratory .
" No test is perfect , " he added .
" But anyone will tell you that we learn just as much , if not more , when we encounter a glitch . "
The city of Portland , Ore. , is aiming for 49 total acres of eco-roofs in the city by 2013 ( the city ’s paying up to $ 5 per square foot to any home or business that builds one ) .
But what about green roofs outside the urban environment ?
What ’s the appeal there ?
Blending more with the natural surroundings ?
Sure , green roofs are beautiful , keep your abode cooler in the summer , warmer in the winter , and tastier for wildlife passers - by .
But , we wonder , what stories and mysteries lie beneath the non-urban eco-roofs …

If the Congressional election were held today , 42 percent of voters would back the Republican candidate in their district , while 40 percent would support the Democrat , according to the latest Fox News poll .
Most Republicans ( 86 percent ) back their party 's candidate and most Democrats ( 80 percent ) back theirs , and independents are divided .
By 37-31 percent independent voters are somewhat more likely to back the Republican candidate , while 20 percent are undecided .
A similar split is seen when the question is about voting in the 2012 presidential election : 41 percent would back Barack Obama , and 41 percent the Republican Party 's candidate .
Click here to see the poll .
In one hypothetical three - way race with New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg as a third - party candidate , President Obama ( 42 percent ) has a clear advantage over both the unnamed Republican candidate ( 29 percent ) and Bloomberg ( 10 percent ) .
Where do independents go ?
In the two - way race , independents are more likely to back the Republican nominee ( 38 percent ) over Obama ( 28 percent ) .
In the three - way vote , Obama keeps almost all of his independent support ( 25 percent ) , while the Republican candidate ( 18 percent ) loses a significant amount of support to Bloomberg ( 19 percent ) .
Either way , for many independents it 's too soon to say how they will vote in 2012 .
Overall , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee ( 42 percent favorable ) has the highest favorable rating of the potential 2012 Republican candidates in the poll .
He is followed closely by former Mass .
Gov. Mitt Romney ( 40 percent favorable ) and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ( 37 percent favorable ) .
About a third of voters have a positive view of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( 32 percent favorable ) .
Among only Republicans , Palin ( 65 percent favorable ) and Huckabee ( 64 percent favorable ) lead the field — topping Romney ( 59 percent favorable ) and Gingrich ( 51 percent ) .
By comparison , President Obama has a 53 percent favorable rating overall , and a 91 percent favorable among Democrats .
Twenty - eight percent of voters have a positive view of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , as do 49 percent of Democrats .
Former First Lady Laura
Bush receives a 68 percent favorable rating , which is the highest positive rating of the individuals tested on the poll .
The national telephone poll was conducted for Fox News by Opinion Dynamics Corp. among 900 registered voters from May 4 to May 5 .
For the total sample , the poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Interest in 2010 Election
Republicans are more interested in the November elections than Democrats .
About two - thirds ( 68 percent ) of Republicans are either " extremely " or " very " interested compared to just under half ( 49 percent ) of Democrats .
That said , interest by Republicans has declined : 34 percent of Republicans are now " extremely " interested in the election , down from a high of 42 percent two weeks ago .
Men ( 62 percent ) are somewhat more interested than women ( 53 percent ) , and voters ages 65 and over ( 68 percent ) are much more likely to be interested than young voters ( 36 percent ) .
Congressional Job Ratings
Democrats in Congress continue to garner better ratings than Republicans .
Some 37 percent of voters approve of the job Democrats in Congress are doing , little changed from 36 percent about six months ago .
For Congressional Republicans , 31 percent approve , up slightly from 29 percent .
Fully 70 percent of Democrats approve of the job their representatives are doing on Capitol Hill , compared to 52 percent of Republicans who approve of theirs .
About twice as many Republicans ( 40 percent ) disapprove of the job their party is doing in Congress as Democrats disapprove of their party ( 19 percent ) .
A majority of independents disapproves of Democrats ( 60 percent ) and Republicans in Congress ( 66 percent ) .

DETROIT --
His teammates were fast to fall on the sword for Jimmy Howard on Sunday , but the rookie goaltender , in no uncertain terms , said he must raise his game .
Howard was not happy with his performance in the 4 - 2 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes in Game 3 at Joe Louis Arena .
" I would say ( I ) allowed three untimely goals -- first minute ( of the game ) , last minute of the second period and then that fourth one when we sort of had the momentum in the third period , " Howard said .
" I just have to refocus and get out there and have a good practice ( Monday ) .
Forget about it and improve my performance ( Tuesday in Game 4 ) . "
That will be the biggest test of Howard 's young career .
One of Chris Osgood 's strengths was his ability to bounce back from a bad night , and Howard continues to lean on the veteran .
" Chris gave me a couple words of wisdom , '' Howard said .
" I 'm grateful for that .
Just forget about it .
Go home and do n't think about hockey at all . ''
Coach Mike Babcock said he is not considering a goalie change .
" Never thought about it at all , '' Babcock said .
Howard did n't have the angle covered on Radim Vrbata 's goal at 11:38 of the third period , which sapped Detroit 's momentum after Johan Franzen had cut the Coyotes ' lead to 3 - 2 at 9:59 .
But Howard 's teammates said they let him down on the other goals , with turnovers and defensive lapses .
" We let him out to dry on a couple of occasions , where you want to do a better job helping him out , clearing guys out of there or getting rebounds out of there , '' Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" They were shooting the puck a lot more , going to the net a little bit harder . ''
Howard , who is 1 - 2 with a 3.71 goals - against average and .889 save percentage , knows he must step up for his team to come back in the series .
" The pace out there is definitely quicker from the regular season , '' Howard said .
" I have to keep battling .
I have to find a way to respond . ''
Bertuzzi puzzled by call
The Red Wings thought they had cut Phoenix 's lead to 4 - 3 with 3:02 to play in the third period when Todd Bertuzzi jammed the puck into the net while goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov had it smothered on the ice with his glove .
But referee Bill McCreary waved it off .
" He just said you can't push the goaltender , but the puck was sitting there loose , '' Bertuzzi said .
" He 's on a tough angle , being on the goal line , ca n't see that it 's loose .
So even though it was in , and then the whistle went , he said you can't have contact with the goaltender 's feet , which is somewhat news to me . ''
Babcock said the call had no bearing on the outcome of the game .
Doan out longer ?
Coyotes coach Dave Tippett revealed no details on Shane Doan 's injury or his status for Game 4 .
Doan left two minutes into the second period after tripping over Howard and crashing his right shoulder into the boards .
" I did n't even know it was him , '' Howard said .
" I was just covering because I could see a Phoenix guy coming out of the corner of my eye . ''
Said Phoenix defenseman Ed Jovanovski : " It 's tough losing a guy playing 20 minutes as a forward .
It gave opportunities to step up and everyone responded well to it . ''
Odds & ends
Lidstrom , on what his team needs to do differently : " They 're playing real well in the neutral zone .
Sometimes you have to lay the puck in .
It 's difficult to stick - handle your way through two or three guys .
Lay it in and get a good forecheck on them . '' ... Lidstrom , on his team 's power play , which went 1 for 5 : " Their forwards are in good positions , pushing us to the outside .
They 're in shooting lanes .
When we get stationary , it works to their advantage .
On a couple of occasions we were standing still instead of having motion .'' ...
Detroit 's Tomas Holmstrom played in his 155th playoff game , moving him past Gordie Howe into seventh place on the franchise 's career list .
Holmstrom trails Lidstrom ( 238 ) , Kris Draper ( 203 ) , Steve Yzerman ( 196 ) , Kirk Maltby ( 169 ) , Darren McCarty ( 167 ) and Sergei Fedorov ( 162 ) .
... Former Red Wings center Robert Lang returned to the lineup for Phoenix , replacing the injured Vernon Fiddler , but played only 6:58 .
Lang had missed the final 17 games of the season and the first two games of this series with a lower - body injury .
[ Haskell ] [ ANNOUNCE ] SyntaxMacros-0.1
We are pleased to announce the first release of SyntaxMacros [ 1 ] .
SyntaxMacros is an EDSL for constructing compilers out of a collection of pre-compiled , statically type - checked , possibly mutually dependent ``language - definition fragments ' ' .
This way of constructing a compiler brings syntax macros for free .
This approach is based on a collection of techniques we have previously developed : - transformation of typed abstract syntax trees [ 2 ] makes it possible to construct parsers on the fly in a type - safe way - parser combinators [ 3 ] make it possible to construct parsers dynamically - first - class attribute grammars [ 4 ] make it possible to define semantics in a compositional way More information can be found at : http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/Center/SyntaxMacrosForFree

Behold a star from the second generation of generation of stars after the Big Bang , something scientists have been seeking for a while .
Its unique make - up may prove that our galaxy developed by cannibalizing dwarf galaxies .
In the dwarf galaxy Sculptor , this star is made out of the same material as the oldest stars in the Milky Way .
The Harvard Center for Astrophysics found this beauty , and a press release explains :
" This star likely is almost as old as the universe itself , " said astronomer Anna Frebel of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , lead author of the Nature paper reporting the finding .
Dwarf galaxies are small galaxies with just a few billion stars , compared to hundreds of billions in the Milky Way .
In the " bottom - up model " of galaxy formation , large galaxies attained their size over billions of years by absorbing their smaller neighbors .
" If you watched a time - lapse movie of our galaxy , you would see a swarm of dwarf galaxies buzzing around it like bees around a beehive , " explained Frebel .
" Over time , those galaxies smashed together and mingled their stars to make one large galaxy - the Milky Way . "
If dwarf galaxies are indeed the building blocks of larger galaxies , then the same kinds of stars should be found in both kinds of galaxies , especially in the case of old , " metal - poor " stars .
To astronomers , " metals " are chemical elements heavier than hydrogen or helium .
Because they are products of stellar evolution , metals were rare in the early Universe , and so old stars tend to be metal - poor .
Old stars in the Milky Way 's halo can be extremely metal - poor , with metal abundances 100,000 times poorer than in the Sun , which is a typical younger , metal - rich star .
Surveys over the past decade have failed to turn up any such extremely metal - poor stars in dwarf galaxies , however .
" The Milky Way seemed to have stars that were much more primitive than any of the stars in any of the dwarf galaxies , " says co-author Josh Simon of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution .
" If dwarf galaxies were the original components of the Milky Way , then it's hard to understand why they would n't have similar stars . "
The team suspected that the methods used to find metal - poor stars in dwarf galaxies were biased in a way that caused the surveys to miss the most metal - poor stars .
Team member Evan Kirby , a Caltech astronomer , developed a method to estimate the metal abundances of large numbers of stars at a time , making it possible to efficiently search for the most metal - poor stars in dwarf galaxies .
" This was harder than finding a needle in a haystack .
We needed to find a needle in a stack of needles , " said Kirby .
" We sorted through hundreds of candidates to find our target . "
Among stars he found in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy was one faint , 18th - magnitude speck designated S1020549 .
Spectroscopic measurements of the star 's light with Carnegie 's Magellan - Clay telescope in Las Campanas , Chile , determined it to have a metal abundance 6,000 times lower than that of the Sun ; this is five times lower than any other star found so far in a dwarf galaxy .
The researchers measured S1020549 's total metal abundance from elements such as magnesium , calcium , titanium , and iron .
The overall abundance pattern resembles those of old Milky Way stars , lending the first observational support to the idea that these galactic stars originally formed in dwarf galaxies .
But some bioethicists say the whole idea of genetic testing outside a medical setting is troubling .
“ It ’s a bad precedent to set up mass testing without some sort of counseling support , ” said Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania .
“ I ’d rather people get their results in a medical setting , where they can ask questions about the error rate or the chances of passing it on to their children , and not just see it posted on some Web site . ”
Dr. Schlissel said that he understood the concern about counseling but that he believed it applied mostly to testing for genetic diseases , not necessarily the relatively innocuous gene variants that Berkeley is looking for .
Berkeley , like many colleges , has for several years tried to create a common intellectual experience for new students by assigning a summer reading book .
Last year , freshmen and transfer students in its College of Letters and Sciences received “ The Omnivore ’s Dilemma , ” By Michael Pollan .
But for the class of 2014 , the program will be especially ambitious .
After the genetic testing , the university will offer a campuswide lecture by Mr. Rine about the three genetic markers , along with other lectures and panels with philosophers , ethicists , biologists and statisticians exploring the benefits and risks of personal genomics .
There will also be a contest in which students who submit creative entries on the theme will have a chance to win further genetic testing from 23andMe , a private company that offers DNA profiling .
Berkeley has not yet chosen a company to analyze the DNA samples , but Dr. Schlissel said it was unlikely to be 23andMe.
Estimates are $ 35,000 to $ 40,000 per 1,000 samples .
While the Berkeley professors see the gene testing as relatively harmless , others say that all genetic knowledge carries risks .
“ They may think these are noncontroversial genes , but there ’s nothing noncontroversial about alcohol on campus , ” said George Annas , a bioethicist at the Boston University School of Public Health .
“ What if someone tests negative , and they do n’t have the marker , so they think that means they can drink more ?
Like all genetic information , it ’s potentially harmful . ”
The Federal Government has announced it will tighten its regulation of foreign investment in Australian property , in an effort to stem rising property prices .
People on temporary resident visas will now have to be screened and must be approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board to buy property .
They will then have to sell it on departure .
The move comes after Labor 's decision to relax the same rules last year .
Assistant Treasurer Nick Sherry says they are reintroducing old restrictions and bringing in tougher penalties .
But the Federal Opposition says the Government has been exposed for another policy blunder .
Shadow treasurer Joe Hockey says the Government 's original loosening of the rules had the effect of pushing up prices and putting pressure on the market .
" Kevin Rudd promised the Australian people he would make it easier to buy houses , not harder , " he said .
" When he changed the foreign investment rules he made it harder for Australians and now we 've seen yet another Rudd Government backflip .
" It is certainly the case that they do not focus on outcomes when they develop a policy ... they focus on politics .
" And this is another example of the Prime Minister lacking the courage to go out and announce that he got it wrong on a policy . "
Mr Hockey says the changes are a return to Howard Government policy and a significant policy failure .

He allegedly tried to tamper with databases that track possible terrorists
A U.S. Transport Security Administration analyst has been indicted with tampering with databases used by the TSA to identify possible terrorists who may be trying to fly in the U.S .
Douglas James Duchak , 46 , was indicted by a grand jury Wednesday with two counts of damaging protected computers .
According to a federal indictment , Duchak tried to compromise computers at the TSA 's Colorado Springs Operations Center ( CSOC ) on Oct. 22 , 2009 , seven days after he'd being given two weeks notice that he was being dismissed .
He was also charged with tampering with a TSA server that contained data from the U.S. Marshal 's Service Warrant Information Network .
He " knowingly transmitted code into the CSOC server that contained the Terrorist Screening Database , and thereby attempted intentionally to cause damage to the CSOC computer and database , " prosecutors said Wednesday in a press release .
Duchak , who had been with the TSA for about five years at the time , was responsible for keeping TSA servers up - to - date with information received from the terrorist screening database and the United States Marshal 's Service Warrant Information Network .
If convicted , Duchak faces 10 years in prison .
He was expected to make his initial appearance in federal court in Denver Wednesday .
The New York Times has a blockbuster article on the case of a Wisconsin priest who admitted molesting over 200 deaf boys .
The guy was a monster .
But , he had protectors in high places at the Vatican .
And , one of his protectors is now the Pope :
Top Vatican officials — including the future Pope Benedict XVI — did not defrock a priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys , even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them that failure to act on the matter could embarrass the church , according to church files newly unearthed as part of a lawsuit .
The Wisconsin case involved an American priest , the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy , who worked at a renowned school for deaf children from 1950 to 1974 .
But it is only one of thousands of cases forwarded over decades by bishops to the Vatican office called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , led from 1981 to 2005 by Cardinal Ratzinger .
It is still the office that decides whether accused priests should be given full canonical trials and defrocked .
In 1996 , Cardinal Ratzinger failed to respond to two letters about the case from Rembert G. Weakland , Milwaukee ’s archbishop at the time .
After eight months , the second in command at the doctrinal office , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , now the Vatican ’s secretary of state , instructed the Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial that could lead to Father Murphy ’s dismissal .
But Cardinal Bertone halted the process after Father Murphy personally wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger protesting that he should not be put on trial because he had already repented and was in poor health and that the case was beyond the church ’s own statute of limitations .
The Catholic hiearchy has enabled and protected child rapists for decades .
Over the past few months , we ’ve seen the scandal get closer and closer to the Pope , mostly because of what ’s happening in his native Germany .
But , this article shows that Benedict / Ratzinger was directly involved in the cover up here in the U.S .
This case is so disturbing and shocking .
It ’s hard to grasp how Benedict has any credibility or moral authority .
And , the same holds for the U.S. Conference of Bishops .
They put their institutional interests ahead of human decency — and the law .
NOTE FROM JOHN : Kind of goes to show you why we still need newspapers , and especially the New York Times .
Their reporter , Laurie Goodstein , deserves a medal for this story .
Following news that a KNBC staffer and her husband were the $ 266 million winners of the Mega Millions , a new shocker this morning : * another * NBC newsroom staff has won the lottery .
KNTV staffers Brent Cannon , Laura - Garcia Cannon , Mike Inouye , Rob Mayeda and 32 others pooled their money to buy 32 $ 1 tickets .
Several tickets in the March 4 drawing matched a few numbers , creating a total payoff of $ 14 .
" We heard about the KNBC winner and thought ' well , what are the chances that another NBC employee could ever win the lottery ? ' " said anchor Brent Cannon .
" But then we looked at he ticket and sure enough , we had $ 14 . "
Each NBC Bay Area employee who participated will get 43 cents .
There was much discussion in the newsroom whether employees would " keep working " given their winnings .
Business reporter Scott McGrew declined to contribute money to the lottery pool , explaining to his co-workers that the statistical liklihood of winning the lottery was " like getting hit by lightning and then getting into a car crash on the way to the hospital , which then burns down . "
That and he did n't have a dollar at the time .
Proven wrong , McGrew is now considering legal action , declaring he " clearly MEANT to participate in the lottery pool " and thus should be party to the winnings .
Clearly , the sudden windfall has divided the once harmonious newsroom into the " haves " and the " have nots . "
Newswriter Kellie Onaga is considering using her Lottery winnings to buy part of a Vitamin Water .
She says the biggest problem is choosing between the risque " triple XXX " flavor and the " revive " flavor , which she does n't particularly like , but gives her an added boost on the early shift .
Newscast director Ken Portwood would not discuss his plans , citing privacy needs .
Crew chief Jennifer Garcia says she just likes hearing the coins jingle .
No family benefitted more than the Cannons , however , as the anchor team of Brent and Laura are married .
Each contributed a dollar , meaning together they will collect 86 cents .
Image caption Teams have salvaged the wreckage of the Cheonan from the sea bed
It might seem odd that it has taken a six - week - long investigation to produce proof of something as catastrophic as a torpedo strike on a warship .
When it finally came , it was in dramatic form .
A few bits of rusty scrap metal , unveiled in front of the assembled reporters at a press conference marking the publication of the investigation report .
Ever since the South Korean warship , the Cheonan , was split in half by an explosion and began sinking in the darkness with the loss of 46 lives , North Korea has been the prime suspect .
But why has it been so difficult to prove ?
Stealth is the name of the game in submarine warfare .
It is entirely plausible that a ship , on routine patrol in its own shallow waters , would not pick up any signs of an enemy sub , or even a torpedo fired from one , on its sonar system .
One thing seems to be beyond reasonable doubt , the Cheonan was sunk by North Korea , and South Korea has the evidence to prove it
So the fact that North Korea was not caught in the act has meant that the investigation team has had to embark on a painstaking and slow process , attempting to piece together what happened by examining the shattered wreck of the ship , salvaged in two pieces from the sea bed .
It was announced early on that the Cheonan had been hit by an external " non-contact " explosion .
That ruled out a simple collision with a rock , or an internal malfunction of the ship 's own weapons systems .
Whatever sank it had exploded underwater , close to the hull of the ship but not in contact with it .
That is exactly the way that many torpedoes are designed to work , because exploding a few feet away from the ship causes a far more devastating blow than a direct hit .
Sea search
The trouble for the investigation team was that many sea mines are designed to explode in exactly the same way .
Could the Cheonan have been sunk as the result of an accidental collision with an unexploded mine left over from the Korean War perhaps ?
Image caption The Cheonan was lifted from the sea bed in April
It was crucial to find direct evidence of the type of weapon involved .
To that end the South Korean navy even designed its own special nets and they have been dragging them , up to eight times a day , across the seabed close to the site of the sinking .
Just five days ago , they found what they were looking for - the propellers , a propulsion motor and a steering section of a torpedo , a perfect match for a model known to be manufactured and exported by North Korea .
The markings , in Korean script , are said to be consistent with those on a previously obtained model .
It was these fragments that were put on display at the news conference .
They were clear evidence that the weapon used with such devastating effect was a 1.7 ton torpedo with a net explosive weight of 250kg , and apparent proof of North Korea 's involvement .
There is other evidence of course .
The investigation report says that a number of small submarines , escorted by a support ship , left a North Korean naval base in the Yellow Sea a few days prior to the attack and returned a few days after it took place .
The investigation itself was given an added air of impartiality by the presence of 24 foreign experts from America , Australia , Britain and Sweden .
They are all said to support the conclusions reached .
To what end ?
The only big question that remains is why ?
Using a submarine to launch an unprovoked attack on another country 's warship is such an extraordinary act of aggression with such serious potential consequences .
And despite the difficulties in obtaining proof after the event as outlined above , such an action certainly runs a substantial risk of detection .
Why would North Korea have taken such a calculated risk , and for what purpose ?
Some observers have suggested that it may have been a simple act of retaliation .
The Cheonan sank close to the disputed sea boundary between North and South Korean territorial waters , along which the two navies have clashed a number of times in the past decade .
The most recent incident , last November , left a North Korean ship in flames , with reported casualties amongst the crew .
But torpedoing a warship would be a very dramatic response indeed .
Another theory suggests that the incident is a worrying indication of the tensions within the North Korean power structure .
Perhaps the order was given by the ageing and ailing North Korean leader to keep the military on side .
Or perhaps the military were acting alone .
The speculation will continue , as will the debate about the appropriate response .
But for now , one thing seems to be beyond reasonable doubt , the Cheonan was sunk by North Korea , and South Korea has the evidence to prove it .
From MSNBC
HOUSTON – Police released descriptions of two men involved in an attempted carjacking in which a 3 - year - old girl was shot to death , KPRC Local 2 reported Monday .

S.C. Man Shoots 8 - Year - Old To Death
Picture this .
You ’re getting ready to go to your senior
, and you ’re on cloud nine because you know you ’ve picked the perfect dress .
Then you arrive at the dance only to discover that someone else is wearing the same outfit you are .
“ It ruins the night , ” said Alexandra Wenger , 18 , a senior at Cedar Cliff High School .
Indeed , the idea haunted Wenger so much that she decided to take matters into her own hands .
The result ?
.
The new website , which Wenger did as her school senior project , attempts to prevent such a fashion mishap by having students post pictures of their dresses online .
“ My mom and I have gone dress shopping every year , ” she said .
“ And in the dressing room I always turn and say ‘ I hope no one else has this dress too . ’
Finally last year I decided to do something about it . ”
The basic concept is simple .
Girls who create an account on the site ( registration is free ) get access to a “ closet , ” where they can upload photos of their new dress and then enter the name of the prom or other event they plan to wear said gown at .
The idea is that girls heading to the same event will go to the site and by looking at the other girls ’ “ closets , ” manage to avoid purchasing the same or a similar dress .
The site also lets users share their worst “ oh no ” prom moments , post group pictures of their friends , follow links to local stores ( users can recommend stores as well ) , and discover places to buy accessories like shoes and purses .
Wenger worked with designer firms M Street Associates in Strasburg and 206 Design in Mechanicsburg to help put the site together , which included figuring out the logo , deciding what colors to use , and , of course , what exactly the site ’s content should include .
“ There was definitely a lot going into the thought process and planning , ” she said .
Ultimately , she hopes the site will “ explode and ... every girl in the nation [ will ] use and enjoy it . ”
While registration is free , Wenger hopes the site will bring in revenue from advertising — the site just became part of Zappos.com ’s Associates ad program — with the money not only going toward the site ’s maintenance , but also helping to pay her college tuition .
Wenger will be attending Penn State in the fall , where she ’s leaning toward a major in marketing and business .
The always - tense relations between North Korea and South Korea hit a low this week .
The South Koreans and their president , Lee Myung - bak , have increasingly come to the conclusion that the sinking of one of their warships in March , which killed 46 sailors , was caused by a North Korean torpedo .
Lee has promised to reduce trade ties between the countries while North Korea has threatened that any military retaliation will lead to “ all - out war . ”
Making the situation more problematic , the United States and other countries still hope to dismantle North Korea ’s nuclear arsenal .
MIT News asked Jim Walsh , a research associate with the Security Studies Program , to comment on the situation .
An expert on nuclear proliferation , Walsh has in the past conducted talks with officials in North Korea about security matters and closely follows events in the region .
Q. Why has the situation between North Korea and South Korea deteriorated so rapidly ?
A . There are two answers .
The more narrow answer regards the sinking of the South Korean naval ship in late March .
There was some feeling at the time this was caused by an old mine left over from World War Two .
It seemed unlikely the North Koreans would have attacked this ship , and they denied attacking it .
But after a multinational investigation , there was a report issued this month concluding the ship was sunk by a torpedo .
So that ’s an act of aggression , an affirmative act of war .
And naturally the South Korean government felt compelled to respond , and the United States , its long - time ally , felt compelled to support South Korea .
Now you might ask why North Korea did this in the first place .
And here we ’re getting to the famously large field of speculation about North Korean motives .
There are several possibilities .
It may have been an individual decision made by an individual commander of a submarine .
Or it may have been the military acting independently .
Or perhaps it was something to do , somehow , with internal problems in North Korea regarding their succession process .
The bottom line is that North Korea is opaque enough and relations are complex enough that it ’s very hard to know for sure why they would want to do this .
It ’s usually good to bet on the idea that there ’s something internal that ’s driving the North Koreans .
Q. President Lee Myung - bak of South Korea seems to have a very different attitude toward North Korea than the earlier president Kim Dae - Jung , who helped initiate the “ sunshine policy ” of more open relations .
How has this change in South Korea affected the countries ’ relationship ?
A. Lee came to power as someone running against the sunshine policy , so yet another theory is that the North Koreans are doing this to embarrass Lee and to weaken him politically .
But it ’s not clear that ’s going to be the result here .
Lee was the first president to come to power in some years saying his goal was not to increase exchange with the North Koreans , but a lot of this was rhetorical , because he left a lot of policies in place .
And if you look at this most recent statement this week about the incident , he said they would cut back all the trade and exchange they could , except the aid to the women and infants .
But that would n’t apply to the Kaesong development park [ an industrial zone in North Korea where South Korean firms have plants ] , and that ’s about half the trade between the two countries .
So Lee came in with a different style and strategy toward the North Koreans , but it has not been night and day .
Q . What do you think is going to happen , and what would you like to see happen ?
A . What one hopes would happen is that the South makes clear its anger at the sinking of the ship , but that we resume the process of dealing with the ongoing issues on the Korean Peninsula .
The ship sinking was awful , it ’s a provocative act , but we need to keep our eye on the ball here , and in this case the ball is trying to denuclearize North Korea and bring some stability to the peninsula .
I ’m hoping that each side can still address the ongoing , deeply dangerous security issues that will not improve unless there ’s some sort of dialogue with the North .
There ’s no getting around it :
If we want North Korea to get rid of its nuclear arsenal , to reduce the prospects of war , we ’re going to have to talk to the North Koreans — even if it ’s unpleasant to do so .
Another scenario is that the leaders lose control of this tit - for - tat and it spins off in a direction no one wants to go .
And sometimes the North Koreans provoke a crisis on the eve of a positive development — that is a negotiating style they have .
But it ’s hard to see how this crisis will open a door for progress in the relationship at the moment .
Right now a positive move probably means resumption of talks on some topic , like a cultural issue or prisoner swap .
I think the most likely scenario is that we muddle along and everything gets pushed off six months .
Then the question is :
Who benefits from the passage of time ?
Some argue it benefits the North Koreans because they ’ll hold onto their nuclear arms longer , and that becomes a fact on the ground everyone accepts .
But you could also argue that because North Korea has deep economic problems , deep succession problems , time is not on their side .
In any case , the most likely outcome is that we ’ll be in a period of uncomfortable stasis .
A new CU - Boulder study shows that ratios of nitrogen and carbon in soils , rivers and oceans are closely linked , a finding with potential implications for mitigating pollution and health problems .
Credit : Casey A. Cass , University of Colorado
A new study exploring the growing worldwide problem of nitrogen pollution from soils to the sea shows that global ratios of nitrogen and carbon in the environment are inexorably linked , a finding that may lead to new strategies to help mitigate regional problems ranging from contaminated waterways to human health .
The University of Colorado at Boulder study found the ratio between nitrates -- a naturally occurring form of nitrogen found in soils , streams , lakes and oceans -- and organic carbon is closely governed by ongoing microbial processes that occur in virtually all ecosystems .
The team combed exhaustive databases containing millions of sample points from tropical , temperate , boreal and polar sites , including well - known , nitrogen - polluted areas like Chesapeake Bay , the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico .
" We have developed a new framework to explain how and why carbon and nitrogen appear to be so tightly linked , " said CU - Boulder doctoral student Philip Taylor , lead author on the new study .
" The findings are helping us to explain why nitrate can become so high in some water bodies but remain low in others . "
A paper by Taylor and CU - Boulder ecology and evolutionary biology Professor Alan Townsend is being published in the April 22 issue of Nature .
The study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation .
Both Taylor and Townsend also are affiliated with CU - Boulder 's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research .
While the vast majority of nitrogen gas is abundant in the atmosphere , it is nonreactive and unavailable to most life , said Townsend .
But in 1909 a process was developed to transform the nonreactive gas into ammonia , the active ingredient of synthetic fertilizer .
Humans now manufacture more than 400 billion pounds of fertilizer each year -- much of which migrates from croplands into the atmosphere , waterways and oceans -- creating a suite of environmental problems ranging from coastal " dead zones " and toxic algal blooms to ozone pollution and human health issues .
Taylor said the new study indicates that in virtually every area of Earth 's environment where there is substantially more dissolved organic carbon than nitrates , the nitrogen is sucked up by microbial communities .
" But most of these nitrates are probably not locked away forever , " said Taylor .
" Instead , they are passed on to other ecosystems , essentially just moving pollution problems elsewhere in the environment . "
The consistent relationship between nitrogen and carbon detected in the study was surprising , said Taylor , a doctoral student in CU - Boulder 's ecology and evolutionary biology department .
" The microbial communities that are controlling this link are found across the globe , whether in pristine environments or in areas of heavy pollution . "
Taylor said the CU - Boulder team looked at available data from virtually every ecosystem type , ranging from high - altitude tundra and tropical forests to riparian areas and estuaries .
" We looked at a large number of data sets , from sites as small as an office table to as large as entire oceans , " said Taylor .
" We saw the same correlation between nitrogen and carbon wherever we looked . "
" The bottom line is that if there is sufficient organic carbon present , it keeps the nitrates at a low level , " said Townsend .
" By using available data , we can now make more accurate evaluations of when and where nitrate pollution may pop up . "
In the February 2010 issue of Scientific American , Townsend and co-author Robert Howarth of Cornell University wrote that " a single new atom of reactive nitrogen can bounce its way around these widespread environments , like a felon on a crime spree . "
Nitrogen pollution is increasing globally in part because of fertilizer - intensive activities like biofuel synthesis and meat production that relies on the growth and cultivation of grains used to feed animals .
In addition , the burning of fossil fuels -- which releases nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide -- causes ground - level ozone pollution .
Some scientists have ranked nitrogen pollution as one of the top threats to global biodiversity , Townsend said .
High nitrate concentrations in drinking water also is a potential hazard to human health and may cause several types of cancer and elevate risks for Alzheimer 's disease and diabetes , while atmospheric nitrogen pollution can elevate cardiopulmonary ailments , said Townsend .
In addition , studies also have shown elevated nitrogen concentrations may increase the risks of several other human and wildlife diseases .
Taylor said the new study showed that " downscaling " from a global analysis of the carbon - nitrogen link to system - specific scenarios indicates the relationship between the elements typically becomes even stronger .
" Analyzing the problem using these methods at smaller scales could allow ecosystem management teams to better predict and influence the fate of nitrates in the environment , " Taylor said .

" Honest adults with licensed guns , go away .
Lawbreakers looking for sitting ducks , step right in . "
Actually , the sign at the entrance to the Phoenix , Arizona restaurant simply read , " No Firearms . "
I returned to my car and left .
A wave of constipated thinking has afflicted some Arizonans after legislators passed a law allowing licensed concealed handguns to be carried into businesses that serve alcohol as long as the licensees consume none .
Proprietors have the option to post the " No Firearms " sign , and many have done so .
Arizona currently honors 147,121 CCW ( concealed carry weapon ) permits .
More than 31,000 permit - holders are women , 157 of whom are aged 80 years or older -- spicy gals all .
The state has suspended or revoked 1.9 percent of all permits , a statistic which the gun control crowd may take to imply that nearly 2800 gun nuts blasted away and had their permits yanked .
This leap of logic would be dead wrong .
How many permit - holders use guns to commit crimes ?
The Violence Policy Center found that in the United States between May 2007 and April 2009 , fifty - six deaths resulted from gun crimes committed by CCW permit - holders .
Whether this anti-gun organization derived its number objectively or creatively , we accept the claim .
Using the VPC data , U.S. Department of Justice statistics on nationwide gun murders , and Arizona 's 290 firearms homicides spread over a population of 6.5 million , your chances of being gunned down by a CCW permit - holder in that state are a bit more than one in ten million .
How does dying at gunpoint stack up against other ways to go ?
According to the U.S. Office of Hazardous Materials Safety [ i ] , from 1999 to 2003 , the likelihood of being killed by lightning was one in 6,061,000 , or 28 percent greater than the likelihood of being cut down by a licensed hand - gunner .
During the same timeframe , people in America had a one - in - 18,700 chance of death by poisoning .
The restaurant that does n't nail you by taking your gun from your hand when you need it has a 400 - times - better shot at killing you with over - the - hill thousand - island dressing .
The benefits of having decent citizens carry concealed guns outweigh the one - in - ten - million chance that one of those citizens will turn not - so - decent and shoot you .
Law - abiding Americans brandish handguns in 2.5 million defensive incidents a year -- once every 12 ½ seconds .
In most cases , a gun 's mere appearance settles a brewing conflict .
The National Center for Policy Analysis found that major crime plunges when law - abiding citizens carry concealed handguns [ ii ] .
The same NCPA study , covering every American county , found that murders dropped by 8.5 percent , while rapes and serious assaults fell up to 7 percent in states with licensed concealed carry .
Furthermore , if states without licensed concealed carry would institute it , then 1570 murders , 4180 rapes , and over 60,000 aggravated assaults would not happen each year .
The National Academy of Sciences reviewed hundreds of studies and found not " a single gun regulation that reduced violent crime or murder . "
A criminal told John Stossel , then with ABC , that he was n't " worried about the government saying [ he ] can't carry a gun " because he 's " gonna carry a gun anyway . "
A Washington , D.C. - area assault victim asked , " If someone gets into your house , which would you rather have , a handgun or a telephone ?
You can call the police if you want , and they 'll get there , and they 'll take a picture of your dead body . "
If we replace " house " with " restaurant " in that last quote , we may ask if some restaurateurs see themselves as noble for creating gun-free zones from which defenseless patrons can depart for the beyond .
Can just anyone be licensed to carry a gun ?
Arizona has strict requirements for obtaining a concealed carry permit .
Applicants must be twenty - one or older , state residents or American citizens , and not under felony indictment or conviction .
To obtain a permit , one can never have been legally denied gun possession , must not suffer mental illness or have been judged mentally incompetent , and cannot have been committed to a mental institution .
Prospective permit - holders must pass firearms safety training , which addresses marksmanship and judicious shooting , the legal issues and mental conditioning for using deadly force , and techniques for weapons care , maintenance , handling , and storage .
Considering the statistics presented here plus the state 's stringent requirements for concealed handgun permit - holders , why would any Arizona restaurant operator choose to disarm honest patrons and announce to armed lawbreakers the presence of easy prey on premises ?
Multiple queries to the parent company of the restaurant in this article 's opening story have gone unanswered .
Perhaps restauranteurs ' " logic " is based on California Senator Diane Feinstein 's claim that " Banning guns addresses a fundamental right of all Americans to feel safe . "
To people willing to wrap themselves in illusion , Feinstein 's silliness feels good .
A sober , law - abiding adult at a table a few feet away with a gun that you 'd never know she had unless she used it to stop a killer from killing you ?
That feels bad .
To anti-gunners who embrace false security , what 's important is how it feels , not what 's real .
By not having concealed weapons in the same building with their food , restaurant patrons can savor " the sign " just before the killer who laughed at the sign swings into action .
Diners would surely feel awful witnessing a gal with a gun stop a guy with a gun who was only crying for attention .
Licensed hand - gunners steer clear of establishments that do n't welcome them and patronize the ones that do welcome them .
And if Mr. Dirtbag threatens deadly force , a licensed hand - gunner will engage Messrs .
Smith and Wesson to dispatch Mr. Remington , sporting his shiny metal jacket .
Mr. Remington will rush out to greet Mr. Dirtbag .
The meeting will be brief .

“ … does n’t mean that you should n’t visit : ”
San Diego tourism leaders and hoteliers fear they could lose a sizable chunk of business this summer from valued “ Zonies ” who are so angered by elected leaders ’ recent censure of Arizona for its illegal - immigration law that they ’re mounting an informal boycott of their own .
The San Diego Convention & Visitors Bureau and several hotels report receiving e-mails and letters from Arizona visitors saying they intend to change their plans to travel here in light of local outcry over their home state ’s anti-illegal - immigration stance .
Tourism officials are striking back .
In an open letter , they urge Arizona residents to overlook local politics and come to San Diego just as they always have for its mild climate , beaches and attractions .
Tom Brown said that his 59 - year - old pal believes he has “ one big job left in him ” .
And IMF insiders are thought to consider the former Prime Minister the ideal candidate to take over when France ’s Dominique Strauss - Kahn ’s term ends in 2012 .
Tom Brown said last night : “ Gordon ’s record would make him first choice .
His motive for taking it , or another job like it , would be his ambition to tackle world poverty and his anger at the plight of many millions of people around the world who live on the knife ’s edge of bare existence . ”
Gordon Brown reportedly turned down a chance to head the organisation several years ago because he wanted to become PM .
He was re-elected in his constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath in the election and will continue to serve as a backbench Labour MP .
Internationally , his reputation remains intact and he is admired for the way he tackled the global banking crisis .
An IMF source said : “ He is very well regarded . ”
Barnes & Noble announced a software update for its
Nook e-reader , complete with new features such as a Web browser and games , on April 23 .
The new features include the beta version of " Read In Store , " which allows Nook users to browse the retailer 's library of e-books for free at any Barnes & Noble location , with the entirety of each book accessible for an hour per day .
Barnes & Noble has also added the beta version of a basic Web browser , and a selection of Android - based games including Sudoku and chess .
" We 've also made additional reading and device performance enhancements including improved page turn speed , faster access to previously opened e-books , enhanced color touch - screen navigation and more , " Paul Hochman , manager of Content and Social Media at BarnesandNoble.com , wrote in an April 23 posting on the Nook and BN eReader blog .
" The new features and additional enhancements are available with the updated Nook software now available via manual download at www.nook.com/update. "
Hochman 's allusion to faster book access and page - turn speed seems to be a reference to early reviews for the Nook , some of which claimed that slowness and some unpolished features represented the biggest drawbacks for the device .
Registered Nooks with WiFi connectivity will automatically download the software , a process that Hochman suggests will take between 5 - 7 minutes , at some point within the next week .
Barnes & Noble 's announcement comes at a time when the bookseller finds itself in strengthening competition against not only Amazon.com and its bestselling Kindle e-reader , but also Apple 's iPad , whose e-books application is considered a viable threat to traditional e-reader devices .
In addition to selling the Nook through its Website and bookstores , Barnes & Noble also recently inked a deal with Best Buy to sell the device ; that move will soon be mirrored by Amazon , which plans on selling the Kindle at Target stores starting on April 25 .
Under the terms of the agreement with Best Buy , Nook e-reader software will be loaded onto a selection of the electronics retailers ' PCs and smartphones .
Both Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com have issued e-reader applications for the iPad , hoping to extend their brands even onto a device meant to take their market share .
Although some analysts originally pigeonholed e-readers as a niche item , the devices managed to gain substantial traction during the 2009 holiday shopping season , with both Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble claiming their devices to be some of the most heavily sought - after items through their respective channels .
The competition between the Nook and Kindle also led to something of a price war , with the retail cost of both devices eventually hitting $ 259 .
As Britain ’s water supply faces fluctuation , an environmental group is calling for systemic reform and improved conservation .
Rising temperatures and a growing population are threatening the water supply of the Severn , Britain ’s longest river .

Population growth and global warming could damage rivers across England and Wales , with one - third of the region ’s river systems already in danger of running dry during hot summer months , according to local government and environmental groups .
This seasonal drying would be detrimental to the surrounding environment and decrease water supply for utilities that tap them .
The Environment Agency , a government bureau charged with environmental protection and regulation in England and Wales , estimates that river flows in some areas could be reduced by 80 percent by 2050 and warns that ecosystems in one - third of the river catchments are already in danger of drying out in a hot summer , the Daily Telegraph reports .
Threatened waterways include the upper Wharfe in Yorkshire , known as the world ’s most volatile and fastest rising river , and the Severn , Great Britain ’s longest river at 354 kilometers ( 220 miles ) .
The World Wide Fund for Nature , formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , is calling for an overhaul of British water regulations as well as public education efforts , including installing water meters to help people measure and reduce their water use , the Daily Telegraph reported .
The WWF is also asking people in Britain to reduce their average daily water use of 148 liters ( 39 U.S. gallons ) to 130 liters ( 34 gallons ) by 2030 , and for the government to update how they measure utilities ’ usage of water .
Meanwhile , the environmental group has teamed up with Ofwat , which regulates water and sewerage providers in England and Wales , to reform the country ’s more than 40 - year - old water withdrawal licenses and to develop other conservation measures .

Experience dictates that the modern black metal listener is in essence a “ hipster ” ; a self referential , individualist , egocentric and more or less self - pitying individual .
Moreover , experience also dictates that the modern and profane black metal musician has more in common with the lowly pop artist than with the principles and individuals that helped to create the original Norwegian black metal movement .
There was once a moment in time when black metal , like all great artistic movements strove to express something eternal , whether that was the paradoxical juxtaposition of beauty and death , the joy in battle and the growth that ensues due to struggle , or the essentially inexpressible infinite cosmos .
One of the more salient features of the nascent black metal scenes was the romantic obsession those involved had with the past .
Black metal ’s obsession with bygone ages pointed to a nascent , articulated , although perhaps not fully defined , desire to rediscover traditional knowledge , including the mythology , and the social and traditional norms that defined their venerable , Indo -European culture , namely Norse .
As these individuals invaded the undergrowth of wisdom distilled in the remaining works of bygone ages , listeners , onlookers and now later historians were and are provided with a glimpse into the workings of a movement that pre-eminently strove to rediscover lost wisdom and to participate and explore the multifaceted plains of reality , and its highest level therein , namely the Supreme Principle .
This desire to participate in the highest level of reality can be used to shed light on the enigmatic drive to self - imposed anonymity , such that these original European Mystics indeed strove towards .
As we traverse the iconography and interviews , or lack thereof , of the original black metal scene we are forced to recognize the tools by which these individuals imposed anonymity among themselves ; one recalls the corpse paint , used primarily although not exclusively to obscure their physical attributes .
Indeed , we recall , the use of pseudonym to obscure , nay to eschew their name and ego .
Recall lastly , the ambiguous relationship these individuals had with media , in itself the pre-emptive tool for modern ego worship , as either non-existent or outright hostile .
Regardless of later sensational developments in the scene , the originators reveled in a mystique of anonymity that pointed not to a new marketing gimmick but rather to the participation in a higher principle or reality , from which peek their ego and its gratification seemed comic .
Awaiting the sign of the horns
A thousand black clouds storms
Blasphemous Northern rites
Mysticism touched
Pentagrams burning – Immortal , Unholy Forces of Evil
The Main purveyors of the early black metal scene , and especially the Scandinavian Mystic Varg Vikernes seemed to be in fact consciously aware of this higher reality , from whence all proceeds .
Commenting on the “ illusory ” nature of material reality , and its reliance upon a higher principle for its substantial and formal manifestation , the lyrics of “ Lost Wisdom ” proclaim :
While we may believe , our World , our reality
to be that is , is but one manifestation of the Essence – Burzum , Lost Wisdom
Although such an outright recognition of the Supreme Principle is rarely encountered as explicitly in other black metal bands of the time , the anonymity and symbolism utilized by many of the protagonists within the scene , for example Enslaved and their conscious decision to explore the themes surrounding the Norse gods and the profound metaphysical symbolism implied therein , seems to point to an implicit recognition of higher principles , and perhaps the higher principle itself , from whence an expression of anonymity logically follows .
Rene Guenon teaches us that it is a mere modern deviation from the Supreme Principle and traditional doctrine that has led to current notions of crass individualism , ego worship and “ originality ” .
Current artists are very nearly obsessed with having works attributed to their ego , and such modern profanities have even led scholars on an endless search to provide the public , and novelty seekers , with the names of those artists who completed Medieval masterpieces .
Of course these Medieval artists , due to their participation in the higher Principle from which all things emanate , had not the hubris to associate their works solely with their own ego .
Likewise , a search for traditional knowledge and the participation of and recognition of a supreme Principle led to a general anonymity amongst the original black metal adherents from Norway .
This participation precludes the notion of anonymity described as “ infra - human ” , implying the dissolution of a particular in a crowd , but entails rather a participation in a higher supra-individual order .
Consider the words of Rene Guenon :
The being that has attained a supra- individual state is by that fact alone , released from all the limiting conditions of individuality , that is to say it is beyond determinations of name and form that constitute the essence and the substance of its individuality as such ; thus it is truly anonymous because in it the ‘ ego ’ has effaced itself and disappeared completely before the ’ Self ’ – Rene Guenon , The Reign of Quantity and The Signs of the Time
The key to understanding what has been said above is to recognize that in this case the Ego has effaced itself in the face of the higher Principle from which it has emanated , nay from which all things , states and possibilities emanate , while in itself remaining unaffected and unchanged by this manifestation .
It is the ego that produces the “ subject vs. object ” sensation and produces the dichotomy of “ I and Thou ” .
However , participation in the Supreme Principle implies a transformation , in which one becomes consciously aware that all of existence is indeed one , and that all must fundamentally be attributed to It , the Supreme Principle .
Indeed , all dichotomies will have been overcome , the barriers of subject versus object will have been overcome , and one will attain immortality .
Hence , in aspiring to this reality and perhaps participating in it , Black Metal musicians were quick to live among the shadows , obscure , nameless , formless , recognizing themselves and their works as naught but one of the infinite possibilities inherent in the supreme principle .
It should therefore come as no surprise in connection with these thoughts that certain musicians chose such pseudonym’s as if to reflect cosmic principles , representative of the venerable Indo - European tradition of the Norsemen .
Brahman cannot be realized by those who are subject to greed , fear and anger .
Brahman cannot be realized by those who are subject to the pride of name and fame .
– Tejobindu Upanishad
Delving deep into primordial traditions long forgotten , those Scandinavian mystics seem to have uncovered long forgotten mystic truths , hidden within the depths of the most primordial of the Indo - European traditions – Hinduism .
It should come as no surprise to those familiar with Indo - European traditions that a study of , and adherence to strict Traditional principles , a fascination with the Norse Legends combined with some occult influences , however badly understood , would lead the black metal warrior down the road of ‘ Self ’ discovery .
It is well known that Odin himself is etymologically derived from Gwoden , another name for Indra , a God venerated as the leader of God ’s in the Hindu Pantheon .
With the inherent and complimentary relationship between these two Indo European worldviews , namely Hinduism and Norse Mythology established , not only etymologically but through the recognition that all true traditions aspire to the same essential goal , realization of the Supreme Priciple , it is fair to conclude that both contain within themselves the seed for mystical realization , or a knowledge of the “ essence ” .
Of necessity , we turn to Hinduism , a more complete metaphysical system to fill in some of the blanks as to what Vikernes and company were aspiring to during the apex of the black metal phenomenon .
Return to the ring of our forefathers gods
The flames of Midgard ’s fires and ancient mysticism still are – Enslaved , Fires of Midgard
According to Hindu tradition the purpose of life is to become united with the ‘ Self ’ , Brahman , the Supreme Principle , that which is enshrined in the hearts of all , according to ones station in life and capacity to do so .
Again , this is the same Supreme Principle alluded to above , from which participation in , a true supra-individual anonymity necessarily springs .
Although the original black metal purveyors may not have been consciously aware of the heights to which they were ascending , nor of the full traditional implications of what they were doing , it comes as no surprise that when re-discovering their traditional legends that they would inadvertently ascribe to the goal of , and rediscover some of the outstanding tenants of a more primordial , and complete Indo - European tradition , Hinduism , whose purpose again , much like that of the ancient Norse religion , was and still is to help facilitate the discovery of ‘ Self ’ knowledge , participation therein and the realization that all proceeds from the Supreme Principle .
Once again , truth is one , and it is the same for all those who , by whatever way , have attained to its understanding .
– Rene Guenon , Oriental Metaphysics

UPDATE : And the answer is : private karaoke studios … with a bar !
Rock Box co-owner Mindy Dodobara cleared up any confusion .
She and her husband Steven , a dentist in Federal Way , are planning to open a karaoke “ box ” in the traditional Japanese style , as she described it , with 12 private boxes ranging from small ( four to six guests ) , to medium ( eight to ten ) , to large ( 12 to 14 ) .
Rock
Box will also include a party room that accommodates up to 40 people and which will host a weekly , non-karaoke DJ night .
While this would be the first karaoke shop for the Dodobaras , they are partnering with more experienced karaoke operator Toshihiko Kida out of NYC .
The big difference between Rock Box and the city ’s existing private karaoke studios ?
Booze .
However , instead of being primarily a bar , Rock Box will be first and foremost a karaoke venue , just one that offers a full bar .
“ For some people , liquor is sort of a prerequisite for karaoke , ” she said .
Seattle ’s Best Karaoke , located at 1818 Minor Ave. , does not serve alcohol and requires that guests who bring their own libations pay for a permit .
Mindy , a Capitol Hill native , anticipates signing the lease in the next two to three days and opening by mid-October .
In the meantime , she is seeking advice on how to make Rock Box a hit .
“ We ’d love to have feedback from people as to what they ’d like to see in our place , ” she said .
To contact her , follow Rock Box on Twitter @rockboxseattle .
Original Report :
Warm up those vocal cords , Capitol Hill .
The team that recently attracted Blick Art Materials to the neighborhood is considering a karaoke outfit to take over another space in its historic building at Pine and Broadway .
Monday morning , signs promoting the Fall 2010 arrival of Rock Box appeared in the windows at the building ’s southeastern corner along Nagle Place across from Bobby Morris Playfield .
According to Jill Cronauer of property owner Hunters Capital , Rock Box specializes in karaoke but is not a karaoke bar .
The lease has yet to be signed , though the sign is up .
So what might it be ?
Private karaoke studios ?
A karaoke discotheque ?
The rare hybrid , a karaoke club in front with a jewelry store in the back ?
It remains to be seen .
One clue can be found in Washington State corporation records .
CHS has found records for a Rock Box LLC incorporated in Washington in 2008 .
Listed as “ governing persons ” are a Steven and Mindy Dodobara of Seattle and Toshihiko Kida of Forest Hills , NY who has the Twitter handle karaokechamp123 and operates a business called Karaoke Champ in NYC .
According to http://karaokechamp.com, the business provides rental karaoke machinery and operates six lounges in New York , three in Southern California and one in Atlanta .
Could Capitol Hill ’s Rock Box be a Pacific Northwest outpost for the network ?
We have calls out to various involved parties and will update when we learn more .
From the Crescent to the Cuff ( and many in between ) , Capitol Hill currently has much to offer the wannabe American Idols in us all , but is there such thing as a karaoke threshold , a point at which our neighborhood could be over - saturated with karaoke ?
If such a thing does exist , we may not have crossed that line yet .
Scott Hembree , who has managed the Crescent for 10 years , would welcome a new arrival to the neighborhood .
“ As long as there are n’t too many in one cluster , it would be great to have one more , ” he said .
“ I would n’t discourage it .
I love karaoke . ”
He added that cities such as San Francisco and Fort Lauderdale play host to even more karaoke that Seattle does .
Black Nail Productions owner Marcus Lo Ré , who hosts karaoke Monday and Tuesday nights at Purr , would encourage the neighborhood ’s next karaoke purveyor to reach out to him and to bars in the neighborhood that already offer karaoke .
Lo Ré , who has put on karaoke shows for more than 17 years , added that perhaps the neighborhood ’s hetero population is an untapped market for aspiring crooners .
“ Karaoke is far from dead , as far as I ’m concerned , ” said Lo Ré .
“ We have n’t even gotten started yet . ”
Perhaps Capitol
Hill has room yet for one more woozy , 2 a.m. rendition of “ I Will Survive . ”
[ 1 ] THE TERM HAS BECOME so widely used that it is in danger of meaning nothing .
It has been applied to all manner of activities in an effort to give those activities the gloss of moral imperative , the cachet of environmental enlightenment .
“ Sustainable ” has been used variously to mean “ politically feasible , ” “ economically feasible , ” “ not part of a pyramid or bubble , ” “ socially enlightened , ” “ consistent with neoconservative small - government dogma , ” “ consistent with liberal principles of justice and fairness , ” “ morally desirable , ” and , at its most diffuse , “ sensibly far - sighted . ”
[ 2 ] NATURE WILL DECIDE what is sustainable ; it always has and always will .
The reflexive invocation of the term as cover for all manner of human acts and wants shows that sustainability has gained wide acceptance as a longed - for , if imperfectly understood , state of being .
[ 3 ] AN ACT , PROCESS , OR STATE of affairs can be said to be economically sustainable , ecologically sustainable , or socially sustainable .
To these three some would add a fourth : culturally sustainable .
[ 4 ] NATURE IS MALLEABLE and has enormous resilience , a resilience that gives healthy ecosystems a dynamic equilibrium .
But the resiliency of nature has limits and to transgress them is to act unsustainably .
Thus , the most diffuse usage , “ sensibly far - sighted , ” is the usage that contains and properly reflects the strict ecological definition of the term : a thing is ecologically sustainable if it does n’t destroy the environmental preconditions for its own existence .
[ 5 ] ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY describes the point at which a less - developed economy no longer needs infusions of capital or aid in order to generate wealth .
This definition is misleading : for many of those who use it ( including traditional economists and many economic aid agencies ) , “ economic sustainability ” means “ sustainable within the general industrial program of using fossil fuels to generate wealth and produce economic growth , ” a program that is , of course , not sustainable .
[ 6 ]
SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY describes a state in which a society does not contain any dynamics or forces that would pull it apart .
Such a society has sufficient cohesion to overcome the animosities that arise from ( for instance ) differences of race , gender , wealth , ethnicity , political or religious belief ; or from differential access to such boons as education , opportunity , or the nonpartisan administration of justice .
Social sustainability can be achieved by strengthening social cohesion ( war is a favorite device ) , through indoctrination in an ideology that bridges the disparities that strain that cohesion , or through diminishing the disparities themselves .
( Or all three . )
[ 7 ] CULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY asks that we preserve the opportunity for nonmarket or other nonindustrial cultures to maintain themselves and to pass their culture undiminished to their offspring .
[ 8 ] HUMAN CIVILIZATION has been built on the exploitation of the stored solar energy found in four distinct carbon pools : soil , wood , coal , petroleum .
The latter two pools represent antique , stored solar energy , and their stock is finite .
Since agriculture and forestry exploit current solar income , civilizations built on the first two pools — soil and wood — had the opportunity to be sustainable .
Many were not .
[ 9 ]
THE 1987 UN BRUNDTLAND REPORT offered one widely accepted definition of what sustainability means : “ meet[ing ] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . ”
This definition contains within it two key concepts .
One is the presumption of a distinction between needs and wants , a distinction that comes into sharp relief when we compare the consumption patterns of people in rich and in poor nations : rich nations satisfy many of their members ’ wants — indeed , billions of dollars are spent to stimulate those wants — even as poor nations struggle to satisfy human needs .
Two : we face what Brundtland called “ limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment ’s ability to meet present and future needs . ”
[ 10 ] THAT A DISTINCTION can usefully be drawn between wants and needs seems obvious .
Mainstream economics , however , refuses to countenance such a distinction .
( Marxist economics does , which , from the viewpoint of an ecologically enlightened economics , is one of the few ways in which it is distinguishable from its neoclassical alternative . )
The work of Wilfred Pareto was crucial to this refusal .
His contribution to economic theory marks a turning point in the evolution ( some would say devolution ) of nineteenth - century political economy into the highly mathematized discipline of economics as we know it today .
Pareto ’s novel idea : because satisfactions and pleasures are subjective — because no one among us can say with certainty , “ I like ice cream more than you do ” — there is no rational way to compare the degree of pleasure that different people will gain by satisfying desires .
All we can do is assert that if an economic arrangement satisfies more human wants , it is objectively better than an arrangement that satisfies fewer human wants .
This seems commonsensical until we unpack that caveat “ all we can do . ”
An economic arrangement achieves Pareto Optimality if , within it , no one can be made better off ( in his own estimation ) without making someone else worse off ( in her own estimation ) .
Economic science , in its desire to be grounded on rational , objective principles , thus concludes that were we to take a dollar from a billionaire and give it to a starving man to buy food , we ca n’t know for certain that we have improved the sum total of human satisfaction in the world .
For all we know , the billionaire might derive as much pleasure from the expenditure of his billionth dollar as would a starving man spending a dollar on food .
All we can do — all ! — is promote the growth of income ; and if we care about that starving man , we must work to produce two dollars ’ worth of goods where before there was only one , so that both the billionaire and the starving man can satisfy their wants .
[ 11 ] THUS WAS neoclassical economic theory , putatively value - free and scientific , made structurally dependent on a commitment to infinite economic growth , a value - laden , unscientific , demonstrably unsustainable commitment if ever there was one .
[ 12 ] THE BRUNDTLAND assertion that we face “ limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment ’s ability to meet present and future needs ” can be read as both acknowledging ecological limits to human activity and as sidestepping the major issue that those ecological limits have brought to the fore .
Can humans , through technological development , solve any problem brought on by resource scarcity and the limited capacity of ecosystems to absorb our acts and works ?
When all is said and done , can we enlarge the economy ’s ecological footprint forever in order to create wealth ?
Gradually , we are coming to recognize that the answer is no .
[ 13 ] AN ECONOMY CAN BE MODELED as an open thermodynamic system , one that exchanges matter and energy across its border ( that mostly conceptual , sometimes physical line that separates culture from its home in nature ) .
An economy sucks up valuable low - entropy matter and energy from its environment , uses these to produce products and services , and emits degraded matter and energy back into the environment in the form of a high - entropy wake .
( Waste heat .
Waste matter .
Dissipated and degraded matter : yesterday ’s newspaper , last year ’s running shoes , last decade ’s dilapidated automobile . )
An economy has ecological impact on both the uptake and emission side .
The laws of thermodynamics dictate that this be so .
“ You ca n’t make something from nothing ; nor can you make nothing from something , ” the law of conservation of matter and energy tells us .
With enough energy we could recycle all the matter that enters our economy — even the molecules that wear off the coins in your pocket .
But energy is scarce : “ You ca n’t recycle energy , ” says the law of entropy .
Or , in a colloquial analogy : Accounts must balance and bills must be paid .
To operate our economic machine we pay an energy bill ; we must ever take in energy anew .
[ 14 ] ESTABLISHING an ecologically sustainable economy requires that humans accept a limit on the amount of scarce low entropy that we take up from the planet ( which will also , necessarily , limit the amount of degraded matter and energy that we emit ) .
An effective approach would be to use market mechanisms , such as would occur if we had an economy - wide tax on low - entropy uptake ( the extraction of coal and oil , the cutting of lumber ) .
The tax rate could be set to ensure that use does n’t exceed a limit — the CO 2 absorption capacity of the planet , the regenerative ability of forests .
Producers and consumers would have freedom under the cap brought about by the tax .
With such a tax , the tax on workers ’ income could be abandoned .
( As the slogan says , we should “ tax bads , not goods . ”
Work is good .
Uptake of scarce resources is bad . )
[ 15 ] FOR DECADES environmentalism has been primarily a moral vision , with principles susceptible to being reduced to fundamentalist absolutes .
Pollution is wrong ; it is profanation .
We have no right , environmentalism has said , to cause species extinction , to destroy habitat , to expand the dominion of culture across the face of nature .
True enough , and so granted .
But even Dick Cheney agreed that environmentalism is essentially , merely , a moral vision .
( “ Conservation , ” he said , on his way to giving oil companies everything they wanted , “ may be a personal virtue , but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound , comprehensive energy policy . ” )
The time has long since passed for the achievement of sustainability to be left to simple moral admonition , to finger - wagging in its various forms .
It ’s time to use the power of the market — the power of self - interest , regulated and channeled by wise policy — to do good .
Environmentalism must become an economic vision .
[ 16 ] ACCEPTING A LIMIT on the economy ’s uptake of matter and energy from the planet does not mean that we have to accept that history is over , that civilization will stagnate , or that we cannot make continual improvements to the human condition .
A no -growth economy is not a no- development economy ; there would still be invention , innovation , even fads and fashions .
An economy operating within ecological limits will be in dynamic equilibrium ( like nature , its model ) : just as ecosystems evolve , so would the economy .
Quality of life ( as it is measured by the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare , an ecologically minded replacement for GDP ) would still improve .
If a sustainable economy dedicated to development rather than growth were achieved through market mechanisms , consumers would still reign supreme over economic decision making , free to pursue satisfactions — and fads and fashions — as they choose .
[ 17 ] OUR CHALLENGE is to create something unprecedented in human history : an ecologically sustainable civilization that offers a high standard of living widely shared among its citizens , a civilization that does not maintain itself through more - or - less hidden subsidies from antique solar income , or from the unsustainable exploitation of ecosystems and peoples held in slavery or penury , domestically or in remote regions of the globe .
The world has never known such a civilization .
Most hunting - and - gathering tribes achieved a sustainable balance with their environments , living off current solar income in many of its forms rather than on the draw - down of irreplaceable stocks , but we ca n’t say that any of them achieved a high standard of material well - being .
Medieval western Europe lived in balance with its soil community , achieving a form of sustainable agriculture that lasted until the invention of coal - and steam - propelled agriculture a few centuries ago , but few of us would trade the comforts and freedoms we enjoy today for life as a serf on a baronial estate , or even for the pre-electricity , pre-petroleum life of a mid-nineteenth - century farmer .
[ 18 ] NO , THERE IS NO PRECEDENT for what we are struggling to create .
We have to make it up ourselves .

Watch :
Seven Giltnir Bank investors and officials , including Jon Asgeir Johannesson , are being sued for conspiring to snatch control of USD 2 billion to benefit their own “ failing companies , ” Reuters reports .
According to the complaint filed in the New York State Supreme Court , the seven defendants led by investor Jon Asgeir Johannesson , financed the scheme of USD 2 billion by relying on funds that Glitnir raised in 2007 , and then selling USD 1 billion of medium - term notes to investors across the U.S .
The complaint was filed a little over 18 months after Icelandic regulators took control of Glitnir , as well as Iceland ’s two other largest banks , in the wake of the global economic crisis .
In November 2008 , Glitnir then went into insolvency proceedings .
Those accused also include Johannesson ’s wife , Ingibjorg Stefania Palmadottir , investor Palmi Haraldsson , former Chairman Thorsteinn Jonsson , former Chief Executive Larus Welding , former directors Jon Sigurdsson and Hannes Smarason .
In addition to the New York proceedings , Glitnir has also succeeded in imposing a worldwide freeze on all Johannesson ’s assets .
This move in a London court echoes an Iceland - only freeze imposed earlier this week .
There will be a press conference with Giltnir ’s insolvency committee at 14.30 GMT today .

DeviantART has truly empowered a rich and diverse global community of 21st century mark makers …
It 's easy for us to toot our own horns , so see what these industry experts have to say about the new deviantART experience :
Overall , we 've saved a whopping 148 px in height on the browse pages .
That 's an extra row of thumbs displayed above the fold at our default page size .
We 've simplified the layout , removing 50 % of the horizontal and vertical separations on the browse page .
V6 has ten divided visual sections , while v7 has just five — appearing approximately 30 % larger than before .
Profile and group pages are now 60 px further up the page .
Avatars and names now take ownership of the top of the page like never before .
The v7 header is now the same height as the deviantART iPhone / Mobile site 's header .
This makes it possible for a similar experience on any platform ( desktop , iPad , iPhone ) .
Kagan is being described as a " political pragmatist . "
When centrism , pragmatism , and " moderation " are a foil for " what 's good for me , " we need to be worried .
The terms “ centrist , ” “ pragmatist , ” and “ moderate ” most often are used these days to describe politicians who make deals based on their own political calculations ( e.g. what is good for them and their re-election campaigns , or what is best for the corporations or largest donors to their campaigns ) .
Rarely , these days , do I see that label attached to someone who stood for something clear and progressive , fought for their principles as long as they could , and then made what compromises were necessary to do the greatest good for the greatest number .
I personally have been deeply disappointed in the Obama White House because of their own default to “ pragmatism ” over values , as evidenced in the pattern of pre-emptive capitulation on almost every issue from health care to climate change .
What is good for people is not always good for politicians , but the latter considerations invariably come first .
So it is both deeply troubling and simultaneously not surprising to realize that the only things we can know about Elena Kagan is that she was a “ political pragmatist ” in the Clinton White House when it came to women ’s rights .
Yesterday we learned that Kagan–and let ’s face it , the Clinton White House–did not stand for and fight as much as possible for pro-choice principles but rather stood for the president ’s own political gains at the expense of women when it came to legislative bans on late abortion .

In short , they “ sadly ” ( their words ) sold poor women down the river for political reasons , something that happens time and again .
Josh Gerstein writes that the documents “ could underscore concerns among some liberal activists that Kagan was an advocate of the policy triangulation of the Clinton White House and thus might not be a reliably liberal vote on the court . ”
A 1998 memo shows that Kagan was among advisers encouraging Clinton to deny Medicare funding for abortions in cases of rape or incest – in part to avoid a messy battle with Republicans .
At the time , Medicare rules covered abortion only where the mother ’s life was in danger , and women ’s groups and the Department of Health and Human Services wanted to expand the coverage .
Leaving the stricter standard in place “ may expose us to criticism about non-coverage of extremely sympathetic cases involving vulnerable and disabled women , ” the memo from domestic policy chief Bruce Reed and counsel Charles Ruff to Clinton said .
“ This option will anger women ’s groups which would prefer us to provide Medicare coverage of the widest possible range of abortions , even if doing so would provoke the Republicans to enact contrary legislation . ”
“ DPC ( Bruce , Chris [ Jennings ] , and Elena ) and OMB support [ the stricter option ] because ( 1 ) it is most consistent with this Administration ’s prior practice on government funding of abortions and ( 2 ) it stands the best chance of avoiding a high - profile legislative battle … that we are unlikely to win , ” the memo said .
A left - handed check mark shows Clinton took the advice .
“ It was a tough call to make because some of the cases were very sad ” involving women who had been raped in mental institutions , said Jennings , Clinton ’s top health care adviser .
“ But some of the issues were not just a question of what lines you draw , but what would happen on the Hill with a Republican Congress , what kinds of things would attract a reaction that ’s actually worse . ”
The question of “ what lines you draw . ”
Women being raped in mental institutions … did anyone , in the course of considering fights on the hill , discuss this publicly as a human rights and political issue ?
Or was it just buried as one more set of collateral damages of women ’s right sacrificed to what was best for politicians ?
Was anyone in the broader public made aware of this as an issue ?
What considerations go into “ what lines you draw ” when it comes to the rights , health , and lives of women , including but not limited to rape victims in mental institutions ?
That they wo n’t be heard anyway ?
( Let ’s just be clear we are talking about perhaps the most defenseless rape victims , people already institutionalized and therefore invisible , already stigmatized and discriminated against , but who clearly are not likely to be a major political force at the polls , nor even get media attention to their plight ? )
Of course , they are at once perhaps most vulnerable but also emblematic of a broader problem in any articulation of women ’s rights by the Democratic party .
Gerstein also refers to the issue of late - abortions , on which we reported yesterday .
Another memo from May 1997 suggests Kagan ’s political pragmatism – showing that she encouraged Clinton to endorse an abortion - related legislative proposal by Sen.
Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) even though it was opposed by abortion rights groups and viewed as unconstitutional by the Justice Department .
Daschle ’s language was a substitute for a so - called partial - birth abortion ban being pushed by Republican leaders .
It would have allowed late - term abortions only where a doctor certified pregnancy would “ risk grievous injury ” to the mother ’s health .
Clinton had been on record for years opposing the “ partial - birth ” procedure , but he insisted on creating an exception to allow the procedure for cases where it was medically needed .
Women ’s groups complained that Daschle ’s requirement for creating that exception went too far .
But in a memo co-written with Reed , Kagan painted the endorsement of Daschle ’s language not necessarily as good policy but as the best way of heading off the chances that an even stricter anti-abortion measure would clear Congress with a veto - proof majority .
“ Not necessarily as good policy . ”
One might be forgiven for thinking that “ good policy ” would be what ’s good for real people .
Here it is clearly what is good for politicians .
Of course , these are the issues of greatest concern when evaluating whether we want Elena Kagan to be on the Supreme Court for the better part of the next 30 - plus years .
Still …
White House officials did not comment on specific memos but have publicly described Kagan as a “ pragmatic progressive ” and suggested perceptions that she ’s a centrist largely reflect her keen sense of what is politically achievable .
What is “ politically achievable ” is not a static concept or reality .
What is “ politically achievable ” is a condition created by people of courage who make clear their values and principles , are not afraid to articulate them , and fight for them as far as they can reasonably go .
What is politically achievable is created by movements that press for change and politicians accountable to them .
The real issue here is “ what is best for the politician who wants to stay in office , ” and how a “ politically pragmatic ” Supreme Court nominee who has never , apparently , articulated a position on anything will operate in securing our basic rights .
And clearly , that is one reason Obama chose her .
Whose lives matter more ?
Whose priorities are on the table ?
The “ pro-choice ” president and advisers who will never engage a fight on behalf of women ?
Or the people those politicians are supposedly there to represent ?
And what does this kind of “ political pragmatism ” tell us about Elena Kagan , about whom little is known ?
Just askin’ .
Obama administration backs stripping “ terror ” suspects of Miranda rights
By Patrick Martin
10 May 2010
Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday that the Obama administration would seek congressional passage of legislation that would weaken or eliminate Miranda rights for anyone arrested on suspicion of a connection to terrorism , effectively permitting open - ended and coercive interrogations .
In appearances on several network television interview programs , Holder and chief White House terrorism adviser John Brennan responded to congressional demands for more sweeping attacks on democratic rights in the wake of the failed attempt to detonate a car - bomb in New York City ’s Times Square May 1 .
Senator Joseph Lieberman , an Independent Democrat from Connecticut , and Senator Scott Brown , the recently elected Republican from Massachusetts , announced May 5 they would introduce legislation to authorize the State Department to revoke the citizenship of any American believed to be linked to terrorism .
Similar legislation is to be introduced in the House of Representatives by two Pennsylvania congressmen , Democrat Jason Altmire and Republican Charles Dent .
The Lieberman - Brown bill was announced amid a blaze of media publicity , after the arrest of Faisal Shahzad , the suspected Times Square bomber , a naturalized American citizen of Pakistani descent .
Shahzad was taken off an Emirates Airways plane at Kennedy Airport May 3 , interrogated and arrested .
Right - wing criticism of the Obama administration and Holder in particular has focused on the decision to read Shahzad his Miranda rights after four hours of questioning .
The bill won immediate support from some leading Democrats .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she supported the “ spirit ” of the measure but wanted to see the details .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared , “ United States citizenship is a privilege .
It is not a right .
People who are serving foreign powers — or in this case , foreign terrorists — are clearly in violation , in my personal opinion , of that oath which they swore when they became citizens . ”
Asked about the Lieberman bill on the NBC interview program “ Meet the Press , ” Holder refrained from direct criticism , saying he had n’t been able to review the actual text , which has not yet been released , but he cited possible “ constitutional concerns ” with the proposal .
The attorney general offered a different anti-democratic measure as an alternative to the Lieberman - Brown bill : curtailing the Miranda rights of those detained for questioning as terror suspects .
The Miranda warning is read by police to a person they are arresting , in more or less these words : “ You have the right to remain silent .
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
You have the right to an attorney . ”
The warning entered US criminal procedures after the 1966 Supreme Court decision , Miranda v. Arizona , in which a defendant sued after his conviction on the basis of a confession coerced from him by a brutal police interrogation .
He charged that his constitutional right against self - incrimination ( the Fifth Amendment right ) had been violated , and he won the case .
Eighteen years later , the Supreme Court carved out a “ public safety exception ” to the Miranda warning , in a case where an armed man fleeing the police ran into a supermarket and threw his gun away .
Police observed his empty holster and asked him where the gun was , prior to giving him a Miranda warning .
Both the suspected Christmas Day airline bomber and the suspected Times Square bomber were questioned for several hours under this “ public safety exception . ”
But eventually , both were read their Miranda rights , after which they continued to cooperate and provide information to their interrogators .
Holder told NBC interviewer David Gregory that the Justice Department was reviewing the procedures used in the interrogation of Shahzad .
“ I think we have to look at the rules that we have and look at the situation that we now confront , ” he said , arguing that the current exception to the Miranda warning was established in the 1980s .
“ We ’re now dealing with international terrorists , and I think that we have to think about perhaps modifying the rules that interrogators have and somehow coming up with something that is flexible and is more consistent with the threat that we now face , ” he said .
Holder continued that the administration would work with Congress on a proposal to change the Miranda warning to “ make our public safety exception more flexible and , again , more consistent with the threat that we face . ”
He declared , “ It is a new priority ” for the administration .
Holder ’s statement demonstrates that the Obama administration is once again using the pretext of the “ war on terror ” to push for far - reaching attacks on basic democratic rights .
Holder ’s discussion with David Gregory even invoked the “ ticking time bomb ” scenario , brought up whenever an attempt is made to justify torture or other illegal actions by the state .
The introduction of an expanded “ public safety exception ” through legislation , as suggested by Holder , would go far beyond the Bush administration , translating what were measures to be taken on executive authority , supposedly in emergency conditions , into the standard operating procedures of the US government and police agencies at every level .
The Lieberman - Brown bill , titled the “ Terrorist Expatriation Act ” is even more ominous in its implications for democratic rights .
The blatantly unconstitutional bill would allow the State Department to revoke the citizenship of anyone it deems provides “ material support ” to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda , or who participates in attacks on the United States or its allies .
The terminology is subject to sweeping interpretation .
The Obama administration has defined “ material support ” to include filing an amicus curiae brief in federal court , lobbying Congress , writing an op - ed column or teaching a human rights course .
Under Lieberman - Brown , such actions could lead to revocation of citizenship for people who were born in the United States and lived all their lives here .
Participation in attacks on “ allies ” of the United States is a blanket charge applying to anyone connected to Hamas , Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli resistance groups in Palestine and Lebanon , as well as insurgent groups in many other countries , such as Turkey , Colombia , Spain , India or much of Africa .
In practical terms , the Obama administration no longer distinguishes between citizens and non-citizens in its counterterrorism policies .
Both alike can be targeted for surveillance , arrest , indefinite detention , even assassination .
The sole distinction that remains is that citizens cannot be tried by military tribunals , a procedure reserved to non-citizens .
Thus the Lieberman - Brown bill , if passed , would make it possible to transfer Faisal Shahwad or other US citizen detainees to the jurisdiction of a military tribunal , with far more restricted rights of legal representation and defense .
In introducing the bill , Lieberman pointed to the hypocrisy of the Obama administration , which postures as opposing the worst excesses of the Bush administration while explicitly authorizing the assassination of US citizens , like Islamic fundamentalist cleric Mohammed al Awlawki .
If killing terrorist suspects without due process was permissible , Lieberman argued , what was wrong with depriving them of their citizenship ?

Oh Viagra .
Sure , Pfizer ’s wonder pill has side effects such as headaches , facial flushing , upset stomach , erections lasting more than four hours , bluish or sudden loss of vision .
There ’s one more risk to the pill that grants erections : Hearing loss .
Research published this week in Archives of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery showed an association between long - term hearing loss and Viagra .
This side effect is already acknowledged by Viagra - especially after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration forced this labeling changes for oral erectile dysfunction medicines known as PDE5 inhibitors in 2007 .
The research conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham looked into the data based on 11,525 men .
Men who self - reported hearing problems were twice more likely to indicate that they used erectile dysfunction medication .
While it ’s difficult to establish cause and effect in an observational study , these findings indicate that the FDA labeling was warranted , said study author Gerald McGwin , a professor of epidemiology at the UAB School of Public Health , in a taped news release .
The association was present for long - term hearing loss after using Viagra , and to a lesser extent other ED drugs such as Cialis and Levitra .
The sample sizes for the two latter drugs were smaller .
Since Viagra increases blood flow to the penis , perhaps the drug increases blood flow to the ear causing damage , McGwin hypothesized .

Overloading Functions in C
It is well known that C++ allows one to overload functions , and C does not .
This is typically done by " mangling " the name of a function , and thus including the types of its arguments in the symbol definition .
Each variant of an overloaded function will then obtain a different symbolic name for the entry point .
So by calling or jumping to the correct symbol we can execute the right version of the function .
Typically , the C compiler does no function symbol name mangling at all .
( This is ignoring underscore hacks . )
This means that you simply cannot define two versions of a function .
They 'll get the same symbolic name , and the linker will complain .
However , this is n't quite the whole story .
Various parts of the C and POSIX standards require overloaded versions of C functions to exist .
The simplest of these is the definition of the open ( ) function .
This function takes two arguments , the first of which describes the path of the file to open , and the second a set of flags describing exactly how to open the file .
There is an optional third parameter that is only required when the file may be created .
This third parameter describes the permissions settings to use for the new file .
So how do we specify an optional extra parameter in C code ?
This is a form of function overloading ; overloading by number of parameters .
Obviously it is n't done by mangling , and instead the va_args package can be used .
An implementation of a function which takes only two arguments , with an optional third parameter only required when the second parameter takes a specific value is : # include < stdio.h > # include < stdarg.h > void va_overload2 ( int p1 , int p2 ) { printf ( " va_overload2 %d %d
" , p1 , p2 ) ; } void va_overload3 ( int p1 , int p2 , int p3 ) { printf ( " va_overload3 %d %d %d
" , p1 , p2 , p3 ) ; } static void va_overload ( int p1 , int p2 , ... ) { if ( p2 == 7 ) { va_list v ; va_start ( v , p2 ) ; int p3 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; va_end ( v ) ; va_overload3 ( p1 , p2 , p3 ) ; return ; } va_overload2 ( p1 , p2 ) ; }
In the above code , we can parse the arguments , and then choose to either call va_overload2 ( ) or va_overload3 ( ) .
The POSIX open ( ) function may have a similar implementation on your system .
The printf and sprintf family of functions can parse an arbitrary number of arguments .
These use an initial format specifier to work out how many arguments , and of which type , exist .
One problem with this technique is that a va_args based function does n't do any type checking of its input arguments .
This can be a source of errors if the program interprets one type as another .
Fortunately , the gcc compiler provides a set of warnings for the standard functions that catch most of the problems .
User functions can be annotated with special attributes that describe their input if it matches the format + args pattern .
Another common usage of the va_args package is to accept an unlimited number of arguments , with no direct specifier of the number to accept .
By NULL - terminating the list , we can parse the arbitrary input to our function : static void print_nt_strings ( const char *s , ... ) { va_list v ; va_start( v , s ) ; /* Stop on NULL */ while ( s ) { printf ( " %s " , s ) ; /* Grab next parameter */ s = va_arg ( v , const char *) ; } va_end( v ) ; }
The above function will print all the C - strings passed to it , no matter the number provided the last pointer is NULL .
The problem here is remembering to add the final NULL to the list .
If it is left off , the above function will interpret values on the stack as const char * pointers and try to print them out .
This will invoke undefined behavior and probably crash the program .
A way to fix this problem is to explicitly say how many arguments exist , removing the need for the NULL on the end .
Having the user manually specify the number is inconvenient and error prone .
However , it is possible to automate this .
The first trick is to notice that the C pre-processor is powerful enough to count the number of arguments .
We can then use it to calculate this number , and include it as a hidden parameter to the " real " version of the function .
# define COUNT_PARMS2 ( _1 , _2 , _3 , _4 , _5 , _6 , _7 , _8 , _9 , _10 , _ , ... ) _ # define COUNT_PARMS (... ) \
COUNT_PARMS2( __VA_ARGS__ , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ) static void print_strings2 ( int count , ... ) { int i ; va_list v ; va_start ( v , count ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < count ; i++ ) { /*
Grab next parameter + print it */ const char *s = va_arg ( v , const char *) ; printf ( " %s " , s ) ; } va_end ( v ) ; } # define print_strings ( ... ) \
print_strings2( COUNT_PARMS( __VA_ARGS__ ) , __VA_ARGS__ )
By calling the print_strings ( ) macro , we indirectly call the print_strings2 ( ) function with the first argument being the count of all the rest of the arguments passed .
Note that the above COUNT_PARMS magic macro will only work for up to 10 arguments .
Extending it to more than 10 is relatively easy though .
Another subtle problem is that the C pre-processor macros do not distinguish well between zero and one arguments .
This makes it impossible to construct a macro to return " 0 " , and thus call print_strings ( ) with no arguments at all .
With gcc will get the error " error : expected expression before ' ) ' token " .
In this case it does n't matter much , but in some cases it might make an API a bit more complex .
Using a little more C pre-processor magic , we can remove the need for va_args parsing for overloaded functions .
The pre-processor can count the arguments , and then call a different function for each possibility .
This requires pasting the number generated by the COUNT_PARMS ( ) macro to the function name .
Some code which does n't do the pasting would look like : void count_overload1 ( int p1 ) { printf ( " One param : %d
" , p1 ) ; } void count_overload2 ( double * p1 , const char * p2 ) { printf ( " Two params : %p ( %f ) %s
" , p1 , * p1 , p2 ) ; } void count_overload3 ( int p1 , int p2 , int p3 ) { printf ( " Three params : %c %d %d
" , p1 , p2 , p3 ) ; } void count_overload_aux ( int count , ... ) { va_list v ; va_start ( v , count ) ; switch ( count ) { case 1 : { int p1 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; count_overload1 ( p1 ) ; break ; } case 2 : { double * p1 = va_arg ( v , double *) ; const char * p2 = va_arg ( v , const char *) ; count_overload2 ( p1 , p2 ) ; break ; } case 3 : { int p1 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; int p2 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; int p3 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; count_overload3 ( p1 , p2 , p3 ) ; break ; } default : { va_end ( v ) ; printf ( " Invalid arguments to function ' count_overload ( ) ' " ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } } va_end( v ) ; } # define count_overload ( ... ) \
count_overload_aux ( COUNT_PARMS( __VA_ARGS__ ) , __VA_ARGS__ )
And some code which replaces count_overload_aux ( ) with a macro is : void cpp_overload1 ( int p1 ) { printf ( " CPP One param : %d
" , p1 ) ; } void cpp_overload2 ( double * p1 , const char * p2 ) { printf ( " CPP
Two params : %p ( %f ) %s
" , p1 , * p1 , p2 ) ; } void cpp_overload3 ( int p1 , int p2 , int p3 ) { printf ( " CPP
Three params : %c %d %d
" , p1 , p2 , p3 ) ; } #define CAT( A , B ) CAT2 ( A , B ) # define CAT2 ( A , B ) A ## B # define cpp_overload ( ... ) \
CAT ( cpp_overload , COUNT_PARMS( __VA_ARGS__ ) ) ( __VA_ARGS__ )
As can be seen , the second version is much simpler .
It also can be quite a bit faster , as the compiler tends to find optimizing functions using va_args difficult .
The C pre-processor does enough of the symbol mangling calculation that the compiler can even inline the correct version of the function in whatever calls it .
Yet another advantage is that the compiler will check for mismatching argument count at compile time .
There is no need for something corresponding to the message + exit default option in the switch statement in the first version .
Using the above macros it is possible to overload functions based on number of parameters provided that the overloaded function takes at least one argument .
The actual types of the arguments are not inspected .
This allows the code above to have different type signatures for each overload .
Of course , this extra complexity is not always necessary , but it is nice to have the feature available .
Something similar to the above trick is that of default arguments to a function .
Often we would like to have some parameters only changed if the function user requests it .
Having default arguments that do n't always need to be explicitly set can simplify interfaces .
Simply by defining the less - argument versions of a function in terms of the full version , we can implement this in C. # define cpp_default1 ( A ) cpp_default2 ( A , " default string " ) void cpp_default2 ( int x , const char * s ) { printf ( " Got %d %s
" , x , s ) ; } #define cpp_default ( ... ) \
CAT ( cpp_default , COUNT_PARMS( __VA_ARGS__ ) ) ( __VA_ARGS__ )
The above code will in the default case print the integer first argument , followed by the " default string " string .
If the user calls the function ( macro ) with two arguments , with the second of them a C string , that string will be used instead .
Another form of overloading is that due to type .
This is done within the C standard library in some of the math functions .
For example the isinf ( ) function ( which is actually a macro ) will work with any floating point type .
The macro calls the required version of the overloaded function by inspecting the type of the argument .
This is done in the current version of glibc by investigating the size of the datatype .
void sizeof_overload_float( float f ) { printf ( " Got float %f
" , f ) ; } void sizeof_overload_double ( double d) { printf ( " Got double %f
" , d ) ; } void sizeof_overload_longdouble ( long double ld ) { printf ( " Got long double %Lf
" , ld ) ; } # define sizeof_overload ( A ) \ ( ( sizeof ( A ) == sizeof ( float ) ) ?sizeof_overload_float( A ) :\ ( sizeof ( A ) == sizeof ( double ) ) ?sizeof_overload_double( A ) :\ ( sizeof ( A ) == sizeof ( long double ) ) ?sizeof_overload_longdouble( A ) :( void ) 0 ) The above sizeof_overload ( ) macro works similarly .
It assumes it is passed a floating point type , and will print which one based on the size .
However , there are a couple of flaws with this technique .
The first is that not all types differ in size .
The __float128 type has the same size as the long double type , and thus the wrong overload will be called .
The gcc manual describes some intrinsics that can be used to fix this problem .
We can use __builtin_types_compatible_p ( ) to compare types directly ( instead of indirectly via their sizes ) , and use __builtin_choose_expr ( ) instead of the unwieldy ternary operator .
struct s1 { int a ; int b ; double c ; } ; struct s2 { long long a ; long long b ; } ; void gcc_overload_s1 ( struct s1 s ) { printf ( " Got a struct s1 : %d %d %f
" , s.a , s.b , s.c ) ; } void gcc_overload_s2 ( struct s2 s ) { printf ( " Got a struct s2 : % lld %lld
" , s.a , s.b ) ; } // warning : dereferencing type - punned pointer will break strict - aliasing rules # define gcc_overload ( A ) \ __builtin_choose_expr(__builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof ( A ) , struct s1 ) , \ gcc_overload_s1 (*( struct s1 *) &A ) , \ __builtin_choose_expr(__builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof( A ) , struct s2 ) , \ gcc_overload_s2 (*( struct s2 *) &A ) , ( void ) 0 ) )
This allows us to overload on the two structs s1 and s2 , even though they are the same size .
The second problem is that we need to make sure that we call each overload with the correct type .
We cannot for example call gcc_overload_s1 ( ) with an argument of type struct s2 .
This means that we need to add some type casts to the macro .
Unfortunately , the compiler does n't notice that the " wrong " case is never called , and will emit a warning about breaking aliasing rules .
Unfortunately , silencing this warning via using a union causes incorrect code to be generated on gcc version 4.5
A final problem is that __builtin_types_compatible_p ignores type qualifiers such as const and volatile , making this technique not quite as powerful as C++ function overloads .
A more advanced method that does n't have the aliasing problem is based on the fact that we can use macros to detect the type of the arguments .
We can then pass this extra information to a function that then uses the va_args package to parse them .
This suffers from one small issue .
char and short typed arguments to variable argument C functions are expanded to type int .
Similarly float arguments are converted to double .
Provided you do n't need to determine between these particular types , we can overload on the type of any argument in a C function .
void gcc_type_overload_aux ( int typeval , ... ) { switch ( typeval ) { case 1 : { va_list v ; va_start ( v , typeval ) ; struct s1 s = va_arg ( v , struct s1 ) ; va_end ( v ) ; gcc_overload_s1(s ) ; break ; } case 2 : { va_list v ; va_start ( v , typeval ) ; struct s2 s = va_arg ( v , struct s2 ) ; va_end ( v ) ; gcc_overload_s2(s ) ; break ; } default : { printf ( " Invalid type to ' gcc_type_overload ( ) '
" ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } } } # define gcc_type_overload( A ) \ gcc_type_overload_aux (\ __builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof( A ) , struct s1 ) * 1 \ + __builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof( A ) , struct s2 ) * 2\ , A )
The above constructs an integer based on the type of the argument in the macro , and then uses a switch statement to parse it in the auxiliary function .
Taking the above to an extreme , we show a set of functions and macros that will describe the type and value of up to four arguments to a multiply overloaded function .
void print_ty pe ( int t , va_list * v ) { switch ( t ) { case 1 : { int p = va_arg ( * v , int ) ; printf ( " int :%d
" , p ) ; break ; } case 2 : { long long p = va_arg ( * v , long long ) ; printf ( " long long : %lld
" , p ) ; break ; } case 3 : { double p = va_arg ( * v , double ) ; printf ( " double :%f
" , p ) ; break ; } case 4 : { long double p = va_arg ( * v , long double ) ; printf ( " long double :%Lf
" , p ) ; break ; } default : { printf ( " Unknown type
" ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } } } void param_lister1_aux ( int t1 , ... ) { va_list v ; va_start ( v , t1 ) ; printf ( " 1st param : " ) ; print_type ( t1 , &v ) ; va_end( v ) ; } void param_lister2_aux ( int t1 , ... ) { int t2 ; va_list v ; va_start ( v , t1 ) ; printf ( " 1st param : " ) ; print_ty pe ( t1 , &v ) ; t2 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; printf ( " 2nd param : " ) ; print_type ( t2 , &v ) ; va_end( v ) ; } void param_lister3_aux ( int t1 , ... ) { int t2 , t3 ; va_list v ; va_start ( v , t1 ) ; printf ( " 1st param : " ) ; print_ty pe ( t1 , &v ) ; t2 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; printf ( " 2nd param : " ) ; print_ty pe ( t2 , &v ) ; t3 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; printf ( " 3rd param : " ) ; print_type ( t3 , &v ) ; va_end( v ) ; } void param_lister4_aux ( int t1 , ... ) { int t2 , t3 , t4 ; va_list v ; va_start ( v , t1 ) ; printf ( " 1st param : " ) ; print_ty pe ( t1 , &v ) ; t2 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; printf ( " 2nd param : " ) ; print_ty pe ( t2 , &v ) ; t3 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; printf ( " 3rd param : " ) ; print_ty pe ( t3 , &v ) ; t4 = va_arg ( v , int ) ; printf ( " 4th param : " ) ; print_type ( t4 , &v ) ; va_end( v ) ; } #define TYPENUM ( A ) \ __builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof( A ) , int ) * 1 \ + __builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof( A ) , long long ) * 2 \ + __builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof( A ) , double ) * 3 \ + __builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof( A ) , long double ) * 4 # define param_lister1 ( A ) \ param_lister1_aux ( TYPENUM( A ) , A ) # define param_lister2( A , B ) \ param_lister2_aux ( TYPENUM( A ) , A , TYPENUM ( B ) , B ) # define param_lister3 ( A , B , C ) \ param_lister3_aux ( TYPENUM( A ) , A , TYPENUM( B ) , B , TYPENUM(C ) , C ) # define param_lister4( A , B , C , D ) \ param_lister4_aux ( TYPENUM( A ) , A , TYPENUM( B ) , B , TYPENUM(C ) , C , TYPENUM(D ) , D ) # define param_lister ( ... ) \
CAT ( param_lister , COUNT_PARMS( __VA_ARGS__ ) ) ( __VA_ARGS__ )
Thus , contrary to common knowledge , it is indeed possible to overload functions in C .
Using standard C , the overload possibilities are n't quite as varied as those using gcc intrinsics .
However , it is often extremely useful to overload on the number of function arguments alone .
Type - based overloading with differently sized structs also works well with standard C. Using gcc intrinsics it is possible to obtain nearly the flexibility of C++ overloaded functions .

WiFi calling seems to require fairly robust WiFi signal strength , and as I move around where I live , my iPhone seems programmed to only switch from one airport to another when the existing signal strength is especially low - ( too low for WiFi calling ) , even when another signal is present which is much stronger .
This forces a manual selection .
Is there a way to force iPhone to always pick the strongest WiFi signal or to have a threshold for switching based upon what is required for adequate WiFi calling ?
Has anyone else seen this and have any suggestions for getting it to update again ?

Mr Davis was shadow home secretary and ran for the Tory leadership Plans for fixed - term parliaments that could only be cut short if 55 % of MPs voted to do so are a " serious mistake " , says senior Tory MP David Davis .
The coalition deal would give the power to dissolve Parliament to MPs - but only if a " super majority " backed it .
The ex-shadow home secretary said it could mean a government supported by only 45 % of MPs could not be removed .
Prime Minister David Cameron has pointed out that , in Scotland , 66 % of MSPs must vote to dissolve Parliament .
He argues he is giving up a lot of power by introducing fixed - term parliaments - rather than deciding himself when to go to the Queen to ask for parliament to be dissolved , within a five - year term .
Last week he said any fixed - term parliament required a " mechanism " to deliver it - but the details would be debated by MPs .
' Crippled government '
But Mr Davis , who ran against Mr Cameron for the Conservative leadership in 2005 , said although people had repeatedly referred to Scotland - other countries with fixed - term parliaments required only a " simple majority " of MPs to dissolve parliaments .
" Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , Holland , Sweden all have fixed - term parliaments - they are complicated some of them , but all have a simple majority - none of them have super majority . "
He said in Scotland there was a White Paper , manifestos and a referendum before the change was brought in .
FROM THE WORLD AT ONE Please turn on JavaScript .

More from The World At One He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme : " I think it 's a very serious mistake .
" The consequence in the extreme is you could have a government in parliament which could command 45 % , or 45 % plus one , of Parliamentary votes but no more and therefore could n't deliver a Budget , could n't deliver its manifesto , could n't deliver its normal legislation and yet could n't be thrown out either , because you can't force a dissolution . "
" That is frankly a terrible formula for government , it could end up with a sort of crippled government . "
The existing threshold for a no -confidence vote of 50 % of MPs plus one will remain the same .
' Large number '
But while at present , if a government loses a confidence motion the usual practice would be for the PM to ask the Queen to dissolve parliament - with a fixed - term parliament he or she would no longer have the power to do so .
Instead 55 % of MPs would have to vote to do so .
The threshold would currently stop the Conservatives alone engineering a no-confidence vote - or the Lib Dems walking out on the coalition and siding with opposition MPs to force one .
This wo n't stop
MPs being able to bring down an unpopular government , just as they can now

Cameron defends rule change plan Q&A : The 55 % rule
He denied he was annoyed about not getting a job in the new coalition government and said he had " deliberately not talked to people " because he did not want to create problems for them .
But he said he thought " a very large number " of Conservative MPs were worried about the plans .
He said the issue was central to Parliament 's ability to dismiss failing governments , adding : " We can dismiss failing MPs now , but ironically , MPs can't dismiss failing governments . "
But Professor Gavin Phillipson , who teaches constitutional law at Durham University said a prime minister who lost a confidence motion would still have to resign .
" This wo n't stop MPs being able to bring down an unpopular government , just as they can now . "
The 55 % threshold was about a separate issue - when Parliament can be dissolved early , he said .
Currently , losing a confidence motion tended to lead to the prime minister asking the Queen to dissolve Parliament , triggering a general election .
But he said : " Under the proposed change , parliament would remain sitting and the political parties would have to see if they were able to form a new government - either a minority administration supported by a ' confidence and supply ' agreement or a new coalition with a new prime minister .
" The idea behind the 55 % rule is to make sure that one party on its own can't trigger a fresh general election . "

Among the numerous spoofs of the campaign , one of the more outrageous recreates the picnic scene with a man in drag playing the syrup - loving mom , though this time she is also defending lead from China , female genital mutilation ( “ It ’s safe in moderation ” ) and K.K.K. cross-burning .
Two Los Angeles comedians created the video , which has been watched more than 150,000 times .

Ms. Erickson says she has heard of the spoofs but has not bothered to watch most of them .
“ We ’re really focused on trying to correct the record since a lot of the information consumers have is incorrect , ” she says .
“ High - fructose corn syrup is a case of mistaken identity . ”
Although it has n’t done much good yet , Ms. Erickson continues to point out that science does not support the demonization of the product .
One of her favorite documents is a two - page list of quotations defending the syrup , which she has culled from various media sources .
Many are attributed to people like Ms. Nestle , who spend much more time criticizing the food industry than defending it .
On the list there ’s Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest ; David S. Ludwig , director of the Optimal Weight for Life Clinic at Children ’s Hospital Boston ; Walter Willett from the Harvard School of Public Health ; and even Barry Popkin , a nutrition professor at the University of North Carolina and a co-author of that 2004 obesity paper .
Recent studies “ have convinced me that H.F.C.S. does not affect weight gain , ” he told The Los Angeles Times in July 2008 .
And as for those mercury studies that spread like wildfire last year , Ms. Erickson says that there is no reason to believe that the mercury detected in various foods was coming from high - fructose corn syrup .
In a further attempt to improve its image , the Corn Refiners Association has petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to allow a name change to the simpler , less - chemical -y “ corn syrup . ”
In January , the F.D.A. issued a letter to the Corn Refiners giving its thumbs - up to the name change .
But after an objection from the Corn Refiners ’ rival , the Sugar Association , F.D.A. officials sent another letter saying that they needed to give the matter further thought .
The Lowdown on High Fructose Corn Syrup and Agave “ Nectar ”
High fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) entered the market place in the early 1970s and within twenty years , accounted for over half the refined sweeteners used in the U.S. food supply .
Produced mainly by the two food processing giants , Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill , it is the main sweetener in soft drinks and is increasingly replacing sugar in baked goods , bread , cereals , canned fruits , jams and jellies , dairy desserts and flavored yoghurts .
Sweeter and less expensive than sugar , HFCS represents the major change in the American diet over the last forty years .
Although the food industry made this change very quietly , consumers are beginning to ask a lot of loud questions about the new sweetener as research accumulates to indicate that it is much worse for us than we thought .
Although the corn industry claims that HFCS received GRAS ( Generally Recognized as Safe ) status when it filed for it in 1983 , the FDA did not grant GRAS status until 1996 after considerable pressure from the industry , which was becoming nervous with the publication of negative research findings described in the first anti-HFCS articles .
1
Growing consumer resistance to HFCS is the likely explanation for a recent industry campaign to put the new sweetener in a favorable light .
Ads run on television and in popular magazines portray HFCS as benign and its critics as bossy , overbearing , unqualified and misinformed .
For example , a full - page ad in Better Homes and Gardens portrays two attractive women engaged in the following conversation : “ My dry cleaner says high fructose corn syrup is loaded with calories . ”
The reply : “ A registered dietitian presses your shirts ? ”
Then comes the official statement : “ There ’s a lot of misinformation out there about sugars made from corn .
Truth is , high fructose corn syrup is nutritionally the same as table sugar .
The same number of calories too .
As registered dietitians recommend , keep enjoying the foods you love , just do it in moderation .
We welcome a healthy discussion .
Get the facts .
You ’re in for a sweet surprise .
www.SweetSurprise.com.”2
On the surface , the official statement is true .
Both HFCS and sugar have approximately the same number of calories , both are pure carbohydrate and both are virtually devoid of vitamins and minerals .
For this reason alone , HFCS should be strictly avoided .
Since refined carbohydrates , sugar and HFCS included , tend to be addictive , it is difficult to follow the platitudinous advice of registered dietitians who urge us to consume them in moderation .
In fact , the entire food industry has succeeded very well over the past thirty years in getting Americans to consume far more than moderate amounts of refined sweeteners , particularly high fructose corn syrup .
Between 1970 and 2000 , the per capita consumption of HFCS in the U.S. increased from less than one pound per person to over sixty pounds yearly .
3
There can be no debate about the fact that both sugar and HFCS , with their empty , depleting , addictive calories , are bad for you .
But the real question is whether HFCS is actually worse for you — more depleting and more damaging — than ordinary sugar .
The research indicates that it is .
The Obesity Debate
The public became aware of the possible downside of HFCS with the publication of a 2004 paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
4
Authors Bray and others noted the parallel increase in obesity and HFCS consumption in the U.S. , and a number of columnists publicized his theory that , calorie for calorie , HFCS is more likely to cause weight gain than sugar .
The Bray paper provides an explanation for the mechanism whereby fructose would be more fattening .
Sugar is a disaccharide that breaks down into two monosaccharides — glucose and fructose — in the intestinal tract .
After absorption , fructose must pass through the liver .
Small amounts of fructose added to glucose in the diet increase the production of glycogen ( stored sugar ) and reduce the release of glucose into the bloodstream , an outcome that is theoretically helpful to those suffering from type 2 diabetes .
However , large amounts of fructose in the diet rapidly turn into fatty acids — a process called “ de novo lipogenesis ” — which are then stored as fat or released into the bloodstream as triglycerides .
Small amounts of D - fructose — the type of fructose that human beings have traditionally consumed in fruit — can actually be beneficial to diabetics because L - fructose does not stimulate insulin secretion .
However , research indicates that insulin concentrations in the central nervous system have a direct inhibitory effect on food intake — when insulin secretions increase , food consumption declines .
Furthermore , insulin increases release of leptin , a hormone that also inhibits food intake .
Individuals who are genetically unable to produce leptin are massively obese ; low leptin concentrations are associated with increased hunger and gains in body fat .
Thus , to the extent that fructose inhibits insulin and leptin levels , one would expect an increase in food intake in a diet that includes HFCS .
Bray cites a 2002 study by Teff and others , published in Diabetes , in which consumption of high - fructose meals reduced 24 - hour plasma insulin and leptin concentrations and increased triglyceride levels in women . 5
( Although published in a major medical journal , this study does not appear in a Medline search . )
According to Bray : “ Because insulin and leptin act as key afferent signals in the regulation of food intake and body weight , this suggests that dietary fructose may contribute to increased energy intake and weight gain . ”
6
There is another difference between fructose and glucose metabolism .
Glucose enters the cells through the action of insulin ; fructose enters the cells through the action of something called Glut - 5 transporter , which does not depend on insulin .
This transporter is absent from pancreatic B - cells and the brain , which indicates limited entry of fructose into these tissues .
Glucose provides “ satiety ” signals to the brain , which fructose cannot provide because it is not transported into the brain .
Once inside the cells , fructose facilitates the formation of triglycerides more efficiently than does glucose .
Bray references a study by Bantle and others in which a diet containing 17 percent fructose ( very typical of today ’s consumer ) , caused a highly significant increase of 32 percent triglyceride levels in the blood in male subjects , although not in female subjects .
7
Bray also discusses the fact that sweetened beverages in general , as compared to sweeteners added to solid foods , have a greater tendency to cause weight gain , citing a randomized , double - blind European study by Rabin and others , which found that drinking calorically sweetened beverages resulted in greater weight gain over the ten - week study than did drinking diet drinks .
8
Since the beverages in this study were sweetened with sucrose , Bray called for a second randomized controlled study to compare sucrose - and HFCS - sweetened beverages .
Industry Response
But instead of support for such a study , the industry has responded with a wallop of damage control in the form of a report by the Center for Food , Nutrition and Agriculture Policy .9
The study was supported by a gift from British sweetener company , Tate & Lyle , Inc .
The magnitude of deleterious effects from fructose varies depending on such factors as age , sex , baseline glucose , insulin levels , triglyceride concentrations , the presence of insulin resistance , and the amount of dietary fructose consumed .
10 Some people are more sensitive to fructose than others .
They include hypertensive , hyperinsulinemic , hypertriglyceridemic , non-insulin dependent diabetics , those with functional bowel disease and postmenopausal women .
11
The expert panel was able to confuse the issue by citing studies carried out with individuals known to be less sensitive to fructose .
Conspicuously absent in their review were the Teff , Bantle and Rabin studies cited by Bray .
The report dismisses both the epidemiological correlation and the large amount of research showing that HFCS is metabolized differently from sucrose .
It also dismisses the fact that U.S. fructose consumption has increased over 30 percent since 1970 , claiming instead that the fructose : glucose ratio ( F:G ) in the U.S. food supply has not appreciably changed since the introduction of HFCS in the 1960s — an amazing claim given the fact that the HFCS in sodas has a F:G ratio of 55:45 , and the HFCS used in diet foods has a F:G ratio of 90:10 .
While admitting that “ studies analyzing the differences between HFCS and sucrose consumption and their contributions to weight gain do not exist , ” the authors do not join Bray in calling for such a study .
Instead , they conclude that HFCS “ does not appear to contribute to overweight and obesity any differently than do other energy sources . ”
The Big Dirty Secret About HFCS
Many researchers have pointed out that the fructose in HFCS is free , unbound fructose ; it is not the same as the fructose in fruit , which is bound to other sugars and is part of a complex that includes fiber , fatty acids , vitamins and minerals .
Leaving this obvious difference aside , the industry would have the public believe that the fructose in fruit and in HFCS are chemically identical .
However , in the chemical processing of high fructose corn syrup , the polarity of the molecule is flipped ; the fructose in HFCS is not the same isomer as that of fructose in fruit .
Moreover , in nature , fructose occurs as di and olgio saccharides , not free fructose , and this fructose sugar comes as a complex with vitamins , minerals , antioxidants , pectin and fiber whereas enzymatically produced fructose does not .
As explained by Russ Bianchi , Managing Director and CEO of Adept Solutions , Inc. , a globally recognized food and beverage development company , the fructose in HFCS is therefore not recognized in the human Krebs cycle for primary conversion to blood glucose in any significant quantity , and therefore cannot be used for energy utilization .
13 Instead , these refined fructose sweeteners are primarily converted into triglycerides and adipose tissue ( body fat ) .
In fact , a new study , published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism , found that obese people who drank a fructose - sweetened beverage with a meal had triglyceride levels almost 200 percent higher than obese people who drank a glucose - sweetened beverage with a meal .
14
Chronic high triglycerides translate into increased insulin resistance , inflammation and heart disease .
Thus , according to Bianchi , HFCS is a recipe for obesity , lack of energy and metabolic syndrome — the very portrait of the modern American addicted to a diet of HFCS - sweetened sodas .
Agave “ Nectar ” to the Rescue
As the educated public has shied away from foods containing HFCS , the industry has brought a new sweetener on the scene , one used especially in foods aimed at the health - conscious consumer : agave “ nectar . ”
Agave nectar is advertised as a “ diabetic friendly , ” raw , and “ 100 % natural sweetener . ”
Yet it is none of these .
Agave nectar is found on the shelves of health food stores primarily under the labels , “ Agave Nectar 100 % Natural Sweetener , ” and “ Organic Raw Blue Agave Nectar . ”
In addition , it can be found in foods labeled as organic or raw , including ketchup , ice cream , chocolate and health food bars .
The implication of its name , along with the pictures and descriptions on the product labels , create the impression that agave is an unrefined sweetener that has been used for thousands of years by native people in central Mexico .
“ For thousands of years natives to central Mexico used different species of agave plants for medicine , as well as for building shelter . ”
Thus reads the copy on an agave package .
And it is true that natives would allow the sweet sap or liquid of one species of agave to ferment naturally , which created a mildly alcoholic beverage with a very pungent flavor known as pulque .
They also made a traditional sweetener from the agave sap or juice called miel de agave by simply boiling it for several hours .
But , as one agave seller explains , the agave nectar purchased in stores is neither of these traditional foods :
“ Agave nectar is a newly created sweetener , having been developed during the 1990’s .
” 33
The Big Dirty Secret About Agave
In spite of manufacturers ’ claims , agave “ nectar ” is not made from the sap of the yucca or agave plant but from the starch of the giant pineapple - like root bulb .
The principal constituent of the agave root is starch , similar to the starch in corn or rice , and a complex carbohydrate called inulin , which is made up of chains of fructose molecules .
Technically a highly indigestible fiber , inulin , which does not taste sweet , comprises about half of the carbohydrate content of agave .
34
The process by which agave glucose and inulin are converted into “ nectar ” is similar to the process by which corn starch is converted into HFCS.35
The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose - rich syrup — anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites .
36 ( One agave manufacturer claims that his product is made with “ natural ” enzymes . )
That ’s right , the refined fructose in agave nectar is much more concentrated than the fructose in HFCS .
For comparison , the high fructose corn syrup used in sodas is 55 percent refined fructose .
( A natural agave product does exist in Mexico , a molasses type of syrup from concentrated plant nectar , but availability is limited and it is expensive to produce . )
According to Bianchi , agave “ nectar ” and HFCS “ are indeed made the same way , using a highly chemical process dependent on genetically modified enzymes ” .
The manufacturing process also calls for caustic acids , clarifiers , filtration chemicals and so forth in the conversion of agave starches .
The result is a high level of highly refined fructose in the remaining syrup , along with some remaining inulin .
In a confidential FDA letter , Dr. Martin Stutsman of the Food and Drug Administration ’s Office of Labeling Enforcement , explains the FDA ’s food labeling laws related to agave nectar : “ Corn syrup treated with enzymes to enhance the fructose levels is to be labeled ‘ High Fructose Corn Syrup . ’ ”
According to Mr. Stutsman , agave requires the label “ hydrolyzed inulin syrup .
” 37
Even though , like corn , agave is a starch and fiber food processed with enzymes , it does not require the label “ High Fructose Agave Syrup . ”
Agave “ nectar ” is a misnomer ; at the very least , it should be labeled “ agave syrup . ”
Agave syrup comes in two colors : clear or light , and amber .
What is this difference ?
Mr. Bianchi explains : “ Due to poor quality control in the agave processing plants in Mexico , sometimes the fructose gets burned after heat treatment above 140 degrees Fahrenheit , thus creating a darker , or amber color . ”
However , the labels create the impression of an artisan product — like light or amber beer .
As consumers are learning about problems with agave syrup , the label “ chicory syrup ” is beginning to appear as a non-conforming word for the product .
Consumer beware !
The Saponin Problem
Yucca species are known to contain large quantities of saponins .
The industry describes saponins in agave syrup as beneficial : “ Agave ’s rich density of saponins increases hydration as the soapy , surfactant nature of saponins change the wetting angle of water it contacts .
This eases and accelerates cellular water uptake , especially when used with a high - quality salt .
”
38
However , the truth is that the saponins found in many varieties of agave plants are toxic steroid derivatives , capable of disrupting red blood cells and producing diarrhea and vomiting ,39 to be avoided during pregnancy because they might cause or contribute to miscarriage by stimulating blood flow to the uterus .
40
At the very least , agave products should carry a warning label indicating that the product may cause a miscarriage .
Just Say No to Agave
Since the FDA makes no effort to enforce food - labeling laws , consumers cannot be certain that what they are eating is what the label says it is .
New sweeteners like agave syrup were introduced into the market to make a profit , not to make consumers healthy .
Clever marketing has led many consumers to believe that the high level of fructose in agave syrup makes it a safe and a natural sweetener .
Agave syrup labels do not conform to FDA labeling requirements , thus deepening the illusion of an unprocessed product .
As we have demonstrated here , if a sweetener contains manufactured fructose , it is neither safe nor natural , especially at levels up to 70 percent .
Agave syrup is a manmade sweetener which has been through a complicated chemical refining process of enzymatic digestion , which converts the starch and fiber into the unbound , manmade chemical fructose .
While high fructose agave syrup wo n’t spike your blood glucose levels , the fructose in it may cause mineral depletion , liver inflammation , hardening of the arteries , insulin resistance leading to diabetes , high blood pressure , cardiovascular disease and obesity .
If you want something sweet , eat a piece of fruit , not a candy bar labeled as a “ health food . ”
If you want to create something sweet , use sweeteners known to be safer .
For uncooked dishes , unheated raw honey or dates work well .
For cooked dishes or sweet drinks , a good organic maple syrup , or even freshly juiced apple juice or orange juice can provide delicious and relatively safe sweetness ; dehydrated cane sugar juice or maple sugar may be used in moderation in cookies and desserts that contain nutritious ingredients and good fats such as butter , egg yolks and nuts .
However , to be healthy , we can not eat sugar all day , no matter how natural the form .
One should limit total sweetener consumption to less than five percent of daily calories .
For a diet of 2500 calories per day , that ’s less than three tablespoons of honey , maple syrup or dehydrated cane sugar juice , or several pieces of fruit .
And many people do best by avoiding sweeteners completely .
The lack of standards in the health food world comes as depressing news ; but let this news encourage you to consume more pure and unrefined foods and sweeteners .
Good health depends on wise food choices , and wise food choices depend on constant vigilance .
SIDEBARS
How Corn Sweeteners Are Made
Called “ one of the greatest achievements in the sugar industry , ” the development of the various types of corn syrups , maltodextrins and high - fructose corn syrup from corn starch sources , represents the pinnacle of food processing .
Corn starch can be hydrolyzed into glucose relatively easily , but it was not until the 1970s that it became a major commercial product , bringing about major changes in the food industry .
Corn starch is processed and refined from the kernels of corn by using a series of steeping ( swelling the kernel ) , separation and grinding processes to separate the starch from the other parts of the kernel ( which are used for animal feed . ) .
The starch is hydrolyzed using acid , acid - enzyme , or enzyme - enzyme catalyzed processes .
The first enzyme is generally a thermally stable alpha amylase which produces about 10 - 20 percent glucose .
Further treatment with the enzyme glucoamylase yields 93 - 96 percent glucose .
The final corn syrup ( glucose syrup ) products include dried corn syrup , maltodextrin and dextrose ( glucose ) .
With the development of glucoamylase in the 1940s and 1950s , it became a straightforward matter to produce concentrated glucose syrups ( corn syrup ) .
However , these have shortcomings in the sweetener industry .
D - glucose has only about 70 percent of the sweetness of sucrose , on a weight basis , and is comparatively insoluble .
Fructose is 30 percent sweeter than sucrose , on a weight basis , and twice as soluble as glucose at low temperatures , so a 50 percent conversion of glucose to fructose overcomes both problems , giving a stable syrup that is as sweet as a sucrose solution of the same concentration .
According to food industry literature , one of the “ triumphs ” of enzyme technology so far has been the development of glucose isomerase , which in turn led to the commercialization of high fructose corn syrups .
Several types of bacteria can produce such glucose isomerases .
The enzymes are resistant to thermal denaturation and will act at very high substrate concentrations , which means that they are stable at higher operational temperatures and can be used over and over during processing .
This is key to the production of an inexpensive substitute for sugar .
Glucose isomerases convert the glucose in corn syrup into fructose , resulting in high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
HFCS comes in three different formulations .
Forty - two percent fructose corn syrup is used mostly in processed foods like pastries , cookies and ketchup .
However , soft drink manufacturers requested a higher - fructose blend , one containing 55 percent fructose .
This is produced by using vast chromatographic columns of zeolites or the calcium salts of cation exchange resins to absorb and separate the fructose from the other components .
A very sweet 90 percent high fructose corn syrup is used as a sweetener in low - calorie “ diet ” products .

A Return to Sugar ?
A recent Wall Street Journal article ( January 11 , 2006 ) reports that many outfits are importing Coca - Cola from Mexico into the U.S. , not because Mexican Coke is cheaper ( it ’s actually more expensive ) , but because in Mexico it is made with sugar , which many consumers prefer .
By one estimate , such imports have eroded up to 25 percent of total U.S. sales .
Pepsi and Coke are testing demand with Kosher - for - Passover versions of the soft drinks containing sugar rather than HFCS .
( Corn is one of the grains forbidden at Passover . )
According to one report , Pepsi and Mountain Dew will test consumer preferences with sodas made from sugar for a limited time starting in April , and Snapple has made a permanent switch from HFCS to sugar ( webstv.com , February 23 , 2009 ) .
Mercury in HFCS
Almost half of tested samples of commercial high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) contains mercury , which was also found in nearly a third of 55 popular brand - name food and beverage products where HFCS is the first - or second - highest labeled ingredient , according to two new U.S. studies .
In the first study , published in Environmental Health , researchers found detectable levels of mercury in nine of twenty samples of commercial HFCS .
And in the second study , the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy ( IATP ) , a non-profit watchdog group , found that nearly one in three of fifty - five brand - name foods contained mercury .
The chemical was found most commonly in HFCS - containing dairy products , dressings and condiments .
“ Mercury is toxic in all its forms .
Given how much high - fructose corn syrup is consumed by children , it could be a significant additional source of mercury never before considered .
We are calling for immediate changes by industry and the [ U.S. Food and Drug Administration ] to help stop this avoidable mercury contamination of the food supply , ” said Dr. David Wallinga , a co-author of both studies .
The most likely source of the mercury is mercury - containing caustic soda , used in the production of HFCS .
“ This study appears to be based on outdated information of dubious significance , ” said Audrae Erickson , president of the Corn Refiners Association , in a statement .
“ Our industry has used mercury - free versions of the two re-agents mentioned in the study , hydrochloric acid and caustic soda , for several years . ”
However , the IATP told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that four plants in Georgia , Tennessee , Ohio and West Virginia still use “ mercury - cell ” technology that can lead to contamination .
“ The bad news is that nobody knows whether or not their soda or snack food contains HFCS made from ingredients like caustic soda contaminated with mercury .
The good news is that mercury - free HFCS ingredients exist .
Food companies just need a good push to only use those ingredients , ” Wallinga said in his prepared statement ( Washington Post , January 28 , 2009 ) .
The industry response : “ The article ’s authors and IATP engage in unfounded claims and speculations based on scant data of questionable quality .
High fructose corn syrup is safe for use in foods and beverages .
To imply that there is a safety concern based on this incomplete and flawed report is irresponsible ” ( www.sweetsurprise.com).
Other Concerns About HFCS
Research indicates that free refined fructose interferes with the heart ’s use of key minerals , like magnesium , copper and chromium .
In humans , fructose feeding leads to mineral losses , especially higher fecal excretions of iron and magnesium , than do subjects fed sucrose .
Iron , magnesium , calcium , and zinc balances tended to be more negative during the fructose - feeding period as compared to balances during the sucrose - feeding period .
15
Because fructose competes with glucose and galactose for absorption , excess fructose can be carried to the lower intestine where it provides nutrients for the existing gut flora , which produce gas .
It may also cause water retention in the intestine .
These effects may lead to bloating , excessive flatulence , loose stools , and even diarrhea depending on the amounts eaten and other factors .
16
All the fructose must be metabolized in the liver .
The livers of test animals fed large amounts of fructose develop fatty deposits and cirrhosis , similar to problems that develop in the livers of alcoholics .
17 Excessive fructose consumption is also believed to contribute to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .
18
Excessive fructose consumption is also believed to contribute to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .
Fructose is a reducing sugar , as are all monosaccharides .
The spontaneous chemical reaction of simple sugar molecules to proteins , known as glycation , is thought to be a significant cause of damage in diabetics and an important contribution to senescence and many age - related chronic diseases .
19
In one study , glycated products were significantly higher in fructose - fed rats compared with the other sugar - fed and control rats .
20
In one study , glycated products were significantly higher in fructose - fed rats compared with the other sugar - fed and control rats .
Although the body does not require insulin to assimilate fructose , some studies indicate impaired insulin action in the liver and peripheral tissues after longterm feeding .
Fructose reduces the affinity of insulin for its receptor , which is the hallmark of type - 2 diabetes .
This is the first step for glucose to enter a cell .
As a result , the body needs to pump out more insulin to handle the same amount of glucose .
21
Fructose ingestion acutely elevates blood pressure in healthy young humans .
22
Fructose consumption leads to more lactic acid formation compared to glucose .
Extreme elevations cause metabolic acidosis , even leading to death .
23
A number of studies report elevations in plasma uric acid after dietary consumption of fructose , especially in patients with high blood pressure .
24 Elevated uric acid may be a risk factor in coronary disease .
This may explain the findings of a recent study published in British Medical Journal linking fructose to gout .
25 Cases of gout have risen in recent years , despite the fact that gout is commonly considered a Victorian disease .
The suspect is fructose found in soft drinks and other sweetened drinks .

Studies on the Maillard reaction indicate that fructose may contribute to diabetic complications more readily than glucose .
The Maillard reaction is a browning reaction that occurs when compounds are exposed to various sugars .
Fructose browns food seven times faster than glucose , resulting in a decrease in protein quality and a toxicity of protein in the body .
27 This is due to the loss of amino acid residues and decreased protein digestibility .
Maillard products can inhibit the uptake and metabolism of free amino acids and other nutrients such as zinc , and some advanced Maillard products have mutagenic and / or carcinogenic properties .
The Maillard reactions between proteins and fructose , glucose , and other sugars may play a role in aging and in some clinical complications of diabetes .

In studies with rats , fructose consistently produces higher kidney calcium concentrations than glucose .
Fructose generally induces greater urinary concentrations of phosphorus and magnesium and lowered urinary pH compared with glucose .
29
There is significant evidence that high - sucrose diets may alter intracellular metabolism , which in turn facilitates accelerated aging through oxidative damage .
Scientists found that the rats given fructose had more undesirable cross-linking changes in the collagen of their skin than in the other groups .
These changes are also thought to be markers for aging .
The scientists say that it is the fructose molecule in the sucrose , not the glucose , that plays the larger part .
30
Researchers found that rats fed a high - calorie diet supplemented with high - fructose corn syrup for eight months exhibited impaired spatial learning ability and reduced function of the hippocampus , thus impairing cognitive function .
31
Fructose intake is associated with small LDL particle size in overweight schoolchildren .
Small LDL is associated with higher rates of heart disease .

Bees on HFCS
According to USDA , approximately 420 million pounds of honey is produced each year for human consumption in North America .
Most people believe that honey is produced throughout the year .
However , true natural honey , whether USDA - certified or not , in various grades , is only produced in the mid spring to late summer , when the biological materials are readily available for bees to digest , convert and regurgitate .
So how is honey production in many regions maintained continuously into the fall and early in the spring , when the sources for conversion do not exist ?
The answer is the widespread practice of feeding bees refined sucrose or refined crystallized or liquid HFCS during the months when pollen and nectar are not available .
The bees then run the sweetener through their digestive tracts .
The resulting product is labeled as honey but it may not have the same quality as natural honey .
Millions of beehives worldwide have emptied out as honey bees mysteriously disappear , putting at risk nearly a hundred crops that require pollination .
One explanation is the toxic effect of HFCS on the bees , in addition to the stress of additional months of honey production , leading to reduced immunity and eventually to mite infestation .
The Agave Industry
In the year 2000 , with warrants in hand , federal agents from the Office of Criminal Investigations of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) came banging on the door of North America ’s largest agave nectar distributor , Western Commerce Corporation in California .
In an extremely rare case of the FDA protecting consumer interests ( rather than supporting big business , while shutting down legitimate and health consciousness competition ) , they discovered that Western Commerce Corporation was adulterating their agave syrup with high fructose corn syrup ( to lower the cost even more and increase profit margins ) .
While the federal agents confiscated material in the warehouse , the owners of Western Commerce Corporation were nowhere to be found .
Those who ran the company fled the country with millions of dollars in assets to avoid criminal prosecution .
This adulterated agave syrup ( refined fructose ) was also labeled as certified organic to fool consumers into thinking they were getting a pure product .
This shows you how unverified organic labels are used in the USA .
Today , high fructose agave syrup is made primarily by two companies : Nekutli , and IIDEA .
A third agave marketer , by the name of Volcanic , has a suspicious claim on their website .
“ If your agave comes from one of the other two companies in Mexico , something has been added . ”
They are referring to Nekutli and IIDEA .
Their claim is based upon an analysis , which they say shows that Volcanic ’s agave nectar has a lower level of refined fructose .
After Western Commerce Corporation was shut down , the large retail establishments in the food industry stayed away from agave syrups .
They knew better than to risk lawsuits and consumer fraud .
“ They understood that agave was criminally mislabeled per the U.S. Code of Federal Regulation labeling laws , with an untried sweetener , new to the market , that contained saponins , and was not clearly approved as safe for use , ” explains Mr. Bianchi .
For many years following this bust , the supermarket and health food store industry avoided using agave .
But recently , some sellers in the agave syrup field , once quiet , have begun sneaking back into the food and beverage chains .
And retail food giants like Whole Foods , Wegman ’s , Trader Joe ’s and Kroger , who should know better , and who should know the food labeling laws and requirements , still have no hesitation in selling the toxic , unapproved and mislabeled refined fructose agave syrup , as well as products containing it .

The Snack Bar Business
A good example of the recent shift in consumer awareness about food ingredients is found in the category of snack , diet , functional and energy bars .
In 1989 , in the USA and Canada , the total granola , breakfast , snack and energy bar market was less than $ 60 million yearly , with twelve major brands .
In 2004 , according to several industry sources , the market share was approximately $ 3.2 billion with twenty - five major brands .
During this period , the major multinationals acquired many of the smaller brands , and when they did so , often switched to cheaper ingredients such as HFCS .
We have clear economic evidence that consumers are reading ingredient labels and avoiding refined sweetener intake , because the bar sector that has used more natural sweeteners has taken almost 100 percent of its market share from those made with refined sweeteners .
The successful bar brands avoid polyols ( like malitol and xylitol ) , glycerin , HFCS , maltodextrin and refined sucrose .
Multinationals that failed to heed the lesson on why these brands were successful have lost market share to those that do understand this fact .
The days of confusing or tricking the consumer are waning .
A similar economic shift has occurred in the European Union ( EU ) over genetically modified organisms , and to a lesser extent organic ingredient sourcing .
American suppliers lost hundreds of millions of dollars in market share , virtually overnight , to suppliers who had foreseen the fact that authentic GMO - free raw material sources were not merely requested by consumers , but demanded .
The refined sweetener category is equally problematic in the EU , as elsewhere , because consumers are increasingly likely to read ingredient labels .
Many major brands on American supermarket shelves in the early 1990s have been acquired or have disappeared , because their labels looked like chemistry catalogs .
Consumers are waking up to phony and illegal avoidance labeling , often found in the American natural health food sector , with such fanciful labels as hydrolyzed protein to avoid the term “ MSG , ” “ evaporated cane juice ” to avoid the term “ sugar , ” and “ agave syrup ” or “ chicory syrup ” for hydrolyzed high fructose inulin syrup .

Paleoconservative Republican Congressman John J. Duncan , Jr. has called for the abolition of the Air Marshal Service , arguing that more air marshals have been arrested since 9/11 ( for crimes like smuggling explosives , domestic violence , drunk driving and human trafficking ) than the number of people arrested by the marshals .
The $ 860 million spent on the service amounts to about 4.2 arrests per year , at a cost of $ 200 million per arrest .
Professor Ian Lustick of the University of Pennsylvania wrote last year about the money feeding frenzy of the war on terror .
And he wrote this : " Nearly 7 years after September 11 , 2001 , " he wrote this last year , " what accounts for the vast discrepancy between the terrorist threat facing America and the scale of our response ?
Why , absent any evidence of a serious terror threat , is a war to on terror so enormous , so all - encompassing , and still expanding ?
The fundamental answer is that al Qaeda 's most important accomplishment was not to hijack our planes but to hijack our political system . "
" For a multitude of politicians , interest groups and professional associations , corporations , media organizations , universities , local and State governments and Federal agency officials , the war on terror is now a major profit center , a funding bonanza , and a set of slogans and sound bites to be inserted into budget , grant , and contract proposals . "
When it comes to buying a home or renting , there are many things to consider .
While there are tons of resources on the financial implications of both options , I ’d like to share my thoughts on buying versus renting from an intentional living and minimalist perspective .
The decision to buy or rent is just as much a lifestyle decision as it is a financial one .
Ultimately , if the decision to buy is made , a home affordability calculator is a great resource to get started .
Longevity and Flexibility
It ’s important to consider how long you ’re planning to be in a certain area and how much location flexibility you need when you ’re making the decision to buy or rent .
When renting , the leases are typically 12 months or less and there may be options to work out a more flexible move - out date with the landlord or management company .
If you end up needing to move to a different area , you have more flexibility to do so .
It becomes a lot more complicated if you need to move away from a home you own .
You ’ll likely need to sell the house or rent it out — options that require more time and resources than if you were renting an apartment .
With the amount of investment and time that a house requires , it ’s probably best to stay in a location for at least a few years if you ’re going to buy .
Personal Values
Think about how you want to spend your time .
Similarly , it ’s also important to consider how much responsibility you ’re willing to take on .
During the time I lived in an apartment , I barely changed a light bulb .
There were no repairs , no additional investment and no worries .
For the past five years I ’ve owned a home , it ’s a whole different experience .
I spend time cleaning the gutters , mowing the lawn , buying and fixing appliances and other maintenance activities that you never have to think about when you ’re renting .
Regular or unexpected repairs can quickly add up to large sums when you own a home .
Part of the benefit of renting is that you do n’t have to deal with or budget for anything like that .
Customization
Another thing to think about is how much customization and control you ’d like to have .
A home you own can be customized to your exact liking , a rental on the other hand has more limitations .
From painting the wall a different color to making bigger changes to your living space , you ’ll have greater control if it ’s your home .
With a rental , any customizations would need to be approved by the owner .
Amenities
Amenities are another lifestyle consideration when it comes to buying or renting .
Most likely , an apartment will have more amenities than a typical home , such as a workout room , pool , large party room or even a concierge service .
Of course , you may have the option of building or adding similar amenities to a home you buy , but it can be pricey and impractical investment .
If you want a pool without the cost and maintenance that owning one would require , then renting an apartment with a community pool is the way to go .
From my perspective , whether you buy or rent has a significant impact on your lifestyle , particularly over the long - term .
Thinking about what ’s important to you and how you want to spend your time will help you determine what best fits your desired lifestyle .

Close - Up Footage Of Flotilla Passengers Attacking Israeli Soldiers
IDF : Video taken by IDF naval boat shows the passengers of the Mavi Marmara , one of the ships in the ‘ Free Gaza ’ Flotilla , violently attacking IDF soldiers who were trying to board the ship after having sent repeated requests for the boat to change course .
Large groups of passengers surrounded soldiers and beat them with metal poles and chairs , and threw one soldier over the side of the ship .
Some passengers grabbed pistols from the IDF soldiers and opened fire .
As a result of the attacks , seven IDF soldiers were injured , and nine of the passengers were killed .
The ‘ Free Gaza ’ Flotilla had publicly insisted on their non-violent intentions , however their violent attack on the IDF soldiers was clearly premeditated .
They had knives , metal rods , firebombs and other items ready to use .
A man in Medinah , Illinois was recently arrested by police after wiping his rear end with a parking ticket and stuffing it into a city payment box .

Other than the zergling I 'm with everyone else in saying this is some really badass art he 's doing .
If I were working at Blizzard I would seriously fire the art department and set this guy in place of it . ♞

An Ecology of Consciousness
An E-mail Trialogue Between William Irwin Thompson , David Spangler and Pir Zia Inayat - Khan , Autumn 2009
William Irwin Thompson , David Spangler , and Pir Zia Inayat - Khan

WILLIAM IRWIN THOMPSON
My Dear Pir Zia ,
My use of the word " daimon " comes out of its use in the Western esoteric tradition in Plato and Yeats .
I understand it to mean the part of the soul that is too vast to squeeze into a human body in the process of incarnation , and so it is experienced as an accompanying spirit , or spiritual guide .
I have read that the Persians call this " daena . "
Is this true ?
Here is a new poem about all this .
It is sort of a continuation of the contemplative cycle STILL TRAVELS I read at the Abode .
In my limited experience , the process of initiation is a " matching grant " in which each of the five sheaths in the Yogic system links with an accompanying spirit .
The etheric body ( pranamayakosa ) receives an accompanying Elemental or Primordial Spirit , the astral body ( manomayakosa ) receives an angel or contrasexual Tara - like figure ( to be syncretic ) , the mental body ( vijnanamayakosa ) makes conscious contact with the Daimon , and the ( anatamayakosa ) makes conscious contact with the Christ , and then on to the Holy Spirit and the unutterable God the Father or " the One . "
A Dialogue of Self and Daimon
Self :
Now that the angel has shifted from me to you ,
what use is there for me in your alaya store ?
Why did you advance my time and take death over ?
Why should you wait until I 'm some senile duffer ,
or is there something you still can be hoping for ?
Daimon :
Even if you were to get your ego out of my way --
and you 've only begun to get the feel of that ,
your end is the most important part of the play ,
for how you die marks the trail like the cougar 's scat .
Self : For a Daimon , that 's really some earthy image .
Next you will be talking of football and scrimmage ?
Daimon : I owe it all to you and our hikes in Crestone ,
when I kept that cat out of your Tenderfoot zone .
Self :
Not to mention the bears with their berry - filled piles ,
the slinking coyotes with their Mona Lisa smiles .
Daimon :
If it is angels not animals on your mind ,
then let 's cut to the chase and the real reason --
if she is now linked to me -- you feel left behind ,
and death still gives you that elemental frisson .
Self :
When I die , she shifts automatically to you ,
so since she 's left , does n't it mean we two are through ?
Daimon :
How you die is important to the three of us .
You 're right to see us together , waiting for you ,
and to empty yourself and make space luminous
is precisely the thing that you now need to do .
Self :
Does entering death in managed IV dying
darken the stream we 're to follow into the sun ?
Daimon :
And puts thought in the way of translucent flying ,
which is something , remember , you 've already done .
Self :
Which is my point , since that 's done , why am I still here ?
Daimon :
To work through the body 's hold in death you still fear .
When your mind is the mud , the stem , and the lotus ,
you will be free to die and not even notice .
Yours in the Fellowship of Lindisfarne ,
William
PIR ZIA
Dear William ,
Thank you for sharing your thought - provoking poem .
I particularly like the denouement : “ When your mind is the mud , the stem , and the lotus , / you will be free to die and not even notice . ”
The Zoroastrian concept of the daena does seem relevant here .
In the Avesta , the daena represents the human being ’s spiritual individuality , organ of visionary perception , and conscience .
En route to heaven the righteous soul encounters its daena in the form of a graceful maiden who declares : “ I am your daena … I was fair and you made me fairer still . ”
The question arises : do women have male daenas , as Jung ’s theory of the anima / animus would suggest ?
The Avestan and Pahlavi canon , written exclusively by men , is silent on the subject as far as I know .
If we choose to see the daena as a contrasexual figure , perhaps it would fit better within your system at the astral / angelic rather than mental / daimonic level .
I recall your memorable description of an encounter with your own personal Angel ( daena ? ) in the heavenly shape of Angelina Jolie !
With every best wish ,
Zia
WILLIAM IRWIN THOMPSON
My Dear Zia ,
Yes , I would say that the Daimon , or the Psychic Being of Sri Aurobindo , is not the contrasexual figure .
For Aurobindo , the Psychic Being is the sum of all our incarnations .
So I would wish to use the Socratic / Yeatsian Daimon as expressive of a level higher .
For me , the Jungian Anima / Animus is the icon on the screen — to use a computer metaphor — to a much vaster file that is the Angel .
Further , I would say that it is only at the point of Initiation that the Anima is " replaced " by the Angel .
Similarly , I would say that the Jungian Shadow is a lower reflection of the Daimon , one that expresses the limits to the ego and serves to prevent it from appropriating to itself these higher functions of the soul .
At the point of Initiation — the matching grant process — the Shadow is replaced by an Elemental of Earth or what I call a Primordial Being .
The Jinn , as your grandfather explained , comes from the sphere of the Moon .
Rudolf Steiner called these Beings former teachers of early man who once lived on Earth and nursed our early development before they removed themselves to the lunar sphere to grant us more freedom in which to grow .
The Angel is a stellar creature .
Thus in " the matching grant " process I discussed before , the lower functions Jung identified become replaced by more cosmic ones as ego confronts its limits and begins to serve less egocentricly the Daimon or Higher Self .
Thus we have the fractal pentagram of the five - pointed star of ego / Christ , then stellar Angel , then Daimon , then lunar Jinn , then Elemental or Primordial spirit of Earth .
It would appear to me that various writers in the Zoroastrian tradition are conflating the Daimon and the Angel / Anima , which is understandable as they are both transcendent to the single - incarnation mentality of the ego .
If we add reincarnation and extend this evolving sense of the inner self to a vaster sense of space time , as opposed to the personality or ego , then Daena does correspond to the " Psychic Being " of Aurobindo and the Daimon of Yeats in A Vision and of Socrates in Plato 's Crito .
The important thing is not to objectify it as an independent " spirit guide " as some mediums do .
Also , as it is the Daimon which is capable of multiple projections into space / time , one should not use the ego to appropriate reincarnation to itself in a linear way , as one does in the vanity of saying stupid things such as , " In my last life I was Napoleon , and so forth . "
This is a case of the glove appropriating the hand .
In my own personal mythological system , I call this union of the incarnated ego with Elemental , Angel , Daimon , Christ , and God the Father or Gottheit , the Entelechy .
I envision the Entelechy as a Pentagram , which is a fractal , superimposed upon Da Vinci 's man .
Yogananda uses the white five pointed star as SRF 's emblem of the " Christ Center " one sees upon initiation and the opening of the third eye .
However , since the realm of the psychic is labile and participatory , it is influenced by culture and to being shaped by one 's culture .
I , for example , in a spiritual retreat in Iona saw this as the Celtic trifoil knot on a magenta field .
I would assume you Sufis use a different emblem for this initiatory experience .
I attach some images to illustrate my images of the Entelechy .
So , David , what do you make of all this .
It is your turn to weigh in on this from your experience .
Yours in the Fellowship of Lindisfarne ,
William
DAVID SPANGLER
My esteemed colleagues in this trialogue , Bill and Pir Zia , bring both inner experience and outer scholarship to our discussion , a valuable combination .
I can only bring inner experience as a kind of " freelance mystic " and exploratory " naturalist " of the non-physical realms .
For various reasons , I 'm not much of a student of the great traditions .
But I 'm happy to share what I can from the perspective I have .
Let me start with my understanding of incarnation .
The popular view is that a soul enters a body and takes on a fleshy , physical covering ( or perhaps is even created along with the body , both coming into being at the same time ) ; a common metaphor for this is that of a driver entering a vehicle which it then " drives " around for the duration of the lifespan .
In my experience , this view is far too simplistic and is misleading in important ways .
For instance , incarnation is a continuing , dynamic activity — a constantly configuring relationship between soul and earth — not merely an act of entering something .
If I want to use a metaphor of driver and vehicle , then incarnation is more like a person exuding a car out of his or her own substance and then constantly molding it to fit the shape and conditions of the road and the countryside .
The usual metaphor of a driver sitting in and guiding a vehicle that is separate from him is far too static an image to capture the full energetic and interactive flavor of the incarnational process .
For me , an important understanding is that we incarnate into systems rather than into a body .
Our bodies are merely one part of this system .
This is a similar idea to what Bill is expressing in his image of the Entelechy , though in my case it is not an image of enlightenment but of the architecture of incarnation .
The reason for this is that the soul is a complex , hyperdimensional entity whose fullness cannot be encompassed by a single body , or really by a single anything in the three - dimensional physical realm .
It 's as if a very heavy person jumped off the top of a burning building .
A single person on the ground trying to catch him would be squashed , but a group of people all holding a net between them can do so safely .
In my understanding , some of the " people " holding this net — the nodes in the incarnational system — are the body and its physical elemental , an aspect of Gaia or the World Soul , an aspect of Humanity as a collective soul , a representative of the subtle worlds , and what I think of as the " incarnational soul , " the nature of which I 'll explain in a moment .
There are other nodes as well , and the ones I 've mentioned could be further subdivided , but not without getting into occult complexities and fine - grain distinctions of subtle energies that are important in some contexts but not necessarily in this one .
Another way to look at this is to say that each individual incarnation is an act of collective incarnation — that through each of us , the world incarnates , nature incarnates , humanity incarnates , elementals incarnate , the subtle worlds incarnate .
Angelic , devic or elemental representatives of each of these realms connect to us and participate in our incarnations , in effect making them possible .
To paraphrase Hillary , it takes a village to be an incarnation !
In most instances , particularly with the kind of highly developed and complex energy patterns that characterize a human soul , the soul does not and indeed cannot fully incarnate .
The three - dimensional realm cannot encompass it .
So the soul designates a part of itself to conduct and oversee the incarnation .
Here 's a metaphor for that .
Let 's say that I take part in a fantasy role - playing game ( abbreviated RPG ) like Dungeons and Dragons .
In the play of the game , there are three levels of identity .
There is my identity as David ; I encompass a great deal more knowledge , awareness , life experience , interests , and connections than will ever fit in the game , but I am the one who decides to play .
Then there is my identity as a Player , participating in the game itself .
Finally , there is my identity as a Character in the game , such as an elf archer , a dwarf paladin , or a human mage .
My Character is the one who " lives " within the game world , has the adventures , gains experience , and grows .
As a Player I have much more information than my Character has , plus I 'm aware of the " meta - game , " the rules that govern play and the structure of the game world .
As a Player , for instance , I may know that by entering this cavern , I 'm going to be attacked by a vampire , and from reading the rules , I know just what a Vampire can do .
But my Character knows none of that and will have to discover it through actual experience .
Whatever wounds my Character suffers , I , the Player , remain unharmed , and if he dies , I can simply create a new Character .
And when my wife reminds me I have other things I need to do , then I , as David , stop being a Player , who effectively ceases to exist until the next time I sit down to play .
The analog to the Player is what I call the " Incarnational Soul , " the part of the Soul that oversees and becomes involved with a specific incarnation .
Is this the same as the Daimon ?
Yes , I believe so .
There is part of the Incarnational Soul itself that cannot be fully embodied and does not become the ego or the personality — the " Character . "
Even though dedicated to the manifestation of a particular incarnation , it is still a more complex patterning of energy and consciousness than can normally function in a three - dimensional world .
However , obviously information and awareness flows between the three levels of David , Player , and Character in a role - playing game .
I am still aware of being all three identities when I play .
I can say that I " lose myself in the game , " but in fact , I do n't .
I never fully forget that I am David or that I am playing a game and that the Character is only my avatar in the game .
This is true for soul , as well .
Our personality is not severed from our soul ; there is a continuum of consciousness at some level of our being , which we can touch in moments of transpersonal ecstasy or awareness .
And there 's something else , which I will call the Consciousness of the Game , again using the RPG metaphor .
When I play , a fourth awareness arises that is not the same as my usual David consciousness and which is other than that of the Player and the Character .
It is an emergent awareness arising from the experience of the play of the game itself .
It 's more than just the pleasure at playing ; it 's a self - reflective awareness of the game itself , of the contrast between my different levels of identity and of the relationship between them .
In other words , this fourth level of awareness requires all of the other three to be present and interactive in order to exist .
In a way , it is the experience of this awareness and the pleasure it brings that leads me to participate in the RPG in the first place .
I think of this as the emergent presence of my incarnation , and I think of it as the spirit of the incarnational system itself .
It 's not wholly my soul nor the incarnate soul , nor is it the world soul within me , nor the soul of humanity within me , nor is it my personality .
It is no one part of my incarnation , but it is what emerges from the system that these parts together co-create .
Perhaps it is the spirit of the Entelechy .
Whatever I call it , I believe that a goal of my incarnation is to become aware of and to hold this spirit of the whole system .
Furthermore , this is not a transpersonal experience , for this spirit reflects the specificity , the particularity , of my unique incarnation ; it is very personal indeed , though it is not egoic .
For this reason , I feel that an over - emphasis on transpersonal states misses the point of the incarnation and actually interferes with the emergence and experience of this spirit of the incarnational system as a whole .
To return to my RPG metaphor , if I always keep reminding myself that I 'm really David and that my identities as Player and Character are only figments of my imagination and therefore unreal and unimportant , I never truly enter into the spirit of the game and gain the full experience it could offer me .
In fact , that 's true if I lose myself in any of the roles .
It 's in the space between them that I find myself .
For me , an incarnational spirituality is one that seeks this central space .
Even for angels , it is a holy place .
Lovingly ,
David
DAVID SPANGLER
I would like to add two things that occurred to me after I wrote my previous contribution .
The first has to do with the idea that we incarnate into systems or patterns of relationship rather than simply into bodies .
As I understand it , the more participants there are in a system , the greater its potential depth and complexity .
A soul might not be able to incarnate fully into a simple three - dimensional physical body , but it can incarnate more of itself into increasingly complex systems developed by solid and dependable patterns , relationships and connections built up over time .
In a sense , it may well take an entire world to incarnate a single soul fully , and by the time those kinds of connections and patterns are made , we are all participating is such a communion and thus all incarnating each others ' souls .
That may well be the meaning of a Master whose love is such that he or she is deeply and profoundly connected with the wholeness of the world and thus able to manifest a robust and " full - bodied " expression of soul , a " planetary soul . "
This is the same idea that a net held by many people can catch and support a heavier mass than one held by fewer people or by one person alone .
And if in addition I tie the ends of my net to trees , rocks , animals , and so on , then I could " catch " a great deal .
In a practical way , these connections are made through love and compassion , hence the need for these qualities in expression if I am to fully incarnate .
( I might say here that some years ago one of my non-physical colleagues made the comment that the problem with humanity was n't that we were too incarnated or too physical but that we were n't incarnated enough .
A deeper understanding of incarnation as engagement and connectedness — as creating a wider and more sturdy net — explains why he might say such a thing . )
One thing this means is , for instance , quite apart from any work I may do to connect with my Daimon or any angels or elementals , that the loving connections I form with others and with the physical flora and fauna of my world create greater energy complexity through which my soul may incarnate .
Thus , in my loving relationship with my wife , Julie , I become part of the " net " of her incarnation , and she part of the " net " of mine , each helping the other to " catch " our souls in fuller ways .
Note , though , that this is not a simple numbers game .
It 's not like some kind of metaphysical Facebook where one seeks to have as many " friends " as possible in order to enhance your personal page .
It 's not simply pure connection but the quality of love , compassion and awareness that each connection embodies .
I am now connected to millions of people on earth each of whom theoretically I could contact via cell phone or Internet , but that does n't mean I know them .
There is no soul connection between us , no mindful flow of love .
I have connections but I am not necessarily connected .
As far as that goes , in the subtle worlds we have each always had essentially the kind of connectedness that is now externalized in the Internet and wireless telephones , but it has n't made us more incarnated .
What has been missing is the important ingredient of willing and conscious participation and awareness .
A second thought has to do with the importance of the physical plane .
I happen to think that the training the soul is going through is one of holopoiesis , the art of creating wholeness ; or I might call it a form of metaphysical systems management and synthesis .
How to create and hold a blending of various combinations of beings , consciousnesses , and so forth so that a coherent spirit emerges from their midst ?
For humanity in particular , this is our challenge as we are a species of spiritual being in whom the angelic , the devic , the elemental , the sacred , the individual , the planetary and the cosmic all come together to be fused into an amalgam of creative consciousness .
What the physical plane offers that other levels do not is stability .
Or maybe " slowness " or " density " are better words .
The fact is that forms hold their shape on earth ; there is none of the fluidity of matter and form that one finds in the invisible realms .
Participation in the physical realm forces beings to slow down relative to their native state .
This makes their qualities simpler and easier to connect to and hold .
It is simply easier for a consciousness to engage with all the elements of a system because the nature of this realm holds those elements in place and supports the existence of the system .
A certain amount of coherency is imposed by the laws of nature that define the physical realm , for instance .
A chair in my living room will remain a chair and will not morph into something else beneath me as I sit in it .
This is not always true in my experience on the subtle worlds .
I may be visiting with a being , but if I cannot hold my consciousness steady in its presence , I may suddenly find myself somewhere else entirely , with that being nowhere in sight .
This is why it is a privilege to come here .
There is a grace inherent in the stability and constancy of the physical plane that allows us to concentrate on the essential issues , such as learning to master love and compassion , without also having to devote awareness and energy to keeping our environment and our connections stable and coherent in their forms as well .
I can focus on loving my wife and children and creating a home , for instance , without also having to think about ensuring that walls remain walls , floors remain floors , and furniture retains its shape .
I am confident that because of a momentary change of thought or lapse of concentration , we wo n't find ourselves suddenly in the middle of the ocean when a moment before we were on land .
Of course , I overstate this a bit to make a point .
But the truth is , at least in my own experience and perspective , that the World Soul sacrifices itself to habit and a certain rigidity — the laws of nature — in order to give us a steady and consistent platform on which to stand and learn the arts of holopoiesis , love and compassion .
With blessings ,
David
WILLIAM IRWIN THOMPSON
Dear David ,
Thanks for your comments , which cleared up a point for me about Elementals that had been troubling me .
It also highlighted some points where you and I diverge , which is OK , since neither one of us is out to convert the other , and we both recognize that we are simply building narratives based on our own experiences .
I 'll number my points to give you and Pir an easy reference matrix .
1 . Your point that the Elemental is the elemental of our physical body and is itself part of the evolutionary Gaian system makes sense .
When I would see the Elemental and converse with him , I would always ask him why he took on the form of a human body .
I guess I expected some Emerald Crystal Being that was part of the mind of a volcano .
When we talked , or when he appeared in the practice of Yoga Nidra , he was always human , but not quite humanly socialized , but rather like someone with Asperger 's Syndrome whose semi-autism would not allow him to look you in the eye .
He had bangs and always looked downward , and once when I asked him about this , he raised his head and looked at me with wild cat 's eyes .
( This gave me greater insight into the Lionman statues of Engleherd from 33,000 BCE , a site along with Hohe Fels that has yielded rich insights into Ice Age Shamanism and the religion of early Homo sapiens sapiens . )
But if , as you point out , he is part of our incarnational system , then his interest in participating in a human body ecosystem — as the bacteria do in our guts in Lynn Margulis descriptions — makes sense .
And so he takes a human form in Yoga Nidra practice .
2 . Our physical body itself is Elemental / mineral , with our skeletal system ; and is fluid , with our blood and lymphatic system ; and then is gaseous with our respiratory system , and finally photonic with our production of vitamin D and serotonin and endorphins from sunlight .
This four - fold structure , as I argued at this year 's Lindisfarne Fellows Conference , corresponds to the four worlds of Yoga Nidra practice : the world of objects ( physical world ) , the world of images ( psychic and astral world ) , the world of sound ( the world of the Cosmic Nadam as the Holy Spirit or Parvati the divine Mother or Shakti ) , and the world of light ( the Mind of Light of Sri Aurobindo or the Buddha Mind of Zen ) .
3 . Now the Dalai Lama's " open question " that Evan presented at the Fellows meeting in July is : " Are these all simply brain - based states ? "
Is religion merely mythologizing brain functions in exactly the way we turn a sound into an image in our dreams and then use the image to generate the little drama of the dream ?
Religious rituals , from this scientific perspective , are mythologized images turned into dreams .
Like the complementarity of wave / particle in quantum mechanics , we always seem to have the possibility of two radically different explanatory narratives : artistic / religious or reductionist / scientific .
From the reductionist point of view the four states of Yoga Nidra of objects , images , sound and light express the reversal of the evolutionary process through meditation : 1 . mammalian perception ; 2 . reptilian trigger registers a response ; 3 . cellular and bacterial response to flagella in a sonar / aquaeous chemical medium ; and 4 .
the primal photosynthesis of light in stromatolites and cyanobacteria billions of years ago in the origins of life .
4 . As for the Daimon , I still wonder if what Sri Aurobindo calls " the Psychic Being " loosely situated behind the heart chakra is not a still vaster being than the Daimon and maybe represents a longer wave of a greater incarnational cycle — whole solar systems rather than a Great Year of the Zodiacal precession or a planetary formation .
Your image of the game is a point where we do converge .
In fact , in one of my books I say : " The ego is the video game of the Daimon . "
I can't remember which book !
5 . The point where we seem to diverge is on the nature of Initiation .
I see it as an increasing awareness of the incarnational " pit team " as you have sometimes called it .
I see Initiation is the point where the Shadow and Anima of the average man is transformed into the Elemental of the Body and the Angel from other stellar systems .
At the point of Initiation , we begin to move beyond our identity / awareness of our solar system to other star systems , just as when a child goes to school he begins to extend his identity from his parents and immediate family to his teachers and generational peers .
I am sure you of all people can understand this , since you are the eeriest walking earthly extraterrestrial I have ever met — you and Esalen 's Michael Murphy !
Well , since this is all in the realm of Seven Pillars , I think we should let Pir Zia have the last word on " all of the Above . "
Yours in the Fellowship of Lindisfarne ,
Bill /Wm
DAVID SPANGLER
OK , but let me have a " middle word " in response to your excellent points .
1 . I love the image of the elemental as someone with Asberger 's syndrome ; it 's not a bad analogy .
From my standpoint , " elemental " covers a wide ecology of beings , so I use the term carefully since an actual elemental could manifest in a number of different ways , just as there are many different species of bacteria .
I think what they all have in common is their function which , it seems to me on the basis of what I have seen but which also may be a generalization , is to " fix " energies from a freer state to a more bounded one and to provide connective and mediating activities .
They do not so much generate energies themselves as they receive spiritual and energetic forces and do something with them .
What that " something " is depends on the species of elemental they are and the environment in which they are working .
What I think of as the " body elemental " is a sentiency that connects the individualizing forces of the human soul , ego and body with the larger domain of energies and consciousness that we dub " nature , " and primarily with the elemental forces of the planet itself .
They connect us to the land , to the realms of animals and plants , and so on .
They help to " ground us " and " fix ' our more mercurial and fluid spiritual natures into particular forms .
2 . Yes , I would agree with your depiction of the physical body .
It 's not the only possible mapping , of course , but it 's a good map .
3 . If we ask if these are only brain - based states with no other correspondence in higher levels of being and consciousness , I would say no , though I have no idea how to justify or prove that .
If we ask if these are also brain - based states , I would say yes , otherwise we would not be able to register them at all .
From my point of view the brain is an organ that participates in the co-creation of " reality states " or " experience states , " rather than just receiving and recording on the one hand ( as in " reality is ' out there ' and the brain records what it perceives of it " ) or wholly creating on the other ( as in " everything we experience is created or generated by the brain " ) .
I think those who say that consciousness must be embodied are exactly right ; the question really is what constitutes the body .
From my point of view , we are deeply embedded in many layers of being all of which constitute " body . "
My physical body is obviously one of these layers , but subtle ' bodies ' are , too ; the physical environment is one of these layers , but subtle environments are , too .
It 's not so much that it 's all one to me , all a unity , as it is an interactive ecology of interdependent but distinctly individual elements , Gregory 's ecology of mind expanded to include the non-physical dimensions .
There is no mind - body duality problem because everything is either all body or all mind or both : your body and mind are also " body " to the incarnation of my mind , the tree and the elemental are also " body " to the incarnation of my mind , and my mind is body to their incarnations as well .
The way I navigate all this is NOT to give up my personal identity but to use my personal identity as a marker to designate and highlight relationships and interactions that in turn illuminate a larger whole .
A metaphor for this is when we tag a wild wolf in order to track the movements of its clan and migration patterns of wolves in an environment .
The tag gives us a point of connection to a fluid and dynamic interaction between individuals , groups , and environments .
With out it , we can't see the whole as it is too diffused .
Ironically , individuality is important in bringing wholeness into view ( and probably the reverse is true , too ) .
So if I try to lose myself in a larger oneness , I may ironically end up losing both myself and that oneness .
I think identifying brain states is a similar kind of marker .
Rather than asking , " What does this explain ? " or " What does this cause ? " we could ask , " What does this allow me to see that I could n't see before ? "
4. My David / Player / Character paradigm is very simple .
The reality is more complex and not always so conveniently structured .
I believe a person can be in touch with both the " incarnate soul " or the " player " but also the soul , the " I " .
Which of these , then , is the Daimon ?
The soul IS vaster than the Daimon , yet it can under some circumstances function in a Daimon - like way .
I 'm not familiar enough with Aurobindo 's cosmology to know just what he means by the " Psychic Being " or to what it might correspond in my own experience , assuming I 've even experienced it !
5 . Yes , I would agree .
I was n't trying to define initiation , only to say that one of the objectives of incarnation is to discern and manifest coherency and integrity in the incarnational system so that an emergent consciousness — an amalgam — can arise .
But I would agree that there are other developmental steps that either parallel this or are part of it and flow out from it , including what you 've described above .
Gee , an eerie walking earthly extraterrestrial : Bill , you always say the nicest things !

WILLIAM IRWIN THOMPSON
David ,
You said : " I 'm not familiar enough with Aurobindo 's cosmology to know just what he means by the " Psychic Being " or to what it might correspond in my own experience , assuming I 've even experienced it ! "
So I looked it up in my collection of Aurobindo 's books on my shelf .
On page 225 of Volume One of THE LIFE DIVINE , Aurobindo says " this veiled psychic entity is the flame of Godhead always alight within us ...
It is the concealed Witness and Control , the hidden Guide , the Daemon of Socrates ... "
On these terms , it does correspond to what we have been discussing .
Unlike Yogananda , Aurobindo does not give specific Tantric practices for the awakening of kundalini and the energizing of the subtle bodies and their re-alignment to " the Life Divine . "
In Aurobindo 's terms the Psychic Being slumbers in most people , but when it comes to the fore and takes over the leadership of the incarnation , then true Sadhana begins .
There are no techniques in Integral Yoga , as there are in Yogananda 's Kriya Yoga ; the Sadhana comes from the inner instructions of the Psychic Being .
Aurobindo is not interested in the awakening of kundalini and all that .
He was a natural yogi who was not interested in all the elementary stuff , so when Gopi Krishna wrote to him for help with his Tantric sadhana , Aurobindo told him to seek out a Tantric master , as all that downward up yoga was not his Integral Yoga which worked through a process of Top > down , and not bottom >
Up. Aurobindo has a " Descent of the Supramental " which is not produced by yogic or shamanic or drug techniques .
When Gopi Kirshna received the letter from Aurobindo , he mistakenly interpreted it to mean that Aurobindo was merely a scholar and a writer of books and had not himself experienced Yoga , and so Gopi Krishna inflated to think that he alone in the modern world had discovered " The Secret of Yoga . "
I stayed in Gopi Krishna 's home for a week , and I found him to be a good , kind and gentle follower of yoga , but one who did not really understand what Aurobindo had to say .
I had just come to visit Gopi Krishna after my stay in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and my Darshan with " The Mother . "
I would venture to say that the Daimon , like the double - faced god Janus , the Roman god of doorways , faces in two directions .
One is the Daimon as the sensorium of the Soul that faces in our direction and is interested in our incarnation .
But as you have probably noticed in your bouts with cancer , as I certainly did with mine , the Daimon is interested in our suffering as much as our joy , and is especially fascinated with the human oscillation between suffering and joy .
Since it already has " consciousness without an object , " it is not interested in samadhi as much as we are .
It is more aligned to wisdom , compassion and cosmic love .
This , I think , is why cults led by yogic masters — who are often nothing more than psychic weight lifters or outright religious psychotics — often focus on " Enlightenment " as an " I 've got a secret " culture in which the chela is conned by the cult leader into serving his ego as he strives to parasitize theirs .
The other face of the Daimon is turned toward Godhead , and its consciousness is a fractal mind within the greater Divine Mind .
This would be what I believe you mean by the Soul .
Others use the term soul just to mean the being between incarnations , and reserve the word Spirit for this higher being .
Yours ,
Bill
PIR ZIA
Dear William ,
Reflecting on how to translate your Entelechy into the conceptual language of Sufism , it occurred to me that it bears an intriguing resemblance to the Akbarian theory of the Five Divine Presences .
There are several formulations of this theory ; the version I have in mind names the Presences as follows : Hahut , Lahut , Jabarut , Malakut and Nasut .
Hahut is the plane of pure consciousness , beyond manifestation .
Lahut is the spiritual plane , where the qualities of being manifest as archetypes , Plato ’s Ideas .
Jabarut is the astral plane , populated by angels , creatures of light .
Malakut is the mental plane , the World of the Image ( “ where bodies are spiritualized and spirits corporealized ” ) , peopled by jinn .
Nasut is the material world .
Mapping your system on to the Five Presences of Sufism would produce the following correspondences :
God the Father – Hahut ( consciousness )
Christ – Lahut ( spiritual )
Angel – Jabarut ( astral )
Daimon – Malakut ( mental )
Elemental – Nasut ( material )
In Sufism , and in my experience , the human being is a microcosm of the whole .
We possess organs of perception ( lata’if ) attuned to each of the five Presences .
Ordinarily our experience is fragmented , each organ functioning in relative isolation .
The purpose of spiritual practice is to bring about integration .
The process of creation is called “ descent ” ( nuzul ) , referring to the top - down emanation of the Universe from its source in pure consciousness .
The reciprocal process of bottom - up reintegration is called “ ascent ” ( ‘ uruj ) .
In this process , the perfume is distilled from the fading rose of the Earth and infused into Eternity .
As souls descend and ascend along the cosmic Jacob ’s Ladder , they meet .
The rising soul is attracted by the celestial magnetism of the downward - moving soul , and the downward - moving soul is attracted by the terrestrial magnetism of the rising soul .
Each of them imparts something of its experience to the other , and the energy of that exchange hastens both on their path .
The account of the Nephilim and the daughters of men in Genesis , Ovid ’s Metamorphoses , Thomas Moore ’s poem “ The Loves of the Angels , ” and Wim Wenders ’s film “ Wings of Desire ” all seem to allude to encounters of this kind .
My grandfather held that the phenomenon of exchange between ascending and descending souls provides an important and often - neglected perspective on the theory of reincarnation .
Substance is recycled at all levels .
Just as plants and animals absorb the elements of our physical body when it perishes ( and to some extent before as well ) , so too do other beings incorporate the substance of our mental bodies into their own .
This is in keeping , I think , with David ’s insight that , “ we incarnate into systems rather than into a body . ”
Thank you , dear and respected colleagues , for your illuminating words .
I hope that our conversation will continue in some form in the future , as I feel that in a sense we are just getting started .
Peace and Blessings ,
Zia

Could playing in the dirt make you smarter ?
Studies in mice suggest that it could .
Mice given peanut butter laced with a common , harmless soil bacterium ran through mazes twice as fast and enjoyed doing so .
So says Dorothy Matthews of the Sage Colleges in Troy , New York state , who presented her results at the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in San Diego , California , this week .
In a classic test of learning ability , Matthews gave mice a treat – white bread with peanut butter – as a reward to encourage them to learn to run through a maze .
When she laced the treat with a tiny bit of Mycobacterium vaccae , she found that the mice ran through the maze twice as fast as mice that were given plain peanut butter .
This suggests that they had learned to navigate the maze faster , Matthews says .
Advertisement
Moreover , the mice given the bacteria continued to run the maze faster than those without it for 18 more trials over the next six weeks , showing they were n’t just made more alert by a surprise change to their treat .
This effect lasted for four weeks after the last piece of doctored peanut butter was given to the mice .
Speedy solvers
Matthews believes this was caused by the effect M. vaccae has on the immune system , something that was investigated in 2007 by Chris Lowry , now at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Lowry was trying to explain why sick people – who have activated immune systems – often become depressed and sluggish , which could be an adaptation that speeds recovery .
His team found that exposing mice to the bacteria , and hence activating their immune system , activated clusters of neurons in their brainstem called the dorsal Raphe nuclei .
These neurons connect to the forebrain and other brain structures that regulate mood and behaviour .
This result led Matthews to investigate whether the bacteria ’s effect on the brain extended to a more general difference in cognitive function – and she found that it did .
Focus on that maze
The bacteria may speed up learning because the Raphe nuclei stimulate a brain region called the hippocampus , which handles spatial memory , she says .
But the bacteria also changed the mice ’s mood – they showed less behaviour that indicates anxiety , such as grooming and searching , perhaps analogous to the calmer behaviour immune activation triggers in people .
This is likely to have been caused by changes to the higher mental functions in the forebrain , which perhaps allowed them to focus better on the maze .
Matthews says that exposure to soil bacteria may affect human brains too .
“ It just shows that we evolved with dirt as hunter - gatherers , ” she says .
“ So turn off your TV and go work in your garden , or walk in the woods . ”

An Anarchist FAQ spends some time explaining , probably in far too much detail given their small size and corresponding importance , why " anarcho " - capitalism is not a form of anarchism .
Ironically , its founder Murray Rothbard once agreed !
An Anarchist FAQ explains how anarchism , in all its many forms , is fundamentally a socialist ( anti-capitalist ) theory and movement .
This has caused it to be , well , hated with a passion in certain right - wing circles .
It is somewhat ironic , then , to discover that the founder of " anarcho " - capitalism , Murray Rothbard , also concluded that " that we are not anarchists , and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground , and are being completely unhistorical " .
This was because " all " anarchists had " socialistic elements in their doctrines " and " possessed socialistic economic doctrines in common . "
It is hard to disagree ...
In a sadly unpublished article from the 1950s entitled " Are Libertarians ' Anarchists ' ? " , leading " anarcho " - capitalist Murray Rothbard came to the same conclusion that almost all anarchists have done , namely that " anarcho " - capitalists are not anarchists .
The article itself is notable not only for its correct conclusion , namely " We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists " but also for its ill - informed diatribes against anarchism , particularly what Rothbard terms " left - wing " anarchism ( i.e. , social anarchism ) .
As such , it is useful to highlight its mistakes and flaws .
Somewhat ironically , given what his article contains , Rothbard states that the " almost insuperable distortions and confusions " about anarchism " have come both from the opponents and the adherents of anarchism .
The former have completely distorted anarchist tenets and made various fallacious charges , while the latter have been split into numerous warring camps with political philosophies that are literally as far apart as communism and individualism . "
Yet , the fact that there were numerous schools of anarchism was a recognised fact .
Kropotkin , for example , indicated as much in such works as " Modern Science and Anarchism " .
Yet these schools have much in common , with both Tucker and Kropotkin considering their ideas as socialist and anarchism as part of the wider socialist movement .
Both were opposed to the exploitation of labour by capital , aiming to end interest , rent and profits .
While Tucker , like some other individualist anarchists often ( and without reason ) excommunicated communist - anarchism from anarchism , he regularly called his ideas " Anarchistic - Socialism " .
For Tucker , like all anarchists , there were " two schools of socialistic thought " , namely " State Socialism and Anarchism . "
[ The Individualist Anarchists , pp. 78 - 9 ] Kropotkin hardly disagreed .
As such , the communist and individualist camps where not that far apart on many key issues .
Both considered Proudhon as being the father of anarchism .
But then , as Rothbard patronising asserts , " the various anarchist groups themselves did not recognize the enormous ideological conflict between them . "
Could it be , as even he is forced to admit towards the end of his inaccurate diatribe that " all the anarchist groups , even the right - wingers [ sic ! ] , possessed socialistic economic doctrines in common " ?
In other words , all schools of anarchism are socialistic .
" The major difficulty " , Rothbard moaned , " in any analysis of anarchism is that the term covers extremely conflicting doctrines " but have a " common hostility to the existence of the State , the coercive monopolist of force and authority . "
Yet this is not the case , as the various forms of anarchism also shared a " common hostility " to capitalism and capitalist private property as well .
An awkward fact Rothbard acknowledged : " even the best of them have . . . socialistic elements in their doctrines . "
He correctly noted that anarchism " arose in the 19th century , and since then the most active and dominant anarchist doctrine has been that of ' anarchist communism . '
This is an apt term for a doctrine which has also been called ' collectivist anarchism , ' ' anarcho - syndicalism , ' and ' libertarian communism . '
This seems fair , as communist - anarchism developed out of collectivist - anarchism and shared much in common .
As for anarcho - syndicalism , that was considered a tactic towards libertarian communism rather than a goal and , again , shared much in common with collectivist / communism anarchism .
It does seem strange , however , to see that Rothbard acknowledged the use of " libertarian communism " by anarchists while , at the same time , he wanted his own ideology to be called " libertarian " .
Given that " libertarian " had been used first by communist - anarchists as an alternative to anarchist since 1858 , it shows that he was willing to appropriate that name to describe an ideology at odds to its traditional article .
So Rothbard 's article , from an anarchist perspective , is utterly misnamed ,
It would have been better called " Are Propertarians ' libertarians ' ? " and it would have come to the same conclusion .
Rothbard seems to have stated the common propertarian habit of describing social anarchism as " left " - anarchism by asserting that " [ w ] e may term this set of related doctrines ' left - wing anarchism ' " .
Given that he later admits that individualist anarchism contains " socialistic " elements , it seems that this label confuses more than it enlightens .
Surely is Tucker called his position " Anarchistic Socialism then it suggests that he , too , considered his ideas of the left ...
Somewhat strangely , Rothbard asserted that " Anarchist communism is primarily of Russian origin , forged by Prince Peter Kropotkin and Michael Bakunin " .
In reality , both Bakunin and Kropotkin became anarchists in Western Europe and rather than anarchism being " forged " by them , they were simply the most famous proponents of ideas developed within the labour movement .
Thus Bakunin took up and expanded the ideas already developed by radical mutualists in the First International while communist - anarchism developed shortly after Bakunin 's death as a product of debates within the Italian section of the First International .
Kropotkin may have been communist - anarchism 's most famous advocate but he did not invent it .
So , in reality , " communist - anarchism " is of Western European , not Russian , origin .
It came out of the debates and activities of libertarians within the First International in Switzerland , France , Belgium , Italy and Spain .
As such , it can be considered as a natural evolution of Proudhon 's mutualism within a labour - union context ( as Bakunin acknowledged , collectivist - anarchism was " Proudhonism widely developed and pushed to these , its final consequences . "
[ Michael Bakunin : Selected Writings , p. 198 ] ) .
For example , France 's leading mutualist , Eugene Varlin , " seems to have moved independently towards his collectivist position . "
[ George Woodcock , Anarchism , p. 239 ]
Kropotkin , like Bakunin , became an anarchist in exile and proclaimed to his accusers in Lyons trial of 1883 that they did him " too much honour .
The father of Anarchism is the immortal Proudhon ! " [ quoted by Dorothy W. Douglas , " Proudhon : A Prophet of 1848 : Part I " , pp. 781-803 , The American Journal of Sociology , Vol. 34 , No. 5 , p. 800 ]
Certainly , he become a socialist after reading Proudhon in Russia but became a libertarian socialist in Europe and , like Bakunin , wrote all his classic anarchist works there .
Significantly , Tucker referred to Proudhon as being both " the father of the Anarchistic school of socialism " as well as " being the Anarchist par excellence " .
[ Instead of a Book , p. 391 ]
Rothbard showed his lack of knowledge of anarchism as a global movement when he asserted , correctly , that " it is this form that has connoted ' anarchism ' throughout the continent of Europe . "
The same would be true of South America , Japan and China , for example .
This would be the case in North America too -- Albert Parsons and Emma Goldman were far better known than Benjamin Tucker and the communist anarchist movement quickly grew much bigger than the more home - grown individualist tendency ( and as Paul Avrich notes , " [ b ] y the turn of the century , the anarchist movement in America had become predominantly communist in orientation . "
[ Anarchist Voices , p. 5 ]
It would be fair to say that anarchism has meant communist - anarchism ( and its variations like anarcho - syndicalism ) across the globe , even in America where the individualist tendency was quickly overwhelmed by it ( in part , because of the development of capitalism there ) .
After showing a somewhat dubious understanding of anarchist history , Rothbard then got to what he considered the crux of the problem with anarchism , private property :
" The principal feature of anarchist communism is that it attacks private property just as vigorously as it attacks the State .
Capitalism is considered as much of a tyranny , ' in the economic realm , ' as the State in the political realm .
The left - wing anarchist hates capitalism and private property with perhaps even more fervor than does the socialist or Communist . "
This is , of course , true yet Rothbard makes no attempt to explain why anarchists , from Proudhon onwards ( and even before , as Godwin produced a similar analysis of property as the Frenchman ) , have taken this position .
Significantly , it was because private property produces the same kind of authoritarian social relationships which mark the state .
For those interested in liberty , this similarity is important and informs anarchist theory .
Thus we find Proudhon arguing that property " violates equality by the rights of exclusion and increase , and freedom by despotism " and has " perfect identity with robbery . "
He , unsurprisingly , talks of the " proprietor , to whom [ the worker ] has sold and surrendered his liberty . "
For Proudhon , anarchy was " the absence of a master , of a sovereign " while " proprietor " was " synonymous " with " sovereign " for he " imposes his will as law , and suffers neither contradiction nor control . "
This meant that " property engenders despotism , " as " each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his property . "
The aim of anarchism , unsurprisingly enough given this , was a society of " possessors without masters " rather than wage - labourers and tenants " controlled by proprietors . "
[ What is Property , p. 251 , p. 130 , p. 264 , pp. 266-7 and p. 167 ]
That this analysis is right can be seen , somewhat ironically , from Rothbard himself -- at least , the future Rothbard .
Some decades later we discover Rothbard arguing that the state " arrogates to itself a monopoly of force , of ultimate decision - making power , over a given area territorial area . "
He then went onto note that " [ o ] bviously , in a free society , Smith has the ultimate decision - making power over his own just property , Jones over his , etc . "
[ The Ethics of Liberty , p. 170 and p. 173 ]
The logical contradiction in this position should be obvious , but not to Rothbard .
It shows the power of ideology , the ability of means words ( the expression " private property " ) to turn the bad ( " ultimate decision - making power over a given area " ) into the good ( " ultimate decision - making power over a given area " ) .
Of course , to quote Rothbard 's future writings is problematic as , while dripping in irony , he was obviously unaware of them or the obvious contradictions they expose in his ideology .
Let us quote a source he was familiar with , namely Ludwig von Mises who glibly noted that the capitalist " of course exercises power over the workers " , although " he cannot exercise it arbitrarily " thanks to the market but within this limit " the entrepreneur is free to give full rein to his whims " and " to dismiss workers offhand " [ Socialism , p. 443 and p. 444 ]
So , looking at both Rothbard and von Mises we discover that the anarchist opposition to private property " as much of a tyranny , ' in the economic realm , ' as the State in the political realm " has merit .
As we have explained in section F.1 this obvious self - contradiction in " anarcho " - capitalism is one of the many reasons why it is not anarchist .
After proclaiming , but not explaining , anarchist opposition to property , Rothbard continued in his best Ex Cathedra tone :
" Like the Marxists , the left - wing anarchist is convinced that the capitalists exploit and dominate the workers , and also that the landlords invariably are exploiting peasants . "
As just indicated , the capitalist and landlord do dominate the workers and peasants , as acknowledged by both Rothbard and von Mises .
Both the property owner and the state have a monopoly of decision making over a given territory and , of course , power over those within it .
If the state dominates people , so ( logically ) must the capitalist and landlord .
That Rothbard considers the power associated private property as legitimate does not change the social relations it produces .
Then there is the charge of exploitation .
The answer to that is simple , why does a capitalist hire a worker unless that worker produces more for the boss than they get paid in wages .
Why does the landlord rent out land to the peasant , unless to get rent ?
To quote a source he would be familiar with , " the employer . . . considers labour a commodity , an instrument of earning profits " .
Of course , in reality , labour cannot be separated from the human beings who provide it ( unlike " capital " and land ) .
The workers sell their labour - power , and so the " hired man . . . owes [ the employer ] a definite quantity of work of a definite kind and quality . "
[ Ludwig von Mises , Human Action , p. 629 ]
As discussed in section C.2 , the difference between the wages paid and what the labour actually produces is source of surplus value ( profits , rent and interest ) .
So , yes , capitalists do exploit the workers and in order to do so dominate them , that is , create hierarchical social relationships within the workplace .
Workers sell their labour ( liberty ) to the capitalists , the capitalists get to command them and monopolise the fruit of their labour .
This has been a pretty standard anarchist position since 1840 ( see Proudhon 's What is Property ? ) and so it is fair to say that Marxists are repeating ideas first expounded by anarchists .
Rothbard then asserted that the " economic views of the anarchists present them with a crucial dilemma " , namely " how can capitalism and private property be abolished , while the State is abolished at the same time ? "
Given that , for example , Kropotkin wrote numerous articles on precisely this subject ( as collected in The Conquest of Bread and , more recently , Act for Yourselves ) Rothbard 's assertion is simply staggering .
It suggests an utterly lack of familiarity with the subject matter .
Let us simply quote from one of Bakunin 's numerous anarchist programmes :
" natural and necessary consequence of this destruction will be . . . [ among others , the ] dissolution of army , magistracy , bureaucracy , police and priesthood .
. . confiscation of all productive capital and means of production on behalf of workers ' associations , who are to put them to use . . . the federative Alliance of all working men's associations . . . will constitute the Commune . . . all provinces , communes and associations . . . by first reorganising on revolutionary lines . . . [ will ] constitute the federation of insurgent associations , communes and provinces . . . [ and ] organise a revolutionary force capable defeating reaction . . . [ and for ] self - defence . . .
[ The ] revolution everywhere must be created by the people , and supreme control must always belong to the people organised into a free federation of agricultural and industrial associations . . . organised from the bottom upwards by means of revolutionary delegation . . . " [ Michael Bakunin : Selected Writings , p. 170-2 ]
Thus it is quite easy to abolish private property at the same time as the state -- those who use it simply ignore those who claim to own it and place it under their own management .
In this way private property is abolished , along with wage labour and so capitalism .
This should all be obvious to anyone familiar with the anarchist critique of private property .
More to the point , how is it possible to abolish private property if the state is not abolished ?
How can capital be expropriated if the might of the state , its police and army , can be called upon by the property owners to kick the workers out of their fields , factories and workshops ?
And it should be noted that Rothbard 's " solution " does not abolish the state , it simply changes its name to " a body of constitutional libertarian law " with " private courts " allowing the use of force to defend private property -- in other words , private statism .
Equally , using the state to abolish private property simply replaces the property owners with a new class of state bureaucrats -- as happened under Lenin .
But to give credit where it is due , at least Rothbard was aware that communist - anarchists seek to destroy capitalism and the state " at the same time " , which is a substantial improvement on the false Marxist assertions that we aim to just abolish the state !
Aware that anarchists have discussed his " crucial dilemma " in some detail , Rothbard states that " nearest those anarchists have come to resolving the problem has been to uphold syndicalism as the ideal . "
Yet anyone familiar with the history of anarchism would know that syndicalism is a tactic , not a goal .
It comes from the French for revolutionary labour unionism and does not describe an economic system different from that of communist - anarchism .
In fact , the ideas of syndicalism were first expounded by Bakunin and others in the First International and was supported by Kropotkin and other communist - anarchists like Malatesta .
As such , there is no fundamental difference between anarchism and syndicalism ( regardless of what Rothbard and Marxists may imply ) .
What Rothbard terms " syndicalism " , namely a situation in which " each group of workers and peasants is supposed to own its means of production in common , and plan for itself , while cooperating with other collectives and communes " , was raised by Proudhon in 1840 long before the word syndicalism was coined .
Bakunin and Kropotkin also presented similar visions , again long before syndicalism become well - known in English .
And what of " syndicalism " ?
" Logical analysis of these schemes " , he asserts , " would readily show that the whole program is nonsense .
Either of two things would occur : one central agency would plan for and direct the various subgroups , or the collectives themselves would be really autonomous . "
Obviously " the first possibility means nothing more nor less than Communism " ( i.e. , Stalinism ) -- which is why anarchists have always opposed central planning !
The second option , Rothbard states , " leads to a real chaos of diverse and clashing Communisms , that would probably lead finally to some central Communism after a period of social war " !
Why this logically happens is left unexplained , probably because having to explain why free people would not work together for to meet their common goals would simply be too hard to do .
Why a syndicate contacting another to order and arrange the delivery of a good they require would produce " a true chaos of communistic syndics " is hard to see .
Equally hard to see is why these communist syndicates would take up arms against each other , after having taken up arms against capitalist oppression to create a co-operative commonwealth in the first place ...
After that wonderful display of " logical analysis " , Rothbard turns to this assertion :
" But the crucial question is whether these agencies would be empowered to use force to put their decisions into effect .
All of the left - wing anarchists have agreed that force is necessary against recalcitrants . "
Sadly Rothbard failed to provide the slightest evidence to support this claim .
Perhaps because none exists ?
In fact , communist - anarchists have been at pains to explain that those who do not wish to be communists would be free to try other forms of economy -- individualist , mutualist , collectivist and so forth .
But , of course , asserting that all communist - anarchists support force means he does not have to provide any evidence , particularly given that few of his fellow propertarians would be likely to check his claim or be familiar enough with communist - anarchism to know that he is slandering it .
Rothbard then notes , correctly , that the " leading anarchists , particularly in Europe , have always been of the left - wing variety , and today the anarchists are exclusively in the left - wing camp . "
It is also useful to note that anarchism was coined by Proudhon , someone recognised as being one of the leading socialist thinkers in France at the time .
" Add to that , " he continued , " the tradition of revolutionary violence stemming from European conditions , and it is little wonder that anarchism is discredited . "
Taking of logical analysis , why does anarchists being " left - wing " result in anarchism being " discredited " ?
Rothbard prejudices , as was often the case , obviously got in the way of his logic .
It should also be noted that American anarchism also involved " revolutionary violence " , so it cannot be said to be purely the results of ( unspecified ) " European conditions . "
Rather , such a " tradition " flowed from the rise of capitalism in both continents , combined with a corresponding rise in state repression of the labour movement and labour protest .
For example , Italian Anarchist Gaetano Bresci assassinated King Umberto of Italy in 1900 and Alexander Berkman tried to kill Carnegie Steel Corporation manager Henry Clay Frick in 1892 .
What is often unknown is that Umberto 's troops had fired upon and killed protesting peasants or that Frick 's Pinkertons had also murdered locked - out workers at Homestead .
Similarly , the violent rhetoric of the Chicago anarchists was a product of state repression of strikes , a repression urged on by the capitalist class .
As for anarchism being " discredited " , well it is true that post - war anarchism was at a low ebb .
The apparent " success " of the Russian Revolution and its impact on the wider socialist and labour movement played its role , not to mention the fact that both Fascism and Stalinism physically destroying the anarchist movement across Europe .
However , the decline of anarchism was short - lived and by the 1960s it had exploded back onto the world stage again -- as it has repeatedly since .
This return of anarchism can be best explained by the fact that both neo-liberal capitalism and the state capitalism of Stalinism have been exposed for what they are and people are looking for alternatives to capitalism and Marxism .
Rothbard turned his attention to the Spanish Revolution , stating that " Anarchism was politically very powerful in Spain , and during the Spanish Civil War , anarchists established communes and collectives wielding coercive authority . "
It is true that the anarchists were very strong in Spain , with the CNT being the most active and militant union in the country .
It is also true that the anarchists helped create communes and collectives , although the notion that they wielded " coercive authority " is typical Rothbard invention .
The collectives were free associations of workers , managing their own affairs .
If making decisions and implementing them equals " wielding coercive authority " then all organisations do so , including capitalist firms .
The question really should be why a dictatorial organisation ( the capitalist workplace ) is considered more libertarian than a democratic one ( a commune or collective )
The answer is , of course , it cannot be -- which is why anarchists have always been anti-capitalist .
Rather than a blanket condemnation of all organisation , perhaps Rothbard is referring to the Stalinist myth ( recently repeated by propertarians ) that the anarchist militias forced people to join collectives in Aragon .
While this did happen in a very few cases ( and was opposed by the CNT - FAI ) , the facts are that the vast majority of collectives were formed voluntarily and worked remarkably well .
And , strangely enough , the syndicates did not start a " social war " amongst themselves ...
Clearly on a roll , Rothbard then stated that " [ o ] ne of their first steps was to abolish the use of money on the pain of a death penalty . "
Unfortunately , but unsurprisingly , he failed to indicate where he got that particular gem -- because , yet again , it never happened ?
After this little detour into fantasy , Rothbard tried to generalise from his inventions .
" It is obvious , " he opines , " that the supposed anarchist hatred of coercion had gone very much awry . "
Why ?
Simple : " The reason was the insoluble contradiction between the antistate and the antiproperty tenets of left - wing anarchy . "
Of course , his case would be somewhat stronger if he presented any actual real evidence to support it , but never mind !
So why does communist - anarchism urge the expropriation of capital and the creation of collectives / communes ?
This flows from our libertarian analysis of capitalism and the awareness that private property produces hierarchical social relationships -- the owner has power over the workers .
We urge those subject to such power to rebel and get rid of it by forming an association .
To quote Proudhon :
" either the workman . . . will be simply the employee of the proprietor - capitalist - promoter ; or he will participate .
. . [ and ] have a voice in the council , in a word he will become an associate .
" In the first case the workman is subordinated , exploited : his permanent condition is one of obedience .
. .
In the second case he resumes his dignity as a man and citizen .
. . he forms part of the producing organisation , of which he was before but the slave ; as , in the town , he forms part of the sovereign power , of which he was before but the subject . . . we need not hesitate , for we have no choice .
. . it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers . . . because without that , they would remain related as subordinates and superiors , and there would ensue two . . . castes of masters and wage - workers , which is repugnant to a free and democratic society . "
[ The General Idea of the Revolution , pp. 215-216 ]
While Proudhon opposed revolution , his arguments for association were perfectly correct .
Thus the antistate and antiproperty aspects of anarchism fit together logically .
In fact , as Rothbard himself later proved , any pro-property " anarchism " involves the real " insoluble contradiction " !
Ultimately , Rothbard is blind to the fact that there are " two ways of oppressing men : either directly by brute force , by physical violence ; or indirectly by denying them the means of life and this reducing them to a state of surrender . "
In the second case , government is " an organised instrument to ensure that dominion and privilege will be in the hands of those who . . . have cornered all the means of life , first and foremost the land , which they make use of to keep the people in bondage and to make them work for their benefit . "
[ Malatesta , Anarchy , p. 21 ]
As Kropotkin argued against a forerunner of propertarianism :
" The modern Individualism initiated by Herbert Spencer is , like the critical theory of Proudhon , a powerful indictment against the dangers and wrongs of government , but its practical solution of the social problem is miserable -- so miserable as to lead us to inquire if the talk of ' No force ' be merely an excuse for supporting landlord and capitalist domination . "
[ Act For Yourselves , p. 98 ]
Moving on to his favourite subject , Rothbard states that " [ o ] f economics , which would show them the impossibility of their system , they are completely ignorant , perhaps more so than any other group of political theorists . "
Given how little relationship economics has to reality , this is hardly a major blow against anarchism -- assuming it were true .
Equally , it should be noted that Austrian economics , like neo-classical economics , is not a science .
Logic deductions from a few assumptions is a pre-scientific methodology , not to mention the repeated assertions by Rothbard that mere evidence cannot disprove his claims .
And it is a strange coincidence that these deductions always seem to end up being what the property - owning class wants to hear !
As Kropotkin put it , economics " has always confined itself to stating facts occurring in society , and justifying them in the interest of the dominant class . . .
Having found [ something ] profitable to capitalists , it has set it up as a principle . "
[ The Conquest of Bread , p. 181 ]
Rothbard then moved onto the issue of anti-social activity , stating that the " dilemma about coercion they attempt to resolve by the absurd theory that crime would simply disappear if the State were abolished , so that no coercion would have to be used . "
Really ?
Crime would " simply disappear " ?
No , not at all .
If you read Kropotkin , say , he was well aware that anti-social acts would not disappear .
What he did argue , as did other anarchists , was that once people were free and no longer crushed by poverty and hierarchy then anti-social behaviour would decrease drastically .
Apparently Rothbard subscribed to the absurd theory that crime is completely independent on how wealth is distributed and how people are treated -- apparently a starving man and a well - fed one would have the same tendency to steal a loaf of bread ...
Significantly , Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in The Spirit Level : Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better ( Allen Lane , 2009 ) demonstrate that more equal societies have less crime and smaller prison populations as well as consistently delivering other advantages such as better physical and mental health , lower rates of teenage pregnancy and obesity , and higher rates of literacy and social trust .
It is striking that on almost every index of quality of life or wellness there is a strong correlation between a country 's level of economic inequality and its social outcomes .
Of course that information was not around when Rothbard wrote his diatribe but it is a striking confirmation of the communist - anarchist position he distorts in order to mock .
While as an " Austrian " economist , Rothbard may happily dismiss this empirical evidence , the awkward fact is that more equal societies are better ones and have less crime .
As Kropotkin and others argued .
Showing that Marxists have no monopoly of spewing forth nonsense about anarchism , Rothbard asserted that :
" Irrationality indeed permeates almost all of the views of the left - wing anarchists .
They reject industrialism as well as private property , and tend to favor returning to the handicraft and simple peasant conditions or the Middle Ages . "
It would be interesting to discover which anarchists favoured a return to the Middle Ages or rejected " industrialism " , but sadly Rothbard did not feel that actually naming them would be of benefit to his potential readers .
Perhaps this silence is due to the awkward fact that no " left - wing " anarchist actually advocated such a rejection or return ?
If Rothbard had actually read , say , Kropotkin he would have discovered that he advocated the use of appropriate technology , the integration of workplaces and farming , the humanisation of industry and most definitely not their rejection .
While Marxists have tended to dismiss anarchists , particularly Kropotkin , along these exact same lines , it does not make it true .
The actual position advocated by anarchists , including Kropotkin , did not involve rejecting technology and industry , but rather the surely uncontroversial position that a free society would transform the industrial structure and technology that grew up under centuries of unfree society .
As Kropotkin repeatedly stressed , modern industry is shaped by the need to make profits and dominate markets .
Combine this with state intervention against the working class , and you quickly come to the conclusion that the " industrialism " that Rothbard takes for granted was the product of centuries of coercion and the exercise of political and economic power .
Apparently , for Rothbard , centuries of coercion in no way shaped the economy and that , without the state , exactly the same socio- economic system would have developed , with essentially the same industrial and class structure .
Rothbard then introduces a somewhat surreal point ( pun intended ! ) :
" They are fanatically in favor of modern art , which they consider ' anarchist ' art . "
Again , who is this " they " ?
He named no names , again .
Moreover , this statement is wonderfully irrelevant , raising the question " who cares ? "
And to make an equally irrelevant statement , is it not interesting that Stalin , like the Nazis , had a distinct hatred of modern art .
Who knows , perhaps he did so because he considered it " anarchist " too ?
One thing is sure , many modern art supporters and artists that they were the most important bulwark against totalitarianism and its repression represented a warning that individual liberties were being threatened .
Rothbard continued to make his broad and decidedly vague accusations against communist - anarchists :
" They have an intense hatred of money and of material improvements .
Living a simple peasant existence , in communes , is extolled as ' living the anarchist life , ' while a civilized person is supposed to be viciously bourgeois and unanarchist . "
" They " ?
Who , exactly ?
Again , Rothbard named no names .
As such , it makes it hard to determine whether anarchists do wish to live " a simple peasant existence , in communes " .
It is well - known , of course , that Kropotkin suggested that a free society would combine industry and agriculture in a decentralised economic system but that was hardly a " peasant existence " nor did it reject " material improvements " .
As for " communes " , that suggests a blissful ignorance of anarchist history as well as theory given that anarchists saw communes embrace whole towns and cities ( with the Paris Commune giving a concrete example of what was desired ) .
That is hard to square with a " a simple peasant existence " and so , unsurprisingly , went unmentioned .
And what , may we ask , makes a person " civilised " ?
By what criteria is being " bourgeois " civilised ?
But , yes , an employer of wage slaves ( an actual bourgeois ) would be " unanarchist " as , by definition , anarchism is against masters and slaves , against social relationships based on power , authority , oppression and exploitation .
Rothbard then concluded : " Considering the dominant anarchists , it is obvious that the question ' are libertarians anarchists ? ' must be answered unhesitatingly in the negative .
We are at completely opposite poles . "
And ignoring the unsubstantiated assertions , smears and errors , Rothbard 's conclusion is right -- it is obvious that propertarians are not communist anarchists , that they are " at completely opposite poles . "
However , communist - anarchism is not the only school of anarchism .
Rothbard noted that " [ c]onfusion enters " because of " the existence in the past , particularly in the United States , of a small but brilliant group of ' individualist anarchists ' headed by Benjamin R. Tucker . "
This is , he states , " a different breed " who " have contributed a great deal to libertarian thought . "
Needless to say , he used the term " libertarian " in the ( incorrect ) propertarian sense and in that ( incorrect ) sense it is questionable how much they did contribute to propertarianism .
While certain of their ideas have been inserted ( in a suitably modified form ) into propertarianism , the economic and social context of these ideas have been ignored .
This cannot help present a somewhat skewed notion of what the individualist anarchist desired and how close they are to propertarianism or , for that matter , communist anarchism .
So " [ c] onfusion enters " only if you ignore the social context in which Individualist Anarchism developed and if you have an ideologically coloured notion of what socialism is .
Somewhat strangely , Rothbard states that " [ i ] n the political sphere , the individualist anarchists were generally sound libertarians .
They favored private property , extolled free competition , and battled all forms of governmental intervention . "
Since when was free competition political rather than economic ?
And to proclaim they " favored private property " is somewhat at odds with the later acknowledgement that they " failed to advocate defense of private landholdings beyond what the owner used personally " !
In a predominantly agricultural society , such a position was not only considered an attack on the rights of private property ( as Rothbard implies ) but also a radical transformation of the economy .
As for " all forms of governmental intervention " that included defence of capitalist property rights in land and housing ( Tucker regarded a tenant of a house " as the occupant and user of the land on which the house stands , and as the owner of the house itself . "
[ Liberty , no. 308 , p. 4 ] ) .
" Politically , " Rothbard continued , " the Tucker anarchists had two principal defects : ( 1 ) they failed to advocate defense of private landholdings beyond what the owner used personally ; ( 2 ) they relied too heavily on juries and failed to see the necessity for a body of constitutional libertarian law which the private courts would have to uphold . "
Yet , the Tucker anarchists did not consider these as being remotely defects -- quite the reverse .
Indeed ,
Tucker spent some time arguing against Rothbard 's preferred property rights in land based on valid libertarian principles :
" I put the right of occupancy and use above the right of contract . . . principally by my interest in the right of contract .
Without such a preference the theory of occupancy and use is utterly untenable ; without it . . . it would be possible for an individual to acquire , and hold simultaneously , virtual titles to innumerable parcels of land , by the merest show of labour performed thereon . . .
[ This would lead to ] the virtual ownership of the entire world by a small fraction of its inhabitants . . . [ which would see ] the right of contract , if not destroyed absolutely , would surely be impaired in an intolerable degree . "
[ Liberty , no. 350 , p. 4 ]
It should be noted that this critique caused problems with another propertarian thinker of the time , Auberon Herbert .
Somewhat ironically , Tucker would have joined Proudhon , Bakunin and Kropotkin in " the private courts " if they had practiced what they preached and refused to pay rent .
After all , that would be a crime under Rothbard 's " constitutional libertarian law " and it would be unlikely that a wealthy private judge would be as moved as a jury by the arguments used to defend their actions !
And what , exactly , is the difference between a monopoly " constitutional libertarian law " and the state , other than the former , like a dictatorship , would not be subject to democratic change ?
It should also be noted that Rothbard 's wish to defend landlords just proves Kropotkin 's point :
" Political economy -- that pseudo - science of the bourgeoisie -- does not cease to give praise in every way to the benefits of individual property . . . [ Yet ] the economists do not conclude , ' The land to him who cultivates it . '
On the contrary , they hasten to deduce from the situation , ' The land to the lord who will get it cultivated by wage earners ! ' "
[ Words of a Rebel , p. 209-10 ]
However , while they had " minor political failings " the Tucker anarchists had " grievous economic error " .
First off , they " believed that interest and profit were exploitative " ( not to mention rent ! ) and this was caused by " an allegedly artificial restriction on the money supply . "
Their goal , apparently , was to establish free banking in which " everyone would print as much money as he needed , and interest and profits would fall to zero . "
Of course , this is simply nonsense ( and it gives some of Rothbard 's assertions on communist - anarchism a run for its money in terms of being inaccurate ! ) .
For the Tucker anarchists , free banking simply meant that banks did not need specie to issue money and credit , rather people would use other forms of property as collateral .
It would not be printing money , but rather the creation of credit for people seeking to produce more goods and services .
In other words , they expressed a clear understanding of how a modern credit economy would work -- in stark contrast to Rothbard 's " Austrian " position which assumes his logical deductions are more significant than the activities of an industry which have evolved over centuries .
Rest assured , though , the " economic fallacies of the Tuckerites . . . still permitted them to advocate a nearly libertarian system " !
Yet if the economic base of their political system do not exist , if aspects of their system are grafted onto a deeply unequal society marked by accumulation of wealth via interest , rent and profit , then their system would turn into the opposite of what they desired .
Rather than ended the power of the capitalist and landlord class over society , the private courts would be imposing the private power of these classes , a power enshrined in the " constitutional libertarian law " .
As individualist anarchist Laurance Labadie put it :
" Mere common sense would suggest that any court would be influenced by experience ; and any free - market court or judge would in the very nature of things have some precedents guiding them in their instructions to a jury .
But since no case is exactly the same , a jury would have considerable say about the heinousness of the offence in each case , realising that circumstances alter cases , and prescribing penalty accordingly .
This appeared to Spooner and Tucker to be a more flexible and equitable administration of justice possible or feasible , human beings being w hat they are . . .
" But when Mr. Rothbard quibbles about the jurisprudential ideas of Spooner and Tucker , and at the same time upholds presumably in his courts the very economic evils which are at bottom the very reason for human contention and conflict , he would seem to be a man who chokes at a gnat while swallowing a camel . " [ quoted by Mildred J. Loomis and Mark A. Sullivan , " Laurance Labadie : Keeper Of The Flame " , pp. 116-30 , Benjamin R. Tucker and the Champions of Liberty , Coughlin , Hamilton and Sullivan ( eds. ) , p. 124 ]
Many a subsequent propertarian has echoed Rothbard 's notion that " superficial might easily confuse the two " schools because the individualists were led to attack ' capitalists ' , whom they felt were exploiting the workers through State restriction of the money supply . "
Yet Rothbard himself fell into this allegedly " superficial " perspective by acknowledging that " all the anarchist groups . . . possessed socialistic economic doctrines in common " and that " even the best of them " had " socialistic elements in their doctrines " .
Clearly , confusing the two schools of anarchism may not be so " superficial " after all !
This acknowledgement of reality came when he asserted that " [ m ] any libertarian thinkers in that Golden Age of liberalism were working on doctrines that were similar in many respects " although these " genuine libertarians never referred to themselves as anarchists . "
The reason seems clear : " probably the main reason was that all the anarchist groups , even the right - wingers [ sic ! ] , possessed socialistic economic doctrines in common . "
Apparently these " genuine libertarians " were also " superficial " ...
It would have been nice to know who these " genuine " libertarians actually were .
Presumably , one of them would have been Molinari , someone propertarians generally point to as inventing " market anarchism " even though he never called himself an anarchist .
Assuming that Rothbard meant Molinari , it should be noted that his position was unique -- he was the sole defender of such free - market justice at the time in France .
It must also be noted that no one , including these so - called " genuine libertarians " , ever referred to them as " libertarians " at the time .
This " Golden Age of liberalism " not only produced anarchism in opposition to it , it also saw anarchists across the globe use the word " libertarian " to describe their ideas from 1858 onwards !
And , needless to say , surely the fact that " all " anarchists were " socialistic " is significant ?
Rothbard gets to his conclusion :
" We must therefore turn to history for enlightenment ; here we find that none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position , that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines . . . we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists . . .
We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists , and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground , and are being completely unhistorical . "
How very true ( bar the " irrational collectivists " nonsense , of course ) !
As argued by most anarchists ever since and as proven in An Anarchist FAQ !
It may be argued that as Rothbard did not publish his article , it makes little sense to discuss it .
This is not the case , particularly given that elements of this article subsequently appeared in two other published pieces ( " The Spooner - Tucker Doctrine : An Economist 's View " and the charmingly entitled " The Death Wish of the Anarcho - Communists " ) .
More importantly , Rothbard 's conclusion was correct .
Attempts to include " anarcho " - capitalism into anarchism are " completely unhistorical " and are not " on firm etymological ground " .
His conclusion that all schools of anarchism have " socialistic elements in their doctrines " confirms what anarchists have long argued , as does his admission that " We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists . "
That Rothbard at one stage acknowledged the obvious is significant and should be commented upon , just as his slanders and distortions about anarchism should pointed out and corrected .
An Iraq War veteran who served with the company shown in the “ Collateral Murder ” video released by whistleblower web site Wikileaks says the military trained him to dehumanize Iraqis .
In a videotaped interview released Wednesday , Josh Stieber told The Real News Network things that troops did on a regular basis in basic training , including chanting during marches , were the start of his loss of faith in the US military .

Josh Stieber enlisted in the army after graduating high school .
He was deployed to Baghdad from February 2007 to April 2008 with the military company shown on the ground in the Collateral Murder video .
He was granted conscientious objector status upon his return home from Baghdad .
In an interview with Real News Network senior editor Paul Jay , Steiber said he was alarmed in basic training when the chants “ even joked about killing women and children . ”
STIEBER : One that stands out in my mind isÃ¢â‚¬â€ it goes , “ I went down to the market where all the women shop / I pulled out my machete and I begin to chop / I went down to the park where all the children play / I pulled out my machine gun and I begin to spray . ”
JAY : That ’s as you ’re marching .
STIEBER : Right .
JAY : So this is , like , an authorized chant , you could say .
STIEBER : Yeah .
I mean , the training , they focus on the physical aspect , or , you know , they say that ’s the challenging part , but then they slip all these psychological things in along with it .
JAY : Well , that ’s got to be shocking for you to hear that the first time .
STIEBER : Yeah .
And so I started writing home to religious leaders at my church , saying what I ’m being asked to do does n’t really line up with , you know , all these religious beliefs I had .
And I would get letters back with explanations that I needed to have more faith in God , or this is just how the military works .
The common mindset was that Iraqis were always referred to as “ Hajis ” in a pattern he said dehumanized people , making it more difficult for soldiers to empathize with civilians .
“ So there was that mindset , combined with this mindset , that if you do n’t do everything you ’re trained to do and if you ’re not being the best soldier that you can be , then these Iraqis , you know , at some point or another , are going to attack you , ” he said .

“ You know , if you ’re in a combat situation and you ’re not doing everything that you were taught , then you ’re exposing yourself and your friends to being open to attack .
So that was very much fear mongering , from that point of view . ”
US military personnel apparently mistook the cameras slung over the backs of two Reuters journalists for weapons when they opened fire on them and a group of people in a Baghdad suburb in 2007 , according to video footage released in April by whistleblower Web site Wikileaks .
As RAWSTORY reported at the time , the video showed the deaths of Reuters journalists Namir Noor - Eldeen , 22 and Saeed Chmagh , 40 , along with six other people on a street corner .
It also shows US forces firing on a minivan in which two injured children were found .
Psychology is the science that deals with behavior and mental processes , and professionals who work in the field research and study in order to better understand the role of mental functions and how they affect social behavior .
It is a complex field that encompasses many branches , from developmental , gender and race , social , abnormal and even more specialties .
This study can often overlap with counseling , as both professions deal with studying different mental processes , brain functions , and how emotional and mental disorders affect the lives and behaviors of the patients they work with .
If you ’re interested in psychology , counseling or studying the functions of the human brain , there are many free courses you can take to get a better idea of which specialty most interests you and which direction to take in furthering your education .

I " ve got a big thick dick myself but would rather have one inside me .
2009 has been an amazing year in the world of robots and Singularity Hub is here to tell you all about it !
Thats right , its time to unveil our second annual roundup of the best robots of the year .
In 2009 robots continued their advance towards world domination with several impressive breakouts in areas such as walking , automation , and agility , while still lacking in adaptability and reasoning ability .
It will be several years until robots can gain the artificial intelligence that will truly make them remarkable , but in the meantime they are still pretty awesome .
If you have n’t seen it yet you wo n’t want to miss our best robots of 2008 story from last year , but now lets not delay any further and get on with the best robots of 2009 :
Industrial / Manufacturing Robots
Nextage , the latest humanoid robot from Kawada , and the Motoman SDA 10 both put on impressive manufacturing demonstrations this year in the videos below .
When watching the videos it is easy to see why factory workers should be terrified for their job security .
The robots demonstrate agility with their hands , the ability to work together , and the ability to divide portions of a complex task amongst themselves .
As with all robots these days , these humanoid manufacturing robots are superior to humans in strength , endurance , and dependability , but seem ill equipped to adapt to changing situations that have not been anticipated ahead of time .
And yet the path is clear – these robots will get even more capable and adaptable with each passing year .
Factory workers look out !
Of course for most industrial applications humanoid robots are not needed .
In these cases the humans are n’t losing their jobs … they have already lost them .
Across the globe humans have been replaced and improved with countless incredible robots that are designed to perform one type of task with repetition and speed that is simply beyond human .
One of our favorite examples of robotic manufacturing prowess is in the task of sorting and moving all manner of objects , from pancakes , to sausages , to screws and bolts .
The flexpicker is one of our favorites in this category .
Check it out :
The flexpicker is not the only player in the sorting game , nor is it even the undisputed champ .
Late in 2009 Adept Technology claimed that its Quattro s650 was the world ’s fastest sorting / packing robot on the planet .
Watch this workhorse in action below :
When it comes to industrial robots , it is n’t always about speed .
Sometimes the name of the game is agility , range of motion , and versatility .
In such cases , the 2009 debut of ABB ’s IRB120 was a powerful entrant to the field , offering the versatility of a human arm , but with the strength and endurance for repetition that we expect from robots .
The IRB120 is “ ABB ’s smallest ever multipurpose industrial robot weighing just 25kg and capable of handling a payload of 3 kg ( 4kg for vertical wrist ) with a reach of 580 mm . ”
See this robotic wonder below :
Lest you think industrial robots are destined to remain hidden behind the relatively closed doors of manufacturing facilities , witness perhaps my favorite robot demonstration of the year – robotic chefs in a Japanese raman noodle restaurant !
The robots are fully autonomous , taking a customer order and cooking it from start to finish .
This includes boiling the noodles , pouring broth , adding spices and toppings , and so on .
The orders are complex too , requiring the robots to take customer preference for amount and type of sauce , salt , noodle , and so on .
The finished product is handed off to a human server who brings the food to the customer ’s table .
The irony could not be more real as we witness the lowly human in the role of a mere server while the robot takes on the cooking :
With such awesome capabilities in tow , we should n’t be surprised that these robots ( or at least their human creators ) exhibit an urge to show off from time to time .
In October 2009 ABB Robotics stunned us with its “ Fanta Challenges ” where ABB robots move metal rods in between six packs of Fanta soda cans at a blistering pace with only 1 millimeter of clearance between the metal rod and the cans .
The feat would already be impressive if the 6 pack of cans was stationary , but then ABB ups the ante by putting the cans on a tray and programming another robot to rapidly move the tray around .
Do n’t miss the video below :
Humanoid Robots
In the world of humanoid robots , 2009 was a bumper year with some outstanding demonstrations from multiple efforts around the world .
By far our favorite humanoid demonstration of the year comes from robotic phenom Boston Robotics and its latest robot dubbed Petman .
In the video below , watch in awe as the humanoid Petman robot conquers the treadmill in classic human style :
Right on the heels of Petman was the Dexter humanoid robot from Anybots , just up the street from Hub Headquarters in Silicon Valley .
Dexter can remain stable on its two legs as it jumps , walks , and is even kicked by nearby human .
Pretty sweet :
A surprising entrant into the humanoid robot field this year came from Toyota as part of its now multi- year partner robot effort .
The Toyota robot to our knowledge is the fastest large scale humanoid robot on the planet right now with an ability to run at an impressive 7 Km / hr ( 4 mph ) .
Check out this running humanoid in action below :
Willow Garage made waves in the world of humanoid robots , not just for creating a robot , but more importantly for creating an open source platform upon which the entire world can build robots of the future .
In 2009 Willow Garage announced that it had achieved its second major milestone : getting a robot to navigate it ’s way around their labs , identifying and plugging itself into electrical outlets .
The Personal Robot mark 2 ( PR2 ) wandered around the labs , opening doors , and plugging in to 9 different outlets and identifying one that was unreachable .
See below :
Although most of the robots we cover seem to come from Japan and the US , Europe held its own this year with progress from their Justin humanoid robot program .
Justin is a collaboration between the University of Napoli and the German Space Agency , DLR under a European project called Physical Human - Robot Interaction : Dependability and Safety .
The Justin robot features software algorithms that allows the hands and arms to dynamically react to their environment and to each other to avoid collision and complete tasks :
The ASIMO robot has consistently been a perennial player in the humanoid robotics genre , and 2009 was not exception .
At Carnegie Mellon , researchers were able to teach ASIMO to dynamically navigate around cut out shapes that represented real - world barriers .
Able to dodge spinning blades , Frogger - like moving lines , and dynamic environments , ASIMO showed us again why its one of the top humanoid bots out there :
Random Other Awesome Robots
The Blob Bot from iRobot defnitely stacks up as one of the more interesting robots of the year .
Keeping in tune with several scifi visions from past and present , the blob bot is a first generation attempt at creating a robot that can morph itself to slip through cracks or even resemble other objects .
The blob bot is built of a shell of many jammable silicone sacs with a central fluid reservoir in the center .
By controlling pressure in each sac and the center reservoir , the blob can expand and contract in order to change shape and flop around .
This robot is nowhere near to becoming anything more than a novel prototype for now , but still it deserves an honorable mention for breaking some exciting ground .
A true solution to this type of robot will likely use some sort of nanotechnology , and would thus appear to be decades away from realization :
Another interesting robot this year was the DASH robot from UC Berkeley .
DASH or Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod is a six legged robot made from cardboard and polymer .
It ’s the size of your open hand , weighs just 16 grams , can run up to 1.5 m/s , and survives falls of 28 meters without damage !
This cockroach bot is really something to behold :
The stickybot from Stanford has been around for a number of years , but in 2009 the gecko inspired wall climbing robot underwent its third revision and is now more capable than ever .
The robot looks almost exactly like a gecko and the adhesive on its padded feet are derived from the tiny hairs the lizards use to cling .
The dry adhesive technique uses micro-hairs and intramolecular ( van der waals ) forces to stick bot to wall .
i Robot impressed us earlier this year with video footage of a pocket sized robotic scout it has been building for the army .
The robotic scout is small and able to conquer rugged terrain .
By itself the robot does n’t look like much , but it does n’t take much imagination to envision the power of a fleet of hundreds or thousands of these things taking video , picking up samples , planting bombs , and generally wreaking havoc in enemy or even civilian territory .

Although the robots themselves are fairly simple , MIT ’s creation of robotic gardeners is so cool that they have earned their way into our roundup of the year ’s best robots .
MIT ’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( CSAIL ) is pioneering the field of automated farming .
During a semester long experiment , CSAIL ’s researchers created a laboratory farm : tomato plants in terra cotta pots with artificial turf for grass .
The goal of the experiment : to see if these tomatoes could be grown , tended , and harvested by robot caretakers .
Enjoy the video below :
The HRP - 4C showed in 2009 that robots can be useful AND look good while doing it by wowing the world with its female manga style hottie robot .
Of course there are no technical barriers to making robots look more human , but nevertheless robot makers rarely try to make their creations look too human , perhaps in respect to human fear of the uncanny valley .
Even in the case of the HRP - 4C , we hear that the creators intentionally limited how lifelike their robot hottie would look .
The positive and overwhelming press that this robot received , however , should serve as a sign to robot creators that the public is indeed ready to see more lifelike robots .
Well , that ends our roundup of the best robots of 2009 .
There are dozens of other awesome robots that did n’t make the cut and certainly a few have somehow evaded our radar .
Feel free to post links to other great robots in the comments .
In the meantime , my cyborg implant is telling me that some awesome robots are going to come out of the gate first thing in 2010 , so why not follow our RSS feed and stay tuned for more !
A year later , two now widely quoted studies were published that pushed aside the fairly obscure academic papers they corroborated : University of Chicago geophysicists Eshel and Martin produced an econometric analysis of U.S. emissions , and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization released its global analysis , " Livestock 's Long Shadow . "
They used very different data sets and approaches , but both made a strong case that the food system ( broadly defined ) contributed more to climate change than the transportation sector .
Were n't our cars the main culprits ?
How could the food system matter more ?
An ideological war thus engaged .
On one side , vegetarian and animal rights activists had a new reason to call on consumers to shun meat .
On the other were individuals who saw these calls as attacks on their personal right to eat whatever they wanted .
And the beef industry — for a while anyway — was absent from the debate .
The beef industry is silent no more .
Voluntary rancher fees from an industry association 's advocacy program have underwritten pro-meat marketing campaigns , stipends for researchers to raise doubts ( but not conclusive evidence ) about scientific studies , and dissemination of talking points that are misleading at best .
" Reducing intakes of meat and dairy would only lead to hunger , " I read recently , and the headline of an industry newsletter stated , " Meat and dairy intakes not linked to climate change . "
These news items represent a disturbing trend : raise doubts , obfuscate the facts , and misinform .
I debated a rancher on Fox News in January 2009 who claimed that his cows did n't contribute to global warming " because they eat grass . "
This is similar to a claim put forth in a grass - fed cattle rancher 's newsletter that his beef " is carbon neutral " because cows " are part of the carbon cycle .
...
They are born , they eat , they die , they return to the soil . "
Well , so are humans , and our choices matter too .
There are lots of reasons to support small - scale , pasture - raised beef versus CAFO - produced , but carbon neutrality sure is n't one of them .
The FAO report held livestock emissions responsible for 18 percent of global greenhouse gases , more than the transportation sector .
This percentage has been criticized recently as being too high .
The FAO is re-evaluating its calculations — for the transportation sector — in response to complaints that they were understated .
In other words , despite the headlines that would have you believe otherwise , what 's at stake are the livestock and transportation sectors ' relative percentage contributions to climate change , not the total amount of livestock emissions .
Perhaps our cars are equally culpable , but where 's the good news in that conclusion ?
I applaud the ranchers who are genuinely working to improve waste management ( the biggest variable in emissions ) or trying different animal forages that might lead to fewer emissions ( nothing is yet conclusive ) .
But an increasing number of independent studies continue to show that beef imposes a higher climate - change burden than plant - based foods we can eat directly , regardless of production methods ( pasture - or feedlot - based ) or many ranchers ' honest efforts at land stewardship .
One study equated the emissions associated with each American 's three and a half pounds of weekly meat consumption with the emissions of driving an efficient car 200 miles .
It has been nearly a decade since President George W. Bush chose arrogance over humility as the basis of American foreign policy .
The intervening years have not been good for the United States or the Republican Party .
As the GOP seeks to take back the White House it needs to conduct a serious foreign policy debate .
Republicans should start by listening to Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .
At the recent Southern Republican Leadership Conference big spending Mitt Romney bested Rep .
Paul by just one vote in the popularity contest .
Yet Paul eschewed reliance on easy applause lines and challenged the newfound Republican fondness for big militaries and constant wars .
For instance , Paul observed that conservatives , like liberals , enjoyed spending money , only " on different things .
They like embassies , and they like occupation .
They like the empire .
They like to be in 135 countries and 700 bases . "
Similarly , Paul said , conservatives talked about following the Constitution , " except for war .
Let the president go to war anytime they want . "
Paul garnered applause from more youthful members of the audience .
But boos were heard as well .
Many establishment GOP activists appear to have become wedded to a big - government foreign policy .
When Politico polled activists and analysts about why the GOP mainstream was hostile to Paul , James Carafano of the Heritage Foundation complained that " The deliberate self - weakening of America is an invitation to disaster . "
Carafano argued that Paul failed to fulfill the constitutional obligation to " provide for the common defense " and that the latter 's vision would not keep America " safe , free , and prosperous . "
Yet Washington 's policy of promiscuous intervention is not providing for America 's " common defense . "
Rather , the U.S. is protecting virtually every other nation .
That 's one reason why the Pentagon was incapable of defending Americans when the U.S. was attacked on 9/11 ,
Indeed , the " Defense Department " has become anything but .
Most of America 's forces do nothing to secure the U.S.
They instead are employed to remake failed societies , impose Washington 's meddlesome dictates , and subsidize populous and prosperous allies .
Do the Europeans want someone to stop a civil war in Yugoslavia ?
They leave it to Americans .
Do the Georgians want someone to protect them after they start a war with Russia ?
Tbilisi begs Washington .
Do the South Koreans hope to subsidize North Korea while someone else guarantees their security ?
The South Korean " Blue House " calls the American " White House . "
Do the Japanese want to concentrate on economic development while leaving the protection of regional security to another country ?
They turn to the U.S.
Do the Israelis want someone else to disarm Iran ?
They call on Washington .
And in every case the Republican elite willingly answers " yes , " spending Americans ' money to provide for most every other nations ' defense .
The Europeans might have a larger collective GDP and population .
The South Koreans might enjoy a GDP 40 times that of the North .
Japan might have the world 's second largest economy .
Israel might be a regional superpower with up to 200 nuclear weapons .
Yet in GOP eyes all are helpless American dependents , to be defended by Washington at all cost - and apparently forever .
This policy has made America weaker .
We are less " safe , free , and prosperous " as a result .
America 's safety is compromised because we are more often at war and at risk of war .
Indeed , intervening promiscuously and setting tripwires around the world has kept the U.S. involved in conflict almost constantly after the Cold War .
Iraq is the most obvious disaster .
More than 4,000 dead and tens of thousands maimed or injured Americans .
Total cost likely to hit $ 2 trillion .
The U.S. military overstretched .
Iran 's strategic position greatly strengthened .
In fact , many Republican legislators apparently have come to recognize reality in Iraq .
When asked how many GOP congressmen believed that the Iraq war had been a mistake , a panel of three Republican members at a recent Cato Institute conference agreed : " almost all of us . "
But it could be far worse .
It appears that top Bush administration officials debated launching air strikes against Russian forces during Moscow 's conflict with Georgia .
Ponder the thought :
After the U.S. made it through the Cold War without getting into a shooting match with the Soviet Union , Washington officials considered attacking that nuclear - armed power to defend a country which : by most accounts other than its own started the fighting ; was not party to any military alliance or treaty with America ; and was irrelevant to U.S. security .
Had the administration initiated military action , the unsuspecting American people could have found themselves in a nuclear confrontation and even war in August 2008 .
Such are the risks to Americans ' safety when their government plays globocop .
The national security state also has made Americans less free .
A century ago social critic Randolph Bourne observed : " War is the health of the state . "
The U.S. was created as a constitutional republic , with a limited national government bounded by law .
Yet the last Republican administration claimed that the president could unilaterally , subject to review neither by Congress nor the courts , order the arrest and indefinite detention of American citizens in America .
In effect , the president asserted that he was an elected monarch or dictator , presumed infallible and beyond reproach .
The defining characteristic of the so - called Patriot Act and other such enactments was not the expansion of federal power , but the refusal to hold accountable those who exercised the new power .
Finally , Americans are less prosperous .
While U.S. citizens pay to defend dozens of nations around the world , those countries invest in business enterprises , economic research and development , and generous welfare states .
Trade competitors cheerfully accept U.S. military troops while excluding commercial products .
The defense budget is the price of our nation 's foreign policy , and the price is high .
The U.S. is spending more than $ 700 billion annually on the military .
In real terms that is more than at any point during the Cold War , Korean War , or Vietnam War .
Today America accounts for roughly half of the globe 's military outlays .
This is a year when the deficit will run almost $ 1.6 trillion .
When America faces $ 10 trillion in deficits over the next decade .
When Washington 's debt is climbing skyward .
And when Social Security and Medicare face unfunded liabilities of an astounding $ 107 trillion .
Yet Americans , like Ron Paul , who advocate a policy to actually make America safer , freer , and wealthier , are routinely vilified by Republican apparatchiks .
The Bush administration and its neoconservative supporters accused opponents of being defeatists and even traitors .
Politico guest contributor Robert White was more mild , merely accusing Paul of preaching " isolationism and appeasement " and of not appearing to be " strong on national defense . "
For these Republicans opposition to bombing or invading other nations is " isolationist . "
Failing to view war or the threat of war as the best response to every foreign problem is " appeasement . "
In fact , war should always be a last resort , a matter of necessity rather than choice .
And we can learn much from the Cold War : there were enthusiastic advocates of preventive war against both the Soviet Union and China , but deterrence kept the peace against the likes of Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong .
In retrospect the latter policy looks good compared to the potential of triggering World War III .
Moreover , intervention and conflict beget intervention and conflict .
America 's troubles with Iran began in 1953 with the CIA - backed coup d'etat against the democratically elected government .
Washington 's support for the autocratic Shah sowed the seeds which turned into the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Fear of aggressive Islamic fundamentalism caused the Reagan administration to back Saddam Hussein in the 1980s after he invaded Iran .
That encouraged Baghdad to invade Kuwait .
Then came the first Gulf War and Washington 's stationing of troops in Saudi Arabia .
Those forces later were targeted in the Khobar barracks bombings ; the U.S. presence also inflamed hostility from the likes of Osama bin Laden .
According to Paul Wolfowitz , a desire to bring home those forces was a benefit of the Iraq war .
But the Iraq invasion empowered Iran , now accused of pursuing the Shah 's dream of nuclear weapons .
So Washington 's sofa samurai are demanding that bombers be sent forthwith against Tehran .
It would have been much better in 1953 had Washington 's coup plotters stayed home .
Much brutality , war , and horror might have been avoided .
Ron Paul is n't likely to be the GOP presidential nominee in 2012 whatever position he takes on foreign policy .
But for the last decade GOP politicians have inflated foreign threats , ignored military costs , and disregarded America 's interests in their search for political advantage .
If the Republican Party wants to return to power - and especially if it genuinely wants to keep America " safe , free , and prosperous " - it will engage rather than dismiss Rep.
Paul 's critique of U.S. foreign policy .
Man commits suicide by shooting himself in the head - but ends up killing sleeping wife with same bullet
An American who committed suicide by shooting himself in the head ended up killing his wife with the same bullet .
Depressed Gene Whitmore , 70 , lay down next to his sleeping wife Betty and placed a gun to his head .
He fired a single shot , but police said the bullet went through his head and struck his 66 - year - old wife .
Tragic :
A police officer opens the door to the Wichita , Kansas home of Gene and Betty Whitmore after he committed suicide - accidentally killing his wife in the process
Their bodies were found just two feet apart .
Police in Wichita , Kansas , initially thought they were dealing with a murder - suicide .
But after an autopsy it was revealed the same medium calibre bullet had killed the couple who were married for more than 40 years .
Wichita Police Lieutenant Ken Landwehr said : ' I have never worked anything like this before ..
The bullet has travelled from his head from right to left and struck his wife . '
Landwehr said there was no indication Whitmore meant to harm his wife .
He was known to be depressed after losing his job a year ago .
Crime scene : The Whitmores ' home in Wichita .
Police said it appeared clear that Mr Whitmore did not intend to kill his wife
Police believe he waited until his daughter and her family , who were staying in their modest home , were asleep before retrieving his handgun .
As his wife slept next to him Whitmore laid down next to her and committed suicide .
Family members said they did not hear any gunfire in during the night .
The couple 's bodies were discovered by their daughter the following day when they failed to rise for breakfast .
Neighbours of the couple said they were shocked by their deaths .
Stacy Lopez said : ' There was no hint of any problems .
He was the type who always took in stray cats .
I can't believe this .'
The
Energy Information Administration
released new data yesterday showing that natural gas production in the U.S. reached an all - time historical monthly high in March of 2.313 trillion cubic feet , breaking the previous record of 2.28 trillion cubic feet set in March of last year by almost 33 billion cubic feet ( see graph ) .
As I have
reported previously
, the U.S. is now the world 's largest producer of natural gas , having surpassed Russia 's production last year to become the new "
Saudi Arabia of natural gas
. "
It 's all because of a breakthrough in drilling technology , involving the use of three - dimensional seismic imaging and hydraulic fracturing of shale rock , so that huge amounts of natural gas are being produced in New York , Pennsylvania , Texas , Louisiana and other states .
In 2000 , shale gas accounted for only about 1 % of our natural gas supply , but now about 20 % of gas comes from advanced shale drilling , and that breakthrough is responsible for boosting gas production to record high levels .

Advertisement A teacher who attacked a 14 - year - old pupil with a dumbbell has been given a two - year community order .
Peter Harvey , 50 , who hit the boy at All Saints ' Roman Catholic School , Mansfield , in July 2009 , pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm without intent .
The boy , a known troublemaker at the school , suffered a fractured skull .
The science teacher , who was signed off with depression for several months , was found not guilty of attempted murder at a trial at Nottingham Crown Court .
The court heard Harvey had been mocked by pupils moments before the attack and had shouted " die , die , die " as he bludgeoned the boy with the weight after the pupil swore at him .
You were undoubtedly suffering from depression , stress and a serious lack of confidence
Judge Michael Stokes QC
It emerged during the four - day trial that pupils at the school were trying to wind up Harvey so his reaction could be caught on a camcorder being used secretly by a girl in the class .
The footage was then to be passed around the school as a way of " humiliating " the teacher .
Harvey 's lawyer argued that he was in such a state when he battered the boy that he could not have possibly intended to kill or seriously harm him .
In December 2008 , the teacher told the school 's education advisor that he had had thoughts he would harm someone .
He was signed off sick for nearly five months and given counselling sessions by a therapist who told him he was too " peaceful and passive " and needed to be better at letting his anger out .
' Tragic case '
He then returned to work in April last year , reportedly feeling much better .
Passing sentence , Judge Michael Stokes QC said : " On any view this is a tragic case .
" You are a thoroughly decent man and for well over 20 years you have been a dedicated and successful school teacher .
His career , a job at which he excelled and which he loved , is in ruins
Chris Keates
NASUWT General Secretary " In previous years you would have handled this easily and professionally but in July of last year you were far from well .
" You were undoubtedly suffering from depression , stress and a serious lack of confidence . "
Chris Keates , General Secretary of the NASUWT union , said his employers at the school and Nottinghamshire County Council were seeking to dismiss the teacher rather than support his application for retirement because of illness .
She said : " His career , a job at which he excelled and which he loved , is in ruins .
The sentencing today does not end Mr Harvey 's ordeal . "
The county council said : " The governing body of All Saints School is dealing with the employment issues under their own internal procedures .
" It would therefore be inappropriate to discuss the details of Mr Harvey 's employment as these procedures are still under way . "

Social network service providers today are in a unique position .
They are intermediaries and hosts to our communications , conversations and connections with loved ones , family , friends and colleagues .
They have access to extremely sensitive information , including data gathered over time and from many different individuals .
Here at EFF , we 've been thinking a lot recently about what specific rights a responsible social network service should provide to its users .
Social network services must ensure that users have ongoing privacy and control over personal information stored with the service .
Users are not just a commodity , and their rights must be respected .
Innovation in social network services is important , but it must remain consistent with , rather than undermine , user privacy and control .
Based on what we see today , therefore , we suggest three basic privacy - protective principles that social network users should demand :
#1 : The Right to Informed Decision - Making
Users should have the right to a clear user interface that allows them to make informed choices about who sees their data and how it is used .
Users should be able to see readily who is entitled to access any particular piece of information about them , including other people , government officials , websites , applications , advertisers and advertising networks and services .
Whenever possible , a social network service should give users notice when the government or a private party uses legal or administrative processes to seek information about them , so that users have a meaningful opportunity to respond .
# 2 : The Right to Control
Social network services must ensure that users retain control over the use and disclosure of their data .
A social network service should take only a limited license to use data for the purpose for which it was originally given to the provider .
When the service wants to make a secondary use of the data , it must obtain explicit opt - in permission from the user .
The right to control includes users ' right to decide whether their friends may authorize the service to disclose their personal information to third - party websites and applications .
Social network services must ask their users ' permission before making any change that could share new data about users , share users ' data with new categories of people , or use that data in a new way .
Changes like this should be " opt - in " by default , not " opt- out , " meaning that users ' data is not shared unless a user makes an informed decision to share it .
If a social network service is adding some functionality that its users really want , then it should not have to resort to unclear or misleading interfaces to get people to use it .
# 3 : The Right to Leave
Users giveth , and users should have the right to taketh away .
One of the most basic ways that users can protect their privacy is by leaving a social network service that does not sufficiently protect it .
Therefore , a user should have the right to delete data or her entire account from a social network service .
And we mean really delete .
It is not enough for a service to disable access to data while continuing to store or use it .
It should be permanently eliminated from the service 's servers .
Furthermore , if users decide to leave a social network service , they should be able to easily , efficiently and freely take their uploaded information away from that service and move it to a different one in a usable format .
This concept , known as " data portability " or " data liberation , " is fundamental to promote competition and ensure that users truly maintain control over their information , even if they sever their relationship with a particular service .

WASHINGTON — Some people fall on their heads and wake up with their memories wiped out .
A few revive with their personalities totally changed .
Others die .
Robin Jenks Vanderlip fell down a stairwell , smacked her head and woke up speaking with a Russian accent .
Vanderlip has never been to Russia .
She does n't remember ever hearing a Russian accent .
She lives in Fairfax County , Va. , was born in Pennsylvania and went to college on the Eastern Shore .
Yet since that fall in May 2007 , the first question she gets from strangers is : " Where are you from ? "
" They say your life can change in an instant , " she said in what sounds like a thick Russian accent .
" Mine did . "
For 42 years , Vanderlip , whose case is being studied at the National Institutes of Health and the University of Maryland , spoke with what NIH neurologist Allen Braun called a typical mid-Atlantic American accent .
But since the fall , her clipped way with consonants — dropping the final " s " from some plural words , saying " dis " and " dat " for " this " and " that " or " wiz " instead of " with " — and her formation of vowels — " home " sounds more like " herm , " " well " sounds like " wuhl " — identify her more like a transplant from Moscow .
The more fatigued she becomes , the thicker her accent grows .
What she has , Braun and other doctors say , is Foreign Accent Syndrome — a legitimate though rare and little understood medical condition that can follow a serious brain injury .
" It does sound strange , " Braun said .
" It certainly does sound like someone has a foreign accent . "
The syndrome was first described by a neurologist in the closing days of World War II , when a Norwegian woman injured by a shrapnel hit to the head fell into a coma and woke up speaking — most unfortunately for her — with a German accent .
( Fellow Norwegians ostracized her as a result , according to the medical literature . )
Since then , fewer than 60 cases have been reported worldwide .
Puzzled doctors have studied a Louisiana woman who , after a brain injury , suddenly began speaking with a Cajun dialect ; a woman from the Newcastle region of England who speaks like a Jamaican ; and a Boston man who developed what sounded like a Scottish burr .
There are Americans who have developed British - sounding accents , Britons who sound French , a Japanese stroke patient with a Korean accent , and a Spanish speaker who acquired a thick Hungarian accent .
" The first time I heard about Foreign Accent Syndrome , I thought , ` This is not true , this is somebody 's joke , ' " said Julius Fridriksson , who has studied brain images of patients suffering from the malady at the University of South Carolina , and who , as a native of Iceland , speaks English with a slight accent .
Then he began working with a patient who spoke with a southern U.S. accent all his life but woke from a stroke sounding like a proper British gent .
" This was an accent he could not control . "
Scientists are quick to point out that these are not bona fide accents .
( And none of the patients has spontaneously learned a foreign language . )
Rather , in a way no one quite understands , the damage to the brain disrupts speech formation .
Shelia Blumstein , a Brown University linguist who has written extensively on Foreign Accent Syndrome , said sufferers typically produce grammatically correct language , unlike many stroke or brain - injury victims .
But subtle changes in intonation and melody make syndrome sufferers sound foreign .
No amount of therapy , she said , seems to reverse that .
" I did have one patient who had a stroke and developed Foreign Accent Syndrome , then had another stroke and it disappeared .
" There is still so much we do n't know . "

Two days after her fall , Vanderlip awoke unable to speak .
Terrified , a friend called 911 and Vanderlip was rushed to the hospital , where an MRI showed she 'd had a stroke .
Working with a speech therapist , she was able to make rudimentary sounds and slowly relearn how to speak — but with a Russian - sounding accent .
When the accent remained even after Vanderlip regained speaking ability , a neurologist diagnosed Foreign Accent Syndrome .
Since the fall , it 's not only Vanderlip 's accent that has changed .
She 's become forgetful and tires easily .
Formerly loquacious and eloquent , friends say , she 's become introverted , can't speak coherently for more than 35 minutes at a time , and has lost her job as a regional manager for the nonprofit Operation Hope .
A single mother of two , she lives off savings and disability payments .
Andrew Uscher , a longtime friend , said many of Vanderlip 's friends have drifted away as she has struggled with her injury , financial issues and depression .
" When we go out , people just assume she 's from another country , " he said .
" It bothers her — not that people think she 's foreign instead of American , but that it does n't sound like her .
It 's not her normal speech pattern .
And we all like to be true to who we are . "
Nearly three years after she slipped on stairs at the National 4 - H Council building in Chevy Chase , Md. , grabbed for a handrail , hurled backwards , hit her head and screamed for help , Vanderlip filed suit in Montgomery County Circuit Court against the 4 - H , alleging that the stairs were unsafe and seeking at least $ 1 million in damages .
The 4 - H Council did not respond to a request for comment .
On her home answering machine , Vanderlip has preserved her old voice as a greeting .
" Please leave your message and we 'll get back to you as soon as we can . "
She sounds easy , confident , articulate .
And American .
Her eyes redden when she hears it .
" When I sound different , people think that I 'm different , " she said .
" To this day , my daughter is nervous about me going on field trips or working in the classroom , because she 's a little embarrassed about how I sound . "
Vanderlip , who is studying brain - injury education at George Washington University , said the incredulous looks she gets when she explains that she 's a native - born American can get wearing .
She watched , devastated , she said , as a Fox News Channel report on her lawsuit poked fun , with anchor Megyn Kelly repeatedly referring to her as " Inga from Sveden " and legal commentator Lis Wiehl saying , " She says she 's going to be damaged because now some people think she has this nice , sexy Danish accent ?
I do n't think so ! "
Since she began speaking like a foreigner , Vanderlip sometimes wants to be anywhere but here .
She and her children have started taking vacations abroad , where she can lose herself in a polyglot of accents .
" I feel there 's no one to judge me in a foreign country , " she said .
" I do n't feel so out of place . "
Arlington , Virginia ( CNN ) --
The man who authorities say shot and wounded two police officers outside the Pentagon Thursday before he was fatally shot had a history of mental health problems and a penchant for spouting anti-government conspiracy theories .
John Patrick
Bedell repeatedly tangled with police in recent months , while his relationship with his parents -- whom he lived with in a gated community in Northern California -- grew increasingly contentious .
" There 's a history of mental health problems with him that the family 's been dealing with for a number of years , " San Benito County , California , Sheriff Curtis Hill said Friday .
Bedell , 36 , suffered from bipolar disorder , according to court records from a 2006 California arrest for a man by the same name .
That man 's birth date matches the one authorities gave for the Pentagon shooter .
Bedell had been committed to mental institutions at least three or four times , according to Hill .
His ties to family had grown strained since late last year .
Two months ago , Bedell 's parents filed a missing person report about him , although he returned and the report was canceled two weeks later , Hill said .
Bedell 's mother had also come across " some information -- either from an e-mail received from a company , or an online posting on a bank account or something -- where on the 10th of January he had made a $ 600 purchase at a shooting range in the Sacramento area in California , " Hill said .
Bedell would not tell her what he bought , he said .
On Friday the FBI said they believe that Bedell drove to Washington , D.C. , and parked his car in a garage near the Pentagon .
Bedell " was very well dressed in a suit " and showed " no distress in his appearance " as he approached a screening area to enter Pentagon grounds about 6:40 p.m. Thursday evening , Pentagon Police Chief Richard S. Keevill said .
" He walked very directly to the officers and engaged , " Keevill said .
" He was very well armed .
I will tell you that he had two 9 mm semiautomatic weapons and many magazines . "
On Friday , a picture emerged of Bedell as a troubled man with an intense interest in science .
On the social networking Web site Linked In , a profile page for a J. Patrick Bedell in the San Francisco Bay Area -- where Bedell 's family lives -- described him as an " MSEE student , " short for Master of Science in Electrical Engineering .
The page said he graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz with a bachelor 's degree in physics in 1994 .
The LinkedIn page said that Bedell attended San Jose State University from 1995 to 1996 , but that he did not get a degree there .
In the missing person report filed in January , Bedell 's father said he worked in the San Jose area but that he did not know where .
Hill , the San Benito County sheriff , said the Bedell family filed the missing person report on January 4 , a day after Bedell was stopped in Texas for speeding as he traveled west .
The Texas Highway patrolman used Bedell 's cell phone to call Bedell 's family , Hill said .
" The highway patrolman wanted to know a little more information about him because when he stopped him for speeding , when he came up to the car , the interior of the vehicle was in ' disarray , ' " Hill said .
The patrolman spoke with Bedell 's mother , then gave him a warning and sent him on his way , Hill said .
The sheriff said the stop prompted the family to file the missing person report , Hill said .
In filing the report , Bedell 's father said John had been staying at an unknown address in San Jose after getting into a fight with his brother three weeks earlier .
It was n't Bedell 's first blowout with his brother .
In July 2006 , Bedell got into an altercation with Matthew Bedell and signed a citizen 's arrest to have him taken to jail and booked , Hill said .
A week after Bedell 's father filed the missing report in January , the parents called the police to say their son had shown up .
Authorities went to the family 's home , where the parents said Bedell " appeared to be impaired , delusional , and agitated , " according to Hill .
" The agitation ... was due to his mother asking him questions [ such as ] , ' Where have you been ?
What have you been doing ? ' "
Hill said .
She also asked him about the $ 600 purchase at the shooting range , he said .
" When she asked him to give her some details about what that purchase was , that 's when he became agitated and left the residence , " Hill said .
Authorities arrived after he had left , and although they gave out information on him to law enforcement agencies , they were not able to find him , Hill said .
The family told authorities that he had a " history of mental illness . "
On January 18 , Bedell 's father told authorities his son had returned home and that the missing person report should be canceled , Hill said .
According to the police report , Bedell was staying at an unknown address after stopping at home .
A couple weeks later , on February 1 , Bedell was picked up by police in Reno , Nevada , and charged with marijuana possession .
His court date was Tuesday , but Bedell failed to show up .
Court records from California show that investigators arrested a John Patrick Bedell in June 2006 on charges of cultivating marijuana and resisting arrest .
Bedell pleaded guilty .
" I sincerely request the court not find the offense to reflect a propensity for violence on my part , " he said in a signed statement in the case .
" I was experiencing an episode of mental illness ( bipolar disorder ) during the event in question . "
Court documents from the 2006 case also include a statement from Bedell 's psychiatrist confirming Bedell suffered from bipolar disorder and describing him as " relatively symptom - free when under medication . "
In an Internet posting , JPatrickBedell referred to being arrested in 2006 on marijuana charges .
" Given my belief that cannabis prohibition is the least defensible and most unjust aspect of the prohibitionist regime existing throughout the world today , I decided in March 2006 to cultivate cannabis in full view of the world , " the person said in a 2006 podcast .
Bedell appears to have been the same man who had railed against the government repeatedly on the Internet .
Through podcasts and a Wikipedia page , a man identified online as JPatrickBedell cast the government as a criminal force destroying personal liberties .
" This seizure of the United States government by an international criminal conspiracy is a long - established reality , " the man said in a podcast in November 2006 , which also was published as text online .
Such an organization , the man said , " would use its powers to convert military , intelligence , and law enforcement bureacracies ( sic ) into instruments for political control and the domination and subjection of society , while discrediting , destroying , and murdering honest individuals within those services that work to root out corruption and faithfully serve their fellow citizens . "
In a video posted on YouTube in October 2006 , a man identified as jpbedell talked about his idea for " information currency , " which he said would " create a financial market for information . "
The man in the video is the same man shown in a photograph of the shooter released Friday by the FBI .
The man 's voice in the YouTube video also sounds similar to the voice in the podcasts .
A person using the screen name JPatrickBedell wrote about the same idea on a Wikipedia page that was taken down early Friday .
The San Benito County sheriff read a statement from the family on Friday , saying that they were " devastated " by Thursday 's news .
" To the outside world , this tragedy is the first and only thing they will know of Patrick ; to us he was a beloved son , brother , grandson , nephew and cousin , " the family said , according to Hill .
" We may never know why he made this terrible decision .
One thing is certain , though , his actions were caused by an illness and not a defective character . "
They expressed hope for a quick recovery of the two wounded officers , and asked that the family 's privacy be respected .
" This is a well - respected longtime local family , " Hill told CNN on Friday .
" They 're a middle -- upper - middle class folks who are well known in the community .
They 're a good solid family . "
Hill said that Bedell 's father is a financial advisor and that his mother works at the local branch of the California - based Gavilan College .
At a news conference Friday morning , Keevill , the Pentagon police chief , said Pentagon and Metro cameras of the area show the gunman in the time leading up to the shooting .
He showed " no real emotion in his face " as he approached the officers , Keevill said .
He approached the officers Thursday evening and , when asked for identification , pulled a gun out of his pocket and began shooting , authorities said .
Officers Jeffrey Amos and Marvin Carraway returned fire with semiautomatic weapons , said Pentagon spokesman Terry Sutherland .
The two wounded officers had superficial injuries and were released from a hospital , officials said .
When officers located Bedell 's vehicle at a nearby parking garage , they found more ammunition inside , Keevill said .
Authorities do not know what the man 's motive may have been , he said .
Several versions of a 2004 scientific proposal to the Department of Defense , attributed to J. Patrick Bedell , exist in multiple locations on the Internet .
A 28 - page version of the proposal , " Aluminum Anodization for DNA Integrated Circuits , " lists Bedell as the sole employee for the project and estimates he would work 1,000 hours at $ 30 an hour for a total of $ 30,000 .
The proposal was a response to an April 2004 call from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , which provides research grants for projects related to defense .
It was not clear if Bedell ever submitted the proposal .
A DARPA spokesperson would not confirm whether the proposal was received , saying the agency could legally comment only on proposals it funded .
" Investigators are searching the car , conducting interviews and reviewing a video of the shooting in an effort to piece together a timeline of Bedell 's activities leading up the incident , " the FBI said in a news release .
CNN 's Dan Simon and Barbara Starr contributed to this report .
SCP - 432 Expedition 1
SCP - 432 Expedition 1
Date : ██-██-████
Expedition supervisor : Dr T S████
Subject is D - 64502 , male , average physique .
Subject 's background shows history of aggravated assault and burglary .
Subject is equipped with standard mission equipment pack and sent into SCP - 432 .
Camera is activated and subject enters SCP - 432 .
The door is held open by a 3kg weight placed inside the doorway , with technicians on hand to remove the weight and close the door if required .
Camera activates , showing a short corridor constructed from the same rusted , corroded metal as the exterior of SCP - 432 .
The floor is formed from ridged safety steel , as might be found on industrial walkways or gantries .
The corridor makes a 90 degree turn to the right approximately 5 meters ahead of the subject .
Control asks the subject to move around the corner .
Subject moves forward as requested , turning the corner into a longer tunnel , the exact length of which can not be judged due to lack of lighting .
A conventional electric bulb on the wall lights the immediate area , but the light fails to illuminate much beyond 3 meters .
Further lights can be observed ahead , though they only illuminate patches of the tunnel .
Control instructs the subject to turn on his torch and the lighting is notably improved to the limit of the torch 's beam ; approximately 20 meters .
Control asks the subject to proceed down the tunnel .
After approximately 42 meters a cross-roads appears in the tunnel .
D-64502 asks Control which way to go , and Control tells the subject to pick a tunnel .
The subject chooses to go left and , before entering the new tunnel , produces a stick of marker chalk from the equipment pack and draws a large arrow on the wall , indicating the direction of the exit .
As subject moves into new tunnel , Control notes that video quality has begun to degrade , with visible interference appearing on the monitors .
Control does not inform the subject of this .
Subject proceeds down new tunnel for 11 meters before tunnel t- junctions left and right .
Subject takes the left tunnel , again marking the direction back to the exit with chalk , and continues onwards .
Subject walks approximately 5 meters down the tunnel then stops and asks Control if they heard anything .
Control replies they did not and asks what D - 64502 heard .
Subject is quiet , as if listening , then replies in muted tones that he can hear someone banging on the wall in the distance and shouting .
Subject becomes agitated and tells Control the person sounds “ fucking scared ” .
Control boosts audio gain on the subjects camera and pick up sounds similar to the subject 's description ; repetitive distant banging consistent with someone striking a metal surface with their arm or hand .
A voice can be detected , but audio quality is not sufficient to discern words .
Subject is becoming increasingly agitated by the sounds .
Control informs the subject to move in the direction of the shouts , the subject objects but after a short discussion with Control about the nature of his employment he moves forward .
After approximately 14 meters the tunnel turns 90 degrees right and angles downwards in a gentle slope .
Video interference is now noticeably increased , and slight audio interference is now audible .
Subject has begun breathing heavily and muttering under his breath .
Subject continues down the tunnel for approximately 27 meters until the floor levels out again .
The subject abruptly stops , crouches , and swears .
Control asks why he has stopped .
The subject remains silent , but breathing has become louder and heavier .
Control asks again why the subject has stopped and D - 64502 replies he heard a scream and that the banging and shouting has suddenly stopped .
Control informs the subject to stand and move forward , but the subject becomes agitated and demands to be allowed to leave .
After several minutes of arguing the subject stands , takes a long drink from one of the bottles of water and moves forward again , although slowly .
Ahead the tunnel t- junctions left and right , and Control tells the subject to go right .
Subject marks the way back to the exit with chalk and goes right .
The tunnel ends in a dead - end after 6 meters .
Control informs the subject to go back to the junction and take the left tunnel .
This too ends in a dead end after only 4 meters .
Subject seems to have calmed slightly , and suggests returning to the previous t- junction and trying the other tunnel .
Control confers with
Dr █████ , who decides to recall the subject and analyse the data collected so far .
The subject has been within SCP - 432 for exactly 37 minutes at this point .
Control informs the subject to return .
The subject moves back through the tunnels , following his chalk marks towards the exit .
At cross-roads the subject freezes again and asks Control if they heard a noise .
Control confirms that they are detecting a sound but requests D - 64502 explain what he is hearing .
Subject identifies the noise as wind .
At this point the camera captures a small drift of what appear to be dead leaves blown from the right - hand unexplored tunnel .
Subject remarks that the breeze smells stale .
Control informs the subject to collect several leaves for analysis and then proceed down the right - hand tunnel to locate their source .
Subject collects leaves and complains about orders to remain in SCP - 432 but moves towards the tunnel mouth .
As subject nears the tunnel entrance , a loud , echoing roar is heard over the audio , similar to a large animal such as a bear or lion .
Subject panics , screams , and runs for the exit , ignoring Control 's demands to investigate the sound .
Subject sprints to the exit and collapses in the storage area .
Expedition is aborted , the door closed and locked and subject removed for debriefing .

Treasury officials have targeted child benefit payments for the middle classes under plans for sweeping cuts to bring the £ 164bn deficit under control .
The cuts are among proposals being presented to the new Conservative and Liberal Treasury team as it emerged that new policy commitments in the coalition agreement may have added up to £ 10bn to the government 's spending bill .
The Guardian has learned that the Treasury has for months been drawing up plans for cuts of more than 15 % in all departments other than the NHS and international development , where spending has been ring - fenced .
The Treasury is waiting for a report from the new Office of Budget Responsibility , chaired by Sir Alan Budd , before deciding exactly where the cuts will come , as well as a possible rise in VAT .
Until now the focus has been on Whitehall departmental budgets , as opposed to the separately accounted welfare bill .
But government sources confirmed that ministers will also be looking at benefit rules .
The Treasury had already drawn up plans for Labour to reduce benefits for the middle class , and one source said child benefit for the middle class would be a prime candidate for review , adding : " Welfare for the wealthy is always on the Treasury hit list . "
After the jokes and bonhomie of Wednesday 's press conference in Downing Street , the new government struck a more sober tone as the chancellor , George Osborne , told the first meeting of the Liberal - Conservative cabinet that the need to cut the deficit will overshadow everything .
Ministers tried to calm the immediate centre - right euphoria by warning that their departments would have to look at difficult spending cuts .
In an effort to generate an atmosphere of shared austerity , Cameron today ordered ministers to take a 5 % pay cut .
The culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt , suggested that the Olympics budget might not be sacrosanct , and the health secretary , Andrew Lansley , said he was looking at efficiency savings of more than the £ 20 bn proposed by the outgoing government .
The news came as Cameron announced 29 further appointments , including six Liberal Democrat ministers of state , but only five women – including two peers .
A smattering of Tory MPs expressed concern over the concept of Lib -Con coalition .
One Liberal Democrat MP , John Pugh , for Southport , also warned that he was " very concerned " about being tied to savage Tory cuts .
He urged colleagues to pursue " a distinctive path " to ensure the poor did not suffer when spending cuts are speeded up , as promised by Osborne .
" I think there is a danger that Liberal Democrats fall into agreeing with decisions made by the ' Sir Humphreys ' in the civil service – and George Osborne . "
Michael Fallon , on the Treasury select committee , became the first senior Tory to advocate cutting welfare for the better - off to spread the load of bringing the deficit down .
He said " If you do n't tackle that side of it and you have some protected areas then you are inevitably driven into much deeper cuts in the remaining departmental spending areas than you would otherwise like to see .
If you are going to spread the pain , then you do need to look at benefit eligibility as well . "
He also raised the question of whether the Liberal Democrats will have the appetite to look at that " bit of public expenditure that is the benefits system and the eligibility of benefits and the way in which they are indexed each year and so on " .
In a potentially precarious balancing act David Cameron appointed Iain Duncan Smith as work and pensions secretary with the Liberal Democrat left - winger Steve Webb in charge of pensions .
Webb ruled out any cuts to benefits during the election campaign .
But in the joint accord agreed by the two parties , and published yesterday , the two parties agreed to " end all existing welfare to work programmes and to create a single welfare to work programme to help all unemployed people back to work " .
It also agreed that receipt of benefits for those able to work should be conditional on " willingness to work " , a tough phrase that may or may not involve any specific new policy to tighten conditionality .
Referring to the annual welfare bill , Robert Chote , director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies , said : " I think it is certainly one of the areas where you 're likely to see more action now we 're this side of the election than the parties were willing to talk about beforehand .
In thinking about the repair job in the public finances there are really three areas – tax increases , cuts in spending on public services and cuts to the social security budget and it would be surprising to see action on two of those and not on the third . "
The pressure to find cuts may have been increased by the agreement reached by the two parties .
Research conducted by Credit Suisse suggested that the two parties had added £ 10bn of extra spending proposals , including extra spending on disadvantaged children .
Liberal Democrats have accepted a Conservative " ring - fence " to guarantee real - terms increases – that is , rises above inflation – in NHS funding every year .
These had been criticised by the new business secretary , Vince Cable , during the election campaign .
He said they would lead to deeper cuts elsewhere .
Lansley said Lib Dems had accepted the need for real terms increases and acknowledged that " those will have an impact on other departments " .
But he warned : " If we protect the real value [ of the NHS budget ] relative to the level of inflation in the economy as a whole , it will not protect the NHS from the need to secure efficiency savings and to control pay and prices in the NHS . "
OTTAWA – Three years ’ worth of vastly improved health facilities for women and children in developing countries ; $ 1,000 tuition cuts for every student in Canada ; 11,000 new construction jobs .
These are among the suggestions being offered to Prime Minister Stephen Harper on better ways to spend the nearly $ 1 billion earmarked for security for the G8 and G20 summits next month .
That $ 1 - billion figure , in fact , is quickly emerging as an important benchmark , with Harper under increasing pressure to emerge from those summits with spending commitments over and above his security costs – dollars directed toward the less fortunate abroad , for instance .
But that would be a massive increase – a doubling , in fact , of the $ 500 - million budget that International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda was boasting this week as the highest - ever aid commitment in Canada ’s history .
Now , however , next to the security price tag for the summits , it is looking like a drop in the bucket .
“ We could make a really landmark Canadian investment in maternal and child health around the world , that would do more than any single thing to meet those millennium development goals , ” says Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff .
“ We could simply lead the world . ”
The New Democrats , seeing what the Conservatives are willing to fork over for security , are calling on Canada to put $ 1.4 billion over five years into foreign aid directed at maternal health , as requested by the international Partnership for Maternal , Newborn and Child Health .
That breaks down into roughly $ 300 million a year – so it would take three years to spend what Harper ’s government has committed to security costs for three days of meetings in Huntsville and Toronto at the end of June .
“ When you can spend a billion dollars to send out sound cannons on protesters in Toronto , the least you can do is provide $ 1.4 billion over a couple of years to provide front - line health services to women in the Congo .
It ’s a no- brainer , ” says NDP foreign - affairs critic Paul Dewar .
Dewar said that with $ 1.4 billion extra from Canada over the next five years , women and children in poor countries such as the Congo could mean more medical clinics closer to the people who need them , better transport to health facilities and a boost in “ front - line ” services , getting clean water and food to children , for example , who need those basics in the first years of their lives .
Oda , however , told the Commons committee on the status of women this week that Canada would be paying for its summit commitments out of the existing international - aid budget .
“ Our government has been increasing its international aid by 8 per cent every year .
That 8 per cent remains in the base of CIDA , in our international assistance , and then we build 8 per cent on top of that .
That brings us to $ 500 million for international assistance , the largest amount ever in the history of Canada , ” she said .
Ignatieff was in his Toronto riding having lunch on Friday and found that the $ 1 - billion number has touched a nerve with the public .
“ People came up right out of the queue and said ‘ what is going on ? ’ ” Ignatieff told the Star .
“ The public really does n’t like this . ”
In addition to boosts in the aid budget , Ignatieff said he ’d much rather see the money being spent on reducing students ’ tuition , creating jobs for the unemployed or even improving broadband access for rural Canadians .
In the House of Commons this week , as well , NDP MP Olivia Chow cited a number of ways to spend $ 1 billion .
“ Three percent of that $ 1 billion would provide all Canadian children a nutritious and healthy breakfast or snacks every day .
We can lift all seniors out of poverty by increasing the guaranteed income supplement , ” Chow said .
“ Canada could pay one - third of the costs of the millennium development goal and save the lives of over 10 million women and children by 2015 . ”
Ignatieff says that his party is going to be demanding an official accounting for security costs that he describes as “ off the charts . ”

“ It ’s simply impossible to understand , ” he said .
Irene Mathyssen , the NDP ’s status - of - women critic , said she is troubled by the prospect of how this $ 1 billion is going to be spent – silencing protest and keeping world leaders safe , when those dollars could be stretched much farther if devoted to making lives safer abroad .
“ A billion dollars for security alone .
What about all the other extraneous expenses ? ” Mathyssen said .
“ I think we should be investing that in human beings . ”

( CNN ) --
Fresh on the heels of a new immigration law that has led to calls to boycott her state , Arizona 's governor has signed a bill banning ethnic studies classes that " promote resentment " of other racial groups .
Gov. Jan Brewer approved the measure without public statement Tuesday , according to state legislative records .
The new law forbids elementary or secondary schools to teach classes that are " designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group " and advocate " the overthrow of the United States government " or " resentment toward a race or class of people . "
The bill was pushed by state school Superintendent Tom Horne , who has spent two years trying to get Tucson schools to drop a Mexican - American studies program he said teaches Latino students they are an oppressed minority .
There was no immediate response from the Tucson Unified School District , the law 's main target .
Brewer 's signature comes less than a month after she approved a state law that requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals ' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance .
Critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling , while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants .
On Wednesday , the Los Angeles City Council overwhelmingly approved a boycott of Arizona - based businesses and governments unless the state repeals the new immigration law .
The city 's legislative analyst reported that Los Angeles currently has $ 56 million in contracts with companies headquartered in Arizona .
Several other California cities , including San Francisco and Oakland , have already adopted resolutions requesting city departments to not sign any new contracts with Arizona companies .
City also bans employees from travel to Arizona

South Korea has accused the reclusive North of torpedoing one of its warships , heightening tension in the economically powerful region and testing the international position of China , Pyongyang 's only major backer .

AFP - A North Korean submarine torpedoed one of South Korea 's warships near the disputed maritime border in March , investigators said Thursday , prompting heated denials and threats of war from the North .
The South 's President Lee Myung - Bak promised " resolute countermeasures " and the United States , Britain and Australia strongly condemned the attack which claimed 46 lives .
The communist North said the report , by a multinational investigation team , was based on " sheer fabrication " .
It threatened " all - out war " in response to any attempt to punish it .
" The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine , " the team said , releasing its report on the March 26 sinking at a nationally televised press conference .
" There is no other plausible explanation . "
Seoul 's closest ally the United States called the attack " one more instance of North Korea 's unacceptable behaviour and defiance of international law .
" This attack constitutes a challenge to international peace and security and is a violation of the armistice agreement " which ended the 1950 - 53 war , said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs .
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the North had shown " a total indifference to human life " .
British experts joined the probe , along with specialists from the United States , Australia and Sweden .
The sinking caused outrage in South Korea , which declared five days of national mourning .
Cross - border relations , which have been frosty for months , went into a deep chill .
But Seoul has apparently ruled out a military counter - strike for fear of igniting all - out war .
It is likely to ask the United Nations Security Council to slap new sanctions on the North .
This would need agreement from China , a veto - wielding council member and the North 's ally , which has indicated it first wants to see strong evidence .
" Resolute countermeasures will be taken against North Korea , " Lee told Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in a phone conversation , according to Lee 's office .
South Korea , through strong international cooperation , " should make North Korea admit its wrongdoing and return as a responsible member of the international community " , added Lee , whose National Security Council will meet Friday to weigh its reaction .
Rudd called for an " appropriate " international response .
The sinking near the Yellow Sea frontier flashpoint was the worst apparent cross - border provocation since the downing of a South Korean airliner in 1987 with the loss of 115 lives .
The investigators laid out apparently damning evidence against Pyongyang , which is thought by some analysts to have acted in revenge for a naval firefight last November in the area .
The 1,200 - tonne corvette was split apart by a shockwave and bubble effect produced by the underwater explosion of a 250 kilogramme ( 550 pound ) homing North Korean torpedo , the report said .
It said parts salvaged from the Yellow Sea " perfectly match " a type of torpedo that the North has offered for export .
A marking in Korea 's Hangeul script was found on one recovered section , and matches markings on a stray North Korean torpedo recovered by the South seven years ago , investigators said .
The report said the attack was likely carried out by a small submarine .
" We confirmed that a few small submarines and a mother ship supporting them left a North Korean naval base in the West ( Yellow ) Sea 2 - 3 days prior to the attack and returned to port 2 - 3 days after the attack . "
The North 's top decision - making body the National Defence Commission , in a statement on the official news agency , said it would send its own investigators to the South to check the purported evidence .
Seoul rebuffed the proposal , saying a commission overseeing the armistice would carry out its own probe .
" Our army and people will promptly react to any ' punishment ' and ' retaliation ' and to any ' sanctions ' infringing upon our state interests with various forms of tough measures including an all - out war , " the North 's statement said .
It threatened in future to respond to any small border incident with a " merciless strong physical blow " .
The North refuses to accept the Yellow Sea borderline where the Cheonan went down .
The area was the scene of deadly clashes in 1999 and 2002 and the firefight last November left a North Korean boat in flames .

One thing that I 've noticed over the past few years is that it seems like there is an increase in the amount of people who refuse to take responsibility for their actions .
Instead they blame others when things do n't go the way they had hoped , and they subscribe to a “ victim mentality ” , a psychology that says there are outside forces beyond your control that are causing you to fail , and there 's nothing you can do about it .
Victim Mentality : a tendency to blame external or uncontrollable factors , instead of focusing on internal or controllable factors for things that go wrong
I think if we 're honest with ourselves , many of the problems we 're facing today can be traced back to people who do n't take responsibility for their actions , and instead act like things are just happening to them .
Continues after Advertisement
Much of the economic crisis we ’re currently having can be placed squarely at the feet of people ’s lack of responsibility .
People are believing the lie that there is always someone else to blame ( and someone else to depend on ) , and as a result when the time comes to make hard financial decisions , people are paralyzed .
They feel powerless .
We live in a consuming society where if we want something – we buy it .
Never mind the consequences .
If we want a big new house that is over our budget ?
Never mind , we 'll buy it anyway – after all the bank gave us a loan so we must be able to afford it !
If we walk away and default , it will be their fault for giving me the loan in the first place !
I run up my credit card bills ?
It 's the credit card company 's fault when I can't pay because they allowed me to have the card in the first place !
I lost my job ?
It 's not my fault for having poor job performance , it 's the economy 's fault !
I can't win – I 'm a victim !
Government Encouragement Of Irresponsibility
Let 's be honest , the government has n't exactly encouraged people to take responsibility and not play the victim .
They 've actually encouraged a victim mentality by giving failing banks huge bailouts , allowing them to dodge the responsibility for their poor business practices .
They 've encouraged people to not find a job by continuously extending unemployment benefits for people who are out of work .
They 've dodged their own responsibility for many of the current fiscal crisis by shifting blame to Wall Street , big banks and mortgage companies .
They never once allowed us to believe that because of their encouragement of irresponsible lending ( sub - prime lending anyone ? ) , that much of this came about .
The point is , if you 're looking to the government for some encouragement in wise spending , responsibility and moving towards a life of debt freedom , you 're going to be sorely disappointed .
They will encourage you to live with a victim mentality , and tell you that there is n't much you can do to succeed .
Decisions Have Consequences – Good And Bad
An article I read recently talks in depth about how the choices we make have consequences , and how so many of the great achievers in history have one thing in common – they took responsibility for their actions , whether the consequences were good or bad .
The price of greatness is responsibility
– Winston Churchill﻿
They did n't allow themselves to be defined by the actions of others , or by the actions of their government .
Instead they took responsibility for their successes and failures , and because of it they were able to live great lives .
Put all excuses aside and remember this : YOU are capable .
– Zig Ziglar
Sometimes it is only us that are responsible for the tough situations we find ourselves in .
It is n't the failure of our family , our friends or our government .
It is the direct result of the choices that we make .
We ARE capable , and we need to stop making excuses .
Take Control Of Your Decisions , And Their Consequences
Are there situations where people legitimately are put in bad circumstances because of others – and are being victimized ?
Of course .
But even in those situations you have a choice that you can make – to turn a bad situation into something good , or to allow yourself to become a victim , and to allow others to define you .
I read this on another site in regards to taking responsibility , and how we can choose to live a full life , one centered by responsibility , or we can allow ourselves to be victims :
What choices are you making in your life ?
Are they the ones that result in positive consequences ?
We can choose if we ’ll reflect our environment , or if we 'll affect our environment .
We can choose to be happy , or not .
We can choose how we react to hard times in our life , with positivity or negativity .
We can choose to take responsibility for our actions , or blame others for our failures .
We can choose to be a victor or take on the role of a victim .
What steps are you taking to keep yourself free of becoming a victim ?
Have you allowed yourself to fall prey to a victim mentality ?
Has the relentless negativity in the news and in society caused you to start believing that you are a victim ?
What steps can we take to get ourselves out of the pit of victim - hood and despair , into the sunlight of responsibility and freedom ?

Have heartburn occasionally ?
Suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) symptoms ?
Mention your indigestion to a pharmacist and the odds are you 'll be directed to proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) drugs that are now sold over the counter .
Or , if you tell your doctor about your heartburn problems , you 'll most likely be given a prescription for an even stronger dose of a PPI .
These Big Pharma profit making drugs ( which include Prilosec , Nexium , Prevacid , Aciphex and Protonix ) are pushed for indigestion because they are supposedly stronger and faster acting than other older acid suppressing and acid neutralizing meds .
But there are problems with these widely hyped drugs .
According to a series of reports just published in the , not only are PPIs being over - prescribed and over - used but they are fraught with health dangers .
" A staggering 113.4 million prescriptions for proton pump inhibitors are filled each year , making this class of drugs , at $ 13.9 billion in sales , the third highest seller in the United States , " Mitchell H. Katz , M.D. , of the San Francisco Department of Public Health , wrote in an editorial accompanying the reports .
Dr. Katz pointed out that these drugs can be effective treatments for inflammation of the esophagus , ulcers and GERD -- but there is evidence that between 53 percent and 69 percent of PPIs are being prescribed inappropriately .
What 's more , doctors are too often pushing these drugs without considering potential adverse side effects .
Bottom line : PPIs are often used to treat plain old common indigestion ( dyspepsia ) in the absence of ulcers , inflammation or severe GERD .
" That proton pump inhibitors relieve dyspepsia is without question , but at what cost ( and I do not mean financial ) ? "
Dr. Katz asked .
So what specifically is the downside to acid- suppressing PPIs ?
The new reports in the current issue of theoffer some disturbing answers to that question : • Shelly L. Gray , Pharm .D. , of the University of Washington and colleagues reported that PPIs increase the risk of fractured bones in women after menopause .
They followed 161,806 women between ages 50 and 79 in the Women 's Health Initiative Study for eight years and found those taking PPIS had an increased risk of spine and forearm or wrist fractures in addition to more total fractures . •
Michael D. Howell , M.D. , M.P.H. , of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School and fellow researchers studied the records of more than 100,000 patients discharged from hospitals over a five year period .
Daily PPI use , they discovered , was linked to an estimated 74 percent increase in infections due to Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) , a bacterium that can cause life - threatening diarrhea and inflammation of the colon . •
Another group of researchers headed by Amy Linsky , M.D. , of Boston Medical Center , also found a worrisome link between C. difficile and PPIs .
They investigated approximately 1,200 patients being treated for C. difficile and documented a 42 percent increased risk of recurrence with the infection if PPIs were used .
Deborah Grady , M.D. , of the University of California , San Francisco , and San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center , and Rita F. Redberg , M.D. , also of the University of California , San Francisco , and editor of the , wrote in another editorial .
There 's actually some good news related to the series of reports discussing the dangers of PPIs and their overuse .
" Evidence suggests that providing excessive health care service is most likely to occur in situations in which there is not strong evidence to document the benefit and harms of the service , " Dr. Grady and Dr. Redberg stated in their editorial .
" Theaims to address this deficit by publishing articles that provide evidence that performing ' more ' of certain health care activities results in ' less ' health . "
NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit recorded this fisheye view with its rear hazard - avoidance camera after completing a drive during the 2,169th Martian day , or sol , of Spirit 's mission on Mars ( Feb. 8 , 2010 ) .
A historic milestone could be made on Mars this week .
On Thursday , NASA 's beleaguered Spiritrover could become the longest - running mission on the surface of Mars , surpassing the Viking 1 lander 's record of six years and 116 days of operationon the Martian surface ?
if it 's still alive , that is .
Spirit fell silent on Mars on March 31 , when it skipped aplanned communications session with Earth .
It may be hibernating through theharsh Martian winter .
But even if Spirit does n't survive , its robotic twinOpportunity is poised to break the Mars mission record in early May .
Beating Viking 's record , which NASA set in the 1980s , wouldbe a major feat for a rover the size of a golf cart that was only supposed tolast for three months and spent the past year stuck in Martian sand .
Themilestone would also be a welcome surprise to the team of scientists andengineers that have been commanding Spirit for these past six years .
" Being part of the team that will break the VL1 [ VikingLander 1 ] record will be exciting , " said Ray Arvidson of the Washington University in St. Louis , who led the Viking Lander Imaging Team wayback when and now serves as a member of the Spirit science team .
" It meansto me personally that I will have participated in two historical events . "
Undying Spirit and Opportunity
Spirit and its robotic twinsister Opportunity landed on opposite sides of Mars in 2004 ?
Spiritbounced onto the surface on Jan. 4 , while Opportunity landed a few weeks lateron Jan. 25 Eastern Time .
Both rovers were initially slated for just a 90 - day missionto explore the geology and chemistry of their respective landing sites .
Butthey blew past those deadlines and have continued their missions for far longerthan mission engineers ever thought possible .
They passed their six - year marks in January of this year .
Thatmeans right now both rovers are in the midst of their seventh Earth year onMars .
" By lasting such a long time , the rovers have been ableto accomplish far more science and exploration than we ever expected , and that 's a wonderful thing .
We 're very proud of that , " said Steve Squyres , leadscientist for the Mars Exploration Rover Project at Cornell University inIthaca , NY .
In January of this year , after months of trying to rescueSpirit from a sand trap it rolled into in May 2009 , NASA rechristened the roveras a stationary lander .
Opportunity , meanwhile , is doing fine and headed to agiant crater called Endeavour on the Martian plains of Meridiani Planum .
Rovers vs. Vikings
Viking 1 was also a hardy spacecraft , lasting from the timeit touched down on Mars on July 20 , 1976 until contact was lost in November1982 , putting its time in operation on Mars at 6 years , 116 days .
[ DeadMars spacecraft . ]
The exact hour when Viking ceased operation is debatable , but NASA officials are marking April 29 as the day that Spirit will matchViking 1's record .
But NASA 's Viking landers ( there were two ) used a radioisotopethermoelectric generator ?
which converts heat from decaying nuclear materialinto electricity ?
for power .
Spirit and Opportunity use solar arrays that relyon available sunlight and periodic dust storms to keep them clean .
Of course , Spirit has been out of communication for the pastfour weeks after entering a low - power hibernation mode once winter sat in andtemperatures dropped along with the sun dipping in the sky , leaving Spirit withlittle available power .
Because the rover is out of contact , mission managers maynot know for several weeks whether or not Spirit survived and was still inoperation on its record - setting day , and not before Opportunity matches thesame record .
" A communication from Spirit on April 29 or later wouldbe a confirmation that it has matched or exceeded VL1's longevity , " saidGuy Webster , a spokesman at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" That might not happen before Opportunity reaches the VL1 longevitymark , which will be on May 20 . "
Battle of the Mars - bots
If Spirit does survive the winter , it will hold the recordover Opportunity , of course .
While Arvidson is doubtful that Spirit will break therecord , pointing out how long the rover will have to stay in a low - power mode , Squyres is more optimistic .
" You could lose a lot of money betting against thatrover , " he told SPACE.com , alluding to the number of times the rover hasimprobably survived tough conditions on the Martian surface .
If the Spiritrover does wake up come spring , it will continue to investigate the area inwhich it became mired , checking out new soil targets in the fortuitouslygeologically - interesting spot .
How long Spirit , or Opportunity , might hold the longevityrecord is anyone 's guess , and will at least hold out until the next Marssurface explorer , the Mars Science Laboratory ( aka Curiosity ) arrives at thered plant .
Curiosity is n't slated to launch until 2011 .
Even if Curiosity becomes the next rover to match the Viking1 record , it will then have to catch up to whatever new benchmark the MERrovers set as they near their 7th anniversaries , and possibly even make it tolater " birthdays . "
Kin definitely lives up to its idea of making insurance easy to get and easy to understand ; now I just wish other companies would follow suit .

Brand name venture capital firms are all desperately trying to stuff cash in Foursquare cofounder Dennis Crowley 's pockets .
One of the venture capitalists coveting Foursquare told us :
" Anybody who can [ invest in Foursquare ] at [ a valuation ] under $ 100 million is going to make money . "
For most people , this $ 100 million valuation probably seems …crazy .
After all , Foursquare is only a year old , does n't even have a million users yet , and revenues are still a distant dream .
So : why ?
Why are these investors -- Accel Partners , Andreessen Horowitz , and Khosla Ventures -- so eager to throw cash at Foursquare on such inflated terms ?
We asked around , and came up with a couple answers .
For starters , get it out of your head that the reason these VCs want Foursquare so bad is that they think Foursquare is going to be bigger than Twitter some day .
Also dismiss the idea that Foursquare 's huge valuation has anything to do with these VCs believing Foursquare is going to crack the local advertising nut .
A much bigger factor is startup scarcity .
One VC source complained to us recently that these days there are " so few deals and so much money . "
The VCs trying to get Foursquare agree .
From their perspective , there are very few consumer - facing startups with the ambition of Foursquare .
Foursquare is the only deal to get .
Meanwhile , there 's a ton of VCs firms with piles of cash .
The supply and demand equation skews in Foursquare 's favor .
The other huge factor to remember is that investing in Foursquare is not necessarily a bet that Foursquare will gain mass consumer adoption .
Investing in Foursquare , is actually just a bet that any of the five following things will happen :
That some company -- Google ?
Yahoo ?
Facebook ? -- will believe that Foursquare can gain mass consumer adoption .
That some company will buy or develop a Foursquare rival and that another company will come to believe it needs Foursquare to defend its market position .
That some company -- we 're thinking of Yahoo here -- will decide that buying Foursquare for $ 100 million is a cheap way to demonstrate to its employees and investors that it is interested in making bets on startups that could gain mass consumer adoption .
That Foursquare will gain mass consumer adoption
And , most importantly :
That someone , someday will come in and bet on any of the above happening , but at a higher price .

If you read this blog regularly , you probably know about the recent problems with Dell ’s server hard drive support .
If you do n’t know , Dell recently announced that it was removing support for 3rd party drives on several PERC controllers .
Essentially , my stance ( and that of many other people ) has been that expecting customers to use supported drives for supported installations is completely reasonable , however after the server falls out of support , there is no reason to require Dell - branded drives .
I was pretty upset , and there were a ton of comments from people who felt the same way .
There was similar outrage from several other places too .
I was elated the other day when a reader , Pawel Kudzia , alerted me to an update .
He forwarded me an email from his Dell representative .
Here ’s the text :
DELL H-SERIES CONTROLLER BLOCKING OF 3RD PARTY DRIVES
TO BE REMOVED IN Q2FY11
At Dell , we are committed to our customers .
We listen to our customers .
And , to ensure our customers have a positive experience with our products , we validate and certify all of our PowerEdge servers and components .
Previously , Dell prevented the use of non-Dell hard drives attached to PERC H700 and H800 controllers in our 11th generation of PowerEdge servers as we could not certify these non-Dell drives .
However , based on customer feedback , we are now reversing this decision and allowing their use ( without support ) .
Dell will no longer prevent customer use of non-Dell hard drives attached to PERC H700 and H800 controllers on our 11th generation of PowerEdge servers .
A Q2FY11 PERC Firmware Update is planned to allow non-Dell hard drives to be used with these controllers .
We strongly recommend choosing Dell drives as we have validated and certified our drives and can support any issues that may arise .
FOR MORE INFORMATION : • www.dell.com/poweredge • Dell Hard Drives Landing Page • Why Dell Drives Paper NOTE :
There is no change to the current hard drive carrier policy .
Hard drive carriers will not be sold separately ( 3rd party drives are still not supported on Dell Enterprise systems ) .
I was very happy to hear about this change of heart , but I wanted to hear it straight from the horse ’s mouth , so to speak , so I emailed Howard Shoobe ( the gentleman who ’s post initially alerted us to the previous stance ) , and he verified the contents of the email .
This is GREAT NEWS !!!
Essentially , Dell has recognized that our position was valid , and that one of the reasons that we buy Dell is because the quality is such that their usable life is beyond the warranty period .
An entire stack of Dell equipment in my lab speaks to this , and I bet yours is much the same .
So a very big thank you to Dell , for removing this policy , and for listening to the voice of your customers .
And congratulations to all of us who are Dell customers , and can continue to buy from them in the future without fear of losing our freedom of choice when it comes to the parts in our machines .
In what would have to be one of the craftiest marketing ploys seen in recent times , UK company X2 Computing has announced the release of the iTablet .
Taking a name that the Apple iPad was heavily rumored to be called before it was announced , X2 has timed its latest release perfectly to capitalize on the current hype surrounding tablet PC’s .
The iTablet features 10.2 ” or 12.1 ” touchscreens with optional multitouch , a large on screen keyboard and images up to 1024x768 resolution in both portrait and landscape display .
The unit weighs around 1.18kg and measures 252x192 mm with thickness from 28 mm to 35 mm .
As well as a 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 processor and 250GB of storage , the iTablet is HDD based and runs on Windows 7 , Windows XP Tablet Edition or Linux .
Included are three USB ports , optional HDMI output , as well as Bluetooth , optional 3G and GSM along with built in 802.11b/ g networking .
Unlike the iPad , the iTablet offers Flash support , and also features a 1.3MP webcam .
Due for release in April according to the press release , the X2 iTablet will be available in a range of metallic colors including pink , blue , red and yellow .
Pricing details have not been released , and while it remains to be seen whether the unit can give Apple a run for its money , common sense says it will take more than a similar moniker to challenge the already popular iPad come release time .
SELLERS are bracing for a horror month as the first weakening in Melbourne 's property bubble appears .
Analysts say prices will start to fall and the best time to sell may have passed .
The auction clearance rate plunged to 76 per cent last weekend - the worst in more than a year and down from a high of 88 per cent in March .
Six interest rate rises in eight months added $ 317 a month to repayments on a $ 300,000 loan .
With the Commonwealth Bank forecasting two more interest rate rises this year , buyers are cautious about how high they bid .
Property firm RP Data analyst Cameron Kusher said prices usually fell when new home loan applications did .
They started falling six months ago .
" We anticipate a slowdown in ... property value growth during the coming months , with capital city values having increased by 4.2 per cent during the first quarter of 2010 , " Mr Kusher said .
" Higher interest rates will make it more difficult for buyers to obtain finance , and if they are able to obtain finance it will cost more to service the debt . "
Ray
White general manager Marcus Williams said sales were relatively strong and there was no reason to delay buying .
" Property is a long - term investment and fluctuations in prices and interest rates over time should be expected and factored into the decision , " he said .
Valuation company WBP Property chief executive Greville Pabst said rates were historically low and unlikely to herald a drop in property prices .
It was more likely prices would simply not rise as quickly .
The Real Estate Institute of Victoria tips 4237 auctions in May - 700 this weekend .
REIV communications manager Robert Larocca said auction numbers this month would be the most in Melbourne in May on record and the fourth highest for any month .
" The clearance rate may have dipped below 80 per cent , but given there is nearly twice as many homes on the market as last year it's a very strong outcome , " he said .

There 's some new research coming out of the University of Rochester that sheds a bit of light on the origin of language in humans .
What these researchers were looking into was if there 's one certain area of the brain that gives humans advanced language capabilities over other animals .
To this end , they designed a great experiment ( which was published in the latest edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ) to determine if different brain regions were used to decipher sentences with different types of grammar .
Languages like English use word order to establish meaning .
" John hugs Susan " means John is subject doing the hugging , while Susan is the one feeling the squeeze .
But other languages , like say Spanish , rely on inflection - and suffixes tacked onto the ends of words - to convey subject - object relationship ( while word order remains interchangeable ) .
Sign language , though , can do both .
So the researchers put native signers inside an MRI machine and showed them video of other native signers signing 24 sentences twice .
One time they would sign using the sentence with the word - order arrangement , the next time would use inflection for emphasis .
What the researchers found is that there are two separate parts of the brain used to process these two types of different sentences .
This suggests that one of the crucial distinctions between human and animals lies not in the architecture of the brain , rather in the ways we establish connections between locations within that architecture .
Richard Granger , head of the Brain Engineering department at Dartmouth University , has come to similar conclusions .
Granger has spent much of his looking for the parts of the human brain are actually different from other animal 's brains .
" The first thing you need to know is you can count the neurological differences between humans and animals on the fingers of both hands , " he told me not too long ago .
" Mostly they 're tiny , inconsequential blips .
None account for things like language , for any skill we would put under the Cartesian heading of ‘ human specialness . ' "
What accounts for those skills , according to Granger , is brain size .
If brains are computers than both humans and animals have the same hardware and the same software , ours just comes in a bigger box .
Because of that bigger box , our neurons have more space to make more connections with other neurons .
In the wiring diagram of the brain , we have more wires .
And this bigger box and these few more wires are the source of our superpowers .
This is essentially the argument Granger , alongside UC Irvine psychiatrist Gary Lynch , made in their recent book Big Brain .
It 's also what the University of Rochester experiment points towards , but it raises a very interesting question .
If , as these ideas seem to claim , the development of language actually required the recruitment and wiring together of a bunch of preexisting computational structures within the brain , this begs the question of causation .
Meaning all mammals have these same brain structures so why did this ability develop in humans and not in other animals ?
According to Richard Leakey , Homo sapiens did not posses the necessary anatomy to produce language until about 300,000 to 400,000 years ago .
Meanwhile , Steven Pinker has argued that since all modern humans have identical language abilities along with a universal grammar , it makes sense that language appeared concurrently with the first appearance of modern humans about 200,000 years ago .
Furthermore , there was a more than a tripling of brain size during the period between the first appearance the genus Homo ( in the form of Homo habilis ) about two million years ago until Homo sapiens appeared , suggesting that the brain developed in that period partly in order to accommodate the new language centers .
There is a totally different theory which looks at the spread of tool use -- a spread that could only have happened if language existed for various tribes to tell others about how to make and use these tools .
Conscious tool making ( as opposed to using whatever rock is at hand ) did n't begin until about 200,000 years ago , but it was n't until about 35,000 years ago that tool making became a really dynamic process , suggesting that real language might not have developed until 35,000 years ago .
But there 's something in the University of Rochester research that makes this last part especially interesting .
Matt Ridley has a new book coming out called The Rational Optimist .
It 's a fantastic read essentially arguing that specialization and the trade that emerged from specialization was the essential driver of human cultural evolution .
It 's a great book and one I 'm not going to destroy by summarizing here , but I do want to mention that there may be a direct link between Ridley 's argument and these new ideas about language .
Ridley argues that one of the main drivers of cultural evolution is the exchange of ideas that comes from trade ( among many other examples , he points out that when governments get rigid then economic monopolies develop - with everything being done for the good of the king - and this has a stunning tendency to destroy civilizations ) .
But trade requires communication between groups of people who speak different types of languages .
And since communication requires having a brain that is flexible enough to understand different forms of sentence structure , it can be argued that it was trade between different groups of early humans that forced the brain to start recruiting other structures to try to understand the bizarre tongues being spoken by other speakers .
If this idea is correct then the tool use argument comes a lot closer to the truth about the development of language than Leakey or Pinker 's ideas , which also mean that language is a much more recent development than many believe .
What with the Internet 's popularity , creation and use of data centers has taken off in the last two decades to the point that they now account for 2 percent of energy consumption worldwide .
Because of their growth , the American Society of Heating , Refrigerating , and Air-Conditioning Engineers set some restrictions for how data centers are cooled , hoping to keep their emissions under control .
But some companies , including Google , have taken issue with ASHRAE 's methods - based approach , and are petitioning for changes .
In Standard 90.1 of its building codes , ASHRAE sets forth requirements on what equipment companies can use to cool their data centers .
The standard requires companies ' data centers to be be cooled with economizers , which direct ambient air in a specific flow , and prevents use of other approaches , such as air conditioners .
Google responded to the standard in a post on their public policy blog this week , undersigned by other companies like Microsoft and Amazon .
They felt the ASHRAE standards should be based on efficiency , rather than approach — if it can achieve a set efficiency threshold , the search giant asks , does it matter how it 's done ?
Google invokes the case of car emissions , noting that cars must achieve a certain minimum gas mileage , but do n't have to use a particular type of engine .
Google acknowledges in its post that economizers are very efficient and emission - friendly , but new and possibly better methods for cooling are still being invented .
For example , a perspective published in Science this week detailed how data centers might be sufficiently cooled even with relatively warm water , up to 70 ºC .
Using warm water would mitigate some of the mechanical costs of liquid cooling and would lose the refrigeration that cold - water systems use .
ASHRAE is open to suggestions on the matter , and have a proposed addendum to Standard 90.1 in the works that is available for public viewing .
The addendum places limits on the efficiency and BTUs per hour that various types of cooling systems may use , and takes away the restrictions on air conditioners , water coolers , and economizers .
ASHRAE will continue to take comments on the addendum until April 19 .

Gorillas are being dangerously stressed by tourists whose attentions are disrupting the animals ' feeding routines and making them aggressive .
The discovery – made by researchers who have just completed a year - long study of the great apes at Bai Hokou in the Central African Republic – has important implications for the tourism industry .
Eco-tourism has become extremely popular , providing travellers with opportunities to get close to rare species , including tigers , polar bears and gorillas .
Money raised in this way has helped to preserve endangered animals and bring employment to developing countries .
Gorilla tourism in particular has boomed , providing jobs and business opportunities in several African countries .
In Uganda , gorilla tourism brings in an estimated £ 345,000 a month from the sale of permit fees alone .
But now scientists warn that greater care will be needed .
Not only do tourists disturb the animals , but so do research teams studying the animals ' behaviour and their interaction with tourists .
It is recommended that the minimum distance between humans and gorillas be increased from seven to 18 metres .
" We got a lot of warning barks from the male silverback in a band of gorillas if we went too close , " said Michelle Klailova of Stirling University .
" And you ignore a male gorilla 's barking at your peril , for there is a real danger that it will turn into something much worse , like a full - blown charge .
They can kill very easily .
They know exactly where to bite a person . "
Great apes are known to be vulnerable to human diseases .
A common cold has the potential to kill an entire family group .
Research at the Tai chimpanzee project in Ivory Coast found that 15 young chimpanzees who died in three disease outbreaks there had been infected with viral strains that were very similar to those found in humans .
Authorities have so far insisted that humans remain at least seven metres away .
" Even if we sneeze , then particles from our breath will not reach the gorillas , " said Klailova , whose study – written with Chloe Hodgkinson and Phyllis Lee – is published in the American Journal of Primatology .
" This barrier has been created for physiological reasons .
However , our work suggests that there are good reasons to establish a far bigger gap between humans and animals – for psychological reasons . "
Klailova and her research group concentrated on one silverback named Makumba and recorded his vocalisations , daily activities and interactions with his 12 family members .
They then studied how these types of behaviour changed when different groups of humans – which included local trackers , scientists and often tourists – came close .
As numbers in a group increased , the gorillas spent less time feeding and instead behaved in a disturbed , unfocused manner .
Klailova found that Makumba was more likely to stop feeding and start watching humans as observers moved closer .
Making a male gorilla angrier could lead to him attacking humans or female gorillas in his own band .
Either way , the reaction reveals that animals that are now hovering at the edge of extinction are being further stressed .
Klailova admitted that a recommended gap of 18 metres " is not a realistic goal in dense forests , particularly for tourists who have spent valuable time and effort to see the gorillas " .
But in clearings and in open land , where there are good sight lines , it should definitely be adhered to .
The suggestion will find support from other scientists who have called for increased protection for great apes .
Other proposals have included suggestions that all tourists be required to wear face masks to block any transmission of human diseases .
However , the prospect of wearing masks all the time while only being allowed distant glimpses of animals could have a detrimental impact on gorilla - watching holidays .
Eco-tourism has become an important source of income for remote African communities .
Foreign visitors who come to enjoy the sights and sounds of natural parks have become a strong motivation for governments to invest in conservation , while the presence of researchers , tourists and tourism infrastructure can work as a strong deterrent to poachers .
As Klailova has said : " It is a very delicate issue . "
Arduino is a tool for the design and development of embedded computer systems , consisting of a simple open hardware design for a single - board microcontroller , with embedded I/O support and a standard programming language .
An Arduino is programmed using the Wiring language , which is essentially C++ with a few simplifications .
The Processing programming language is often used to interface a computer with an Arduino , often to create unorthodox interfaces .[ wikipedia ]
Maryland Cops Beat Student , Lie in Charging Documents
More extreme reactions by Maryland law enforcement .
Saturday I posted a story about an off duty or plain clothes Maryland officer who ’s speeding ticket looked more like a car jacking , today I found a video showing the assault of a University of Maryland student by several county police officers in full riot gear .
The student , John McKenna , was not just peaceful and unarmed but literally skipping down the side walk singing a cheer celebrating a basketball victory on March 3rd .
As he moves down the side walk two mounted officers move to block his path , forcing him to stop .
McKenna can be seen backing away from the officers when two other officers , dawning full riot gear , run over to him , shove him into the wall knocking him unconscious , and than beat him several times with nightsticks .
Unfortuantely , the incident gets even worse .
After the beating the police arrested McKenna and charged him with assault on a police officer and disorderly conduct ( the perennial charge used when no real law has been broken ) .
The officers claimed that McKenna :
“ struck those officers and their horses causing minor injuries , ” and that McKenna was “ kicked by the horses and sustained minor injuries . ”
It ’s obvious when you watch the video that neither one of those things is true .
It also should not come as a surprise that the injuries on McKenna ’s body matched police batons , not horse hooves .
It also seems that the county has a history of incidents involving unnecessary force .
The Prince George ’s County police department emerged from federal oversight only 14 months ago .
The Justice Department had monitored the police force after numerous complaints about unnecessary force .
A new federal investigation is already under way .
Looks like that did n’t take long .
The video does n’t support embedding so be sure to check it out here .
No , it 's not a prequel to Cloverfield , as many suspected .
The trailer for Super 8 , which premiered before Iron Man 2 , is a wholly original Steven Spielberg - J.J. Abrams collaboration .
Here 's the new trailer .
Warning : spoilers below .
We 've been DYING for an intelligent Area 51 movie , and who better to work on on an alien picture other than genre overlords Spielberg and Abrams ?
Very little is shown , but clearly there 's something be transported in an Air Force train cargo storage unit .
And it seems like the entity trying to punch its way out is from Area 51 .
And it has friends , or why else would the truck try and derail the train — or else maybe the alien can move vehicles with its mind ?
Or maybe the truck was trying to kill it ?
We do n't know , but we 're excited !

BioWare is n’t sitting around blowing kazoo’s over the wide success of Mass Effect 2 .
Well they might be , but if so they ’re doing it while already involved in the undertaking of Mass Effect 3 development .
Come on guys , you sure you do n’t want to take your two weeks vacation ?
You definitely earned it .
BioWare ’s Christina Norman confirmed the news by stating she was working on something for the game called “ Project Wombat ” , from the tweet :
“ ME3 Trivia : Today I started work on “ Project Wombat ” for Mass Effect 3 . ”
She hinted it could be some a gameplay system for the title , having mentioned the ammo system for Mass Effect 2 was called Project Sasquatch prior to its full unveiling .
Norman would n’t confirm what Wombat was however :
“ Wow a lot of speculation on what Project Wombat is .
Sorry I ca n’t say !
I can say the name has nothing to do with the project . ”
In other news Epic ’s Mark Rein has said Mass Effect 3 will be using Unreal Engine 3 , like its predecessors in the trilogy .
He states :
“ BioWare chose UE3 for the Mass Effect trilogy because they wanted to make an immersive third - person perspective shooter game with sci-fi environments . ”
EA Partners SVP , David DeMartini agrees :
“ We have a great working relationship with Epic from both the development and licensee perspective , and we ’re continually pleased with how they keep their game engine technology competitive , which helps us deliver the excellent quality games that EA customers expect . ”
Dowdy Sinead O'Connor barely compares to her shaved head look in iconic music video
It 's hard to believe that this is the Sinead O'Connor who , 20 years ago , stared intently into a camera and sang the now iconic song Nothing Compares 2 U .
The Irish singer , renowned for her shaved head appearance , looked somewhat different as she was pictured in Dublin yesterday .
Surprisingly , the 43 - year - old campaigner was sporting a full head of hair , which she teamed with a very dowdy - looking coat and flowing red dress .
Now and then : Irish singer last night in Dublin with a full head of hair and looking rather dowdy and , right , with her iconic shaven headed look , seen here in 1998
Sinead has kept her scalped look for much of her career , despite the stick she got for her unconventional appearance .
She once even insisted she 'd shave her head into old age because she felt odd with hair .
The mother of four explained in an interview once : ' I 'd been trying to grow it , but someone asked if I was Enya .
I was so shocked , I shaved all my hair off .
' I do n't feel like me unless I have my hair shaved .
So even when I 'm an old lady , I 'm going to have it . '
Nothing Compares :
The singer and campaigner wore a mumsy brown coat , teamed with a flowing red dress and turquoise bag
Sinead was pictured last night arriving at the RTE studios for The Late Late Show to perform the Bob Dylan song
The times they are a -Changin .
The outspoken singer , who has four children to four different fathers , is once again making her views known on the Vatican .
She once famously tore up a photograph of Pope John Paul II on Saturday Night Live some 18 years ago .
Now she 's giving Pope Benedict XVI a piece of her mind over the Catholic child abuse scandal .
After Benedict recently wrote a pastoral letter of apology relating to decades of sexual abuse of minors by priests in Ireland , O'Connor , who was physically abused as a child by her mother , responded by saying the letter was an insult .
Iconic : Sinead in her world famous Nothing Compares 2 U music video in 1990
Writing in a piece appearing in the Washington Post last Sunday , she explained : ' To many people in my homeland , the pope 's letter is an insult not only to our intelligence , but to our faith and to our country . '
Sinead rose to fame after following the release of her 1990 cover of the Prince song Nothing Compares 2 U and its accompanying video .
It consists almost solely of a close - up on O'Connor 's face as she sings the song 's lyrics .
Towards the end of the video , two tears roll down her face , one on each cheek .
O'Connor stated on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s that it was caused by the lyric , ' All the flowers that you planted , Mama / in the back yard / All died when you went away " , because she had a very complex relationship with her late mother , who she claims abused her .
The clip won Best Video at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards - the first video by a female artist to win in this category .
Pispala shot tower
A shot tower was a tower designed for the production of shot balls by freefall of molten lead , which was then caught in a water basin .
This method is not used anymore and there are not many shot towers left .
Pispala shot tower was built in 1908 by Oy Hjorth Ab and it is 55 metres high , It was in use until 1972 .
It 's the only surviving shot tower in Finland .
When you get bored of looking at the world with your own eyes why not look at it trough a microscope ?
It seems that there are two worlds – the world of huge things that we see everyday ( a tree , a car , etc . . ) and a micro world of incredibly small things .
Just looking at the micro world takes our breath away – it ’s incredibly rich , beautiful and active .
I ’ve heard that even science people after looking at the smallest corners of our world see a god here .
I could go on an on , but you just have to see it yourself .

Vermaelen : the time at Arsenal .
Concluding our exclusive interview .
This is the second part of the Thomas Vermaelen interview which was arranged by Walter Broeckx of the Official Arsenal Benelux supporters club , and a great friend of Untold Arsenal .
If you missed the first part it is here .
— — — — — ———-
WB : Did you ever think of leaving Ajax after you were named captain ?
TV : When I was with Ajax and being captain I never thought of going to another team at that moment in time .
It just felt good to be there .
WB : Were there other teams that were interested in you and tracked you , as far as you know ?
TV : Well it seemed that there were other teams interested in me as well .
But I never really took notice of that .
WB : When did you first hear that Arsenal was interested ?
TV : I only heard about that after I had played my last game in the Dutch league against Twente .
Before that I never had heard of Arsenal being interested in me .
Watch Arsenal Live Streams With StreamFootball.tv
WB : What went through your mind when you heard that Arsenal wanted you ?
Disbelief ?
Pride ?
Or did it leaves you cold ?
TV : I really was very pleased with their interest in me .
Just imagine ..
Arsenal one of the biggest club in the World wanting me to play fort hem .
I must admit I was very , very happy with that .
( WB : we did want to ask a lot of questions about the transfer talks and how those negotiations took place .
But Arsenal has told us that they would not allow these details to be published or talked about with third party ’s .
We regret this of course but we can understand the reasons behind this decision and we can only respect that decision especially when you take in account the fact that Arsenal always have stayed silent on any issues in regards with transfer talks .
Who am I to break those rules ? )
WB : Tell us about “ the call from Wenger ” when you were on holiday ?
TV : In fact it was rather a short phone call .
I was on holiday with my girlfriend and when my cell phone rang we could not recognise the number at first .
My girlfriend told me to pick it up anyway and then it was Arsène Wenger on the phone and he just told me that he really wanted me to join Arsenal .
And so I joined .
WB : What were your expectations when you came to Arsenal ?
First try to get in the team and then on to the starters 11 ?
Or were you sure that you would be immediately in the starting line up ?
TV : I just went to Arsenal wit no special hopes or expectations .
I just took it as it came and I felt I would just see what would happen with me .
WB : How was your first day at Arsenal ?
Were you presented to the other players and the rest of the technical staff ?
TV : The first day was rather quiet I must say .
I had to do a lot of tests on that day .
And I had to present myself to the rest of the players .
WB : How was Arsène Wenger in the beginning ?
TV : He seemed a quiet and friendly man .
WB : Are there any rituals that you must pass ?
How was the reception with the other players ?
TV : That was n’t too bad you know .
I had to sing a song and give a short speech but nothing more than that .
WB : Who was the player who helped you most in those first days ?
I mean , the ball is round everywhere but I suspect that the habits and rules are somewhat different from club to club ?
TV : In fact everybody was very friendly with me and they all helped me a lot .
So it was very nice from the start .
WB : A question that many Arsenal fans ask , of course , is about Wenger .
How is he in daily life at Arsenal ?
TV : I can summarize that in 2 words : calm and sensible .
WB : Does he stand far above the players ?
Is he a manager who looks from afar , and can he barely be reached ?
Or is he involved in every training session on the field and effectively engaged with advice , tips etc ?
TV : He is very much among the players .
He is always present and busy with the players .
He is not a manager that is looking from a distance but he is involved in what we do .
WB : And again about Wenger : is he a talker with the players ?
I mean , does he also have separate talks with the players on what you ’ve done right or what you ’ve done wrong ?
TV : Yes , Wenger is a manager that does talk a lot with the players , individually and collectively he is always talking with the players .
WB : What does a ‘ working day ’ at Arsenal look like ?
What time do you go to London Colney and what time you go back home ?.
How many training sessions are there per day ?
TV : When we have a busy schedule we only train once a day .
And that means that we can be home around 4 pm .
But we are there from in the morning and stay there till everyone is finished .
WB : How is a match day when you play at home ?
Where and when you come together ?
Is it true that you are not allowed to drive your own car on the day of the game when you come to the stadium ?
TV : We cannot drive on match days as we come together one day before a game in a hotel .
From the hotel we go to The Emirates with the club coach .
WB : Who are the best team mates for you ?
Who is the one with whom you have most contact ?
TV : In fact they are all great team mates for me .
We have a very good bond with each other .
But we are mostly a very young group of players and are all around the same age .
And this really works out fine for the whole group .
WB : Some foreign players clearly still have some difficulty at times with the English language .
Do you speak English among yourselves or is there also a lot of French spoken at times ?
Which language do you speak to Gallas in the field during a game ?
TV : Normally we all speak English with each other .
And also in the games I speak English with the other players including with Gallas .
WB : What does the future hold for you ?
Is your future going to be at Arsenal ?
Or do you dream of even a bigger club ?
Or do you see it as being Arsenal , with Vermaelen , the club that will rule football the next 10 years in England and Europe ?
TV : ARSENAL IS TH BEST CLUB FOR ME .
I do n’t think any further right now .
WB : In what neighbourhood you live in London ?
Do you live in an apartment or a house in the centre of London or somewhere in the outskirts of London ?
TV : I live in Hampstead .
[ For non -UK readers , this is part of north west London known for its exquisite houses and its expansive parkland . ]
WB : How ’s life in London for you ?
And for your girlfriend ?
TV : We like the life in London that we have .
We have adapted very well to London and to living in a big city .
But Amsterdam was not a small town either .
London really is a very nice city I think .

Also it could have been done even faster because I used too good quality ( the video codec lowers the quality anyways , so too much quality in the render is useless . )
Texas State Board of Education : 2010 or 1950 ?
Rebecca Bell - Metereau , Candidate for Texas State Board of Education , District 5
Extremist members of the elected , non-paid Texas State Board of Education have hijacked textbook selection and curriculum requirements for future generations of Texas school children , censoring the information they receive in both subtle and blatant ways .
In addition to violating the constitutional separation of church and state , extremists on the State Board have systematically censored other types of information as well , refusing to include significant minority figures .
Extremist board members complained that the review committee ’s proposed curriculum included too many minorities and women .
In spite of testimony from hundreds of citizens from all over the state requesting greater representation of Mexican Americans , Czechs , Sikhs , etc. , in the curriculum , extremists systematically rejected their inclusion with flimsy justifications .
For example , the far right - wing members of the board thwarted efforts of the Mexican American community to include Dolores Huerta in the curriculum , arguing that she was a bad role model because she was a socialist .
Instead , extremist board members substituted Helen Keller , either unaware that she was also a socialist or convinced that an Anglo socialist was not as objectionable as a Chicana socialist .
The board censored common words recommended by the review committees that they , themselves , had selected .
For example , the right - wing ideologues eliminated any references to the word " democracy , " referring to the United States instead as a " representative republic " throughout the document .
I have no objection to " representative republic , " but I have a big objection to systematic censorship of the word " democracy . "
It seems so , well , undemocratic .
In addition , the right - wing majority voted to delete distinctions between sex and gender , because they feared it might lead students to think about transvestites and transsexuals .
This 2010 controversy over social studies comes on the heels of the board ’s earlier consideration of the science curriculum .
In editing the requirements recommended by the review committee of teachers and scholars , extremists insisted on inserting language that depicted the theory of evolution as an inferior alternative to what they call the theory of " intelligent design . "
Everyone likes intelligence , right ?
And " design " sounds like a good idea as well .
Dr. David Hillis and other distinguished scientists testified before the board , arguing for real science , both for higher education and for science careers that fuel the economy , but to no avail .
In considering the English curriculum , conservatives on the board threw out two years of review committee work on the night before the final vote , substituting a hastily crafted document designed to emphasize phonics , a method popular during the 1950s .
This new curriculum also reduced the number of women and minority authors .
The extremists were able to pass these last - minute changes , a move that prompted protests from board and audience members .
District 5 incumbent Don Mercer later bragged in a San Antonio Express editorial that the teachers had received a " well deserved spanking . "
This kind of disrespect for teachers and education must stop .
We must resist extreme partisan and ideological efforts to rewrite history , weaken the curriculum , and brainwash our children .
Such a huge number of sweeping changes and omissions can't be justified by saying this is simply a response to excessive liberal influence on the curriculum .
There is nothing " conservative " about excluding Thomas Jefferson and democracy from a discussion of our history .
Let 's hear more from the voices of reason , from people all over Texas and the nation who respect education , research , teachers , and common sense .
I call on readers to pay attention to what is happening to education in Texas , because it may spread to the entire United States in the near future .
It ’s not too late to turn this trend around , but we must act now to marginalize political and ideological extremists and return the Texas State Board of Education to its proper mission of educating students for the 21st century , not the 1950s .

The bad blood between Glenn Beck and Rick Sanchez is nothing new and , given their fiery personalities , probably to be expected .
But today , on Rick ’s “ List U Do n’t Want 2 Be On , ” his outrage toward Beck for making fun of Malia Obama ( which Beck has apologized for ) took another , familiar form , when Sanchez pointed out he thought Beck did the same thing he apologized for in the apology .
Hm , where have we heard that before ?
The “ List U Do n’t Want 2 Be On ” segment is a close relative of Keith Olbermann ‘s “ Worst Person in the World , ” even when the people that end up on that list would be more likely to be guests on Countdown than villains .
Sanchez picks a person who behaved badly that day and reprimands them for their indiscretions .
Today , Sanchez chose Glenn Beck for his “ Daddy , did you plug the hole yet ? ” jokes , calling the vote in his office to give him the title unanimous and , judging from his Twitter feed , a “ slam dunk . ”
But in his description , he points out something Olbermann pointed out on his program on Friday , in a manner similar to the MSNBC anchor ’s :
“ Beck is now apologizing , but you ’ll notice in the apology that he again takes a shot at the President of the United States , almost as if he ’s implying it ’s the President ’s fault he was forced to do this … if it was just a mistake , a one - time thing , why did he keep doing it on , and on , and on , seemingly relentlessly ? ”
Sanchez ’s indignation appeared to be genuine– perhaps even moreso because he ’s been Beck ’s object of ridicule in the past , himself – but his attitude towards the story seemed out of place .
The drawn out clip , the evoking of the public opinion … it ’s not early evening outrage– it ’s primetime outrage , on a network with a very conspicuous hole in it ’s primetime lineup .
Whether it ’s CNN trying to tell us something or Rick Sanchez trying to tell CNN something , it ’s still clear that Sanchez does not quite fit in with the rest of his afternoon colleagues .

Have a tip we should know ?
[ email protected ]
A while ago I thought it would be a good idea to make a backup of my Linux server by just dumping the complete disk to a file .
In retrospect , it would have been much easier had I just dumped the individual filesystems .
When I finally got around to using this backup , long after the 10 GB disk had perished I realized that to use the loopback device to mount a filesystem it actually needs a filesystem to mount .
What I had was a disk image , including partition table and individual partitions .
To further complicate matters the data partition was also not the first partition inside this image .
For reference , I created this image using the Unix ‘ dd ’ tool :
# dd if=/dev/hda of=hda.img 30544113+0 records in 30544113+0 records out # ls - lh - rw - r--r-- 1 root root 9.6G 2008-01-22 14:12 hda.img
I followed the instructions on http://www.trekweb.com/~jasonb/articles/linux_loopback.html to try and mount the partitions inside the disk image , but ran into two problems .
To mount a partition inside the disk image you need to calculate the offset of where the partition starts .
You can use fdisk to show this information to you , but you need to specify the number of cylinders if you are using a disk image .
You then also need to multiply the start and end numbers with the calculated sectors to get a byte offset .
I found another tool more useful for this task , called parted .
If you are using Ubuntu , you can install it with ‘ apt - get install parted ’
# parted hda.img GNU Parted 1.7.1 Using / data/rabbit/disk_image/test2
Welcome to GNU Parted !
Type ' help ' to view a list of commands .
( parted ) unit Unit ? [ compact ] ?
B ( parted ) print Disk / data/rabbit/disk_image/test2 : 10262568959B
Sector size ( logical / physical ) : 512B/512B Partition Table : msdos Number Start End Size Type File system Flags 1 32256B 106928639B 106896384B primary ext3 boot 2 106928640B 1184440319B 1077511680B primary linux - swap 3 1184440320B 10256924159B 9072483840B primary ext3 ( parted ) quit
Now we have the offsets and we can use those to mount the filesystems using the loopback device :
#mount -o loop , ro , offset=32256 hda.img /mnt/rabbit
That mounted the first partition , the ‘ boot ’ partition , but this did n’t have the data on it that I was looking for .
Lets try to mount partition number 3 .
#umount / mnt / rabbit #mount -o loop , ro , offset=1184440320 test2 /mnt / rabbit #mount : wrong fs type , bad option , bad superblock on / dev/ loop0 , missing codepage or helper program , or other error
In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail or so
Oops , that does n’t look right .
According the article referred to above if you are using a util - linux below v2.12 b then you cannot specify an offset higher than 32 bits .
I ’m using util -inux 2.13 which should n’t have that problem , and besides , my offset is well below the 32 bit limit .
The article also offers an alternative loopback implementation that supports mounting partitions within an image , but that requires patching and recompiling your kernel which I would rather not do .
Instead I decided to extra ct the filesystem from the image which would then allow me to mount it without specifying an offset .
Doing this is quite straightforward with ‘ dd ’ .
You need to give ‘ dd ’ a skip count , or , how far into the source to start copying , and a count , how much to copy .
Here you can either use the single byte offsets retrieved with parted or divide them by 512 and let ‘ dd ’ use 512 byte blocks .
Copying just one byte at a time takes a very long time , so I suggest using a larger block size .
Here is the command I used to extract my filesystem .
Skip is 2313360 ( 1184440320/512 ) and Count is 17719695 ( 9072483840/4 )
#dd if=hda.img of=hda3.img bs=512 skip=2313360 count=17719695 17719695+0 records in 17719695+0 records out 9072483840 bytes ( 9.1 GB ) copied , 485.679 seconds , 18.7 MB/s
After extracting the filesystem I was able to mount it without any problems .
# mount -o loop hda3.img /mnt/rabbit/ # df -h /mnt/rabbit Filesystem Size Used Avail Use % Mounted on /data/rabbit/image/hda3.img 8.4G 6.3G 1.7G 80 % /mnt/rabbit

A new poll by Sophos found that 60 % of the 1,588 respondents are thinking of closing their Facebook accounts , as controversy over its privacy practices ( or lack thereof ) continues to surface .
Facebook privacy issues are not new , and the past couple of years have witnessed numerous privacy scares , mostly in correlation with Facebook ’s rise to social networking prominence .
Sophos , the security firm , admitted that the poll was not even scientific , and the statistic that would probably be more interesting is the one that shows how many Facebook users even know about the privacy controversies .
Moreover , the users who took the Sophos poll were visitors to their site , indicating they already had concerns about security .
Still , the poll results do raise some interesting questions , especially in light of the latest Wall Street Journal report that some social networking sites , including Facebook and MySpace , were giving out user names to ad companies without permission .
Many Facebook users seem unaware of how to even configure the boatload of options necessary to secure privacy .
While some may be comfortable sharing their photo albums , others may not , and Facebook has an option for each and every component .
Nevertheless , other Facebook users are not concerned .
They knew information on Facebook was not secure in the first place .
Some even use it as a platform to express their ideas and want as many people as possible to view everything they post .
“ Nothing on the Internet is secure , ” one user argued .
Perhaps those who expect Facebook to protect their privacy are expecting too much from a commercial Internet company that is in the business of sharing information .
Still , if Facebook is to maintain its current spot as king of the social networking hill , it will have to at least appease its users ’ fears , even if their promises of privacy protection are disingenuous .
Maybe a more relevant poll question is : “ Would you post private information on Facebook ? ”
In an age when people are losing their jobs because they publish about each and every miniscule detail of their lives , online for the entire world to see , privacy for many means credit cards and social security numbers , not Facebook photos and instant messages .

Liquid fuel from sunlight .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A startup company , Joule Biotechnologies , Inc. , has developed an alternative solution of producing liquid fuel by harnessing sunlight to directly convert carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into liquid energy ( SolarFuel ) .
This eco-friendly system requires no agricultural land or fresh water and is capable of producing more than 20,000 gallons of renewable ethanol or hydrocarbons per acre annually .
Bill Sims , president and CEO of Joule Biotechnologies stated : “ There is no question that viable , renewable fuels are vitally important , both for economic and environmental reasons .
And while many novel approaches have been explored , none has been able to clear the roadblocks caused by high production costs , environmental burden and lack of real scale ” .
Bill Sims went on to say ; “ Joule was created for the very purpose of eliminating these roadblocks with the best equation of biotechnology , engineering , scalability and pricing to finally make renewable fuel a reality — all while helping the environment by reducing global CO 2 emissions . ”
By leveraging highly - engineered photosynthetic organisms to catalyze the conversion of sunlight and CO 2 , usable liquid fuels and chemicals can be manufactured .
This “ SolarConverter ” system assist the process capturing the sunlight to product conversion and separation using minimal resources .
This diverts from established processes of biomass derived biofuels such as algae and cellulose - based forms which are costly , involves many processing steps and substantial scale - up risk .

Joule Biotechnologies has a patent - pending “ Helioculture ” technology that far surpasses the limitations of other clean fuel processes by using sunlight to convert CO 2 directly into “ SolarFuel ” liquid energy .
This liquid energy has up to 100 times the energy storage density of conventional batteries , and can be very efficiently stored and shipped without any degradation of power .
The company ’s first product offering of “ SolarEthanol ” fuel , will be ready for commercial - scale development this year .
Joule Biotechnologies has also demonstrated proof of concept for producing hydrocarbon fuel and expects process demonstration by 2011 .

Advertisement A South Korean climber has reached the top of Annapurna in Nepal and claimed a record for becoming the first woman to scale the world 's 14 highest peaks .
Oh Eun-sun was shown live on television planting a South Korean flag on the summit of the mountain .
But there is still a row over Ms Oh's 2009 ascent of another Himalayan peak , with some disputing whether she reached the top .
She is due to be questioned about that climb on her return from Annapurna .
Ms
Oh threw her arms up in celebration after crawling on all fours for the final stretch to the summit , the Associated Press news agency reported .
DISPUTED ASCENT : KEY ISSUES
The summit photographs Sherpas ' accounts Different types of rope Timing of the ascent
The location of the flag
Is Oh Eun -sun a record - breaker ?
Poor weather last weekend prevented Ms Oh from reaching the summit of Annapurna , at 26,545 feet ( 8,091 metres ) - a notoriously difficult peak to climb .
Her nearest rival in the 14 - peaks quest , Spanish climber Edurne Pasaban , has expressed scepticism about her claim to have reached the summit of Kangchenjunga in 2009 .
Ms Oh has denied all the allegations .
Her sponsors called a press conference in December 2009 to reassert her claim to have reached the summit .
All climbers who make an ascent from Nepal report to Elizabeth Hawley , an 86 - year - old American based in Kathmandu , whose research is recorded in the Himalayan Database .
They have to answer her questions about the climb they have just undertaken .
She is widely accepted as the arbiter of Himalayan climbs .
There is no official body that authenticates claims .
ANALYSIS John Sudworth , BBC News , Seoul
The South Korean public will want to give Oh Eun - sun the benefit of the doubt .
Hers is a story that has much popular appeal , a plucky , tenacious climber who came from behind to beat those who once seemed much better positioned to win the prize .
Her record attempt has certainly sparked a media frenzy , today 's climb was broadcast live on national television with the help of a camera carried by another professional mountaineer who accompanied Ms Oh to the top .
Advertisers have also been getting in on the act , with companies buying space in this morning 's newspapers to wish her luck .
But her success has also been overshadowed by the news that , just hours before Ms Oh began her attempt , two other Korean mountain climbers were missing on the same mountain , and four others hospitalised .
But Ms Hawley has marked Ms Oh's 2009 climb as " disputed " and says that Ms Oh and her Sherpa will have to be questioned again about that ascent when they return from Annapurna .
One of the key issues at the heart of the dispute is a still photograph that , Ms Oh 's sponsors say , was taken at the summit but not on the " three or four square feet " right at the top .
Miss
Hawley says the photograph is " clearly " not taken at the summit , because Ms Oh is standing on rocks and " summit pictures of other people on the same mountain in the same season show them standing in the snow " .
However , pictures taken by climbers in previous years have shown rocks close to the summit .
Ms Oh 's ascent of Kangchenjunga remains recognised in the Himalayan Database , so she can claim the record .
However , if Ms Hawley 's further investigations lead her to change the status of the 2009 ascent to " unrecognised "
Ms
Oh would not be internationally regarded as the first woman to have climbed all 14 8,000ers , as they are known .
Twenty men have scaled all 14 summits - the latest climber completed the quest just 75 minutes before Ms Oh .

Months before he loaded his SUV with propane tanks and fireworks and drove to Times Square , police say , Faisal Shahzad went to a firearms store and bought a rifle .
It was found in his other car at Kennedy Airport , where his name showed up on the no-fly list in time to keep him from escaping .
Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) , is one of many people wondering why a suspected terrorist can be barred from flying but not from purchasing a gun .
It " defies common sense , " he says , that " the rights of terrorists are placed above the safety of everyday Americans . "
Well , not exactly .
Anyone convicted of terrorism has no right to buy a gun , since felons are barred under federal law .
And Lautenberg neglects to mention that in denying constitutional rights to people merely suspected of dangerous connections , he would deny rights to lots of peaceable " everyday Americans . "
His bill , the subject of a recent Senate hearing , gives the attorney general the power to block gun sales to anyone the government suspects of being a terrorist .
Never mind the obstacle known as the Second Amendment , which according to the Supreme Court protects an individual right to own guns for personal use .
Someone arrested , tried , and found guilty of a crime loses that particular freedom .
But Lautenberg 's bill would strip the right from many people without forcing the government to show they 've done anything wrong .
It 's not entirely clear what it takes to be tagged in the government 's terrorist watch list , which includes more than a million names and has been plagued with errors .
" How you get on is a mystery , and how you get off is extremely difficult , " says Mike German , a former FBI agent now with the American Civil Liberties Union .
A 2009 evaluation by the Justice Department 's inspector general found that many nominations " were processed with little or no information explaining why the subject may have a nexus to terrorism . "
The FBI also " did not consistently update or remove watch list records when appropriate . "
If you get put on the list by mistake , you may find yourself permanently exiled to the Twilight Zone .
The program under which innocent Americans may challenge their designation " does not always provide meaningful solutions , " according to the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security .
Supporters of the bill lament that , according to a report by the Government Accountability Office , people on the watch list have tried to buy firearms more than 1,200 times , with 91 percent of the sales going through .
That could mean al - Qaida has a good - sized secret domestic arsenal by now .
Or it could mean that a lot of people thought to be a mortal threat were about as bloodthirsty as Jill Biden .
The more interesting question is whether any of the purchases led to terrorist violence .
If supporters of the bill had examples to flog , you can be sure they would .
In any event , the FBI keeps track of anyone on the list who buys a gun and sometimes steps up surveillance in response .
The proposed law would n't have impeded Shahzad because he did n't make the list until after he bought the rifle .
Nidal Hasan , the alleged Fort Hood shooter , failed to get a nomination .
Most of the people on the terrorist roll , as it happens , can't buy guns legally anyway , because most of them are not Americans .
Under federal law , firearms may be purchased only by U.S. citizens or legal resident aliens .
Barring gun sales on the basis of mere suspicion might be permissible except for that pesky Second Amendment .
The Constitution does n't specifically enshrine the right to ride in a commercial airliner or even the right to travel .
The right to own a gun , by contrast , is right there in black and white .
Not only that , but someone blocked from boarding a plane can always travel by train , bus , boat , or car , says UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh , which is one reason courts have upheld restrictions on flying .
" But this completely prohibits you from even possessing a gun , " he notes , once you 've gotten notice that you are forbidden to buy one .
All this would happen without the normal requirements of due process , which makes it unconstitutional as well as unwise .
Note to the federal government :
You are entitled to deny firearms to anyone engaged in efforts to commit acts of terrorism — just as soon as you can prove it .

The result is a delicious dessert that has fewer carbs than a traditional cheesecake .
It tastes great , has a nice density , and is just waiting to be topped with your favorite fruits .
When you have a craving for cheesecake but need to stick to your low - carb diet , give this recipe a try .
It is sweetened with agave syrup , a common sugar substitute , and features a gluten - free crust made with almond meal .
Preparation
You can bake this cheesecake with or without a water bath .
The water bath simply means that you will place your foil - wrapped baking pan in a water - filled pan .
It 's a preferred method that can keep your cheesecake from cracking , but it 's not required .
First , heat oven to 375 F .
If you have bricks , a pizza stone , or an unglazed ceramic tile , place them on the lower rack of the oven .
By filling your oven with extra oven - safe items , you will hold more heat in the oven .
It is a good trick for cheesecakes not baked in a water bath and actually works well for all types of baking to keep a constant oven temperature .
Many bakers choose to leave things like pizza stones in the oven most of the time .
Make the Crust
In a small bowl , combine the almond meal , melted butter , and 2 teaspoons agave syrup .
Press into the bottom of a springform pan .
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes , until fragrant and just beginning to brown .
Raise the oven heat to 400 F if using a pizza stone .
Lower it to 350 F if you 're using a water bath ( see below ) .
Make the Cheesecake
It 's very important that you add the cheesecake ingredients one at a time .
If you do n't , your cheesecake will not set properly .
Read the following instructions carefully and you should be okay .
In a large bowl , beat the cream cheese with a mixer until smooth and fluffy .
Add the eggs , vanilla , lemon juice , remaining agave syrup , and Greek yogurt , scraping the bowl and beaters after each ingredient you add until it is fully incorporated before adding the next ingredient .
When all ingredients are combined , scrape one more time and beat for 1 minute .
Pour the mixture into the pan on top of the crust .
Baking in a Water Bath
Wrapping the pan will prevent any water from leaking into it and keep any cheesecake from leaking out .
If you forget this step , you might have a mess in the oven .
Wrap the bottom and sides of the springform pan in foil .
Place it in a larger baking pan and pour boiling water around the sides to come halfway up the pan .
Bake at 350 F for 60 to 90 minutes , checking it often .
When the cake is firm to touch but slightly soft in the center , or the center reaches 155 F , remove from the oven .
Cool to room temperature on a wire rack .
Baking Without a Water Bath
For this method , you start the cake at a high temperature , and then reduce it .
This will help reduce the chance that your cheesecake will crack .
Heat oven to 400 F .
Put the cheesecake on a baking sheet in case it drips and place it in the hot oven .
Close the door and immediately turn the oven down to 200 F .
Bake for 60 to 90 minutes , checking often after 1 hour .
When the cake is firm to touch but slightly soft in the center , or the center reaches 155 F , remove it from the oven .
Cool to room temperature on a wire rack .
Serving the Cheesecake
When the cheesecake has reached room temperature , refrigerate it in the pan until it is completely cold ( at least 2 hours ) .
Remove the springform collar and cut it into 16 pieces .
Top with fresh fruit , if desired .
Ingredient Substitutions and Cooking Tips
You can use a low - fat cream cheese , though a cheesecake does need some fat or it wo n't hold together well .
If you like , substitute 8 ounces of low - fat cream cheese for one of the 8 - ounce packages of regular cream cheese .
This tends to work well , even though the batter seems a little looser .
There is only a slight difference in the final product .
The cheesecake is fairly dense and becomes more so when completely cold .
For this reason , it 's best to serve it straight out of the refrigerator .
Top your cheesecake with any fresh fruit you like .
Strawberries are a great choice , especially when they are in season .
I ’m struggling with my article numbering now :-)
Regular readers will have noticed that I am running a whole bunch of series in parallel on this blog : one reviewing programming books , one on the issue of simplicity in programming , one reviewing Series 5 of Doctor Who , a related one on Russell T. Davies ’s contributions , and one on learning Lisp .
To my huge surprise , what started out as a review of Jon Bentley ’s book Programming Pearls [ amazon.com , amazon.co.uk ] has led through a sequence of digressions and become a series of its own on binary search .
This is part 4 of that series : when I ’ve finished part 4 , I will — at last ! — progress to the actual review .
But since part 4 is about the distinctly non-trivial subject of writing correct code , it will itself have to be composed of multiple sub-parts .
So this article on invariants is both part 1 of the new writing - correct - code series and part 4a of the binary - search series .
Hope that ’s clear .
A few people have complained about the sushi pictures on this blog , so before I plough into the article proper , here is something completely different .
Tools for thinking about code
In previous articles , I ’ve complained about using testing as a crutch ( note : not complained about testing ) , and rather self - righteously claimed that people should think about their code .
What exactly do I mean by that ?
In this mini-series , I want to draw attention to a few concepts that will be patronisingly familiar to most of you who have CS degrees , but which will hopefully be helpful to any avocational programmers hoping to tighten up their code .
Anyone who attempted the binary - search challenge and did n’t get it right first time ( modulo syntax errors and other such trivia ) might find something of use here .
The three tools I have in mind are :
Invariants
Bound functions
Preconditions / postconditions
These are powerful concepts , and can be used at different degrees of formality and rigour .
At one extreme , some computer - science researchers might try to use these concepts to mathematically prove the correctness of a piece of code — perhaps with the proof being an order of magnitude longer than the code .
At the other extreme , a seasoned professional developer probably always has at least a fuzzy and informal notion of an invariant in the back of his head whenever he writes a loop .
I think that we would often benefit from thinking more explicitly about invariants .
But note that in this article I will go rather overboard for the purposes of explanation , and use a level of detail that I would never normally use for a program as trivial as a binary search .
So : I am not suggesting that we should invest this level of analysis in every loop we ever write .
What is an invariant ?
An invariant is a property that remains true throughout the execution of a piece of code .
It ’s a statement about the state of a program — primarily the values of variables — that is not allowed to become false .
( If it does become false , then the code is wrong . )
Choosing the correct invariant — one that properly expresses the intent of an algorithm — is a key part of the design of code ( as opposed to the design of APIs ) ; and ensuring that the invariant remains true is a key part of the actual coding .
Roughly speaking , if your invariant properly expresses the intent of the algorithm , and if your code properly maintains the invariant , then that is enough for you to be confident that the code , if it terminates , yields the correct answer .
( Ensuring that it does in fact terminate is the job of the bound function , which I will talk about next time . )
As usual , an ounce of example is worth a ton of explanation , so let ’s go back to the problem of binary search , and see if we can build a routine whose correctness we ’re confident of even before we run our tests .
A brief recap of linear and binary search
Here ’s a quick reminder of what binary search is about .
The goal is to find a value in an array .
If the array contains one or more instances of the value , then the search function should return one of the indexes of the sought value , otherwise it should return - 1 .
( To help us concentrate on the algorithm , we ’ll assume that the values are all integers — we could do this with templates and generics and whatnot , but for our current purposes that would only obscure the algorithmic issues that we want to concentrate on . )
In the general case of searching in an array , you ca n’t do better than the trivial linear search code ( expressed in C ; the code is pretty much identical in C++ or Java ) .
Here we call the array a , it has size elements , and the sought value is called val :
int linear_search ( const int a[ ] , const int size , const int val ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < size ; i++ ) if ( a [ i ] == val ) return i ; return - 1 ; }
This function takes , on average , size / 2 probes to find an element that is present , and size probes to determine that one is absent .
We say that it is O ( n ) , which means simply that its run-time is proportional to n .
But if we are allowed to assume that the array is sorted ( in ascending order ) then we can do much better .
We can use the binary search algorithm : here , we cut the search space in half at each step rather than reducing it by one .
We guess that the middle element of the array might be equal to val ; if it is , we ’re done , otherwise we can narrow the search to either the top half of the array ( if the mid-point is less than val ) or the bottom half ( otherwise ) .
Then we probe the midpoint of the new , smaller , range , and continue in this fashion until we either find the element or discover that the remaining range is empty .
Because binary search cuts the search - space in half at each step , it converges on the desired value much more quickly than linear search — in log2 ( n ) steps .
For very small arrays that difference is negligible ; but when searching in an array of a million elements , binary search needs 20 probes rather than 500,000 on average for a linear search .
What is the invariant for binary search ?
In informal terms , the invariant for this algorithm is : “ if the sought value is present in the array at all , then it is present in the current range ” .
To make it useful for deriving correct code , though , we need to formalise that invariant in terms of specific variables and values .
And before we can do this , we need to decide on the representation of the range under consideration .
There are several candidate representations , none of them greatly better or worse than the others : we could keep track of the highest and lowest array indexes that might hold val , or the lowest index and the size of the range ; or use asymmetric indexes , where we maintain the index to the base of the current range and the index that points past the end .
For this version of the routine , I ’m going to arbitrarily choose to represent the range by two variables , lower and upper , which contain the lowest and highest indexes into a that might contain val .
With this representation , we can formalise the invariant as :
if val is at any position i in a , ( i.e. a [ i ] ==val ) then lower <= i <= upper .
So long as we ensure this invariant is kept true , we can be confident that our code will not fail to find val if it ’s present .
( This does n’t show that the program will terminate , but we ’ll look at that next time . )
Armed with this invariant , we can write the code with some confidence that it ’s right ( and indeed this C function that I just wrote passed all tests first time ) :
int binary_search ( const int a[ ] , const int size , const int val ) { int lower = 0 ; int upper = size - 1 ;
/* invariant : if a [ i ] ==val for any i , then lower <= i <= upper */ while ( lower <= upper ) { int i = lower + ( upper- lower ) / 2 ; if ( val == a [ i ] ) { return i ; } else if ( val < a [ i ] ) { upper = i - 1 ; } else { /* val > a [ i ] */ lower = i+1 ; } } return - 1 ; }
Informal proof of the code
Here is the reasoning that led to the code above , expressed pretty informally .
The first thing to do is establish the invariant that ’s going to hold true for the rest of the function , so we set the variables lower and upper to appropriate values ( i.e. the lowest and highest indexes within the whole of a ) .
and to appropriate values ( i.e. the lowest and highest indexes within the whole of ) .
We have ensured that the invariant is true when we first enter the loop .
To show that stays true throughout the running of the function , we need to show that whenever it ’s true at the top of the loop , it ’s also true at the bottom .
The first statement of the loop ( assigning to i ) does not affect any of the variables referenced by the invariant , so it ca n’t possibly cause the invariant to stop being true .
( Note that a and val can never be changed as we declared them const , so we only need to worry about lower and upper . )
) does not affect any of the variables referenced by the invariant , so it ca n’t possibly cause the invariant to stop being true .
( Note that and can never be changed as we declared them , so we only need to worry about and . )
What follows is a three - way IF statement : we need to show that each of the three branches maintains the invariant .
The first branch covers the case where we have found the sought element .
At this point , we ’re returning from the function ( and therefore breaking out of the loop ) so we do n’t really care about the invariant any more ; but for what it ’s worth , it remains true , as we do n’t change the values of lower or upper .
or .
The second branch ( val < a [ i ] ) is the first time we need to use non-trivial reasoning .
If we ’re in this branch , we know that the condition guarding it was true , i.e. val < a [ i ] .
But because a is sorted , we also know that for all j > i , a[j ] >= a [ i ] .
This means that val < all a[j ] with j >= i , so the highest position it can be at is a [ i - 1 ] .
Knowing this , we can set upper to i-1 , and know that the invariant still holds good with the new , more restrictive value of upper .
Notice what has happened here : we have shrunk the range to half its previous size or less , but simple reasoning about the code persuades us that we still know where val must be ( if it ’s anywhere in a ) .
We are confident that we have not inadvertently excluded it from the range .
) is the first time we need to use non-trivial reasoning .
If we ’re in this branch , we know that the condition guarding it was true , i.e. .
But because is sorted , we also know that for all .
This means that < all , so the highest position it can be at is .
Knowing this , we can set to , and know that the invariant still holds good with the new , more restrictive value of .
Notice what has happened here : we have shrunk the range to half its previous size or less , but simple reasoning about the code persuades us that we still know where must be ( if it ’s anywhere in ) .
We are confident that we have not inadvertently excluded it from the range .
The third branch follows the same form as the second : since we know that val > a [ i ] and that a [ i ] >= a[j ] for all j < i , we can conclude that the lowest position val can be at is a [ i+1 ] , so we adjust lower accordingly and maintain the invariant .
and that for all , we can conclude that the lowest position can be at is , so we adjust accordingly and maintain the invariant .
Since we ’ve verified that all three branches of the IF maintain the invariant , we know that the invariant holds on exiting that IF .
That means the invariant is true at the bottom of the loop , which means it will be true at the start of the next time around the loop .
And by induction we deduce that it always remains true .
Finally , we break out of the loop when the candidate range is empty , i.e. when it ’s been shrunk to negative size , so lower > upper .
At this point , we know that the condition of the invariant ( “ if val is at any position i in a ” ) does not hold , so the invariant is trivially true ; and we return the out - of - band value - 1 .
Does this sound like an awful lot of work ?
When it ’s spelled out step by step in this way , yes ; but in practice , you never need to go this slowly and carefully unless you ’re writing avionics software , a life - support system ’s firmware , or a Reinvigorated Programmer article .
The point is not necessarily to go through the code in small pedantic steps like this , but to spend some time up front understand what the invariant is , keep that invariant in mind while coding , and understand the resulting code to whatever depth seems appropriate .
It takes much longer to read about this ( and much longer to write about it ! ) than it does to actually do it .
Writing the C function above took two or three minutes ; just being explicitly aware of the invariant was nine tenths of the battle .
This code is good
I ’m going to claim that this code is objectively better than most of the solutions that were posted in response to the original challenge — better , even , than most of the correct solutions .
[ Yes , I realise that I am setting myself up for a really big fall if someone finds a bug in it ! ]
Here ’s why :
It ’s short , which makes it easier to understand and maintain .
It has no special cases — array of length 0 and 1 are handled by the main code .
The single comment is genuinely informative .
In short , the code obeys the golden rule from The Elements of Programming Style : “ Say what you mean simply and directly “ .
Through the use of a simple but powerful technique , I was able to write compact , clear code in a short time ; and be pretty confident , even before I tested it , that it was correct .
That last point is important not as some kind of macho posturing , but because it means that the tests , when I run them , are giving a second distinct line of sight on the problem .
I ’m not using tests to make my code right ( even if that were possible , which I ’ve argued is not the case ) .
Instead , I have written code that I already think is right , and I ’m using the tests as an independent line of verification .
You may remember in the last post that I said : “ writing tests lets you triangulate ” ; I was trying to be conciliatory towards all the test - driven developers out there , but actually that ’s not true most of the time — because if the tests are the development then all you ’re getting when you run them is validation that doing the same thing again gives you the same result .
Let me try an analogy to explain what I mean .
If I am paying the bill at a restaurant and I want to add up the amounts for the various dishes , I add from top to bottom , then verify by adding from bottom to top .
By approaching the same problem from two different directions , I give myself the best chance of avoiding mistakes ; whereas if I add in the same direction both times , I am liable to repeat a “ favourite mistake ” like adding 8+7 and making the result 13 rather than 15 .
Or I might verify by using another different technique such as column - at - a - time - and - carry .
The point is to use multiple techniques that have different points of weakness .
But when testing and development are the same thing , then I ca n’t use testing to verify my development .
Why does no - one talk about invariants ?
The great mystery to me is why no - one seems to talks about invariants any more .
You will of course find them in The Elements of Programing Style , Programming Pearls , and other books of similar vintage , but they are not to be found in , say , Refactoring .
Here is an amazing statistic : the original binary - search challenge post has now attracted more than seven hundred comments .
Of those seven hundred , only three comments [ Mihai , dave , Darius Bacon ] so much as mention invariants .
( All three comments are candidate solutions to the binary - search challenge : Mihai ’s and dave ’s use invariant assertions and Darius ’s mentions the invariant in comments . )
That is astonishing to me , given that we ’ve all been trying to solve a problem that is known to be subtle — I warned about its deceptive difficulty up front — and one that is so amenable to analysis using an invariant .
I can only assume that they do n’t teach invariants in CS degrees any more .
( Surely that ’s not actually true ?
Anyone graduated recently care to comment ? )
Here is my best guess on how such a useful technique has become so unfashionable : I think it ’s collateral damage from the huge popularity of object - oriented programming .
The ability to reason rigorously about a program depends on having solid knowledge of its relevant state , and what is an “ object ” but a big opaque ball of mutable state that can change under our feet ?
Yes , objects “ hide ” state by encapsulating it ; but it ’s still there — everyone is naked under their clothes .
Changes to object state cause changes to its behaviour , which makes them hard to reason about .
( This is why object - oriented techniques do n’t work well in concurrent systems , hence in part the growth of interest in functional languages as multi-core processors become increasingly ubiquitious . )
[ Note well — and I say this because almost everything I write on this blog seems to get misinterpreted somewhere or other : I am not , repeat not , saying object - orientation is A Bad Thing .
I am saying that it has a specific and important drawback which ought to be taken into account , alongside its benefits , when deciding where its use is appropriate . ]
Finally , I think there is a practical point to be made here : where languages have facilities that let us mark objects as immutable , or mark methods as pure queries , we should take advantage of them whenever possible — as I did in the code above , where a , size and val were all marked const .
And where languages lack those features , we should grind our teeth in fruitless despair and cry out to the heavens .

Update : links to this whole series
Forwards
The Flyer forwards are probably the deepest in the league next to the Chicago Blackhawks - even without Jeff Carter .
Claude Giroux , who has scored 11 points in 12 games , is playing in a bottom six role and will force the Canadiens to give increased minutes to players they do n’t want playing increased minutes .
The Flyers resurgence came when Mike Richards laid out David Krejci , breaking his wrist and ending his playoffs , and when Simon Gagne returned from his own injury .
Gagne has scored big goals for the Flyers , including the overtime winner in game 4 and the game winner in game 7 .
Gagne has scored over 40 goals twice in his career and if he has regained that type of form then the Canadiens are in trouble .
The Flyer forwards are also mean and physical .
They will attack the Montreal defence in a way that neither Washington nor Pittsburgh did .
This is n't a defence that works well under those type of conditions .
While the Flyers attack is well - balanced the Canadiens offense has been anything but .
Mike Cammalleri has scored 12 goals , while Brian Gionta has 7 .
No one else has more than 4 .
If the Canadiens are unable to get production from other sources they will not advance .
The Flyers have the defenceman capable of shutting down one line .
Edge : Flyers
Defence
The Montreal defence has played terrifically throughout the first two rounds of the playoffs and did a tremendous job shutting down Ovechkin , Crosby , and Malkin .
However , the Flyers forward group poses an entirely different problem for the Habs .
While they may not have the same top - tier talent as Washington or Pittsburgh they are certainly much deeper and have more than one or two players capable of burning the Canadiens .
Montreal will need another pairing besides Gill and Gorges to play in a shutdown role .
I 'm not sure they have one .
Although , P.K. Subban is an interesting wild card in all of this .
If he can elevate his game and emulate Gill and Gorges then the Canadiens have a much better chance of winning .
The Montreal defence also takes a hit if Andrei Markov is unable to return from injury .
He has skated lightly , but by all indications he is out for the remainder of the playoffs .
The Flyers have Chris Pronger who will play close to 30 minutes a game and has the ability to neutralize the Canadiens top players .
Montreal has not received balanced scoring throughout the post - season and it might catch up to them this round if Pronger is able to stop Mike Cammalleri .
Edge : Flyers
Goaltending
Jaroslav Halak has been absolutely insane this post - season .
Halak leads the playoffs with a sizzling .933 % .
He has stopped 420 shots , which leads the next goalie ( Tuukka Rask ) by almost 50 .
He was the difference in the first round against the Capitals and played just as well in the second round against the Penguins .
The remaining goalie with the next best save percentage is Brian Boucher with a .915 % .
He is now injured for the remainder of the playoffs and the Flyers are hoping that Michael Leighton can continue his improbable play of the regular season where he posted a 2.48 GAA and a .918 % with the Flyers .
In three playoff appearances , Leighton has a 1.54 GAA and a .943 % .
These are numbers that certainly wo n’t last , but Leighton is in a position where he does n’t have to play out of his mind in the same way the Canadiens need Halak to .
If the Flyers receive adequate goaltending from Leighton , something the Pens did not receive from Fleury , they should have enough skill and determination to beat the Canadiens .
Edge : Canadiens
Special Teams
Both teams have almost identical power - plays .
The Canadiens are scoring at a rate of 21.6 % ( 11 goals in 51 opportunities ) , while the Flyers have a slightly better rate of 21.7 % ( 13 goals in 60 opportunities ) .
Penalty kill stats are the same story .
The Canadiens have managed to kill off 85.5 % of their penalties , while the Flyers have a slightly lower rate of 83.6 % .
Edge : Even
Coaching
Peter Laviolette replaced John Stevens as coach of the Flyers in December .
He has led his teams to the playoffs only three times in eight seasons as a head coach , but has won a Stanley Cup ( that being in 2006 with the Carolina Hurricanes ) .
Laviolette must be given a ton of credit for keeping the Flyers focused during their series with Boston , despite facing a daunting 3 - 0 hole .
He ’s also had to deal with multiple injuries up front , the most glaring being Jeff Carter .
The Flyers have managed to overcome a great deal of adversity to make it to the Conference Final and Laviolette is a big reason .
Jacques Martin is a former Jack Adams Award winner and most notably coached the power - house Ottawa teams of the late 90s and early 2000s .
These are the same teams that notoriously underperformed each post - season – losing in the first round five out of eight seasons .
This will only be the second time a Jacques Martin led team has advanced past the second round of the playoffs .
Martin holds the edge in experience over Laviolette , but does not have a Stanley Cup ring to go along with it .
Edge : Flyers
How they got there
The Flyers were on the brink of being swept 4 - 0 and then it was discovered David Krejci was done for the playoffs and that Simon Gagne would be returning .
From that point on the Flyers erased a 3 - 0 deficit and a 3 - 0 deficit in game 7 to become only the third team in NHL history to rebound from a 3 - 0 hole .
The Flyers have a lot of momentum heading into this series against the Canadiens .
The Habs came back from being down 3 - 2 in their series with the defending champs to win decidedly in game 7 .
Breaking the President ’s Trophy winners and then the defending Stanley Cup champions is enough to make any team think they ’re the 1976 - 1977 Canadiens .
The Habs have also received more time off since the second round , but have also played in two game 7s already , meaning they have played two more games than the Flyers .
At some point those extra miles will catch up to the Canadiens .
Slight Edge : Flyers
Psychological
The Canadiens will get a boost of energy and confidence every time they play in front of the home crowd at the Bell Centre .
The atmosphere has been absolutely electric and it almost single - handedly won the Canadiens game 6 against the Penguins .
Not only will the crowd build energy for the Canadiens , but it will demoralize the Flyers after big saves by Halak .
Halak is the second psychological factor the Habs have working for them .
Every time they score a goal they have the confidence in having a brick wall behind them .
When the Canadiens jump out to an early lead they play like an entirely different team – one that is extremely difficult to defeat .
The Flyers are only the third team to overcome a 3 - 0 series deficit .
The Flyers are ready to face anything at this point .
Edge : Canadiens
Experience / Leadership
The only player on the Flyers with a Stanley Cup is Chris Pronger .
He won it in 2007 with the Anaheim Ducks .
Both Pronger and Richards were a part of the 2010 Olympic Gold medal winning Canadian team and Simon Gagne also won a Gold medal for Canada at the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics .
The Canadiens have multiple Stanley Cup winners .
Scott Gomez , Brian Gionta , Hal Gill , and Travis Moen have all won Stanley Cups in their careers .
Gomez has won two Stanley Cups .
Montreal did not have any players on a medal winning team at the Vancouver Olympics .
Edge : Montreal
Prediction : Flyers in 7
The Eastern Conference finals take place tonight as the Philadelphia Flyers take on the Montreal Canadiens .
It ’s truly crazy to think that two teams who made it into the playoffs on their last game are now vying for a spot in the Stanley Cup final .
Philadelphia needed a shoot - out victory over the New York Rangers on the last day of the season to secure their playoff berth , while the Canadiens received a single point in an over - time loss to the Maple Leafs to squeak in the night before .
If the Maple Leafs just took care of business in regulation we would n’t be in this predicament .
Maybe things will change when I get my hands on a Delorean .
Until then , here ’s the breakdown of the Eastern Conference finals .
Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo , the president of the Vatican 's Pontifical Council for the Family , said in addition to the doctors and nurses , the measure could apply to " relatives , politicians and lawmakers " whom he called " protagonists in this abominable crime " .
The girl , whose identity has not been released , had " fallen in the hands of evildoers " , the cardinal said in an interview with local television on Tuesday .
In May Colombia 's constitutional court partially lifted the ban on abortion in this deeply Catholic country , allowing pregnancies to be terminated in cases of severe deformity of the foetus , when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or when the mother 's life is in danger .
The first test of the ruling came when the girl sought to terminate her pregnancy , which followed her being raped by her stepfather .
The man admitted to the abuse , which began when the child was seven .
When the case became public , doctors were wary of performing the abortion as the text of the court 's ruling has yet to be published and they feared prosecution .
But the high court issued a new ruling , compelling doctors to abide by its decision if the woman 's case fell within the criteria .
Once the ruling was handed down , the girl 's pregnancy was terminated at a public hospital in Bogotá .
Carlos Lemus , the director of Simon Bolivar hospital where the abortion was performed , said he respected the church 's decision but did not share its view .
" We acted within the constitutional framework , " Dr Lemus said .
" We were faced with the petition of a girl who wanted to go back to playing with her toys . "
He said Cardinal Trujillo " calls the doctors and nurses ' evildoers ' .
I think the person who raped her is the evildoer " .
A senator , Gina Parody , said : " The Vatican has the right to excommunicate whomever they choose .
But I would hope that they also excommunicate priests when they rape boys or girls . "
The president of Colombia 's ecclesiastic tribunal , Monsignor Libardo Ramírez , said according to canonical law excommunication was applied to anyone who participated in the " murder of a child in the womb " .
But he added that it would be up to Cardinal Rubiano Sáenz , as the leading figure of the Roman Catholic church in Colombia , to decide whether to formally apply the sanctions and to whom .
Public health authorities have estimated that more than 300,000 clandestine abortions are carried out each year in the country .
Illegal abortion is punishable by up to three years in prison for both the women who terminate their pregnancies and for the doctors who perform the procedure .
