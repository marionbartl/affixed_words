Courtesy of Brandon Vera 's twitter :
just found out I 'm firing Jon Bones Jones on March 21st in Denver Colorado .
hope u heard it here first !!!!
Well , it certainly did n't take long for Vera to land a new opponent in the wake of Antonio Rogerio Nogueira 's injury .
I 've often said that the five men in the UFC I would keep Jon Jones away from at this stage in his development are Lyoto Machida ( for obvious reasons ) , Shogun Rua ( for obvious reasons ) , Antonio Rogerio Nogueira ( obvious again ) , Keith Jardine ( awkward style presents a major risk and you look ugly fighting him ) and Brandon Vera .
Jones ' length is obviously still an asset but against Vera it will be less so , not to mention that Vera has top notch Muay Thai skills .
Maybe he does n't always let those skills show but they are there and when he does share them with the world , he is very dangerous .
It 's not that I am confident Vera wins this fight , but it is much more of a challenge than I think many people will understand at first glance .

Premier Dalton McGuinty says public service workers have been " sheltered " from the recession and strongly hinted that unpaid days off loom for many on the taxpayers ' payroll .
McGuinty said Wednesday it 's not fair private - sector workers are feeling the pinch while civil servants " clearly " are not , since the province faces a record $ 24.7 billion deficit this year .
" The issue is now , ` So , how can we contribute to the solution ? ' " the premier said , when asked about the possibility of unpaid " Dalton Days " for tens of thousands of workers .
" I like the alliteration , " he quipped , " but we 're going to have to sit down with our public - sector partners . "
In 1993 , former NDP premier Bob Rae mandated 12 days of furlough known as " Rae Days , " which infuriated labour unions but prevented mass layoffs .
Speaking to business leaders at an annual economic summit organized by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce in Niagara - on - the - Lake , McGuinty pulled no punches .
" You might argue that we in government have been sheltered from the ravages of the global recession .
That 's been a privileged position for us to occupy , " he said , conceding public servants , including teachers , nurses and bureaucrats might not be pleased with the tack the government takes .
" People inherently want to do the right thing and sometimes the right thing is not the easy thing to do . "
Ontario Federation of Labour president Wayne Samuelson said it's " bizarre " that McGuinty may target workers to tackle a deficit that is in part exacerbated by slashing corporate taxes .
" If the government had any ... respect for people and the economy , they would be bringing people together to have conversations rather than going to fancy business soirées and throwing this kind of stuff around , " said Samuelson , whose organization represents 700,000 unionized workers in the province .
" It 's hurtful , it 's not helpful and it just creates unnecessary tensions in people 's lives .
There are people who will read about this in the paper and they 'll worry about being able to pay the rent . "
Nor is a Rae - style " social contract " legal any more , said Randy Robinson , of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union , which represents 130,000 workers in government , the Liquor Control Board of Ontario and more than 500 other employers in the public sector .
Robinson noted that in 2007 , the Supreme Court of Canada struck down British Columbia legislation that dismantled union contracts and stripped job protection .
" If they are talking about legislating some sort of `social contract '- like legislation , I think they will find that any such legislation is quite likely to be struck down by the courts , " he said .
Ontario Nurses ' Association president Linda Haslam - Stroud rejected McGuinty 's claim that public - service workers have been sheltered from the worldwide economic turmoil .
" Front - line nurses have not been sheltered , " said Haslam - Stroud , who pointed out cash - strapped Ontario hospitals have been forced to cut 2.4 million hours of registered nursing care in the past six months .
That 's the equivalent of 1,200 registered nurses ' positions , she said .

Haslam - Stroud also said " Rae Days " were an economic boondoggle , at least in hospitals , because nurses on unpaid leave ended up being called in to work on overtime , which ultimately cost more .
Ken Coran , president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation , said the union has not been told " Dalton Days " are on the table and would expect " strong consultation " on such a move .
" We understand that there is a $ 24.7 billion deficit and if there are ways to address that issue that would not involve things such as ` Dalton Days , ' we would certainly be a part of the consultation process – although I can't say we would agree to whatever direction is finalized , " said Coran .
No details of any deficit - fighting plan are expected until Finance Minister Dwight Duncan tables the provincial budget next spring .
Among other options the Liberals are considering are a 5 per cent cut of every area of spending except health care and education .
But since $ 62.6 billion of the projected $ 113.7 billion budget – or about 55 per cent – goes toward those two big - ticket items , even a 5 per cent trim of the remaining $ 51.1 billion in expenditures would yield only $ 2.55 billion in savings .
With four out of every five dollars spent by the province going toward salaries , it may be difficult to avoid " Dalton Days " or , worse , permanent job cuts .
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said " it does not make any sense " to be considering such draconian measures at the same time as billions in corporate tax cuts are on the horizon for Bay Street .

WASHINGTON  Conservative bloggers and opinion outlets in recent days have expressed mounting alarm about an executive order by President Obama that extended certain privileges and immunities to the International Criminal Police Organization , better known as Interpol .
Bloggers have accused Mr. Obama of ceding American sovereignty , painting a portrait of an international police force operating on United States soil without legal restraints .
They have also argued that the order is part of a plot to allow international courts to arrest and prosecute American officials for war crimes .
That theme is making its way from the blogosphere to more mainstream news outlets .
In a Web post for the conservative National Review last week , the commentator Andrew C. McCarthy declared that an “ international police force ” could now operate inside the United States “ unrestrained by the U.S. Constitution and American law . ”
He also suggested that the order created in the Justice Department “ a repository for stashing government files ” beyond the reach of Congress and the public .
And an editorial in The Washington Examiner this week declared that “ this new directive from Obama may be the most destructive blow ever struck against American constitutional civil liberties . ”
UNIVERSITY PARK , PA -- A Penn State expert on probabilistic simulation thinks that the large number of shark attacks that recently took place in Florida might be explained through probability theory .
" It really does seem that there is indeed something odd going on with the ocean currents , temperatures , food supply , or water chemistry , which would explain the recent reported spate of shark attacks ; however , even if such attacks were purely ' random ' and independent of each other , it is not surprising that they seem to occur in ' clumps ' in time -- like this past summer -- and then not at all for a long time , " explains David Kelton , professor of management science in Penn State 's Smeal College of Business .
Kelton , who researches the probabilistic and statistical aspects of simulation , is chair of Smeal College 's Department of Management Science and Information Systems .
" There is something in probability theory called a Poisson process , giving amazingly good descriptions of such random independent events occurring through time , like customer arrivals to a fast - food store , cosmic rays striking a planet , accidents in a factory , airplane mishaps , and maybe shark attacks , " says Kelton .
Reasonable and realistic physical assumptions imply that the time between successive events follows what is called an exponential distribution , the most likely value of which is zero ( or arbitrarily close to zero ) .
" So on a time line , you see lots of very small inter- event times , meaning that the events happen in clumps , then a long time will go by when nothing happens , representing an infrequent but possible observation from the right tail of the distribution , " says Kelton .
" After the fact , it seems that 'it never rains but what it pours . '
This is what 's sometimes called a ' Poisson burst ' of events . "
This process , Kelton points out , was discovered by the French mathematician and probabilist Poisson , who was consulting with the Prussian army to explain why so may Prussian army officers were being killed by getting kicked by horses .
After the Honeymoon : 20 Things I Don't Like About the Droid
by phil on Sunday Dec 13 , 2009 9:31 PM
mainfeed
I 've had an iPhone for a year and a half and have developed apps for the App Store .
I switched to the Droid a few weeks ago , and during my honeymoon period with the device , I wrote a list of 20 Things I Like About the Droid .
In the interest of fairness , though , here 's the opposite list .
And by " Droid , " I 'm referring to the total experience of Google Android , Verizon Wireless , and the Motorola Droid device .
Because , most new and prospective Android users right now will be on the Droid with Verizon .
Android - Specific
Removing Apps requires too many steps .
Actually , I should n't refer to it as " Removing Apps , " but rather use the Android terminology , " Uninstalling Apps , " which is appropriate because it feels like a more involved process .
No built - in screenshot button combination .
I miss the slingshot feedback from the iPhone when you scroll past the edge of the screen .
Otherwise , when I have a list that takes up the whole screen , I can't tell whether my screen is stuck or there are no more entries .
What 's up with all the buttons ?
The iPhone has one button and it 's fine .
What 's especially annoying is the Menu button .
When you 're in an App , and you 're staring blankly , hunting around for a feature , it finally hits you , " Oh , maybe there 's something under the Menu button . "
Lame .
Along the same vein , the back button is ambiguous .
When you press it , you wonder , " is this going to take me back a view , or exit me out of the app ? "
The problem is there 's no consistent indicator as to what " back " means .
On the iPhone , the back button almost always has a dynamic label indicating what you 're backing up to .
This is not really Android 's fault per se , but I dislike the lack of excitement and camaraderie that the iPhone has .
I bought an iPhone around the same time that a lot of my friends were buying it , and I felt there was a lot of sharing of Apps and tips .
I 'm pretty much alone with an Android phone , and I have no idea what 's good on the Market .
I have n't had one of those , " Ooh , did you try this yet ? " conversations .
Not all apps are required to have screenshots .
As a result , only about a third of the apps I check out have a screenshot .
I 'm really taking a leap - of - faith getting an app without even seeing how it looks like .
You can't really shop from your desktop .
There 's an Android Market website , but it 's not comprehensive .
When I had an iPhone , I bought about two - thirds of my apps from the desktop since I could more easily look at descriptions , reviews , and even videos .
Oh , and when you buy an app , it does n't ask you for a password .
There 's probably a setting for this , but man , as a default , this is a major security fail .
When you purchase an app , there 's a series of yellow warning signs saying things like , " This application has access to System Tools : modify global system settings , change Wi-Fi state , change network connectivity , change your UI settings . "
Every time I see these , I have an " Oh Crap " moment , when I just pray that the hive vetted this app thoroughly .
The overall quantity , quality and polish of Android Apps is n't as high as the iPhone .
For example , the best Twitter app for Android is nowhere near as good as Tweetie 2 on the iPhone .
And some of my major favorites on the iPhone , like the Kindle app , do n't exist .
When using Android apps , I sometimes get the feeling like I 'm back in the Blackberry or Windows Mobile world — i.e. in a world where apps are n't made with passion .
Call quality does n't seem as good as on the iPhone - AT&T .
After having gotten used to Visual Voicemail for the iPhone , the lack of it with Verizon makes me feel like I 'm using old technology .
There 's a Visual VM app that you can download , but you have to pay $ 2.99 / mo .
Fine , so I tried to do that today , and bam , got a message along the lines , " Sorry , but the service you 're requesting is currently not available . "
Fail .
This is an obvious one : not being able to use 3G Internet while you 're on a phone call .
When I 'm on a long phone call , it 's like I 'm in a digital cone of silence , unable to know if I 'm getting any new mail .
One of the first major annoying things I noticed was that it takes much longer than the iPhone to charge up , especially when you try to charge from a computer .
I 've never had enough patience to wait for it to get fully charged when plugged into my Macbook .
The battery cover slips off intermittently , especially when trying to pull it from your pocket .
This is a major fail in my opinion , and Droid probably should n't have shipped with this problem .
Proximity detection is not as accurate as on the iPhone .
About a third of time when I draw away from a phone call , the screen remains blank .
I have to then fiddle with the power button and otherwise fumble around .
Screen refresh rate is lower than the iPhone .
I was disappointed that there were no earphones bundled with the device .
I tried my iPhone earbuds ( both the 3G and the 3GS ones ) , and the buttons on them did n't work .
I wish I could answer a call or stop a song from them .
I do n't care that much for haptic feedback .
It does n't really add much to the usability , and what you get in return are these sensations that are like stings or little shocks .
As a result , every time you press the screen , you have this subtle anticipation that you are about to tap something that might buzz you .
Comments
Overall , I 'm very happy with the Droid .
I bought it partly for business reasons , and partly because AT&T was dropping calls at my new place .
There 's many many things that the Droid can do that the iPhone can't ( true to the advertisements ) .
For example , I typed a first draft of this post on the Droid 's physical keyboard , something I could n't have done on the iPhone .
So I really feel like I have a device that I can do some serious work on .

Replace the word " fail " with " failure " or " flaw " at each usage and the credibility of your article increases tenfold .
Morgan said on December 14 , 2009 10:20 AM :
I agree with the general feel of this article .
The overall polish of Droid , and Android as a whole , is much less than the iPhone .
That being said , the ability for Droid to leapfrog the iPhone is wide open .
Really , all of what you said are definitely annoyances , but nothing compared to the keyboard .
I love my Droid , I just ... can't get the hang of the keyboard .
It 's terrible , especially if you have headphones plugged in at the same time .
It 's really uncomfortable to use , and the buttons are much too hard to press .
That being said , I would n't trade in my Droid for a 3GS .

mastershake said on December 21 , 2009 12:08 AM :
1 . You can place shortcut to applications settings on desktop and uninstall with 2 clicks
4 . Multiple buttons are for multitasking - switching between windows , going back separately which is easily accessible in keyboard mode as well .
It 's a habit problem for you not to check the menu first .
5 . Back button either closes a pop up menu , or if you are in the main program , it leaves the program - I 've never had a confusion about this .
12 . You can increase the call quality of your droid on verizon menu http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Zyu-LeTes
15 . Charge from wall
16 .
Get a case - there are 2 piece cases which will protect your phone from shattering and keep anything from sliding out
20 . Lack of habbit ?
good luck

You can turn haptic feedback off .
What 's a real # 20 then ?
Philip Dhingra said on December 21 , 2009 1:29 AM :
Okay , then how about getting too many Application Update notifications .
In some ways , I miss the more strict guidelines for Apple 's applications .
mastershake said on December 21 , 2009 1:51 AM :
Heh , I agree with that one , but I just do n't update my apps unless I know I really want to
DroidDev said on December 21 , 2009 8:36 AM :
Visual voicemail , really ?
Your not doing it right ... google voice FTW .
Nichole said on December 21 , 2009 9:22 AM :
Loved this post !
Brought out some great things that will help me make the Droid decision .
Still 100 % uncertain .
Dov said on December 21 , 2009 1:44 PM :
How about the fact that there is no spell check ?
Philip Dhingra said on December 21 , 2009 1:47 PM :
Or the fact that you can't see what you 're typing in your passwords ( Unless you change a setting to make all passwords visible ) .
Or that form fields with numbers require you to double - tap Alt to put on the Nums Lock
Sara said on December 21 , 2009 4:03 PM :
Or that cut & paste is such a trauma , where it even works .
I too love my Droid , but that 's just nuts .
Backnblack said on December 21 , 2009 4:11 PM :
Sounds like a apple fanboi trying to give a supposedly unbias review ... You sir FAIL ...
Laurence5905 said on December 21 , 2009 5:54 PM :
You really should check out a GOOD Droid forum , like www.droidforums.net.
It 's a very active community , and folks there are very helpful .
MANY of your complaints have been addressed there by the members .
I 'd say , of your list of 20 complaints , maybe 3 can't be helped ( # 5 , # 14 , and # 19 ) .
But I 've seen solutions to or workarounds for all your other complaints on the droidforums .
net website .
Philip Dhingra said on December 21 , 2009 7:27 PM :
Where are all you visitors coming from ?
Sleeve said on December 21 , 2009 9:30 PM :
www.droidforums.net, your entry was cross-posted .
I 've read both your pro and con posts .
I think you needed to stretch to come up with 20 negative points .
I do n't question how you feel about personal preferences , but I think several of your comments are polar opposite to the typical poster at droidforums .
Many of us like the multiple buttons .
In fact , at Thanksgiving I went to an all iPhone gathering and they were eager to see the Droid .
One of the things they commented on was having more interaction options .
The menu was popular among these 9 iPhone owners .
Their biggest concern was whether the market was real , and when I told them that you get 24 hours to try a paid app then request a refund , half of them started asking me Verizon rate plan questions .
@ Dov , no spell check ?
Built in dictionary , user customizable , includes contact names , will either offer several word completion options or pick what you most likely meant based on an option you choose .
# 9 . Your use of the market from your device is connected to your Gmail account .
That 's your password .
You ( fortunately ) do n't need to log on to Gmail every time you want to use the market , you 're permanently logged on .
# 10 . Do n't pray .
Do n't use apps that enable features you think make no sense .
You 're given a full list of out of sandbox access that the app wants .
I found a game that wanted contact list access , sent the dev an email , wtf ?
The dev explained but I still did n't like it .
Uninstalled .
Happy I knew , rather than having to guess .
Philip Dhingra said on December 21 , 2009 9:34 PM :
Awesome , welcome Droid Forums ppl !
Full disclosure .
Within a week , I had 24 things I loved about the Droid , which I pared down to 20 .
Four weeks later , I had 18 things I disliked about the Droid , which I stretched to 20 .
amo said on December 22 , 2009 3:21 PM :
I definitely agree with the people from droidforums.net
It is the most helpful community around , and there is definitely excitement there .
You just havent found that forum , or didnt even put the effort to try .
reed_wrangler said on December 22 , 2009 5:12 PM :
Regarding your point # 1 , removing or uninstalling apps - I just installed a free app killer on my Droid and I love it - I do n't know if it will uninstall the apps but it stops them from running in the background sitting there slurping up power .
I love my Droid .
Firegirl said on December 23 , 2009 10:18 AM :
Yea , I have to agree with others when they say your list seems like a stretch .
You sound like one of those iPhone users that wo n't be satisfied until your phone can wake you up , dress you , cook your breakfast , and start your car in the morning .
These are phones .
Neither are perfect , but my experiences with the Droid have taught me that it 's a better phone .
It makes phone calls , period .
And I guess I still do n't get the surfing the internet while on a call .
Is n't that rude ?
Philip Dhingra said on December 23 , 2009 12:03 PM :
" And I guess I still do n't get the surfing the internet while on a call .
Is n't that rude ? "
A non-rude use - case happens all the time .
For example , I 'm on a long call with a friend .
I mention some factoid , he asks for a citation , I look it up .
zegolf said on December 23 , 2009 12:17 PM :
Are n't you also making comparisons between devices with substantially different life cycles ?
As far as the droid - specific dislikes , you 're comparing the device to the iPhone which has had YEARS of development to get where it is today .
Lest you forget , the almighty iPhone once had its feeble beginnings as a device and had many people creating " 20 Things to dislike " lists .
Many of your arguments make reference to an operating system and device that have n't had the time to " polish " like the iPhone has .
Rest assured , Google is making leaps and bounds in their development with the OS , and each release is a marked improvement over the last .
I respect your opinion , but think that a lot of these arguments are a stretch .
Do n't fear change , rather embrace that you get a brand new device to master .
If people want things to be more " iphone - like " then buy an iPhone .
I do , however , respect this list .
It makes a great point of showing that there 's a fix for just about every issue a user might have with this device .
While a person might find something wrong with the Droid , chances are it's just something they have n't discovered yet .
Do n't get me wrong though .
I 'm glad you 're enjoying your device , and think you bring up a lot of good points .
Philip Dhingra said on December 23 , 2009 12:48 PM :
As someone who works with trying to make user experiences better , you learn to simultaneously love a device and also be critical of its failings .
In fact , loving a device often requires getting to know it well enough to tease out both the negatives and the positives , which I have done .
And doing so , does n't take away from my enjoyment at all from using imperfect gadgets .
I could easily make a list of 20 things I do n't like about the iPhone .
Or World of Warcraft .
Or Google .
Or any other holy cow of a product .
States pummeled by the recession and heavy job losses are moving to bar government employees from " double dipping " — the practice of collecting a pension and a paycheck at the same time .
The new rules are meant to curb employees from retiring only to return to their old jobs .
They come at a time when unemployment has climbed to its highest level in 25 years .
It 's impossible to determine exactly how many government employees also collect pension benefits , but some of the states that studied the issue have identified thousands of workers .
" We have to fix the mess we 've made , " says Utah state Sen .
Daniel Liljenquist , the chairman of a committee that oversees the state 's pension system .
Utah lawmakers will consider an overhaul when they convene in January .
" It will happen , because it 's something we have to do , " Liljenquist says .
Officials in other states are taking similar steps : • New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson proposed changes in November that would bar new government retirees from double dipping .
State legislators had already backed a broader plan that would also have limited current retirees .
•
The board that runs South Dakota 's public retirement system will meet this week to consider changes that would make public employees wait four months after they retire before seeking a new government job .
• Florida Gov. Charlie Crist signed a law in June that requires new retirees to wait at least six months before returning to work .
• Arkansas lawmakers are considering a measure that would stop elected officials who quit from returning to work .
" They do n't even empty out their desk , " state Rep. Allen Kerr says .
Jon Greiner retired as police chief of Ogden , Utah , in 2002 to start collecting benefits , then immediately returned to his job .
Greiner , also a state senator , says there 's nothing wrong with that arrangement , and that lawmakers should n't use the laws to punish public employees .
He is currently paid $ 107,000 annually as police chief ; he estimated he makes about $ 4,000 a month from the pension .
A state audit in Utah identified more than 4,300 public employees in the state who also collected public pensions .
A review in Florida found more than 9,000 — among them , prison wardens , college officials , and the former chief judge of the state 's highest court , according to The St. Petersburg Times .
The nation 's state and local retirement systems lost about $ 800 billion in 2008 , says Keith Brainard , research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators .
Employees who double dip tend to collect benefits sooner , though Brainard says it has a " relatively small " impact on the overall cost of pension plans .
South Dakota 's planned changes will save only about $ 5 million a year , says the system 's executive director , Rob Wylie .
New Mexico's proposed changes would save about $ 7 million .
Elsewhere , the bill is bigger :
An audit this year for Utah lawmakers suggested that double dipping by employees there could cost the state as much as $ 900 million over the next decade .

The CrunchPad drama continued Monday , with the chief of Fusion Garage calling Michael Arrington 's claim on the device " ludicrous " and introducing its own 12.1 - inch tablet , which has been re-branded as the JooJoo .
The CrunchPad drama continued Monday , with the chief of Fusion Garage calling Michael Arrington 's claim on the device " ludicrous " and introducing its own 12.1 - inch tablet , which has been re-branded as the JooJoo .
Fusion Garage will start taking pre-orders for the $ 499 device on Friday at thejoojoo.com .
Delivery is expected within 8 to 10 weeks , Chandra Rathakrishnan , Fusion Garage chief executive , said during a Monday webcast .
The company is in talks with retail partners , but no announcements have been made , he said .
The JooJoo comes in black and has a capacitive touch screen , enough graphic power to deliver full high - definition video , offline capabilities , and a 4GB solid - state drive , though " most of the storage is done in the cloud , " Rathakrishnan said .
He promised 5 hours of battery life .
In a demo during the webcast , the device powered on in about 10 seconds , and showed icons for web - based services like Twitter , Hulu , CNN , and Gmail , though the JooJoo will not come pre-loaded with any apps , Rathakrishnan said .
Scroll through them with your finger as you would on the iPhone .
In terms of the ownership drama , Rathakrishnan said that TechCrunch editor Arrington has created an " incomplete and distorted story . "
The CrunchPad / JooJoo dates back to July 2008 , when Arrington penned a blog post on TechCrunch asking for someone to help him build a " dead simple Web tablet for $ 200 . "
Fast forward to a Nov. 30 blog post , in which that the CrunchPad was just days from launch when Rathakrishnan e-mailed him out of the blue to say that Arrington was no longer part of the project and that Fusion Garage would market the device itself under its own name .
Rathakrishnan took issue with Arrington 's account and said he " is not the person I 've been portrayed as in the blogosphere . "
Rathakrishnan said he read Arrington 's original 2008 post and was intrigued at the prospect .
He approached Arrington at the editor 's annual TechCrunch 50 conference , and met with him later to explain what Fusion Garage was building .
Arrington was " more than a little interested " and promised that he would be able to deliver hardware partners and investors , Rathakrishnan said Monday .
His " much larger objective , " however , was to purchase Fusion Garage and establish a controlling interest in the company , according to Rathakrishnan .
Simply put , however , Arrington was unable to deliver , Rathakrishnan said .
As a result , Fusion Garage completed the development of the OS , hired the necessary expertise to complete the hardware side of the equation , solved remaining technology issues , and worked on arrangements with OEMs .
Fusion Garage secured funding from its shareholders , which now totals $ 3 million , he said .
Rathakrishnan acknowledged that " many conversations " did take place with Arrington and that which would have been a vehicle for distribution of the device , but " ultimately nothing came out " of that .
No contracts of any kind were ever signed , he said .
" Tech Crunch did n't contribute a single line of code , " Rathakrishnan said .
" It was Fusion Garage that brought the device from the dead . "
Fusion Garage offered Arrington " the possibility of working with us " without the controlling interest , but Arrington turned that down , Rathakrishnan said .
In the end , TechCrunch and Fusion Garage had little more than a loose verbal agreement , but when Arrington did not deliver , Fusion Garage proceeded without him .
" Michael 's attempts to claim credit ring hollow , " Rathakrishnan said .
" The suggestions that Michael , TechCrunch , or CrunchPad owns any IP associated [ with the JooJoo ] is simply ludicrous .
Fusion Garage alone owns all IP and proprietary rights associated with the product . "
Rathakrishnan is not concerned by the possibility of a lawsuit .
" We are confident in our decision .
We own the IP and we will defend it . "
He is also not worried about marketing the device without Arrington 's help .
" Tech Crunch 's marketing capability is resigned to a blog , " he said .
" With the partners we have aligned , we have a broader spectrum of marketing capabilities . "
When asked how the JooJoo compares to , Rathakrishnan said that both projects have a " similar vision , " but Fusion Garage does not view netbooks as the best form factor for Internet access on - the - go .
" We are real , we are out there in the market today , " he said , while Google Chrome OS is not expected to debut until the end of 2010 .
Arrington has not yet issued his rebuttal , though in a Friday blog post , he said " there is just no way to argue that TechCrunch is not the joint owner of all intellectual property of the CrunchPad , and outright owner of the CrunchPad trademark . "
UPDATE : " There are n't any more Crunch Pad posts coming from us .
It 's all in the lawyers hands now , " Arrington wrote in a Monday afternoon Twitter post .
The Electronic Frontiers Foundation ( EFF ) has filed a lawsuit against several government agencies hoping to force the revelation of how the U.S. utilizes social networks like Facebook and MySpace to collect intelligence .
“ Millions of people use social networking sites like Facebook every day , disclosing lots of information about their private lives , ” said James Tucker , a student working with EFF , in a media advisory .
“ As Congress debates new privacy laws covering sites like Facebook , lawmakers and voters alike need to know how the government is already using this data and what is at stake . ”

However , when EFF went looking for that information by filing Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests , they ran into a stone wall of silence .
The suit was filed in cooperation with the Samuelson Law , Technology , and Public Policy Clinic at Berkeley .
It demands immediate publication of government policies dealing with social networks during an investigation .
“ Internet users deserve to know what information is collected , under what circumstances , and who has access to it , ” said Shane Witnov , a law student working on the case , according to the EFF ’s release .
“ These agencies need to abide by the law and release their records on social networking surveillance . ”
The EFF ’s full complaint , which encompasses the Central Intelligence Agency , Departments of Justice , Defense and Homeland Security , the Treasury and Director of National Intelligence , can be read here [ PDF link ] .

Fast Exclusive : James Chanos
The word on the street this week was how big banks , namely Wells Fargo and Citigroup , have set themselves to pay back the TARP .
Chanos had held short positions on Wells Fargoin the past and is very familiar with the balance sheet , so how is he playing this stock now ?
As most of the banks have raised significant equity capital recently , they have seen their stocks go up " initially , on a relief rally , " Chanos says , but he thinks the jury is out on Wells Fargo , citing " reasonably difficult " loan problems ahead of them .
Chanos also sees the balance sheets of major banks being " better than they were 6 - 9 months ago , " but he is also hesitant to say that the books are where they should be for the firms , again citing residential and commercial real estate loan problems as well as dramatic security mark - ups resulting from accounting changes .
" I would n't be a buyer here , " he says , " I do n't know if I 'd be a seller , but I would be pretty ambivalent about the sector . "
With a few minor exceptions , Chanos says he 's staying away from the financials .
Chanos ' Overall Market View
With markets just off 14 - month highs , how does Chanos perceive the overall market ?
Although Chanos ' firm is always net - short , he says that in effect , he is " long the market , but short our stocks , " and right now he sees opportunities for short sellers in individual companies and sub- industries , but not the overall market .
But what about the specifics ?
Through the course of 2008 and early 2009 , Chanos had been short covering the auto sector , and says the interesting part of the auto sector is that it has been " chronically " losing money , much like the airlines .
Even with the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler , we have seen increased global capacities for autos in the last 12 months .
He sees the sector as a whole with the lingering problems of overcapacity , as well as legacy costs .
He suggests that investors do n't go long Ford or Fiat .
The airline sector has been relatively bullish of late , but how does this sector look in the coming months ?
Chanos is focusing on the parent of Airbus , EADS for shorting possibilities , highlighting a " myriad " of problems , which may potentially require government support for the company , which would not stand to benefit shareholders .
China : Powering the Global Economy , or the Next Bubble to Burst ?
In a recent report , Chanos ' firm has been very pessimistic about China , and his firm has even gone as far as to speculate that China could be " Dubai times 1000 , or worse . "
Chanos points out a stark irony that investors who decry government involvement in US companies are bullish on the Chinese markets , despite the fact that the country 's government can " fine tune " the economy to their liking .
He is also skeptical of the country 's GDP numbers , calling them " massively inflated by under - depreciating a very , very , very shaky capital asset base . "
He points out that " bubbles are best identified by credit excesses , not valuations ... there is no bigger credit excess right now than China . "
But how do you play this ?
Chanos says that although you can't short China , the short plays are in the first derivative industries : companies which support the raw and imported materials for growth ( such as copper , cement and iron ore producers ) .
He also suggests looking into short possibilities in the Hong Kong exchange .
Chanos himself is actively shorting this area , and is " looking for plays on the China investment pool , which we think will burst at some point ...
Demand in China is over - inflated , that is clear . "
What do the FM traders think about the trades from Chanos ?
To analyze the opinions of the legendary hedge fund manager , Guy Adami steps in .
On his Ford calls , Adami says " he 's probably going to wind up being right , " however , the traders have liked Ford since its lows and sees momentum through the end of the year , but agrees that right now is the time to be peeling back long positions in the company .
In China , Adami agrees that the visibility in the Chinese markets is a serious issue , speculating that they could be simply hording commodities instead of using them , suggesting the short possibility of Freeport McMoran , which has had a strong move to the upside and may be set for a drop .

There were days upon days in New York City when not a single person was murdered in 2009 .
Two such stretches , in February and March , lasted nearly a week each .
There were some pockets of the city where homicide was a singular occurrence : 12 of the city ’s 77 police precincts , in locations as varied as Hamilton Heights , in Upper Manhattan , and Park Slope , Brooklyn , had logged one each through Sunday .
The story line of murder in New York is one that has been undergoing constant revision since 1963 , when the Police Department began tracking homicides in a way that officials now deem reliable .
( Before then , homicides were not counted until they were solved . )
There have been rises  the number peaked at 2,245 in 1990  and subsequent falls .
But there have never been as few homicides as this year .
The city is on track , for the second time in three years , to have the fewest homicides in a 12 - month period since the current record keeping system began .
As of Sunday , there had been 461 ; the record low was in 2007 , when there were 496 for the entire year .

Whether you love him or hate him , MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews has a habit of planting his foot firmly in his mouth , which he did again tonight during MSNBC ’s coverage of President Obama ’s speech on Afghanistan when he claimed that by giving a speech at West Point , Obama had ventured into an enemy camp .
Here is the video from Media Matters :
Advertisements
While selling his point of view that the military hates Obama , Matthews said , “ I watched those cadets , they were young kids , men and women who are committed to serving their country as professionally , it must be said as officers , and I did n’t see much excitement , but among the older people there , I saw , if not resentment , skepticism .
I did n’t see a lot of warmth in that crowd out there , the president chose to address tonight , and I thought that was interesting .
He went to maybe the enemy camp tonight .
That ’s where Paul Wolfowitz used to write speeches for back in the old Bush days . ”
Once again , Chris Matthews has decided to fall back on a tired political cliché to push a storyline instead offering anything intelligent or insightful .
The cliché is that the military hates Obama , but the reality is that Obama got 44 % of the military vote in 2008 , which was up 3 % from John Kerry support in 2004 .
Democrats have also elected ten former veterans to Congress in the last two election cycles .
I am sure this will come as a shock to Chris Matthews , but there are both Democrats and Republicans in the military , and his reference to West Point as an enemy camp was disrespectful to the institution .
West Point is not the enemy of any president , Democrat or Republican .
I understand that Matthews was trying to make the point that the audience Obama spoke to did n’t like him , but he could offer no facts to back up that statement , nor should he have expressed it in such a clumsy way .
I do n’t understand what Matthews was expecting the audience reaction to be to the announcement that 30,000 more troops are going to Afghanistan .
The president was making a serious announcement , and I thought the audience reaction was appropriate .

Wire Models
For the first X - ray crystallographic solution of a macromolecule , myoglobin , Kendrew and coworkers ( 1958 ) built brass models at a scale of 5 cm / Ångstrom .
The models were built and supported within 2,500 vertical rods arranged to fill a cube six feet ( 2 meters ) on a side .
Colored clips were attached to the rods to signify electron density , and guide the building of the model .
The forest of rods obscured the view of the model and made it hard to adjust .
Its size made it cumbersome and problematic to move .
The Richards Box , aka Fred 's Folly .
In the late 1960's , while solving the structure of ribonuclease , Fred Richards and coworkers ( 1968 ) introduced an optical comparator that facilitated building a Kendrew - style brass model .
Electron densities resulting from crystallographic solutions were printed by computers on paper , and electron density contour lines were traced by connecting numbers of similar values on the paper .
These contour lines were then traced onto transparent plates ( 3 x 3 feet ) .
The plates were mounted vertically , equally spaced , creating a sliced three dimensional electron density map .
Half - silvered mirrors were arranged to superimpose the electron density map upon the brass model .
As larger molecules were solved , the scale was reduced to 2.5 cm / Å , and then 1.0 cm / Å .
In 2001 : Several Kendrew - style models built by Michael Rossman 's group , including one with a still - assembled Richards Box , are on display in the basement of Lilly Hall at Purdue University , West Lafayette IN US .
A Kendrew - style model is on display at the US National Institutes of Health Museum , Building 10 ( near the Lipsett Auditorium ) , Bethesda MD US .
This model , built with a Richards box ( no longer in existence ) , represents the Fab fragment of an antibody MoPC603 , built by Eduardo A. Padlan in 1974 .
A Kendrew - style model of chymotrypsin built by Alexander Tulinsky is on exhibit in the main lobby of the Chemistry Building of Michigan State University , East Lansing , Michigan .
Getting it there from the room where it was originally built required partial disassembly , because it would n't fit through the door .
A much more detailed account of this era is available in Michael J. Connolly 's Molecular Surfaces : A Review in the Computational Chemistry section of the NetWork Science website .
Physical models are discussed especially in the Introduction , and in Part 3 : Electron Density Fitting .
( We need photographs of Kendrew models , and the Richards Box used to construct them , here !
If you know of such photographs already on the web , which we can link to , or that could legally be scanned to put on this site , please contact E.M. ! )

Alpha helices are decorated with red pipecleaner , while beta strands are decorated yellow .
Model generously constructed by Tim Herman in 1997 .
Physical " Ball and Spoke " Models
After Kendrew et al. solved the structure of myoglobin , they built a physical " ball and spoke " model .
Eric Francoeur has provided an illustrated account of this era , " A. A. Barker 's Models of Myoglobin " .
Twenty - nine of these models were sold to researchers around the world in the 1960's , manufactured by Beevers Miniature Models , an outfit still offering a variety of protein models today , including custom proteins .
Byron 's Bender Byron Rubin , while working as a crystallographer with Jane Richardson in the early 1970's , invented a machine for bending wire to follow the backbone trace of a protein .
( Rubin & Richardson , 1972 ) .
In the 1970's , computer visualization of macromolecules was not yet generally available to crystallographers .
Kendrew - style models were built on wire supports from projections of the electron density map , from isocontours traced on plates of glass in a " Richards box " .
These models were large and cumbersome .
The small backbone wire models from Byron 's Bender were the most manipulable and portable models available at the time .
An example illustrating the importance of models from Byron 's Bender occurred at a scientific meeting in the mid 1970's .
At this time , less than two dozen protein structures had been solved .
David Davies brought a Bender model of an immunoglobulin Fab fragment , and Jane and David Richardson brought a Bender model of superoxide dismutase .
While comparing these physical models at the meeting , they realized that both proteins use a similar fold , despite having only about 9 % sequence identity .
This incident was the first recognition of the occurrence of what is now recognized as the immunoglobulin superfamily domain in proteins that are apparently unrelated by sequence .
The insight was published in a paper entitled " Similarity of three - dimensional structure between the immunoglobulin domain and the copper , zinc superoxide dismutase subunit " ( Richardson et al. , J. Mol. Biol .
102:221-235 , 1976 ) .
Byron 's Bender remained available through the 1990's .
Tim Herman of the Medical College of Wisconsin was one of its last avid users .
Tim brought the Bender into local high schools and taught teachers and groups of students how to construct models .
Herman 's web site has photos of many beautiful wire models , as well as more on the history , technology , and source of Byron 's Bender .
Aside from the importance of the tactile as well as visual input these models provide , another of their great strengths is that they jiggle and vibrate when fondled , thereby simulating thermal motion .
Too often users of computer models lose sight of the fact that protein molecules in living systems are constantly flexing due to thermal motion .

In the mid-1990's , Rubin resumed the creation of molecular sculptures such as the collagenase ribbon model shown at left .
Larger sculptures are under construction in Rubin 's workshop near Rochester , NY , in 2001 .

Bathsheba Grossman renders proteins within glass blocks -- see photos below .
Julian Voss -Andreae makes large protein sculptures in metal and other media ( see photo at right ) .
Edgar Meyer makes molecular sculptures in wood , using a computer - controlled milling machine .
Kenneth Eward offers a Gallery of Virtual Sculpture and Photography .
Sculptor Bathsheba Grossman makes " laser crystals " in which the macromolecule ( DNA double helix shown at left and right ) is represented by tiny laser - induced fractures within a glass block .
See crystalprotein.com
Rapid Prototyping
In the late 1990's , efforts were begun independently by Michael Bailey ( San Diego Supercomputer Center ) and Tim Herman ( Milwaukee School of Engineering ) to use the new engineering technologies of rapid prototyping for building physical models of proteins .
Custom models of research quality became available in 2000 from 3D Molecular Designs .
Computer Representations
In 1965 , Carroll K. Johnson , of Oak Ridge National Laboratory , released ORTEP , a program to produce stereoscopic drawings of molecular and crystal structures with a pen-plotter .
See the ORTEP page for more details .
In the mid 1970's , a protein structure was solved crystallographically and visualized entirely with computers for the first time ( without building a physical Kendrew model ) by David and Jane Richardson and colleagues ( Beem et al. , 1977 , Metal sites of copper- zinc superoxide dismutase , Biochemistry 16:1930 ) .
They used a density - fitting computer system called " GRIP " at the University of North Carolina ( Tainer et al. , 1982 , J. Mol. Biol . 160:181 ) .
In the late 1970's , more and more crystallographers made the transition to building models for newly solved protein crystals with computers ( " electronic Richards ' boxes " ) rather than with physical Kendrew - style models .
One of the large advantages was that the computer kept track of the atomic coordinates , whereas atomic coordinates had to be measured manually from a Kendrew model , atom by atom .
A history of electronic Richards ' boxes and the four computer systems most widely used at this time is available in Michael J. Connolly 's Molecular Surfaces : A Review in the Computational Chemistry section of the NetWork Science website .
In 1977 a wireframe Atlas of Macromolecular Structure was published .
Also in the late 1970's , Thomas K. Porter [ then of the Division of Computer Research and Technology ( DCRT ) , NIH ] developed computer algorithms for shaded spacefilled representations .
These developments revolutionized the visualization of macromolecules but were available to a limited number of specialists with access to the most powerful computers of the time .
A brief history of molecular graphics , with many more references , is available in the chapter " Part 4 : Molecular Graphics " in Michael J. Connolly 's Molecular Surfaces : A Review in the Computational Chemistry section of the NetWork Science website .

" As you look at the stereoscopic views you will see beauty beyond any previous experience .
We feel that the sense of beauty adds a force to the perception of macromolecular structure and function which will make it possible for you and your students to understand macromolecules as they really exist . "
The TAMS teaching unit was published in 1980 , and included sections on the peptide bond , alpha helix , beta structure , tertiary structure , quaternary structure , prosthetic groups , and active sites .
The TAMS unit included 116 stereo pairs of color slides illustrating these sections .
A student viewer ( Taylor Merchant 's patented Stereo 7 ) was provided , along with 7 pairs of images for each of these sections , representing a 49 - image subset of the full 116 .
Each image was accompanied by a paragraph of description , and a study question ( answer provided ! ) .
The slide - images were constructed using a frame buffer which had one byte of memory ( 256 colors only ! ) for each pixel on a CRT screen .
The frame buffer purchased by NIH for making the TAMS images cost $ 65,000 , but a few years later , the price had dropped to $ 12,000 .
Although idiosyncratic color schemes were often used , one of general applicability was developed in collaboration with Bruce Furie , and dubbed the Functional Color Code :
hydrophobic = black positive charge = blue negative charge = red electronegative ( peptide bond carbonyl ) = pink electropositive ( amide N in peptide bond ) = light blue hydrogens = same color as atoms to which attached .
They describe the CPK colors as C=black , N=blue , H=white , O=red , S=green .
( RasMol 's " CPK " is similar but makes C=gray and S=yellow . )

During the 1980's , David and Jane Richardson pioneered computer graphic representations of molecular structure with a series of programs developed at Duke University .
In the late 1980's this led to a program called CHAOS written in Evans and Sutherland PS300 function - net language ( Richardson & Richardson , 1989 ) .
In 1992 , the Richardsons described the kinemage ( from kinetic image ) , and their supporting programs MAGE and PREKIN ( Richardson & Richardson , 1992 ) .
By virtue of its implementation on the Macintosh , this was the first program which brought molecular visualization to a large number of scientists , educators , and students .
The programs were described in the lead article in the first issue of the journal Protein Science ( early 1992 ) , and the program itself was provided on a diskette which accompanied that issue .
This article also included instructions for using the program PREKIN together with MAGE for authoring new kinemages .
In the subsequent five years , over a thousand kinemages were authored to accompany articles in Protein Science .
A large portion of these were authored or edited by Jane Richardson .
To quote the Richardsons ( 1992 ) ,
" Kinemages are set up to illustrate a particular idea about a three - dimensional object , rather than neutrally displaying that object ; they incorporate the author 's selection , emphasis , and viewpoint .... "

In 1990 , Roger entered graduate school in computer science at the University of Edinburgh , where he continued to develop his program under the mentorship of crystallographer Andrew Coulson .
Further improvements in the speed of the shadowing algorithm made interprocesser communication rate - limiting on the parallel - processor computer .
This enabled Roger to implement it on single - processor computers such as unix , and later Windows and the Macintosh .
Roger developed his program into a much more complete molecular visualization system , and by 1993 , it was being used in teaching and for images in research publications .
Roger generously made the program available to the world scientific community free of charge when he received his Ph.D. in June , 1993 .
In January , 1994 , Roger was employed by GlaxoWellcome , which supported the continued development of RasMol freeware , including the first version for the Macintosh , for the next two years .
Roger ceased active work on public versions of RasMol in 1997 , but in 1999 , Herbert Bernstein et al. collaborated to produce RasMol version 2.7 .
The name " RasMol " is derived from Raster ( the array of pixels on a computer screen ) Molecules .
Roger notes that the fact that his initials are R.A.S. is probably coincidental .
The fact that Roger generously placed the C language source code for RasMol in the public domain allowed others to adapt the program to additional types of computers , and to incorporate RasMol 's wonderful user interface and renderings into derivative programs .
Such derivatives include notably MDL's Chemscape Chime and Molecular Simulations ' WebLab .
RasMol is very widely used throughout the world .
It is difficult to estimate the number of users , but they likely exceed one million .
RasMol is especially popular with students , and in locations where resources do not allow the purchase of expensive commercial molecular graphics software .
For more detail , see Roger Sayle 's Personal History of RasMol .
Recent publications on RasMol are listed in our RasMol & Educational Molecular Visualization Bibliography .
Chime was first made available as a beta pre-release in February , 1996 .
Some of the first Chime - based molecular structure presentations to appear on the web were by Henry Rzepa and David Marcey .
The Navigator +
Chime combination offered many advantages over RasMol for educational presentations of chemical structure .
By early 1997 , various authors had developed Chime - based presentations on 30 - some molecules and made them available on the web .
Subsequently , Chime interfaces were developed which can load any molecule and apply specialized routines to it , or provide a RasMol - like command line permitting any operation of which Chime is capable on any molecule .
These developments are summarized in What is the purpose of the Protein Explorer ? , a document which accompanies the Protein Explorer .

Monads are like burritos
A few months ago Brent Yorgey complained about a certain class of tutorials which present monads by explaining how monads are like burritos .
At first I thought the choice of burritos was only a facetious reference to the peculiar and sometimes strained analogies these tutorials make .
But then I realized that monads are like burritos .
I will explain .
A monad is a special kind of a functor .
A functor F takes each type T and maps it to a new type FT .
A burrito is like a functor : it takes a type , like meat or beans , and turns it into a new type , like beef burrito or bean burrito .
A functor must also be equipped with a map function that lifts functions over the original type into functions over the new type .
For example , you can add chopped jalape ños or shredded cheese to any type , like meat or beans ; the lifted version of this function adds chopped jalapeños or shredded cheese to the corresponding burrito .
A monad must also possess a unit function that takes a regular value , such as a particular batch of meat , and turns it into a burrito .
The unit function for burritos is obviously a tortilla .
Finally , a monad must possess a join function that takes a ridiculous burrito of burritos and turns them into a regular burrito .
Here the obvious join function is to remove the outer tortilla , then unwrap the inner burritos and transfer their fillings into the outer tortilla , and throw away the inner wrappings .
The map , join , and unit functions must satisfy certain laws .
For example , if B is already a burrito , and not merely a filling for a burrito , then join ( unit ( B ) ) must be the same as B .
This means that if you have a burrito , and you wrap it in a second tortilla , and then unwrap the contents into the outer tortilla , the result is the same as what you started with .
This is true because tortillas are indistinguishable .
I know you are going to point out that some tortillas have the face of Jesus .
But those have been toasted , and so are unsuitable for burrito - making , and do not concern us here .
So monads are indeed like burritos .
I asked Brent if this was actually what he had in mind when he first suggested the idea of tutorials explaining monads in terms of burritos , and if everyone else had understood this right away .
But he said no , I was the lone genius .

Accelerator and F# ( II . ) : The Game of Life on GPU
In the previous article , I introduced the Microsoft Research Accelerator library .
It allows us to write computations with arrays in C# and execute them in parallel on multi-core CPU or more interestingly , using GPU shaders .
In the previous artcile , we 've seen how Accelerator works and how it can be accessed from F# .
In this article , we 'll look at one more interesting F# demo - we 'll implement the famous Conway 's Game of Life [ 1 ] using Accelerator .
We 'll use a v2 version of Accelerator which has been announced just recently and is available from Microsoft Connect [ 2 ] .
This article is the second one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. Today , we 'll use Accelerator types directly from F# - this is the simplest possible approach and is very similar to the way you 'd work with Accelerator in C# .
However , we can use some nice F# features such as custom operators to make the code more readable .
In the next article , we 'll discuss a different approach - we 'll look how to execute more " standard " F# code ( that does n't reference Accelerator explicitly ) with Accelerator using F# quotations .
The list of articles may change , but here is a list of articles that I 'm currently planning to write :
Implementing the Game of Life
The Game of Life is a zero - player game , which means that once we start it with some initial configuration , it will run without any other input .
It runs on a square grid and looks like a cell or simple organism simulation .
In each step , some of the organisms die and some new organisms appear , so we 'll just need to calculate a new state of the grid .
The game is truly amazing , because it has extremely simple set of rules , but can create fantastic and very complicated structures .
In fact , it is Turing - complete , which ( roughly ) means that you could encode arbitrary computer program with its inputs as an initial configuration of the Game of Life and it would simulate the program .
It would require some additional coding of inputs and outputs as well as an extremely large grid , but it is theoretically possible !
You can see the rules of the game visualized in the diagram above :
Green -
When an existing cell ( green in the middle ) has three or two neighbours it survives to the next round
- When an existing cell ( green in the middle ) has three or two neighbours it survives to the next round Red -
When an existing cell has less than two neigbors it dies , because it is lonely ( first red case ) , when it has more than three neighbors it dies of overcrowding ( second red case )
- When an existing cell has less than two neigbors it dies , because it is lonely ( first red case ) , when it has more than three neighbors it dies of overcrowding ( second red case ) Blue - Finally , a new cell is born in an empty grid location if there are exactly three neighbors .
As you can see , there are only three simple rules that drive the Game .
Our implementation will simply need to calculate a new state of the grid based on the original one and for each element of the array , we 'll check the three rules .
However , before looking at the implementation , we 'll write a couple of constants to configure the game and a few hlepers .
Getting ready
Our implementation allows us to specify the size of the grid ( it has to be a square ) and a size of the window .
The visualization looks the best when the size of the window is a multiple of the grid size .
Once we know the size , we 'll initialize a couple of FloatParallelArray instances representing arrays of the specified size that contain constant values .
We 're using the FPA type alias from the previous article .
// Configuration of the game let gridSize , formSize = 512 , 512 // Initialization of constant 2D arrays let shape = [| gridSize ; gridSize ; | ] let [ zero ; one ; two ; three ] = [ for f in [ 0.0 f ; 1.0f ; 2.0 f ; 3.0 f ] -> new FPA ( f , shape ) ]
The code uses a simple sequence expression that iterates over a list of constants stored as floats and yields a new FPA instance with the required size .
Note that we 're using a compact syntax of sequence expressions , because we only need to perfrom a projection .
The result of the sequence expression is a list and we use pattern matching to decompose the list into individual elements .
The compiler cannot verify at compile - time that the number of elements will match , so it will issue a warning .
However , we know that the code is correct in this case , so we do n't need to worry .
You can also turn the warning off by adding #nowarn " 25 " to the beginning of the file .
Now that we know the size of the grid and have all the needed constant arrays , we 'll also implement a single function that wrap the Accelerator functionality and three custom operators :
// Calculating with 2D float arrays let rotate ( a: FPA ) ( dx:int ) dy = PA .
Rotate ( a , [ | dx ; dy | ] ) ; //
Custom operators - simulating logical operations using floats let ( &&. ) ( a: FPA ) ( b: FPA ) = PA .
Min(a , b ) let ( ||. ) ( a : FPA ) ( b: FPA ) = PA .
Max ( a , b ) let ( ==. ) ( a: FPA ) ( b: FPA ) = PA. Cond ( PA.CompareEqual( a , b ) , one , zero )
As you can see , all of our functions and operators are simple wrappers for static methods of the ParallelArrays class ( type alias PA ) .
This makes the F# code more idiomatic and also allows us to use operators with the infix notation .
The names of the operators ends with an additional dot to denote that they implement point - wise operations .
The rotate function moves elements of the array by the specified offset ( it is a bit similar to Shift that we discussed in the previous article ) .
However , when elements is shifted outside outside of the grid , values are copied back from the other side .
To demonstrate this , if we moved the contents of 1D array [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 ] by + 2 , we 'd get [ 4 ; 5 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] .
Next , we define three operators that simulate Boolean operations using floats .
Accelerator also provides BoolParallelArray type , which can be used for calculating with arrays of Booleans , but we 'll need to combine calculations with floats and Booleans in more sophisticated ways , so simulating logical operations with floating point numbers works better .
The && . operator simulates and by returning the minimum of the two values .
This means , that the result will be 1 only if both of the inputs contain 1 .
If any of the inputs contains 0 , the overall result will be 0 .
operator simulates and by returning the minimum of the two values .
This means , that the result will be 1 only if both of the inputs contain 1 .
If any of the inputs contains 0 , the overall result will be 0 .
The ||. operator simulates logical or using maximum .
This means that the result will be 1 if any of the inputs contains 1 .
operator simulates logical or using maximum .
This means that the result will be 1 if any of the inputs contains 1 .
Finally , the ==. operator implements an equality check using CompareWith and Cond .
When the values are equal , it returns a value from one and otherwise it returns a value from zero .
Now we can manipulate with the game grid using rotate and also simulate logical operations using floating point values 1.0 and 0.0 .
Let 's finally look how we could implement a single step of the Game of Life .
Calculating the game step
The state of the game will be represented as a 2D array float32 [ , ] .
We 'll need some interesting initial state for the game , so we 'll set all values to zero with the exception of a diagonal from left - upper location ( when x = y ) and the first row and column of the grid ( x = 0 || y = 0 ) .
This is enough to start a very interesting simulation .
If you 'll later want to experiment with the code , you may try changing the initial configuration :
// Create an initial data grid let initial = Array 2D.init gridSize gridSize ( fun x y -> if x = 0 || y = 0 || x = y then 1.0f else 0.0f )
The code uses F# library function Array 2D.init , which takes the dimensions of an array as first two arguments .
The last argument is a function that calculates a value of the array at the specified coordinate .
Otherwise , the listing does n't show anything interesting .
The function that calculates the next state of the grid is much more interesting .
We 'll start by writing a function that takes FPA as an input and returns FPA as the result .
As I explained earlier , this is just a representation of a computation that can be executed later .
We 'll run the constructed computation later to get a result of type float32 [ , ] , which can be easily visualized .
let nextGeneration ( grid : FPA ) = //
Generate grids shifted by 1 in every direction let hd::tl = [ for dx in - 1 .. 1 do for dy in - 1 .. 1 do if dx <> 0 || dy <> 0 then yield rotate grid dx dy ] //
Count neighbors of each grid element let sum = tl |> List.fold (+ ) hd // Implements the Game of Life logic ( sum ==. three ) ||. ( ( sum ==. two ) &&. grid )
In the first step , the function creates a list of 8 grids rotated in all of the 8 possible directions ( north , northeast , east , southeast , etc ) .
This is implemented as a sequence exprssion that generates a single rotated grid for each combination of offsets ( dx and dy ) .
It only skips the combination when both dx and dy are zero ( which would correspond to the original grid ) .
Note that we decompose the created list into a head ( first element ) and a tail ( list of all remaining elements ) , because this will make further processing easier .
Now we have 8 grids , which represent the original grid shifted in each direction .
If we put all these layers over each other and count the number of living cells in each location , we 'll get the number of neighbors for each location .
This is exactly what the next line does .
We 're using the List . fold function with the first grid ( hd ) as an initial value and the overloaded point - wise addition of arrays ( + for the FPA type ) as the aggregation function .
By running the aggregation with the remaining 7 grids ( tl ) as the source specified using pipelining , we 'll get the count of neighbors .
Finally , the last line implements the Game of Life logic using our custom logical operators .
We use a slightly different ( but equivalent ) encoding of the original three rules - a specific location in the newly constructed grid will contain a living cell if and only if it originally had three living cells as neighbors ( in this case we do n't care whether there was originally a living cell in this location ) or if there was a living cell originally and had two neighbors .
Without any doubt , the last line of our code makes the F# implementation of the Game of Life using Accelerator really neat .
A single succinct line of code impplements all the game logic .
Now we only need to add some code to visualize the Game , so that we can see the complex behavior patterns it creates ...
Visualizing the game
To actually run the computation and display the results , we 'll need to specify the target , which is an Accelerator engine , which we can use to evaluate FPA computations .
We 'll implement the game as a function that takes the target as an arguments , implements two local functions and then instantiates the Drawing Form type .
This is a form that keeps running the step operation in a loop and we 'll look at its source in the next subsection .
let life ( target : Target ) = //
Functions to calculate next state and to draw it let nextState ( g:float32 [ , ] ) = target .
ToArray2D( nextGeneration ( new FPA ( g ) ) ) let display ( data:float32 [ , ] ) = data |> toBitmap ( fun f -> if ( f < 0.5f ) then Color .
White else Color.DarkCyan ) //
Run the drawing form with life game let gameForm = new Drawing Form < _> ( initial , nextState , display , ClientSize = Size( formSize , formSize ) ) Application .
Run( gameForm ) do life ( new DX9Target ( ) )
We already have the nextGeneration function , which has a type FPA -> FPA .
It returns a computation that represents the next step of the game .
As we said earlier , we 'll keep the current state as a type float32 [ , ] that contains actual grid values instead of some abstract computation .
The function nextState calculates the new state using the final representation .
It takes an array as an argument , wraps it into FPA type , then calculates the next generation and evaluates the result using the specified target .
The type of this function is float32 [ , ] -> float32 [ , ] .
The second local function is display .
It is used to visualize the current state in a bitmap .
This function has a type float32 [ , ] ->
Bitmap .
We implement it using a higher - order function toBitmap which takes a 2D array as an argument and a function that turns a value from the array ( in our case float 32 ) into a pixel color .
We provide a simple function that returns white color for values 0.0 and dark cyan for values 1.0 .
The toBitmap function is n't a part of standard F# libraries - it is implemented using direct memory access , which is unsafe , but efficient .
You can find the implementation in the source code at the end of the article .
The last part of the function initializes the Drawing Form type .
This is a reusable type that we 'll implement shortly .
It can be used for running any simulations where we want to calculate new state as fast as possible and redraw the form after every recalculation .
We give it three parameters - an initial state , a function to calculate new state and a function that draws the current state into a bitmap .
Note that the state is a generic type parameter .
We do n't need to know what the state is as long as we 're able to create a bitmap from it .
The last step we need to do is to implement the Drawing Form type ...
Implementing a drawing form
The DrawingForm type is a generic class with a single type parameter and three constructor parameters .
The type parameter represents a state , which is recomputed using the provided function when the form is running .
We 'll implement the form using the implicit class syntax :
type DrawingForm <' TState >( initial , update , draw ) as x = inherit Form ( ) //
Loop that runs computation & redraws form let rec drawing Loop ( state ) = if not x.Is Disposed then ( use gr = x.CreateGraphics ( ) gr.InterpolationMode <- Drawing2D.InterpolationMode.NearestNeighbor gr.DrawImage( draw( state ) , x.ClientRectangle ) ) drawingLoop ( update ( state ) ) do // Run the computation Async. Start ( async { drawingLoop ( initial ) })
The form does n't contain any members , so the entire body is essentially just a constructor .
The constructor parameters ( an initial state and two functions ) are written directly following the type name .
It starts by inheriting from the .NET Form type .
Next , it declares a single local recursive function drawingLoop the function runs until the form is closed .
It keeps the current state as a parameter ( which is a typical functional technique ) .
After making sure that the form is still displayed , it redraws the graphics using the current state .
Note that we use the use keyword to dispose the gr object when it is no longer in scope .
In this case , we need to specify the scope explicitly using parentheses .
Inside the drawing code , we need to obtain a bitmap to draw on the form .
We do it by calling the draw function ( a constructor parameter ) with the current state as an argument .
Once we 're done with drawing , we calculate new state by calling the update function and continue looping by recursively invoking drawingLoop .
Finally , the do block contains code that 's executed when the object is created .
The only thing we do is that we start the function performing the drawing on a background thread .
Note that this is safe , because CreateGraphics method is one of the few members of the Form type that can be accessed from non-GUI threads .
We use a single asynchronous workflow to start the computation .
This is simply a convenient way to start a background task , because Async .
Start starts executing the workflow in background .
Extending the example
And that 's it !
There are various ways to make the application more interesting .
One option is to enable some user interaction .
The source code below adds a simple handler for mouse click .
When you click on the form using left button , it will add some randomly located living cells and right button removes some of them .
This allows you to create some nice patterns :
Summary
In this article , we 've seen an interesting demo of using the Accelerator library from F#. We 've used many of the standard methods for working with FloatParallelArray type , which is the core of Accelerator .
Among others , we 've used Rotate for calculating neighbors and Min , Max together with Cond to implement logical operators for working with arrays .
Then we encoded the logic of the Game of Life using a simple data - parallel expression that allows the Accelerator to run the code efficiently in parallel either using GPU or using multi-core CPU .
There are still many interesting things to explore .
We 've already seen two examples of using Accelerator from F# in the direct way , so we wo n't look at more complicated demos .
Instead , we 'll look at more sophisticated way of using Accelerator .
In the next part , we 'll use F# quotations ( which are similar to C# expression trees ) to write the data processing code as a standard F# code ( this for example enables easier debugging ) and then execute it using Accelerator .

With respect to the use of stun guns to administer electro - shock trauma to small children , the State and its agents apply a sliding scale of official charges and punishments .
When a police officer subdues a child as young as five years of age by treating him to a 50,000 - volt shock , this is a law enforcement decision that will be the subject of an official review .
Sure , the officer ’s actions will eventually be vindicated , but in the interest of good public relations the officer , his superiors , and the local media have to undergo an intricate ritual , as stylized as Kabuki theater , before announcing the official inquiry ’s foregone conclusion .
When a group of Florida prison guards subject scores of children , ranging in age from 5 to 17 , to 50,000 - volt shocks as a kind of bizarre prank , this is a lapse of judgment that may have adverse career consequences — up to and including termination — but no criminal charges or intervention by the Department of Children and Families .
On more than a few occasions , as I ’ve read about or seen coverage of the use of Tasers and similar portable agonizers on young children , I ’ve been forced to exclaim , “ Do those people have children of their own ? ! ”
Well , at least some of them do , and see nothing amiss in cajoling them into receiving a couple of Pavlovian shocks .
And so the public memory is refreshed with another illustration of the fact that government “ service ” selects for a personality type in which stupidity and sadism are unusually salient traits .
In one of the “ playful ” incidents , children were arranged in a circle holding hands so that they could share the charge when one of them was shocked .
At another prison , children were shocked individually by having a stun gun pressed against their bodies .
At least two of the kids were sent “ sprawling to the floor , crying out in pain and clutching at agonizing burns on their arms , ” and one of them ended up in the hospital .
“ Your agonizer , please ! ”
The evil Mirror Universe ’s version of Transporter Chief Kyle pays for his inattention to a power surge by absorbing a punitive “ agonizer ” charge administered by the sadistic Mirror Spock .
One would expect that criminal charges would ensue as a result of those incidents .
One would be wrong .
Three employees — Lt. Russell Bourgault and Sgt. Walter Schmidt , 14 - year veterans of the prison system , and six - yet vet Sgt. Charmaine Davis — were fired .
Maj .
Seth Adams , a 19 - year veteran , and Lt. P.J. Weisner , who had 11 years in the system , resigned .
According to news reports , an additional 16 employees face unspecified “ discipline . ”
Thus far , however , there are no pending criminal charges , and the Florida State Department of Children and Family Services ( CFS ) , one of the nation ’s most energetic child - snatching bureaucracies ( it produced Janet Reno , remember ) , has shown no interest in separating the injured children from their parents .
This is a remarkably restrained official reaction , one likely influenced by the fact that the parents involved in this scandal are or were government employees .
On the other hand , when a privately employed father dealing with a misbehaving 14 - year - old son decides to eschew the belt in favor of a home - made electric stun gun , this is an act of felony child abuse and domestic battery worthy of the full punitive attention of the state law enforcement apparatus .
Is there some special significance to the fact that all of these incidents involving the electro - shock of children took place in Florida , a state where more than a few children have perished in “ boot camps ” for juvenile offenders ?
I take note of that fact without venturing an explanation .
Police “ resource officers ” stationed in that state ’s public schools have used Tasers — the full - fledged , consistently lethal instrument , not the relatively low - yield stun guns used in the last two examples — on kindergarten - age children with impunity on the assumption that the Taser is a relatively safe and humane implement of pain compliance .
So it may have been inevitable that a Florida entrepreneur would make a stun gun available to parents on the assumption that a mild jolt of electricity would be a safer and more effective corrective than any of the more familiar modes of administering corporal punishment .
In 2003 , a massage therapist from Boca Raton named Steve Robnor devised and marketed a device called the B - Stik , a billy club - shaped implement designed to deliver a brief shock — of roughly the same intensity as a bee sting — to an unruly child .
Robnor insisted that the B - Stik would leave no lasting marks , and do no significant harm .
“ It ’s a safer alternative for people who physically discipline their children , ” Robnor insisted .
“ Children should not be subjected to conventional physical discipline methods that have proven harmful .
This product will enable a parent or caregiver to physically correct a child ’s misbehavior safely , effectively , and most of all , responsibly . ”
According to Robnor , his kiddie - prod actually removed the risk of “ overdoing ” physical discipline ( and had other massage - related applications as well ) .
Leaving aside the merits — such as they are — of Robnor ’s product , it ’s important to recognize that much of his sales patter reflected the views of the Florida state child - snatcher bureaucracy , and capitalized on a market niche they probably helped to create .
At the time the B - Stik was introduced , the official position of the Florida Department of Child and Family Services was that spanking of any kind and duration was to be discouraged and dealt with as potential abuse .
“ No child needs a spanking , ” sniffed CFS spokeswoman Marilyn Munoz .
“ Spanking can be dangerous .
You never know when a child can be harmed if a parent loses control .
Children do n’t need to be hit in order to be taught how to behave . ”
As far as the CFS was concerned , shocking a child with a low - intensity cattle prod , while not desirable , was no worse than a conventional spanking .
At least one Florida parent took that idea to heart .
In 2005 , 40 - year - old Douglas Dycus was “ hotlined ” to the CFS and arrested for using a cattle prod-style stun gun to discipline his 14 - year - old son .
According to Dycus , he was frequently frustrated by the inattentiveness of his teenage son — a problem familiar to parents of teenagers everywhere .
On one evening , as the family prepared to leave for an engagement , the 14 - year - old was “ wrestling ” with a younger brother and refusing to obey instructions that he stop scuffling and get in the car .
So Dycus retrieved a small stunning device , and applied it to the upper arm of his son , with two predictable results :
The youngster let out a sharp yelp , and then he got into the car .
A case of this sort being irresistible to tabloid media of all varieties , Dycus ’s attorney , Richard Kibbey , soon turned up on Joe Scarborough ’s old MSNBC evening program .
Kibbey offered a two - pronged defense of Dycus ’s actions :
First , the innate right of parents to discipline their children includes the use of appropriate physical chastisement ; and second , that the means employed by Dycus were much milder than those used , with increasing frequency , by police who employ Tasers when dealing with unruly schoolchildren .
“ Some parents can reprimand a child and get order , ” Kibbey pointed out .
“ Some parents need to slap or spank a child to get order .
Some parents need to use a belt .
Police and court systems should not be second - guessing a parent unless it involves torture or [ physical punishment ] for no valid reason whatsoever , which is not the case here . ”
Furthermore , Kibbey continued , “ there ’s a double standard here in Florida , as well as across the nation .
We have all been seeing in the last few months the police are using Taser guns , not handheld , but Taser guns , and shooting darts into 6 - year - old children , a 12 - year - old girl in Florida [ last ]
November who was truant .
She was shot because she skipped class that day .
The police were never prosecuted and the police say they ’re — quote — ‘ reviewing their policy . ' ”
Those officers were never prosecuted , yet a parent , who knows his child better than anyone , who knows the history of this child , is now being prosecuted .
Do n’t you think that ’s a double standard ? ”
Now , one can agree with Kibbey ’s reasoning without presenting a brief on behalf of parental use of cattle prods .
As the father of six children , none of which could be described as a quiet , placid introvert , I can understand the occasional need to administer discipline of an unpleasantly exemplary nature .
Although I ’m not disinclined toward corporal punishment , I consider it to be of extremely limited utility and employ it very sparingly .
Once , while visiting an authoritarian church , I overheard a conversation in which a father , in a voice colored with concern , described his young son as a “ willful , high - spirited ” individual ; with an expression of almost vindictive satisfaction , his interlocutor exclaimed , “ Well , the good thing is that as his father , it ’s your responsibility to break that will . ”
Try as I might , I ca n’t understand how anyone — let alone someone professing to worship the Author of the Sermon on the Mount — could conclude that raising children involves breaking them in any sense .
Certainly , it involves teaching them to restrain and discipline their appetites , to practice deferral of gratification , to treat others with respect and deference where appropriate , and to obey God ’s law ( as summarized in the Two Great Commandments ) .
It means helping them to understand and practice self - regulation .

But “ breaking ” another human being in any sense or context is abusive by definition — irrespective of the means employed .
It stands to reason that the last thing the architects of a collectivist society want is a population of self - regulating , self - governing free individuals — people of the sort who usually come from homes in which parental authority is firmly and fairly exercised , and disciplinary decisions are not subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the nulliparous agony aunts running the local child - grabber bureaucracy .
This helps explain why , under the obscene doctrine of Parens Patriae , the same State that for a century and a half or so has been diligently undermining parental authority in the home has steadily increased its arbitrary power over children in public schools and similar settings .
It ’s now reached a point where misbehaving children barely old enough to speak or read are subject to arrest , handcuffing , and electro - shock torture at the hands of the same State - employed strangers who stand prepared to “ protect ” those same children from the imperfections of their own parents .

After the jump , you will find a memo Dallas Morning News editor Bob Mong and senior vice president of sales Cyndy Carr sent to everyone at A.H. Belo Corp .
Wednesday afternoon outlining what they call a " business / news integration . "
Which means ?
As of yesterday , some section editors at all of the company 's papers , including The News , will now report directly to Carr 's team of sales managers , now referred to as general managers .
In short , those who sell ads for A.H. Belo 's products will now dictate content within A.H. Belo 's products , which is a radical departure from the way newspapers have been run since , oh , forever .
Those sections mentioned in the memo include sports , entertainment , real estate , automotive and travel , among others .
The memo does n't mention Business or Metro by name , but there are references to " health / education " and " retail / finance " ; these are not defined in the missive .
Says the memo , Carr 's sales force will " be working closely with news leadership in product and content development . "
Executive sports editor Bob Yates and Lifestyles deputy managing editor Lisa Kresl are quoted in the memo enthusiastically signing off on the unconventional marriage ; says Kresl , " I 'm excited about the idea of working with a business partner on an arts and entertainment segment . "
I 've left messages for Mong , who refers to this merger as " a progressive step , " and Carr , who is in a meeting , and will update when they respond .
Till then , jump away .
Update at 11:33 a.m. : I just had a lengthy talk with Mong , who acknowledges that yesterday 's memo raised " uneasiness in some areas " of the newsroom , " and I would have been disappointed if people did n't raise questions . "
Our Q&A in full will appear in a separate item shortly .
Update at 12:58 p.m. :
You will find our interview with Mong here .
Update at 7:26 p.m. : Dallas Morning News publisher Jim Moroney called this evening to further explain the motivations behind yesterday 's memo .
A new examination of skulls from the royal cemetery at Ur , discovered in Iraq almost a century ago , appears to support a more grisly interpretation than before of human sacrifices associated with elite burials in ancient Mesopotamia , archaeologists say .
Palace attendants , as part of royal mortuary ritual , were not dosed with poison to meet a rather serene death .
Instead , a sharp instrument , a pike perhaps , was driven into their heads .
Archaeologists at the University of Pennsylvania reached that conclusion after conducting the first CT scans of two skulls from the 4,500 - year - old cemetery .
The cemetery , with 16 tombs grand in construction and rich in gold and jewels , was discovered in the 1920s .
A sensation in 20th century archaeology , it revealed the splendor at the height of the Mesopotamian civilization .
The recovery of about 2,000 burials attested to the practice of human sacrifice on a large scale .
At or even before the demise of a king or queen , members of the court  handmaidens , warriors and others  were put to death .
Their bodies were usually arranged neatly , the women in elaborate headdress , the warriors with weapons at their side .
Ted.com videos are often subtitled in a number of other languages , and when watching a video it 's a good idea to pick a language you happen to be learning or know a bit about to display at the bottom in order to best make use of your time when watching one .
Those learning English as a second language of course will want to display the original English subtitles at the bottom in order to best understand the speech and learn as much as possible .
But what about specifically using a video in order to learn a language instead of just gleaning a few new words here and there ?
Luckily , Ted.com also has the text of the video in each language ready to copy and paste so it 's possible to draft a bilingual copy of the speech that you can use to compare the translation with the English version .
This is a bit time - consuming so it 's probably best to use a short video for this unless you happen to be really patient .
Take a look at this video :
It 's actually too bad that this video happens to be so short because the idea is interesting but far too far - reaching for a video of just 3:30 or so in length .
I can't really say if the idea about a decrease in population and a 22st - century enlightenment is true without seeing a much longer version of the idea .
Nevertheless , this video is for language study so we 'll just let the subject of the video remain as is and take a look at the script .
Creating the bilingual script will be a personal process depending on the language being learned and your ability in the language , but ideally it should focus on parts of sentences instead of sentences as a whole .
When the word order differs to the extent that the translation has information that was originally at the beginning moved to the end though , you will have to use the whole sentence .
The script I 've created here as an example is Persian ( a much easier language than one might expect , by the way ) , and in Persian the verb is usually at the end of a sentence so sometimes one has no choice but to use the entire sentence .
You may also want to increase the size of the text of the language you are learning if it makes it that much easier to read .
Here is the script :
I used to be a Malthusian .
من سابقا پیرو فلسفۀ مالتوس بود م
This was my mental model of the world .
آن قالب مغزی من از جهان بود
Exploding population , جمعیت در حال انفجا ر
small planet , سیارۀ کوچ ک
it 's going to lead to ugly things .
به مسائل زشتی منتهی خواهد شد
But I 'm moving past Malthus .
ولی من دارم از مالتوس می‌گذر م
Because I think چون به نظر من
that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment .
شاید تنها ۱۵۰ سال با نوع جدیدی از روشنگری فاصله داشته باشی م
Here 's why .
توضیح می‌دهم چرا
This is the U.N. 's population data , you may have seen , for the world .
این داده جمعیتی سازمان ملل از جهان است، که احتمالا دیدید
And the world 's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion , late this century .
و
انتظار می‌رود که جمعیت جهان در اواخر قرن به بالاترین حد خود برسد، خوشبینانه اش درحدود ۱۰ میلیارد
And after that , و بعد از آن
most likely به احتمال زیاد
it 's going to begin to decline .
کم خواهد شد
So what then ?
خب بعد چه؟
Most of the economic models اکثر مدل‌های اقتصاد ی
are built around scarcity and growth .
بر اساس کمیابی و رشد بنیان شده‌اند
So a lot of economists از این رو خیلی از اقتصاددانان
look at declining population and به جمعیت در حال کاهش نگاه می‌کنند و
expect to see stagnation , maybe depression .
گمان می‌کنند که به رکود یا شاید کسادی منجر خواهد شد
But a declining population ولی جمعیت رو به کاه ش
is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects .
دو تاثیر اق تصادی مفید خواهد داش ت
One , fewer people , اولا، شمار کمتر ی از مرد م

make investing in property a bad bet .

is actually wrapped up in its speculative value .
در واقع ارزش فرضی آنها اس ت
Take away land speculation , اگر زمین خواری را از میان بردارید
price of land drops .
قیمت زمین کاهش می‌یابد
And that و این
begins to lift a heavy burden off the world 's poor .
باعث می‌شود که بار سنگین ی از دوش نیازمندان جهان برداشته شود
Number two , شمارۀ دو اینکه
a declining population جمعیت در حال تنز ل
means scarce labor .
به معنی کمیاب شدن نیروی کار اس ت
Scarce labor drives wages .
نیروی کار اندک موجب افزایش دستمزد می‌شود
As wages increase با افزایش دستمزدها
that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class .
بار دیگر ی از دوش فقرا و طبقۀ کارگر برداشته می‌شود
Now I 'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death .
حال، من از یک کاهش یکباره مثل چیزی که در « مرگ سیاه » شاهد بوده‌ایم صحبت نمی‌کن م
But look ولی بنگرید
what happened in Europe after the plague : به حوادث بعد از طاعون در اروپا

And after that , و پشت آن

Most of our cultural heritage اکثر میراث فرهنگی ما

romanticizing the past .

All of the Western religions همۀ ادیان غرب ی
begin with the notion of Eden , با خیال ی از بهشت آغاز شده‌اند

At that point , در آن هنگا م
we 'll start romanticizing the future again , ما نسبت به آینده خیالبافی خواهیم کرد
instead of the nasty , brutish past .
به جای زمان حال نامطبوع و گذشتۀ خش ن
So why does this matter ?
خب چرا این مهم است ؟
Why talk about social - economic movements چرا دربارۀ جنبش‌های اجتماعی‌ای صحبت کنی م
that may be more than a century away ?
که شاید بیش از یک قرن فاصله داشته باشند ؟
Because transitions are dangerous times .
برای اینکه دوران « گذار » خطرناک اس ت
When land owners وقتی که صاحبان زمی ن

there are some powerful interests that اینها موضوعات مهمی هستند که

If we have a positive view about the future اگر ما نظر مثبت ی

instead of careening off a cliff .
به جای واژگونی در صخره
If we can اگر ما بتوانی م
make it through the next 150 years , این ۱۵۰ سالِ پیش رو را پشت سر بگذاری م
I think that من گمان می‌کنم که
your great - great - grandchildren بچۀ- بچۀ- نوه‌هایتان
will forget all about Malthus .
به کلی مالتوس را از یاد خواهند برد
And instead , و به جای آن
they 'll be planning for the future برای آینده برنامه‌ریزی خواهند کرد
and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment .
و شروع به بنا نهادن عصر روشنگری قرن ۲۲ام خواهند نمود
Thank you .

Conical bras are flying off the shelves but would YOU wear one - and how do they work ?
Advertisement
Well hello , boys !
There 's no getting away from it .
That is exactly the message that my attire is sending out into the world .
In fact , I think the only way I could make it clearer is if I were holding a flashing arrow pointing at my chest .
It 's not that I 'm striding around the November streets exposing the sort of cleavage that made Eva Herzigova so voluptuous that her Wonderbra ad stopped traffic .
Far from it , I 'm in fact clad in a very demure cashmere sweater .
Before and after : Claire Coleman in her own bra , left , and the attention - grabbing in a cone bra , right
But it's what I 'm wearing underneath it that is causing something of a stir .
Because following the news that John Lewis has recorded a surge in sales of pointy bras , I am road - testing one of the aforementioned garments and the results are - ahem - interesting , to say the least .
I suppose I should be grateful that my modesty has - to some extent - been preserved .
After all , the concept of a conical bra means one thing and one thing only to anyone who grew up in the Nineties : Madonna and THAT outfit .
The infamous cone bra corset that Jean Paul Gaultier designed for her Blonde Ambition tour became a cultural reference point , long before we realised that , actually , Madonna was n't the first blonde to popularise this style of lingerie .
Indeed , in the Fifties , Diana Dors and Marilyn Monroe were infamous for their unnaturally cone - shaped bosoms that helped shape that Fifties icon ' the sweater girl ' .
Flash - forward 50 years and it looks like this particular silhouette is back with a bang .
OUR PICK OF THE COOLEST CONE BRAS : Red & black Lulu bullet bra , £ 35 , whatkatiedid.com ( left )
The prettiest and most wearable of all the bras , thanks to a less - extreme shape and with the lace a more feminine touch .
Pink satin bra , £ 109 , Rigby & Peller , 0845 076 5545 ( right )
This was meant to be inspired by old - world glamour , but seemed more reminiscent of a Madonna video .
The points needed more padding .
Nude soft non-wired bra , £ 9.75 , johnlewis.com ( below )
This is the conical bra for women who do n’t want to wear a conical bra .
It offered very little support .
Helen Spencer , John Lewis 's head buyer of lingerie , says : ' I think we 're selling more conical bras as customers take influence from designers such as Louise Goldin , Jean Paul Gaultier and Dolce & Gabbana , who have rediscovered the bra as outerwear in their spring / summer 2010 collections .
' Throughout the last century , the trend for feminine pointy - shaped bras experienced a renaissance following times of a toughened economy , marking a return of unabashed femininity as women seek to have more fun with fashion as a form of escapism . '
I do n't know about escapism .
The Triumph Doreen bra ( £ 23.50 , johnlewis.com ) that I 'm wearing feels an awful lot more restrictive than my usual choice .
This ain't pretty , sexy underwear .
This is the sort of matronly underwear that is probably referred to as ' a foundation garment ' ; it 's no-nonsense , functional stuff that the empire was built on .
And while , in my pencil skirt , rear - seamed stockings and tight sweater , I 'd hoped to be channelling a sort of breathy , Jessica - Rabbit - meets - Marilyn - Monroe vibe , I actually feel more like my old history teacher , Mrs Lewis , who had a bosom so impressive that it could silence a full assembly hall in seconds .
( Admittedly , this might have been down to her position in authority and her booming baritone , but I still believe that her formidable bosom , that she always seemed to wear high , proud and pointed - like a pair of attacking bazookas - added in no small way to the effect . )
I might not feel in the slightest bit sexy with this pair of oversized bullets attached to my torso , but there 's no escaping the fact that I 'm garnering an awful lot more attention than I usually would in a prim sweater and skirt .
Walking through the office , I 'm a little bit concerned that I 've inadvertently given an entire desk whiplash , after my two - pronged attack prompts a series of double - takes .
' Wow , your boobs walked into the room before you did , ' gasps the photographer .
I pop outside to grab a sandwich for lunch and the man serving me seems to have problems focusing on my face , and on my way back to the office a passing builder shouts after me : ' You 'll have someone 's eye out with them ! '
But when I do a quick straw poll , almost everyone agrees that while it's an eye - catching look , it 's just not sexy .
' I think it 's because when men think about boobs , they think about something soft and round - it's the curves that are sexy , ' ponders one man .
' But this is a very aggressive look . '
You can see his point .
Who in their right mind would n't be terrified with these two instruments of torture bearing down on them ?
And to be honest , that decides me .
If lingerie does n't feel good , does n't look good and men do n't find it sexy , frankly what 's the point of it ?
It might have worked for Marilyn and Jean Paul Gaultier , but despite John Lewis 's recent figures piquing my interest , I 've got to confess that my interest in these particular twin peaks has , well , peaked .
The Book of Unwritten Tales is a humorous homage to the great fantasy books , movies , and games of the genre , filled with plenty of weird characters and dark humour .
The game features four playable heroes ( the little gnome Wilbur ; the elf princess Ivo ; a human adventurer named Nate ; and The Critter , a shaggy creature that Nate adopted on one of his journeys and has n't stopped trotting behind him ever since ) whose skills have to be used wisely , particularly those that can only be solved by working as a team .
India
This is the India Stage .
Look at Dhalsim go !
OK , let 's take a closer look at this stage .
The cow is enjoying a free meal courtesy of the falling fruit .
When the battle heats up , the elephants will fall over !
And it 's not just the elephants .
Cows , people , everyone is falling over !
This geezer kind of sticks out .
Even Dhalsim 's wife is here to cheer on !
Actually , you will only see Sally cheering on when Dhalsim is fighting .
A cow feeding on some grass .
Everyone gets really excited when you win !
Korea
Next up !
Here 's a stage from Juri 's home country , Korea .
This stage was created with a lot of support from Capcom Korea .
Take a good look !
A busy marketplace .
Vendors and customers , everyone 's excited to watch the fight !
Here 's a guy looking into the camera .
And there 's a pretty detailed park way back in the distance !
( I noticed it just now )
Some kind of sausage ... looks delicious !
I want some !
I want some right now !
The left hand part of the stage looks like this .
All kinds of people are stopping by to watch .
Looks like they 're a couple , huh .
Hey , boyfriend , get a hold of yourself !
A lady who sells socks and shoes .
With matching eyeshadow and scarf , she 's seems like a pretty fashionable woman .
When you win the match , this old couple gets all lovey dovey !
Africa / Savanna
This is the stage I want to brag about the most , the savannah stage !
I 'm sure that T.Hawk would agree that this stage 's standout feature is the lovingly detailed depiction of all the animals .
So I 'll show you a lot of pictures of just that !
Meerkats .
Their heads pop up as if they 're asking " Hey , what 's going on here ? " .
They start to gather , and soon enough a whole band of meerkat spectators will be watching .
A peaceful savannah scene .
The sun is shining brightly ...
Or so you 'd think !
In this stage , you 'll get to witness a solar eclipse !
Those hippos are huge !
But actually , in real life hippos are about 3.5 - 4 meters long and weigh about 1.2 - 2.6 tons .
Just like elephants , these are some enormous land creatures .
Kinda scary .
A giraffe , two zebras and a cheetah , running across the savannah .
Wait , what kind of game is this again ?
The meerkats and hippos get really really into the fight for some reason .
... I 'm a little worried about the meerkats .
Wait - there 's something in the hippo's mouth !
Tada !
It 's a white bird taking a break in the hippo's mouth !
Instead of asking the staff , I looked it up myself and , this bird is an intermediate egret !
I 'm sure of it !
Ah ...
Aaah ...
Free at last !
The hippo falls over dramatically in all the excitement , but the giraffe just calmly looks on .
The giraffe gracefully drinks water , but what about when the match gets going ..?
Its legs are long , so falling over must really hurt !
When you win the match , the meerkats start clapping and cheering !!
Construction Zone
And here 's the fourth stage .
The construction site stage , that got everybody talking about Andore !
Here you can see the whole stage .
When you look at the stage , you get a slight feeling that Servbots might appear somewhere ...
Even behind that net in the background , people are moving about !
This guy in the red hardhat looks like he 's the foreman .
Lunch time !
This is the right hand corner of the stage .
That guy is just playing around on that loading cart ...
There he is , the much talked about Andore !!
And way back in the foggy distance , you can see ... the Mayor !
It 's the Mayor !
Wow , that 's quite the statue ...
Andore is horrified to see his colleague about to fall .
That pose really gets his emotion across .
Do a move that travels high up like this one , and you can even see the upper floors of the construction site !
I kind of feel bad for Fuerte though , you can tell he 's not getting out of that one ...
Hello everyone !
The cold of winter is finally here , and Ono ... Ono ... was done in by a virus !
It does n't seem to be the flu though , so that 's good at least .
But , will he be OK in time for today 's Midnight Live ?
[ A talkshow hosted by Famitsuu and Xbox Live - Jig 's note ]
Hang in there , Ono !
Last week finally saw the revival of the Q&A section here on the blog , and I want to thank everyone for leaving so many comments !!
No matter how many times I read them , they always lift my spirits !
Really , there 's so many kind comments ...
I might even cry a little !
OK , that 's enough !
I 'm too busy for this !
Everyone , did you vote for the SF4 National Tournament Dream Team yet ?
The deadline is December 21 , at 9 PM !
So there 's only three days left .
If you have n't voted yet , head to the SF4 Mobile Site immediately and cast your vote !
[ A " dream team " of players will be qualified for the Japanese nationals by fan vote .
Voting is open only to SF4 players with an arcade IC card registered with the SF4 mobile website - Jig 's note ]
OK , so let 's move on to SSF4 .
A merry merry Christmas is almost upon us !
So , PlayStation
Home is hosting the " Christmas Illumination " event !
Of course , SSF4 will join the party .
12/19 0:0012/20 18:0012/25 23:0012/25 22:00
Visit the PlayStation Home Square at the above times , and ... W - w - what !?
Felyne and Melynx from Monster Hunter Freedom Unite will introduce SSF4 , and Jill from Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition will be there too !
And Ryu !
You can see amazing snow sculptures ... and you will be able to receive exclusive , never - before - available items !!
Wow , this is just something you can't miss !
... Ah , well , instead of coming at the exact times noted above , it might be a good idea to be a little early .
I 'm really looking forward to it too !
[ This all refers to an event held on the Japanese PlayStation Home , of course - Jig 's note ]
Very well !
Today , I 'll give a proper introduction to something you 've probably seen a glimpse of here and there recently , namely the new stages in SSF4 !!
SSF4 will have four new stages .
OK !
Those are the four new stages in SSF4 !!
The stage development staff created these with even more passion and enthusiasm than normal , so when you get to see these stages in motion , I 'm sure there are even more things to discover !
Alright , so that was my attempt at introducing the new stages .
And finally , I have a correction to make .
Unfortunately , when announcing the locations for the Street Fighter IV National Tournament last time , I made a mistake .
Last week I announced that the custom titles awarded at the regional qualifiers would be the following : 1st place : " 2010 VIP " 2nd place : " 2010 Generalissimo " 3rd place : " Proof of Friendship " But actually , the " Generalissimo " title is for finishing in 2nd place at the National Tournament , like RF , who holds the title of " 2009 Generalissimo " since the tournament in January of this year .
So in other words , I mistakenly mixed up the custom title awarded for getting 2nd place in the qualifiers , and the one for getting 2nd place in the actual National Tournament .
I 'm so sorry , RF !!
So allow me to set things straight .
The award for getting 2nd place in a regional qualifier is the custom title " Telepath " .
That 's all .
Sorry again !
Next week , I will announce the results of the Dream Team election !
It will be the final update of 2009 , so I 'm working hard on it !
Well , everyone , see you next week !

Beirut , Lebanon ( CNN ) --
Hezbollah's chief on Monday announced the group 's new " manifesto , " which calls on all countries to " liberate Jerusalem " and declares the United States a threat to the world .
" American terrorism is the source of every terrorism in the world , " Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech from an undisclosed location .
It was his first address since a unity government formed in Lebanon this month , ending a crisis that had left the country with no government since June 's parliamentary elections .
Hezbollah , a political party in Lebanon , is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel .
Nasrallah does not appear in public amid concerns for his safety .
" We invite and call on all Arabs and Muslims and all countries keen on peace and stability in the world to intensify efforts and resources to liberate Jerusalem from Zionist occupation and to maintain its true identity and its Islamic and Christian sanctities , " Nasrallah said .
Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks .
It has been linked to attacks against against American , Israeli and other Western targets .
In his remarks , which included about 80 minutes of reading the manifesto followed by answering questions from reporters , Nasrallah sought to reject the " terrorist " label , repeatedly saying Hezbollah is a " resistance " force .
" The U.S. administration under President George W. Bush equated the concepts of terrorism and resistance to deny the right of resistance for the people , " he argued .
He praised Iran and Syria , which are Hezbollah 's chief backers .
" Iran plays a central role in the Muslim world " and " stood with courage and determination with Arab and Islamic issues , especially the Palestinian issue , " Nasrallah said .
" Damascus stood with and supported the resistance 's movements in the conflict .
We emphasize the need to adhere to the distinguished relations between Lebanon and Syria , " he added .
A battle to end Syria 's occupation of Lebanon led to protests and confrontations in the streets in 2005 , which was labeled the Cedar Revolution .
Syria eventually withdrew its troops from the country .
In his " manifesto " Monday , Nasrallah also touched on domestic issues .
" We want a government that works for its citizens and provides the appropriate services in their education and medical care and housing to secure a decent life and to address the problem of poverty and provide employment opportunities , " Nasrallah said .
" We want a government that works to strengthen the role of women in society and enhance their participation in all fields , " he added .
Nasrallah also called for Palestinians in Lebanon to " be given basic human rights which at the same time protect their identity and their cause . "
Under Lebanese law , Palestinian refugees have no social and civil rights , limited access to public health or educational facilities , and no access to public social services , according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency .
" The majority rely entirely on UNRWA as the sole provider of education , health and relief and social services , " the agency says on its Web site .
" Considered as foreigners , Palestine refugees are prohibited by law from working in more than 70 trades and professions .
This has led to a very high rate of unemployment amongst the refugee population . "
More than 422,000 Palestinian refugees are registered with the agency in Lebanon , the group says .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea ’s New Year ’s wish of seeing the destruction of a massive concrete wall dividing the Korean peninsula never seems to come true -- mostly because there is no such barrier .
South Korean

Mentioning the wall by the North has been an odd New Year tradition begun by state founder Kim Il - sung and kept alive by a fawning propaganda machine that dares not correct a person revered as a deity .
Kim died 15 years ago and is considered the state ’s “ eternal president . ”
The Korean peninsula is divided by a 4 - km wide Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) with razor wire fences on the North and South side , but with no huge , concrete barrier as claimed by the North .
But that did not stop North Korea ’s ruling party newspaper on Wednesday from coming out with its demand that the wall be demolished because “ it runs diametrically counter to the desire and demand of the nation and the trend of the times . ”
The idea of a Korean wall across the Cold War ’s last frontier was a creation of the times , specifically , the fall of the Berlin Wall , which marked the symbolic end of the Cold War in Europe .
A few weeks after the Berlin Wall started coming down in 1989 , Kim Il - sung said in a New Year ’s address that Seoul had built a massive concrete wall to divide the two states , which are technically still at war .
Analysts said Kim made the claim to rally support for his state as its communist allies were fading .
At the time Seoul was working to set up formal ties with the Soviet Union , then the North ’s biggest benefactor .
Kim , who helped secure power by turning his country into one of the world ’s most isolated and insular states , said in the speech to welcome 1990 that the wall was “ a barrier of national division ” preventing free travel between the two countries .
Some international news reports accepted Kim ’s pronouncement as fact , prompting Seoul to invite journalists and observers a few weeks later to look into the DMZ to see for themselves that the wall did not exist .
The North likely spotted concrete tank barriers set up south of its end of the DMZ and assumed the South was building a wall across the peninsula , analysts have said .
The DMZ was set up in the armistice that halted fighting in the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
North Korea ’s official media has painted a vivid picture of the wall that is not there .
It says the border wall stands 5 meters ( 16 ft ) to 8 meters ( 26 ft ) high , is as thick as 19 meters and was built in the 1970s by a “ South Korean military fascist clique . ”
Using DTrace with GHC
GHC 6.13 includes DTrace probes in the runtime system .
Currently , these probes correspond to the events of the EventLog framework and are only available on Mac OS X ( from Leopard onwards ) .
It is straight forward to extend the current implementation with additional probes , and due to the lightweight nature of DTrace , new probes could inspect the runtime system and running Haskell program in an even more fine - grained manner .
About DTrace
DTrace and the associated D programming language are described in detail in the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide .
The Mac OS X specific GUI frontend , Instruments , is explained in the Instruments User Guide and the Mac version of the command line tool dtrace is documented by the Mac OS X dtrace man page .
Using DTrace with GHC
To make effective use of DTrace probes , we need D scripts and custom instruments for Instruments app .
Until then , the available probes can be queried as follows :
Start ghci in a terminal Invoke the following command at another command line prompt : sudo dtrace - P ' HaskellEvent * ' -l
To trace a Haskell program :
Execute sudo dtrace - P ' HaskellEvent * ' - Z on the command line Then , invoke your Haskell program ( the terminal running dtrace will dump the trace )
If you only want to be notified of the start and end of garbage collections , invoke dtrace as follows :
sudo dtrace -n ' HaskellEvent *::: gc- start ' -n ' HaskellEvent *::: gc-end ' - Z
Further details on the available probes are below .
IMPORTANT : Do not use dtrace with the -c option to start and trace a Haskell program in a single invocation .
On Mac OS X , this does n't seem to work for reasons that I do n't understand .
( To be precise , it does seem to work for other programs , but probes in the Haskell runtime appear not to be detected . )
Probe description
The following probes are being made available by the HaskellEvent provider :
create - thread ( capability , tid ) Triggered when a new runtime thread is created .
Reports the capability on which the thread is created and the new thread 's thread id .
run-thread ( capability , tid )
Indicates that the given thread starts to run on the specified capability .
stop - thread ( capability , tid )
The identified thread stops execution on the given capability .
thread - runnable ( capability , tid )
The given thread has just been appended to the run queue of the specified capability .
migrate - thread ( cap , tid , new_cap )
The specified thread has just been moved from capability cap to new_cap , either because cap is sharing its run queue with new_cap or because the migration was explicitly requested .
run-spark ( capability , tid )
We are about to convert a spark into a new parallel thread .
The capability and thread are those determining the spark and converting it , not the thread id of the new spark .
steal - spark ( cap , tid , victim_cap )
We are about to convert a spark from a different capability , namely victim_cap , into a new parallel thread .
Again , the capability and thread are those determining the spark and converting it , not the thread id of the new spark .
shutdown ( cap )
The specified capability is about to disappear ; its run queue and spare worker lists are already empty .
thread - wakeup ( cap , tid , other_cap )
We just unblocked the specified thread on capability other_cap .
( The capability cap is the one which performed the unblocking . ) gc-start ( cap )
The specified capability gets ready for a garbage collection .
gc-end ( cap )
The specified capability completed a garbage collection .
gc- request - seq - gc ( cap )
We are about to perform a single - threaded garbage collection ( meaning that we will grab all capabilities , and then , perform the GC on the specified capability ) .
gc- request - par - gc ( cap )
We are about to perform a parallel garbage collection ( this still means all mutator threads need to stop ) .
We might need to wait for the other capabilities to donate a worker thread each .
create - spark - thread ( cap , tid )
We just turned a spark into the specified thread on the given capability .
startup ( num_caps )
Initialising the runtime system with the given number of capabilities ( that 's the value passed with + RTS - N ) .
user-msg ( cap , msg )
The given user message ( a string that you need to copy with copyinstr ( ) ) was emitted on the given capability ; this happens when a call to traceEvent is being made , passing the message as an argument .
gc-idle ( cap )
The GC worker thread of the specified capability just became idle .
gc-work ( cap )
The GC worker thread of the specified capability is about to do some GC work .
gc - done ( cap )
The GC worker thread of the specified capability finished doing GC .
Probe definition
The provider is defined as follows :
provider HaskellEvent { // scheduler events probe create__thread ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID ) ; probe run__thread ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID ) ; probe stop__thread ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID , EventThreadStatus ) ; probe thread__runnable ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID ) ; probe migrate__thread ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID , EventCapNo ) ; probe run__spark ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID ) ; probe steal__spark ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID , EventCapNo ) ; probe shutdown ( EventCapNo ) ; probe thread_wakeup ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID , EventCapNo ) ; probe gc__start ( EventCapNo ) ; probe gc__end ( EventCapNo ) ; probe request__seq__gc ( EventCapNo ) ; probe request__par__gc ( EventCapNo ) ; probe create__spark__thread ( EventCapNo , EventThreadID ) ; // other events probe startup ( EventCapNo ) ; probe user__msg ( EventCapNo , char * ) ; probe gc__idle ( EventCapNo ) ; probe gc__work ( EventCapNo ) ; probe gc__done ( EventCapNo ) ; } ;
where we have
typedef uint32_t EventThreadID ; typedef uint16_t EventCapNo ; typedef uint16_t EventThreadStatus ;
The two events EVENT_LOG_MSG and EVENT_BLOCK_MARKER are not supported .
The former does n't appear to be used and the latter appears to be an artefact of the event log file format .
Portability
User -space DTrace probes are implemented differently on Mac OS X than in the original DTrace implementation ; see under the heading BUILDING CODE CONTAINING USDT PROBES in the Mac OS X dtrace man page .
Nevertheless , it should n't be too hard to enable these probes on other platforms , too .

Herman Van Rompuy .
Get used to the name .
He is the first President of the European Union , which with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by all the 27 EU member states in early November was transformed into a genuine United States of Europe .
The President of Europe has not been elected ; he was appointed in a secret meeting of the heads of government of the 27 EU member states .
They chose one of their own .
Herman Van Rompuy was the Prime Minister of Belgium .
I knew him when he was just setting out , reluctantly , on his political career .
To understand Herman , one must know something about Belgium , a tiny country in Western Europe , and the prototype of the EU .
Belgians do not exist as a nation .
Belgium is an artificial state , constructed by the international powers in 1830 as a political compromise and experiment .
The country consists of 6 million Dutch , living in Flanders , the northern half of the country , and 4 million French , living in Wallonia , the southern half .
The Belgian Dutch , called Flemings , would have preferred to stay part of the Netherlands , as they were until 1830 , while the Belgian French , called Walloons , would have preferred to join France .
Instead , they were forced to live together in one state .
Belgians do not like their state .
They despise it .
They say it represents nothing .
There are no Belgian patriots , because no - one is willing to die for a flag which does not represent anything .
Because Belgium represents nothing , multicultural ideologues love Belgium .
They say that without patriotism , there would be no wars and the world would be a better place .
As John Lennon sang “ Imagine there ’s no countries , it is n’t hard to do , nothing to kill or die for , and no religion too . ”
In 1957 , Belgian politicians stood at the cradle of the European Union .
Their aim was to turn the whole of Europe into a Greater Belgium , so that wars between the nations of Europe would no longer be possible as there would no longer be nations , the latter all having been incorporated into an artificial superstate .
A closer look at Belgium , the laboratory of Europe , shows , however , that the country lacks more than patriotism .
It also lacks democracy , respect for the rule of law , and political morality .
In 1985 , in his book De Afwezige Meerderheid ( The Absent Majority ) the late Flemish philosopher Lode Claes ( 1913 - 1997 ) argued that without identity and a sense of genuine nationhood , there can also be no democracy and no morality .
One of the people who were deeply influenced by Dr. Claes ’s thesis was a young politician named Herman Van Rompuy .
In the mid-1980s , Van Rompuy , a conservative Catholic , born in 1947 , was active in the youth section of the Flemish Christian - Democrat Party .
He wrote books and articles about the importance of traditional values , the role of religion , the protection of the unborn life , the Christian roots of Europe and the need to preserve them .
The undemocratic and immoral nature of Belgian politics repulsed him and led to a sort of crisis of conscience .
Lode Claes , who was near to retiring , offered Herman the opportunity of succeeding him as the director of Trends , a Belgian financial - economic weekly magazine .
It is in this context that I made Herman ’s acquaintance .
He invited me for lunch one day to ask whether , if he accepted the offer to enter journalism , I would be willing to join him .
It was then that he told me that he was considering leaving politics and was weighing the options for the professional life he would pursue .
I am not sure what happened next , however .
Maybe word had reached the leadership of the Christian Democrat Party that Herman , a brilliant economist and intellectual , was considering leaving politics ; perhaps they made him an offer he could not refuse .
Herman remained in politics .
He was made a Senator and entered government as a junior minister .
In 1988 , he became the party leader of the governing Christian - Democrats .
Our paths crossed at intervals until 1990 , when the Belgian Parliament voted a very liberal abortion bill .
The Belgian King Baudouin ( 1930 - 1993 ) , a devout Catholic who suffered from the fact that he and his wife could not have any children , had told friends that he would “ rather abdicate than sign the bill . ”
The Belgian politicians , convinced that the King was bluffing , did not want the Belgian people to know about the King ’s objections to the bill .
I wrote about this on the op - ed pages of The Wall Street Journal and was subsequently reprimanded by the Belgian newspaper I worked for , following an angry telephone call from the then Belgian Prime Minister , a Christian - Democrat , to my editor , who was this Prime Minister ’s former spokesman .
I was no longer allowed to write about Belgian affairs for foreign newspapers .
In April 1990 , the King did in fact abdicate over the abortion issue , and the Christian - Democrat Party , led by Herman Van Rompuy , who had always prided himself on being a good Catholic , had one of Europe ’s most liberal abortion bills signed by the college of ministers , a procedure provided by the Belgian Constitution for situations when there is no King .
Then they had the King voted back on the throne the following day .
I wrote about the whole affair in a critical follow - up article for The Wall Street Journal and was subsequently fired by my newspaper “ for grievous misconduct ” .
A few weeks later , I met Herman at the wedding of a mutual friend .
I approached him for a chat .
I could see he felt very uncomfortable .
He avoided eye contact and broke off the conversation as soon as he could .
We have not spoken since .
Herman ’s political career continued .
He became Belgium ’s Budget Minister and Deputy Prime Minister , Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives and finally Prime Minister .
He kept publishing intellectual and intelligent books , but instead of defending the concept of the good , he now defended the concept of “ the lesser evil . ”
And he began to write haiku .
Two years ago , Belgium faced its deepest political crisis ever .
The country was on the verge of collapse following a 2003 ruling by its Supreme Court that the existing electoral district of Brussels - Halle - Vilvoorde ( BHV ) , encompassing both the bilingual capital Brussels and the surrounding Dutch - speaking countryside of Halle - Vilvoorde , was unconstitutional and that Parliament should remedy the situation .
The ruling came in response to a complaint that the BHV district was unconstitutional and should be divided into a bilingual electoral district Brussels and a Dutch - language electoral district Halle - Vilvoorde .
This complaint had been lodged by …
Herman Van Rompuy , a Flemish inhabitant of the Halle - Vilvoorde district .
In 2003 , however , the Christian - Democrats were not in government and Herman was a leader of the opposition .
His complaint was intended to cause political problems for Belgium ’s Liberal government , which refused to divide the BHV district because the French - speaking parties in the government refused to accept the verdict of the Supreme Court .
The Flemish Christian - Democrats went to the June 2007 general elections with as their major theme the promise that , once in government , they would split BHV .
Herman campaigned on the issue , his party won the elections and became Flanders ’ largest party .
Belgium ’s political crisis dragged on from June until December 2007 because it proved impossible to put together a government consisting of sufficient Dutch - speaking ( Flemish ) and French - speaking ( Walloon ) politicians .
The Flemings demanded that BHV be split , as instructed by the Supreme Court ; the Walloons refused to do so .
Ultimately , the Flemish Christian - Democrats gave in , reneged on their promise to their voters , and agreed to join a government without BHV being split .
Worse still , the new government has more French - speaking than Dutch - speaking ministers , and does not have the support of the majority of the Flemings in Parliament , although the Flemings make up a 60 % majority of the Belgian population .
Herman became the Speaker of the Parliament .
In this position he had to prevent Parliament , and the Flemish representatives there , from voting a bill to split BHV .
He succeeded in this , by using all kinds of tricks .
One day he even had the locks of the plenary meeting room changed so that Parliament could not convene to vote on the issue .
On another occasion , he did not show up in his office for a whole week to avoid opening a letter demanding him to table the matter .
His tactics worked .
In December 2008 , when the Belgian Prime Minister had to resign in the wake of a financial scandal , Herman became the new leader of the predominantly French - speaking government which does not represent the majority of Belgium ’s ethnic majority group .
During the past 11 months , he has skillfully managed to postpone any parliamentary vote on the BHV matter , thereby prolonging a situation which the Supreme Court , responding to Herman 's own complaint in 2003 , has ruled to be unconstitutional .
Now , Herman has moved on to lead Europe .
Like Belgium , the European Union is an undemocratic institution , which needs shrewd leaders who are capable of renouncing everything they once believed in and who know how to impose decisions on the people against the will of the people .
Never mind democracy , morality or the rule of law , our betters know what is good for us more than we do .
And Herman is now one of our betters .
He has come a long way since the days when he was disgusted with Belgian - style politics .
Herman is like Saruman , the wise wizard in Tolkien ’s Lord of the Rings , who went over to the other side .
He used to care about the things we cared about .
But no longer .
He has built himself a high tower from where he rules over all of us .

The fantastic thing about a recession is that it tightens up the business belt .
Deadwood goes , much to the relief of the competent employees , who are only demoralized by the well - paid bum in the next cubicle .
Good riddance .
In a recession , software upgrades become essential to life itself .
Employees feel the need to actually do stuff besides update their Facebook accounts .
In other words , recessions make the world less wasteful and , in this sense , forge a framework for increased prosperity down the road .
Finally , there is something aesthetically pleasing about clean houses , and recessions accomplish this by necessity .
But some bad business practices have survived this downturn , and number one on my list is the practice of sending gifts to customers during the holiday season .
I simply cannot believe that this still goes on .
Far from pleasing the customer , these gifts have the opposite effect .
They make the customer wonder what the heck the business is doing spending money on nonsense rather than increasing efficiency and giving lower prices .
Is anyone really fooled by these gifts ?
I seriously doubt it .
For me , I must admit , these gifts generate waves of fury .
Let 's say that a printer decides to send out boxes of fancy candy and fruit to all its clients , an idea generated by some B - school grad in upper management .
There are 30,000 customers .
Each gift costs $ 8 plus $ 3 in mailing for a total of more than a third of a million dollars .
With that , the company could hire a good programmer or software manager for five full years .
" Recessions make the world less wasteful and , in this sense , forge a framework for increased prosperity down the road . "
These days , one good employee can increase the efficiency of a company by 50 percent , simply by automating processes that are now manual .
Or maybe the money could go for some solid enterprise software or a web service .
But no : the company instead squanders the money on cheap bribes that have nothing to do with enterprise .
Getting a fruit basket in the mail serves only to remind customers of the business 's failure to get with the program .
The truth is that vast numbers of American businesses are living in times past , using dated software and computers , and employing an army of fools who think that business life consists in dressing nicely and talking a good game .
Meanwhile , the people who actually make the business run — the geeks — are underpaid and underappreciated .
Their value to the future is nearly always underestimated .
And even if the company is using the latest technology ( which is highly unlikely ) , why not put the money being spent on gifts into a price break for the customer ?
That is what people really appreciate .
It conveys true devotion , true service , true attachment to the idea of excellence .
Nothing says Happy Holidays like a discount .
Even better would be good service and good prices all year long .
I do n't see Wal - Mart sending presents to all its customers .
In fact , most people would be rather puzzled to get a gift in the mail from Wal - Mart .
The first thoughts to occur to the recipient would be " That chair I bought is falling apart , the CD player stopped working , and those crackers I bought were stale ! "
It would call to mind every failing of the company .
Wal - Mart is surely wise enough to understand this .
But it is different in business - to - business contracting .
Somehow the ethos caught hold in the B2B world that every third - party contractor must shell out thousands , millions , to send holiday treats .
Why do they do this ?
Are printers , warehouses , and technology companies under the impression that these gifts increase the likelihood that the contracting company is going to use the provider more in the new year ?
They must believe this .
Why else would they send them ?
After all , these providers are not Santas .
They are businesses .
And in business the watchword should always be Get rid of waste .
A gift to a client says , " We love waste and we think you love it too . "
Yes , it is true that the holidays are a time for love and sharing and gift giving .
But people should do this on their own dime , not at the expense of others .
An office party is one thing , but why advertise inefficiency to your clients ?
A business in the private sector is utterly and completely dependent on customers for its revenue , so the revenue they spend on gift giving necessarily comes from the customers too !
Do you see ?
They are throwing away money on fripperies rather than serving others through what they are supposed to be doing .
As the gifts from these businesses pour in , think of it as a sign that this recession has not been nearly deep enough or gone on nearly long enough .

The grotto , at Westfield shopping centre in west London , invited over - 18 shoppers to relax on Santa 's sleigh sofa , have their photo taken with sexy helpers and receive a naughty gift .
A centre spokesman said : “ Why should kids have all the fun at Christmas ?
" The grown - up grotto at Westfield is infusing the festive season with a touch of burlesque glamour in the run-up to Christmas , with only over - 18s allowed .
“ While children can only expect a present from Santa if they ’ve been good , the grown - up grotto welcomes adults who like to be just ever so slightly naughty . ”

The D.C. Council gave tentative approval Tuesday to a bill that would allow same - sex marriages to be performed in the District of Columbia .
The bill passed 11 - 2 and faces a final vote that is scheduled tentatively for Dec. 15 .
Mayor Adrian M. Fenty , a Democrat , has said he will sign the bill , which would go into effect after a mandatory 30 - day congressional review period .
If approved , the District of Columbia will join Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa and Vermont in performing same - sex marriages .
New Hampshire will begin performing same - sex marriages in January .
“ I do n’t think it ’s a giant step , it ’s a final step , ” said council member Phil Mendelson , at - large Democrat .
“ This is a civil right . ”
The District ’s bill redefines marriage as “ the legally recognized union of two people ” who meet the eligibility requirements “ regardless of gender . ”
Under the bill , religious officials may choose whether to perform same - sex marriage ceremonies but are not required to if doing so would contradict their faith .
Mr. Mendelson , chairman of the council ’s Committee on Public Safety and the Judiciary , held more than 18 hours of public testimony on the subject , which has drawn fire from religious groups , particularly local , black Christian churches and the Catholic Church .
Council members Yvette Alexander , Ward 7 Democrat , and Marion Barry , Ward 8 Democrat , cast the dissenting votes .
Both have cited the will of their overwhelmingly black constituencies as the reason for their opposition .
Mr. Barry pointed to his record as a civil rights leader and said he has supported the gay community on many issues but could not vote in favor of same - sex marriage .
“ This community is deeply divided on this issue , ” he said , “ and it to some extent cuts across racial lines , unfortunately .
It ’s not fair to make this one issue a litmus test as to one ’s commitment to human rights — to justice . ”
The Catholic Church has argued that legalizing gay marriage will prevent it from operating in the District of Columbia because the church will not extend benefits to same - sex married couples employed by Catholic schools .
The church also has said the bill would force it to offer social services , such as adoption services , to same - sex couples , which is contrary to the Catholic faith .
The bill was not amended to address the church ’s concerns .
Council member David A. Catania , at - large independent , who introduced the bill in October with the support of nine council members , said Tuesday he still is open to any language that could “ perfect the religious freedom notion ” of the bill .
“ I have a deep and abiding respect for faith and the role it plays in our lives , ” he said .

( CNN ) -- Heather Moores and her 4 - year - old son , Julian , sat in a waiting room at a pediatrician 's office .
Alexandre Moores holds his 4 - year - old son Julian , whose behavior elicits stares and comments .
Julian , who has autism , was goose - stepping and counting every coat hook on the wall aloud .
He started roaring like a lion .
Moores smiled at her son , then noticed the horrified looks on other people 's faces .
" People do not understand , " she said .
" To them , as bizarre as his actions might look , for us , they 're a blessing .
For us , it means he 's enjoying himself and happy .
No one understands that .
They just see an out - of - control child .
They do n't understand this is a good day , when there is n't screams upon screams . "
On the second World Autism Awareness Day , the search for a cure continues , and major court decisions have helped sort out the theories connected to the mysterious developmental disorders .
Public knowledge and acceptance of autism and the difficulties the families face may be growing , as some iReporters told CNN .
But that 's little comfort to a parent whose child 's behavior can range from quirky to violent .

Children with autism have unexplainable breakdowns -- their outbursts are often loud , aggressive and disturbing .
Julian slams himself against the ground or wall while he screams , flailing his limbs .
Julian 's younger brother , Marcus , 3 , squirms away from his parents and runs into the street to oncoming cars because he is fascinated by them .
He also screams with such ferocity that his face turns purple and mucus bubbles from his nostrils .
Their youngest brother , Aric , also has autism and just turned 1 year old .

Heather Moores remembers that the stares in the waiting room were full of contempt .
Onlookers shook their head in disgust and glared , making her feel like the " world 's worst mother . "
This happens every time they go out to the doctor 's office , the barber shop or anywhere in public .
" You 'll hear people talking , ' If it was my kid , he would n't behave like that .
These parents do n't know how to discipline their children .
Why do n't you shut that kid up ? ' said Alexandre Moores , Heather 's husband .
" It makes going out unpleasant .
I do n't know if you ever get used to it . "
Autism spectrum disorders affect the ability to communicate and interact .
Many with autism have repetitive movements like rocking or hand - flapping and become set in their daily routines .
Anything unexpected -- even a sound -- can result in major meltdowns .
" The reason why toddlers have tantrums is they do n't have verbal or cognitive skills yet , " said Dr. Lisa Shulman , an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx , New York .
" They have no control to navigate difficult situations using their social and communication skills .
That inability to communicate can set off such behaviors in toddlers . "
Their odd behavior draws unwanted attention .
Marcus walks on his tiptoes and amuses himself by dumping liquid from sippy cups and containers .
Julian counts everything aloud , over and over again .
" People are always staring and because the children do n't show any type of physical abnormality , like someone with Down syndrome would show ; people kind of assume that you 're a bad parent , " said Alexandre Moores
When the staring and critical comments become too overwhelming , Julian 's mother tells the onlookers that the children have autism .
" You 're in a situation you have to explain your kids , because you can't take the looks , " she said .
" It gets really , really hard .
No one seems to understand where you 're coming from . "

To prepare for outings , parents should bring a favorite toy or plan ahead to reduce waiting time .
But do n't avoid going out , Shulman said .
Parents should have a pat answer to say to a nasty face maker , she said .
" It should be something they feel comfortable with , about this invisible disorder .
' This is what autism looks like .
My child has disability . '
They 're not obliged to engage in conversation .
Make a statement that 's heard and move on . "
Moores said the most helpful thing the public can do is withhold the judgmental looks and reassure the parent with a smile when they encounter a child having a public meltdown .
Critical comments are " very , very painful and very depressing , " she said .
" Please try to understand parents of special children are going through living hell 24 hours a day , " she said .
" Even if you are confused and you do n't know what to do , give that parent a reassuring smile .
That 's the absolute best thing you could do . "
It 's a familiar experience for Laura Shumaker who remembered the scorn of strangers whenever her son had a public meltdown .
Autism was not well - known when her son , Matthew , now 22 , was growing up .
" When I look back , there are people who judged me , " she said .
" There were just as many that were compassionate , who could see I was trying my best . "
Four years ago , she and her son were flying home to Northern California from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
At the airport , Matthew learned they would be flying on US Airways instead of their usual United Airlines .
This greatly distressed Matthew , who started hyperventilating .
Shumaker walked to the U.S. Airway ticket counter as Matthew rocked behind her nervously , mumbling , " United is friendly .
US
Air is not . "

Under her breath , Shumaker whispered to the ticketing agent that Matthew had autism .
Then in a louder voice , she said , " We 'd just like to trade these in for United tickets , " and winked .
The agent paused for a moment , glanced at Matthew and said : " Oh !
Well , do n't worry , because US Air and United are the same now ... really .
We merged .
We 're the same airline now . "
Strangers in line chimed in .
" That 's right , " said a man standing behind them in line .
" And the skies are still friendly . "
Hearing those reassurances , Matthew stopped hyperventilating and began breathing normally .
Before leaving for the US Airways gate , Shumaker hugged the ticketing agent in gratitude .
Read Shumaker 's iReport submission .
" So many children are diagnosed , there is an awareness now , " she said .
But it 's still difficult to explain to others , Shumaker said , when Matthew comments at the supermarket that a person standing in front of them at the check - out line is too fat to buy ice cream .

Building at home and abroad
I was struck by Louis Uchitelle ’s article in the Sunday NY Times on the dearth of big public works projects here in the United States .
“ For the first time in memory , the nation has no outsize public works project under way , ” he says , and then reports that :
Some economists argue that the continual construction of new megaprojects adds a quarter of a percentage point or more , on average , to the gross domestic product over the long term .
Again , cause and effect are n’t clear , but the strongest periods of economic growth in America have generally coincided with big outlays for new public works and the transformations they bring once completed . ”
One might add that we are n’t spending enough to maintain our existing public infrastructure , and state and local governments across the country are facing deep budget deficits ( and in some cases , a very real risk of bankruptcy ) .
But it ’s not as though the United States has n’t started some big public works projects over the past decade or so ; it just has n’t been doing them here at home .
We ’ve spent billions constructing military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan , for example , and another billion or more on a giant embassy in Baghdad and another one in Pakistan .
Needless to say , those “ public works ” projects are a drain on the U.S. economy rather than a source of additional productivity .
As I ’ve said before , Americans have come to believe that spending government revenues on U.S. citizens here at home is usually a bad thing and should be viewed with suspicion , but spending billions on vast social engineering projects overseas is the hallmark of patriotism and should never be questioned .
This position makes no sense , but it is hard to think of a prominent U.S. leader who is making an explicit case for doing somewhat less abroad so that we can afford to build a better future here at home .
Debates about foreign policy , grand strategy , and military engagement — including the current debate over Obama ’s decision to add another 30,000 - plus troops in Afghanistan — tend to occur in isolation from a discussion of other priorities , as if there were no tradeoffs between what we do for others and what we are able to do for Americans here at home .
And no , I ’m not suggesting a return to isolationism , a retreat to “ Fortress America ” or any of the other labels that hawks use to try to discredit those who want a more restrained foreign policy .
Rather , I ’m suggesting that national security spending should not be considered sacrosanct and that a nation ’s leaders can hurt the country just as easily by under - investing at home as by neglecting its defenses .
And given that we currently spend more on national security than the rest of the world put together , have several thousand nuclear weapons , face no great power rivals , and do n’t have any serious enemies nearby , it ’s kind of hard to argue that we ’re “ neglecting ” our defenses .
We are using them unwisely ( see under : Iraq , Afghanistan ) and Obama is about to make his own contribution to this bipartisan blunder , but we ’re not exactly scrimping .

Beacon Power Corp. broke ground today on a 20 - megawatt , energy - storage facility in southeastern New York .
The Rensselaer County project , slated for completion in 2011 , would be the first in the nation to use a " flywheel " frequency regulation system to balance electricity supply and demand , according to the Tyngsboro , Mass . - based company .
The $ 69 million facility would store electricity as kinetic energy in a matrix of massive discs when grid supply outstrips demand .
The ability to move power in and out of the system and maintain proper electricity frequency -- about 60 cycles per second -- will make the nation 's electricity grid " smarter , " Beacon President and CEO Bill Capp contended in a written statement .
" Our flywheel systems provide an essential grid- stabilizing service , and they do it faster and much more efficiently than today 's conventional methods , most of which consume fossil fuel and produce harmful [ carbon dioxide ] greenhouse gas emissions , " he added .
In July , the Department of Energy conditionally approved a $ 43 million federal loan for Beacon 's project .
DOE has not issued final approval of the loan guarantee but aims to do soon , a department spokeswoman said today .
In August , Beacon applied for two grants , totaling up to $ 46.7 million , under DOE 's Smart Grid Demonstration program .
If approved , each grant would fund up to 50 percent of the cost of Beacon 's second and third 20 - megawatt plants , the company noted in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
Company officials did not return phone calls or e-mails seeking comment for this article .
A recent report by GTM Research projects that " power oriented " energy storage -- used mainly to regulate short - term changes to grid frequency -- will grow quickly in the near term but will be constrained in the long term by a limited market .
Conversely , " energy oriented " storage -- in which energy use is shifted to other times of the day -- has a massive total market size and is only beginning to emerge .

Goldman is trying to diffuse the increasingly harsh light being turned on its dubious practices in the collateralized debt obligation market , with the wattage turned up considerably last week by a story in the New York Times that described how a synthetic CDO program called Abacus was the means by which Goldman famously went “ net short ” subprime .
We ’ve mentioned Abacus repeatedly because AIG wrote guarantees on at least some of the Abacus trades .
One of the things that has been frustrating in watching this debate is the peculiar propensity of quite a few observers to defend Goldman and its brethren , and to argue , effectively , caveat emptor .
Contrary to the fantasies of libertarians , that is not in fact how markets , particularly securities markets , operate .
In virtually every market in the world , when someone represents his wares as being sound and safe and they turn out to be “ bad ” and dangerous , the seller is considered to have some responsibility for the damage .
Remember those Pintos that turned into fireballs when rear - ended ?
The pets that died from pet food laced with melamine from China ?
No one suggested that the buyers of those products were at fault .
I ’m deliberately using extreme examples , but as we proceed , you will see they are not unreasonable .
Those products did not fail by design ( well , the faults of the Pinto were known and left uncorrected ) .
By contrast , Goldman wanted its Abacus trades to fail .
That was the most profitable course of action for them ( note the Times clearly states that that was the role of the Abacus trades and Goldman has not disputed that claim ) .
They were net short , this was no mere hedge of a long position but a trading bet .
And those CDOs did turn out to be big turkeys .
If you sell a stock when have inside , non public information that the company was in serious trouble without disclosing this information – you are likely to be held accountable .
If you sell a manufactured product and it causes harm , you might be held liable regardless of whether you knew it was faulty ( strict liability ) .
In fact , if sellers were not held responsible for product quality to some degree , commerce would become impractical .
In a pure “ buyer beware ” , dog - eat - dog world , every transaction would require extensive and prohibitively costly due diligence .
Now let us turn to the CDO market ( and by “ CDO ” we mean “ ABS CDO ” or “ asset backed security CDO ; there are other types ) , where buyers ( contrary to uninformed views otherwise ) DID routinely perform extensive due diligence , and nevertheless , lemming - like , went to slaughter .
It was n’t just the investors or the now - derided guarantors ; many banks wound up with lots of CDOs on their balance sheets ( for not very good reasons , but that is beyond the scope of this post ) .
But then we have the famed short sellers who used synthetic CDOs as their means for getting short .
With a synthetic CDO , no one puts up cash .
It is a little corporate entity .
The asset side is various credit default swaps , in this case , “ referencing ” mainly subprime bonds , the BBB tranches .
So the cash flow comes from the premium payments on these CDS .
The liability side is tranched , so you have an equity tranche , BBB , A , AA , and a junior AAA layers , then say two more AAA layers and the infamous super senior tranche ( there could be more tranches than this , but you get the general idea ) .
But the investors do not make cash payments ; they are effectively protection sellers , or insurers .
But it is important to note that is not how the deals were hawked ; they were presented as a convenient , faster - to - launch alternative to the old - fashioned cash CDO .
( This may seem like a distinction without a difference , but as you will see soon , it matters ) .
Now let us turn to Goldman .
The New York Times last week published a story that discussed how a Goldman synthetic CDO program ( series of deals ) called Abacus .
Goldman was not merely the structurer of these deals ; unbeknownst to its investors , it was usually the ONLY protection buyer in these deals ; it occasionally let some favored hedge funds participate in a minor way on the short side .
In other words , the sole purpose of these deals was for Goldman to put on a short position .
Goldman issued a disingenuous defense on its website .
It is n’t long , but let ’s look at the key sections :
Synthetic CDOs were an established product for corporate credit risk as early as 2002 .
With the introduction of credit default swaps referencing mortgage products in 2004 - 2005 , it is not surprising that market participants would consider synthetic CDOs in the context of mortgages .
Although precise tallies of synthetic CDO issuance are not readily available , many observers would agree the market size was in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
Many of the synthetic CDOs arranged were the result of demand from investing clients seeking long exposure .
Synthetic CDOs were popular with many investors prior to the financial crisis because they gave investors the ability to work with banks to design tailored securities which met their particular criteria , whether it be ratings , leverage or other aspects of the transaction .
Yves here .
This is all background , but notice that “ synthetic CDO ” includes synthetic collateralized loan obligations .
In fact , if you had said “ synthetic CDO ” prior to the recent focus on synthetic ABS CDOs , most Wall Street types would have assumed you meant synthetic CLOs .
It was a longer established , bigger , and less complex product .
CLOs are tranched products made from leveraged corporate loans .
As an aside , this bit is simply precious : “… it is not surprising that market participants would consider synthetic CDOs in the context of mortgages . ”
Ahem .
Goldman pushed the ISDA protocol that made synthetic CDOs possible , and along with Deutsche , launched the first deals .
And who were these “ market participants ” who were so keen to get synthetic CDOs done ?
Not the long investors , but none other than John Paulson , the famed subprime short .
To pretend that the growth of subprime ABS CDOs was driven by the long side is a misrepresentation .
It was the shorts that pushed the development of this product .
As we stressed in a recent post , the bulk of the value of a deal was in the AAA tranches , which for ABS CDOs represented 70 % to 90 % of the total value .
They did not drive the structure of the deal ; it was well cooked by then and they had influence over certain parameters .
As someone who did package CDOs told us :
They [ the AAA investors ] usually could n’t see the big picture ( e.g. they were getting long massive amounts of risk ) , yet they were keen to nitpick over documentation .
On managed transactions they usually did n’t have the right to DK individual collateral items , but they could ( and often did ) negotiate deal parameters ( e.g. max AA CDO bucket , max synthetic bucket , reporting , controlling class provisions , etc. )
I would say that they were brought into the deal around mid-way , once the manager and majority of the equity was locked down .
The banker / structurer had to be the arbitrator between equity , monoline , the rating agencies , and their own P&L from the structuring fee & warehouse carry .
In other words , the AAA investors were not equal parties in negotiating , despite their economic weight ; many parameters were largely set before they were brought in .
The main drivers in the structuring were the equity investors , the monoline , the rating agencies , and the bank ’s own economics .
Goldman , of course , protests that everyone is a grown - up , and perfectly capable of taking care of themselves :
The buyers of synthetic mortgage CDOs were large , sophisticated investors .
These investors had significant in - house research staff to analyze portfolios and structures and to suggest modifications .
They did not rely upon the issuing banks in making their investment decisions .
Yves here .
I find this “ sophisticated investor ” bit very amusing .
Just because an investor might be “ sophisticated ” by securities law standards does not mean he is highly skilled as far as ABS CDOs are concerned .
People who were in that business have consistently said that very few people are competent in the product .
One estimated 1000 , another even fewer .
This is in the world , mind you .
No matter how you cut and slice it , this is far fewer than were dealing in the product .
This is no surprise to me ; I did work in the early days of OTC derivatives , and it was widely known then that the number of people who understood the products was a small fraction of the population selling and buying them .
So we ’ve had nearly 20 years of it being completely acceptable , even normal , for “ sophisticated ” investors to dabble in instruments that they were at least a bit , maybe a lot , beyond their ken .
As an aside , that was not for dint of trying to become more knowledgeable .
In CDO - land , one of the dirty tricks the dealers played was model arbitrage .
The customers were given models for assessing the deals that were less sophisticated than the ones used by the packagers / underwriters .
So let ’s go to the next bit of Goldman self - defense :
For static synthetic CDOs , reference portfolios were fully disclosed .
Therefore , potential buyers could simply decide not to participate if they did not like some or all the securities referenced in a particular portfolio .
Yves here .
Hard to know for certain , but my impression is this is largely irrelevant .
Many , if not most , deals were managed , meaning they were effectively blind pools .
In those cases , the parameters would be specified , and the equity investor would have a veto on particular assets .
And the AAA investors could nix certain categories ( say no option ARMs or CMBS ) but not particular bonds .
And even if the portfolios were specified , how realistic was it to assume they could be evaluated ?
The CDOs were composed mainly of trances of subprime RMBS , the BBB tranche in “ mezz ” CDOs .
A typical subprime bond issue contained 5000 mortgages .
I honestly do not know how many bonds would be in a CDO , but it was obviously more than 100 .
100 RMBS tranches means 500,000 mortgages .
In the early days of the crisis , bottom fishers tried looking at CDOs and for the most part gave up on systematic evaluation .
It would take too long and cost too much money to assess the value due to the complexity .
Those factors were no less operative when the CDO was being launched .
In other words , one could argue that the long investors , particularly the AAA investors , who were earning not - sexy spreads , would find it uneconomic to do old - fashioned , granular credit analysis .
That is n’t to say they did n’t stress test them ; in fact the monolines modeled them assuming six to eight grade downgrades , which was considered catastrophic for AAA paper .
It never occurred to anyone that AAA paper could go to CCC .
Why ?
That had simply NEVER happened before , in the absence of massive fraud ….. until it happened on a very large scale , with CDOs .
But what were the economics to the shorts ?
Aha , if you are buying at 140 basis points , and you in the end close out your position at 10,000 ( which happened in some cases ) you have vastly more upside than the long side .
That means you can afford to do much more due diligence , or if you are Goldman or someone packaging a synthetic CDO to suit your needs , you can afford to do the work to devise something that suits you well but will not be obviously toxic to those on the other side of the trade .
This is the part the defenders of Goldman , Deutsche , and others are missing .
Heretofore , the packagers had been … packagers .
They had product in their warehouses from mortgage originators that they were putting into deals .
Just as in traditional underwritings , they were assumed to be balancing the needs of the issuer against those of the buyer .
It is more than a bit disingenous for Goldman to protest the everyone knew it could be on the other side of the trade :
It is fully disclosed and well known to investors that banks that arranged synthetic CDOs took the initial short position and that these positions could either have been applied as hedges against other risk positions or covered via trades with other investors .
Yves here .
Please .
If these deals were regulated by the SEC , Goldman ’s role in the deal would have had to be disclosed and it would have made a CONSIDERABLE difference in the pricing .
To pretend otherwise is an insult to a reader ’s intelligence .
And a lawsuit filed against Morgan Stanley suggests that synthetic CDO buyers , when an investment bank was using the deal for its own purposes , are advancing credible theories as to how they were had From Business Week ( hat tip reader Barbara ) :
Morgan Stanley was accused in a lawsuit of defrauding investors in a collateralized - debt obligation , called the Libertas CDO , by collaborating with ratings companies to place triple - A ratings on the notes .
Morgan Stanley , the sixth - biggest U.S. lender by assets , arranged the offering as it was short - selling almost the entire $ 1.2 billion worth of assets in the CDO , according to a complaint filed today in federal court in New York .
“ Morgan Stanley was betting the entire investment it was promoting would fail , ” the public employees ’ retirement system of the Virgin Islands said in the complaint .
“ The firm achieved its objective . ”
Yves here .
The fact is that pretty much every investment bank in the second half of 2007 was trying to offload its subprime exposures into CDOs .
But look at the party suing , the employees ’ retirement system of the Virgin Islands .
Do you think they have lots of fancy models and skilled experts to assess these deals ?
I ’d bet not .
And I ’d also bet that at least some of the Abacus investors were no more sophisticated than this Morgan Stanley CDO investor .
Back to the article :
“ By collaborating with major credit - rating agencies to place Triple - A ratings on the rated notes , Morgan Stanley intentionally or recklessly misled investors in the Libertas CDO , ” according to the complaint .
“ But for Morgan Stanley ’s violations of law , the rated notes never would have been issued . ”
CDOs typically repackage bonds and other assets into new securities .
The Libertas CDO did n’t buy the mortgage - backed securities , according to the complaint .
Instead , it entered into credit - default swaps that referenced mortgage - backed securities .
Credit - default swaps are financial instruments that function as insurance for bondholders .
As the credit - protection buyer , Morgan Stanley was shorting the securities , or betting they would fall in value .
“ Morgan Stanley was highly motivated to defraud investors , ” the retirement system said .
The bank also had an unfair advantage because it had access to information on the assets the investors did n’t have , according to the complaint .
The securities were riskier than the bank let on and in fact were impaired at the time Libertas was created , the retirement system said .
Yves here .
I am not a lawyer , but the idea of pursuing the investment bank for fraudulent AAA ratings could be a promising line of attack .
Now this is only one suit , but if this theory prevails , this could do considerable damage to industry balance sheets .
And right on the heels of record looting , um , 2009 bonuses .
An editorial in the New York Times today indicates that the pursuit of the CDO dead bodies could prove costly to other powerful parties :
To be thorough , investigations of these and other questions would have to reach into the Obama Treasury Department .
One of the most aggressive creators of the questionable investments was a firm called Tricadia , whose parent firm was overseen by Lewis Sachs , now a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
We might finally get some answers , as well as some good theater .
ISTANBUL , Turkey —
Iran saw its deadliest day of protests in six months and the declaration of martial law in at least one city Sunday , as hundreds of thousands of people clashed with security forces on the streets of major cities at the climax of a Shiite religious festival .
Four people were killed in incidents , including a nephew of opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi , and at least 300 arrested , according to police deputy commander Ahmad Reza Radan , being interviewed on IRIB .
One of those arrested was the son of Mustafa Moein , a prominent reformist who ran for president in 2005 .
Witnesses and opposition news sources reported that government forces had shot live gunfire into crowds of protesters during the holiest feast in Shiite Islam .
Another four people were killed in Tabriz , according to a reformist news site .
Witnesses described demonstrators constructing street barricades and fighting against security forces for the control of squares .
Unverified reports claimed that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had been transported to a military base in a helicopter from his residence in central Tehran .
“ There ’s fighting going on across the north of the city , and the number of killed is far more than the four whose death has been announced , ” said one witness who described the kind of weapons used as " Colts and a larger handgun . "
" They have been spraying people with bullets . "
The reformist Rahesabz news agency reported that officers refused to shoot into crowds as per their commanders ’ instructions and aimed at the sky instead .
One photograph showed a riot policeman in his black body armor donning a green cap and joining the ranks of protesters .
Elsewhere , protesters stripped demoralized officers of their weapons and set their motorbikes afire .
" This is an inferno that ca n’t be extinguished with just a splash of water , " said Delbar Tavakoli , an exiled journalist living in Turkey who has been watching developments from over the border .
Siavush Randjbar - Daemi , an analyst and Ph.D. candidate in contemporary Iranian history at London University , said : “ It ’s pure political suicide to kill people on Ashura , of all days .
" They become instant martyrs . "
The Internet buzzed with grainy video purporting to show demonstrators exchanging body blows with security forces , torching police motorcycles and vans , and fighting for control of key squares and overpasses in the Iranian capital .
Crowds circulated among a sea of jammed honking cars encompassing most of central Tehran , stretching from Tehran ’s Azadi Square to Baharestan .
By contrast , the miles of Tehran ’s labyrinthine bazaar were shuttered and silent for the anniversary .
Protesters adapted slogans from the 1979 Iranian Revolution , shouting “ I will kill , I will kill those who kill my brother , ” and “ This is the month of blood , the Supreme Leader is toppled . ”
Amateur footage and photographs showed crowds kicking an isolated Basiji militiaman or pelting a cornered troop of anti-riot police with stones .
Under an unidentified overpass , firefighters kept onlookers back from an overturned police van .
Witnesses reported seeing tear gas and black smoke drifting over the capital and the sound of live rounds being fired .
" We ’re getting into the final stage of the confrontation , and the ruling clique is waving all pretences of respect to faith , tradition and memory goodbye , " said Randjbar - Daemi .
" Moharram is a month of truce , so the authorities in Iran are violating everything .
It 's a regime that is feeling and smelling its own demise , ready to embark onto everything in order to avoid the sinking ship from capsizing . "
With the exception of a handful of foreign correspondents , journalists have been expelled from Iran since the disputed presidential elections in June .
In the absence of permission to hold their own rallies , Iran ’s opposition activists have piggybacked onto regime - orchestrated demonstrations to get their message out .
The death by natural causes of Grand Ayatollah Ali Montazeri last week revitalised the movement and witnessed the spread of protests to peaceful parts of the country .
Emily Boss sent along this photo of her fiancee , Paul Drappi , sporting a festive look .
She 's a lucky lady .
Anyone counting on a meaningful economic recovery will be greatly disappointed .
How do I know ?
I follow credit , and credit is contracting .
Access to credit is being denied at an accelerating pace .
Large , well - capitalized companies have no problem finding credit .
Small businesses , on the other hand , have never had a harder time getting a loan .
Since the onset of the credit crisis over two years ago , available credit to small businesses and consumers has contracted by trillions of dollars , and that phenomenon is reflected in ...

Where is NASA going next to probe our solar system ?
The space agency announced today they have selected three proposals as candidates for the agency ’s next space venture to another celestial body in our solar system .
The proposed missions would probe the atmosphere composition and crust of Venus ; return a piece of a near - Earth asteroid for analysis ; or drop a robotic lander into a basin at the moon ’s south pole to return lunar rocks back to Earth for study .
All three sound exciting !
Here are the finalists :
Surface and Atmosphere Geochemical Explorer , or SAGE , mission to Venus would release a probe to descend through the planet ’s atmosphere .
During descent , instruments would conduct extensive measurements of the atmosphere ’s composition and obtain meteorological data .
The probe then would land on the surface of Venus , where its abrading tool would expose both a weathered and a pristine surface area to measure its composition and mineralogy .
Scientists hope to understand the origin of Venus and why it is so different from Earth .
Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado in Boulder , is the principal investigator .
Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security Regolith Explorer spacecraft , called Osiris - Rex , would rendezvous and orbit a primitive asteroid .
After extensive measurements , instruments would collect more than two ounces of material from the asteriod ’s surface for return to Earth .
The returned samples would help scientists better undertand and answer long - held questions about the formation of our solar system and the origin of complex molecules necessary for life .
Michael Drake , of the University of Arizona in Tucson , is the principal investigator .
MoonRise : Lunar South Pole - Aitken Basin Sample Return Mission would place a lander in a broad basin near the moon ’s south pole and return approximately two pounds of lunar materials for study .
This region of the lunar surface is believed to harbor rocks excavated from the moon ’s mantle .
The samples would provide new insight into the early history of the Earth - moon system .
Bradley Jolliff , of Washington University in St. Louis , is the principal investigator .
The final project will be selected in mid-2011 , and for now , the three finalists will receive approximately $ 3.3 million in 2010 to conduct a 12 - month mission concept study that focuses on implementation feasibility , cost , management and technical plans .
Studies also will include plans for educational outreach and small business opportunities .
The selected mission must be ready for launch no later than Dec. 30 , 2018 .
Mission cost , excluding the launch vehicle , is limited to $ 650 million .
“ These are projects that inspire and excite young scientists , engineers and the public , ” said Ed Weiler , associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
“ These three proposals provide the best science value among eight submitted to NASA this year . ”
The final selection will become the third mission in the program .
New Horizons , launched in 2006 , will fly by the Pluto - Charon system in 2015 then target another Kuiper Belt object for study .
The second mission , called Juno , is designed to orbit Jupiter from pole to pole for the first time , conducting an in - depth study of the giant planet ’s atmosphere and interior .
It is slated for launch in August 2011 .

( CNN ) -- Russell Pate was driving through a neighborhood one late afternoon when he noticed something odd .
He could n't hear the sounds of children playing .
No jump rope patter .
No squeals of a bike 's brake .
No crack of a bat -- just silence .
The streets were deserted because the neighborhood kids were cocooned in their homes , Pate says .
It was a scene he 's seen over and over again .
" Now you can drive through entire neighborhoods where you know there are a lot of young kids there and hardly see any of them out , " says Pate , an American Heart Association spokesman .
Pate 's story reinforces what numerous medical studies say : American youths are getting less active and fatter .
Medical experts say many of these couch - bound youths are becoming coronary time bombs -- they 're more liable to suffer from heart disease as adults .
The coronary time bomb is ticking
Pate and other childhood obesity experts say more American youths are becoming obese because so many are addicted to television , video games , testing and fast food .
Obesity experts say the rise in childhood obesity is n't new .
The prevalence of overweight children and adolescents between ages 6 and 19 has tripled since 1970 , a 2007 New England Journal of Medicine study found .
" Our study suggests that more of these young adults will have heart disease when they are 35 - 50 years old , resulting in more hospitalizations , medical procedures , need for chronic medications , missed work days and shortened life expectancy , " said Kirsten Bibbins - Domingo , lead author of the study .
A study released last November at a Heart Association conference found that the neck arteries in obese and overweight children were similar to those of 45 - year - olds .
The children in the study also had " abnormal cholesterol " and were said to be at high risk for heart disease in the future .
Pate , who has testified about childhood obesity before Congress , says he can tell how American kids have changed by looking at old yearbooks .
" You see fewer overweight kids , " Pate says .
" There were some kids that were overweight in the older yearbooks , but the typical kid was leaner . "
A mother 's story
Though more kids may be overweight today , the stigma remains .
Jenice Burgos is the mother of four children , including one 7 - year - old girl , Haley , who has struggled with obesity .
Burgos says Haley , who weighs 124 pounds ( she should weigh about 70 , Burgos says ) , has been reduced to tears by classmates teasing her about her weight .
Burgos , who lives in Saline , Michigan , says her daughter 's difficulty has made her and her husband feel guilty .
" She can't eat unless I buy it , unless we make it , " Burgos says .
" Her eating pattern has been learned from us . "
Burgos is changing that pattern now .
She enrolled Haley in the University of Michigan 's MPOWER program , which uses a team of physicians , dietitians and psychologists to help obese kids .
Haley went on a diet and started taking daily water aerobics and dance class , Burgos says .
She 's lost 9 pounds in a month , her mother says .
" Today is the first day she 's been able to fit into a pair of jeans , " Burgos says .
" She was extremely happy .
She was just like , ' Mom , look .
They fit . ' "
Burgos ' advice to parents of obese kids is simple :
Though it may be easy to save time by not cooking and by giving kids only the food they want , do n't do it .
" Do n't let food become a substitute for the love and time you should give them , " she says .
A high school gym teacher tells her story
Childhood obesity experts cite another factor in the growth in childhood obesity : the declining number of physical education classes in public schools .
Lisa Summers , a physical education teacher , says many school districts nationwide have cut physical education classes in an effort to meet national academic standards .
With little encouragement from adults , many kids do n't even seem interested in exercise when she sees them in class , says Summers , who has taught physical education at Black Hills High School in Tumwater , Washington , for 14 years .
" You have video games .
You have computers -- kids are tweeting and texting , " Summer says .
" There 's a lot of technology that promotes ' seat time ' -- you just sit there . "
Summers says the average youth should get about 30 minutes of exercise daily .
But by the time she meets most teenagers in high school , Summers says , it 's difficult to get them moving .
" Man , that 's a tough task , " she says .
" We in high school look at ourselves as their last chance before they go into the adult world . "
Some school districts may think that physical education classes have little to do with academic excellence .
But being physically fit often helps students in the classroom , says Paula Keyes Kun , a spokeswoman for the National Association for Sport and Physical Education .
" The kids who exercise do better academically , " Kun says , " because after being physically active , they can go back to their classroom , get focused and pay attention to what they 've learned . "
Getting kids to go outside
Childhood obesity experts mention common solutions for reducing childhood obesity : require more physical education classes , improve the nutritional value of school meals , encourage kids to play more sports and put away the video games and cell phones .
Pate , the Heart Association spokesman , says parents can do their part by telling their kids to go outside and play .
But what about parents who are afraid to send their kids out to play ?
Pate says that statistics show that kids are safer than they 've ever been , despite the lurid headlines on cable news .
Unless parents live in an awful neighborhood , they should encourage their kids to play outside with others and take common - sense safety precautions , he says .
" I do worry that with the 24 - hour news cycle and the tendency to expose everyone to very unfortunate incidents that occur in one place , that some parents become hypersensitive to safety concerns , " he says .
Pate does n't just draw on his medical expertise to advise parents .
He cites his own life .
He grew up in upstate New York , where his family did n't own a television until he was 5 years old , he says .
" I do n't really remember what I was doing before 5 , but it was n't watching TV or surfing the Internet , " he says .
" Staying inside was not very interesting . "
Pate 's kept his active lifestyle as an adult .
He 's 62 now , but he 's never abandoned his desire to keep moving .
He has run in three U.S. Olympic Trials marathons and in the Boston Marathon .
But when he drives through America 's silent communities now , he does n't see many kids running .
He 's sorry that more kids do n't live the life he once did .
" I really do think the norm was that kids came home from school at 3 p.m. and the mom said , ' Get out of here and be home for dinner , ' '' he says .
" There were a lot of good reasons for that norm . "
أينما حل وارتحل مارسيلو بيلسا فأنه يحد ث نوعا من التأثير غير العادي في أي مدينة يحل بها، تابعت العديد من المدربين في تنقلاتهم لكن ما يحدث مع بيلسا هو أمر غير اعتيادي وأمر غير طبيعي .
Because this initiative was the first of its kind , the goal in Ede was to see whether such a project was even practical .
The untested nature of the project meant the organizers prepared as meticulously as possible .
The undercover patients developed their fictive biographies in months of meetings with an acting coach and a psychotherapist .
“ Ronald , ” for example , was a middle - aged man with a history of aggression problems , and after a supposed suicide attempt he was taken to De Riethorst by an actor playing his brother .
To make their stories believable , the patients memorized details about where their children went to school or which supermarket they shopped at , and the psychotherapist advised them on how to present their given mental illness convincingly .
To ensure their safety , the fake patients checked in via text message every three hours , and they carried letters identifying them as plants .
A code word ( “ fireplace ” ) was in place if they had to communicate genuine distress to visitors .
The visitors wore hidden cameras and microphones ; the undercover patients did not .
The warning to the staff about the undercover patients made the project more amenable to Martien Opdam , a psychiatric nurse at De Riethorst who worked while the plants were there .
Though he and his colleagues did wonder who the plants might be , he said : “ You ca n’t keep doing that for two months .
You go back to your routine . ”
He said the experience was helpful .
“ It taught me not to go too much on autopilot , ” he said .
Among the findings of the project were that patients frequently found it difficult to get information on their treatment and medications and that the sound of a staff member ’s key chain jangling could be jarring to an already anxious patient .
Malingering one ’s way into a psychiatric ward to report on conditions within has been a journalistic staple since as far back as 1887 , when Nellie Bly got herself admitted to the insane asylum on Blackwells Island ( now Roosevelt Island ) in New York City .
Similar endeavors have been the subject of many books and television documentaries over the years .
The best - known scientific example remains the experiments by David Rosenhan , a psychologist .
He and seven other “ pseudopatients ” got themselves admitted to a dozen hospitals by pretending to hear voices , and the study , published in Science magazine in 1973 as “ On Being Sane in Insane Places , ” is still widely seen as a critique of psychiatric diagnosis .
Dear Cecil :
What 's the straight dope on truth serums ?
What are they ?
What exactly do they do ?
Do sodium pentothal and the like really make witnesses spill their guts ?
If so , why do n't we use it for courtrooms and police interrogations ?
Please hurry , my suspect is wrestling his way out of the handcuffs .
J.F .
Cecil replies :
Truth serums are based on a phenomenon known since ancient times , when Pliny the Elder coined the phrase in vino veritas : “ in wine , truth . ”
He meant anything that lowers your inhibitions is likely to cause you to say things you ’d normally keep secret .
Unfortunately for cops and CIA interrogators , what you spill is n’t necessarily the truth .
Although people have been plying one another with liquor for centuries , the earliest confession induced using something stronger was reported in a 1903 criminal case involving a New York cop .
He admitted under ether that he ’d faked insanity when accused of killing his wife .
The first drug to catch on in a big way as a truth serum was scopolamine , a depressant and sleeping agent .
Mixed with morphine , it was used to put women in labor into a “ twilight sleep ” so they ’d forget the pain .
To gauge the dose , the doctor would ask the patient questions until she could no longer remember anything .
The pioneer of truth serum research , a small - town Texas obstetrician named Robert House , claimed his patients always answered truthfully during these times , and from this concluded the drug rendered them unable to lie .
In 1922 he tried the technique on two prisoners in a Dallas jail , helping to exonerate both .
The age of truth serum investigation , also called narcoanalysis , had been born .
Although truth serum caught the fancy of reporters and some scientists , it was never widely accepted as a way of extracting criminal confessions .
Several sensational early cases produced a variety of results .
In 1924 , five black men in Birmingham , Alabama , reportedly confessed under the influence of an unspecified truth serum to eight ax murders , then confirmed their guilt after the drug had worn off .
( This comes from a four - paragraph account in the New York Times ; I admit to some skepticism . )
A few years later a chauffeur in Hawaii confessed under scopolamine to writing the note in a kidnap - murder case but repudiated his statement afterward ; ultimately the crime was pinned on someone else .
By the mid-1930s , scopolamine had been largely abandoned in favor of safer drugs such as sodium amytal and sodium thiopental ( of which Pentothal is a brand name ) .
But the theory stayed the same : once you ’re in a trance and have thus lost the complex brain functions needed to sustain a lie , you ’re reduced to telling the truth .
Drugs were also said to be helpful in dredging up lost memories .
Sometimes they probably were .
The problem with truth serums is the results ca n’t be depended on .
It ’s easy to find case reports of people recounting detailed stories under the influence of drugs of which they have no recollection afterward — and the stories check out .
But researchers also admit despairingly that they know of just as many confessions that were demonstrably false .
Drugs reduce some subjects to unintelligible babbling .
Other subjects are suggestible and will tell you whatever they think you want to hear .
Plus , just because somebody thinks something is true does n’t mean it is .
But hope lives on in the shadowy corners of government .
During World War II , the Office of Strategic Services , forerunner to the CIA , tried using cannabis extract to make people talk .
Later generations of spies wondered whether they could get results with mescaline and LSD .
In the 1950s the CIA launched a covert research program called MK - Ultra to explore the possibilities of truth serums and behavior - modification drugs ; it ’s said to have run at least through the late 60s .
The project gained notoriety after one participant jumped out a hotel window while on LSD .
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that confessions obtained using drugs are inadmissible as evidence , on the premise that the practice violates the constitutional protection against self - incrimination .
The European Court of Human Rights has likewise prohibited the practice .
Nonetheless , drugs continue to be used to extract confessions in some parts of the world .
Police in India reportedly used drugs to convince two suspects to confess to a series of grisly killings in 2007 .
After 9/11 , some in the U.S. argued that truth serum ought to be used to extract information from terrorism suspects .
Nothing so far suggests American authorities tried it , although if they did n’t I do n’t imagine it was out of an excess of scruples .
The more persuasive argument in these nervous times is likely to have been a practical one .
Let ’s say out of 100 bits of data forcibly extracted using drugs or other means , five are legitimate .
How do you know which five ?

The way that title is worded , you 'd think this would be another of those " it 's not that bad ! " stories .
You 'd be wrong .
Rather , this is just to show exactly how bad the Flyers offense has been this year in comparison to last year .
The team statistics are obvious - they are n't scoring , their power play is n't clicking , and they are n't winning the even - strength battle .
Now , this is another stat heavy , table - filled post .
But this time I kept the numbers simple .
I 'm looking purely at qualcomp , qualteam , goals per 60 minutes , and points per 60 minutes .
Since it 's tough to compare this season to last due to the number of games played , the rating stats are a lot easier to use .
Is it perfect ?
No .
But it shows you how drastic the drop off has been .
The good news ?
Our defenseman seem to be scoring more this year than last year .
The bad news ?
Everything else .
After the jump , tables and analysis .
I 'll start by first spewing out the team statistics .
This year 's team ( again , this is just a look at the offense ) is scoring 2.66 goals per game , good for 20th in the league .
Their 5 - on - 5 goals for / against ratio is 0.96 , good for 17th in the league .
With the man advantage , they 're converting 20.7 % of their opportunities , good for 10th in the league .
All of this while putting 31.8 shots per game on target , 7th most in the league .
How does that compare to last year ?
The team scored 3.17 goals per game , good for 4th in the league .
They had a 5 - on - 5 ratio of 1.01 , 14th in the league .
Their power play was successful 22.5 % of the time , 6th best in the league , and they fired 29.8 shots per game on target , 14th in the league .
So , on the team level , they 're getting two additional shots on goal , but more than half of a goal less .
They 're losing the 5 - on - 5 battle after barely winning it last year , and their power play has dropped from one of the best to above average .
Certainly , you already knew this : lots of shots ( most of them easy ) , not a lot of goals , poor defensive play , and a much worse power play .
But when you look at this on an individual level , you begin to see the problem .

This is the data for this year , sorted by goals per 60 .
There are a number of things wrong with that .
First , I found that Gagne actually has scored 0.3 goals per 60 minutes ( one goal in 198 minutes , feel free to correct my math ) rather than 0 .
However , that still ranks him below Mika Pyorala .
Now , here 's how those same numbers look from last year .

Important things to see here , bullet point style :
Last year , the team had 5 players who averaged at least one goal per 60 minutes of ice time .
This year , only Darroll Powe , David Laliberte , and Danny Briere have accomplished that .
Along the same lines , the team had 6 players who averaged at least two points per 60 minutes of play last year .
This year , only David Laliberte is doing that .
Only 4 players are averaging at least 1.75 points per 60 ; Powe , Laliberte , Briere , and Jonathon Kalinski .
Considering only Briere has played 20 games , the team is only seeing Danny Briere produce so far this year .
Jeff Carter is obviously having a down year in comparison to last year .
But the fact that he 's scoring one fewer point per game and nearly half as many goals per game as last year , is worse than even I expected .
With that said , Carter is facing stiffer competition with worse teammates .
Couple that with his steep drop in production , and you see why he 's been such a disappointment so far this year .
The flip side of Carter though , is Briere .
He 's also playing against tougher competition with worse teammates , yet his drop in goals ( 1.23 to 1.12 ) is manageable , especially compared with Carter 's ( 1.4 to 0.75 ) .
And for some reason I still do n't think this will stop people from hating Briere .
Since Carter and Briere have been playing together for a large part of this season , it 's no surprise that Scott Hartnell has also seen a drop in his qualteam rating while his qualcomp number went up .
But when you look at how similar his competition has been , his severe drop in scoring is even more drastic .
His goals per 60 fell from 1.26 last year to just 0.4 this year .
And he actually played more last year than he has so far this year .
last year than he has so far this year .
As mentioned above , the defense has actually upped their production from last year .
Matt Carle has gone from 0.79 points per 60 to 0.97 .
Braydon Coburn from 0.53 to 0.77 ; Kimmo Timonen from 0.69 to 0.79 ; and Chris Pronger from 0.62 in Anaheim to 1.06 .
Only Ryan Parent has seen a drop in scoring ( 0.51 to 0.38 ) , but he 's also seen his goals against per 60 shrink from 2.96 to 1.9 .
We can certainly see the problems this team has - and defense is certainly one of them - but the lack of scoring is not the fault of the blueline .
As much as Claude Giroux has impressed this year - he's one of the few who are noticeably playing every night - his drop - off is still steep .
He 's obviously one who likes to set up goals rather than score them , so his goals / 60 falling from 0.8 to 0.56 is n't what is alarming .
Instead , it 's his points per 60 ( 2.39 to 1.27 ) and his primary assists per 60 ( 0.91 to 0.56 ) that are the most troubling .
Everyone noticed how he was n't scoring much this year ( 7 goals in 35 games ) , but he 's also failing to get the assists .
Mike Richards is one of the few who have seen his goal scoring rate increase ( modestly , from 0.7 to 0.74 ) , but his primary assists have plummeted from 0.97 to 0.25 .
Having only a quarter as many set ups per game from a huge part of your offense is yet another troubling development .
If you are someone who thinks James van Riemsdyk was supposed to " replace " Mike Knuble ( or Joffrey Lupul for that matter ) in the offense , I 'm sure you 're a bit disappointed - especially with his play of late .
However , JVR is scoring 2.2 points per 60 minutes of ice time , higher than both Knuble and Lupul last year ( 1.47 and 2.03 respectively ) .
The problem arises when you look at his goals / 60 , which at 0.68 is much lower than both Knuble ( 0.91 ) and Lupul ( 1.13 ) .
Either way , van Riemsdyk 's numbers continue to impress , despite his largely invisible play of late .
Lastly , for you Randy Jones lovers out there , his offensive contributions from last year ( 4 goals and 4 assists in 47 games due to injury ) may not be offset this year , but Oskars Bartulis comes close .
Through 21 games , Bartulis only has 3 assists .
However , he 's producing at 0.46 points per 60 , just ahead of Jones ' 0.45 .
Plus , Jones failed to register a primary assist all of last year .
Obviously , there 's a lot of information there .
And mostly , all of that could be seen just from watching the games .
However , when you look at just how bad the Flyers are doing compared to last year , it still amazes you .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - AT&T
Inc workers are suing the telephone operator for an estimated $ 1 billion in overtime payments in two class action lawsuits that say it is wrongly depriving about 5,000 employees of overtime pay .
The lawsuits say that a company - wide policy exempting first - level managers from overtime pay was a violation of federal labor laws and California state laws , according to Sanford Wittels & Heisler , the law firm filing the case .
AT&T , which employs about 290,000 people and is expected to generate $ 123 billion in revenue this year , declined to comment on the cases directly but said that it complies with all federal and state wage laws .
One of the cases filed in Atlanta in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia says first - level managers are the lowest in a seven - tier management hierarchy at AT&T and have only minimal supervisory roles .
But for the last few years these workers from nine former BellSouth operating states have been asked to work more than the regular 40 - hour week , and up to 100 extra hours in some cases , without any overtime pay , according to the case .
Steven Wittels , a partner in the firm , said that under federal and state laws workers need to have clear managerial responsibilities in order to be exempt from overtime pay .
“ If you call somebody a duck and it does n’t quack , it does n’t swim and it does n’t have wings , it ai n’t a duck , ” he said , adding that BellSouth used to pay the same workers overtime until a policy change in 2007 .
His firm has already succeeded in gaining class action certification for workers in a similar suit filed in a Connecticut subsidiary of AT&T Southern New England Telephone Company , according to Wittels .
One of the lawsuits , related to employees of the former BellSouth , was filed in court in Atlanta on Wednesday and another , related to former Pacific Bell employees , was filed in San Francisco .
AT&T bought BellSouth at the end of 2006 after Pacific Bell became part of AT&T in 2005 .

It is very common to ask the following question …
Democracy Now's Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzales had a really terrific interview today with Eliot Spitzer on why Bernie Sanders is right and Ben Bernanke should not be confirmed for another term as Federal Reserve Chairman and that Tim Geithner should be replaced as Treasury Secretary .
One question Amy Goodman asked I found particularly interesting was this one along with Spitzer 's answer :
AMY GOODMAN : Do you think you were partly taken down by the very entities you were going after ?
ELIOT SPITZER : I have been very careful in saying that I resigned because of what I did .
And I have no doubt that there were many people whom I had — was on the — were opposed to me , very powerful forces , who were happy to see me go .
Whether they participated , I ’ll let others figure that out .
I resigned because of what I did .
And whatever they ’re involved in does n’t excuse what I did .
I 'm sure a lot of others like myself were left wondering after the prostitution scandal broke if Spitzer was set up .
He did n't say no .
Full transcript available here .
The interview is way too long to put on our servers , but way too good not to share all of it , so I 'm using their embed player .
Florida Gators starting defensive end Carlos Dunlap was arrested and charged with driving under the influence early Tuesday morning in Gainesville .
Florida coach Urban Meyer announced after practice Tuesday evening that Dunlap has been suspended indefinitely from the team and will not play for the No. 1 Gators against No. 2 Alabama for the SEC Championship on Saturday in Atlanta 's Georgia Dome .
Meyer says he is " stunned " by Dunlap 's actions .
" Carlos obviously made a very poor decision , " Meyer said .
" I have not spoke to him or his family yet .
He 's not going to play .
But I want to visit with him and his family first and go from there . "
Meyer acknowledged that the situation was a distraction as his team prepares for a matchup that has national championship implications .
But he also said his players might be able to overcome it , much like they did flulike symptoms and linebacker Brandon Spikes ' suspension for dirty play .
" We 've had distraction after distraction , " Meyer said .
" This is a rather serious one , obviously , so it is a distraction .
Sometimes this team 's found ways to get a little tighter in distractions .
We 've had a few of them this year . "
Dunlap , a junior from North Charleston , S.C. , was arrested at 3:25 a.m. near campus and was booked into the jail at 5:52 a.m. , Gainesville Police Department spokesman Lt. Keith Kameg said .
He was released on his own recognizance about six hours later during his initial appearance at the Alachua County Jail .
Judge Mary Day Coker admonished Dunlap for underage drinking , and said he cannot possess alcohol , illegal drugs or prescription drugs that are not prescribed for him .
He was told not to drive a motor vehicle without a license , and if caught driving without a license , he would violate the terms of his release .
The judge released Dunlap without bond because he has no prior adjudications and no failures to appear in court .
Wearing a jail - issued , green - and - white striped jumpsuit , Dunlap spoke softly when asked questions and always replied " Yes , ma'am , " to the judge .
Mexico is one of the world 's geopolitical disasters waiting to happen .
There 's a brutal , costly and ineffective war on drug cartels ; big government deficits ( debt is nearly 40 % of GDP ) ; and less and less oil ( Mexico could be a major energy importer within 10 years ) .
Peter Zeihan , VP of Strategic Analysis at Stratfor , a global intelligence company , recently put the looming oil crisis this way to us : " What happens when all of a sudden its primary source of income disappears ?
Mexico is flirting with failed state status now . "
Dire stuff .
But two unlikely silver linings to Mexico 's financial crisis may help turn the country around .
Stratfor summarizes :
Standard & Poor ’s on Dec. 14 cut Mexico ’s credit rating to BBB , the second - lowest investment grade .
Faced with declining oil profits and an increased budget deficit , Mexico will be at risk of underinvestment in the years to come , which may force the government to ramp up borrowing .
This is not an unfamiliar situation for Mexico : Capital shortages are built into its geography .
However , there are two possible silver linings for the Mexican economy : the weakening peso and the drug trade .
How does that work ?
First , the weakening peso may have a positive effect on trade and may dampen negative effects of declining remittances .
Again , Stratfor :
Despite the decline in the value of the peso — 17 percent since January 2008 — the depreciation is not really a problem for Mexico compared to past bouts of peso devaluation .
This time around , Mexico ’s government debt is a relatively manageable 39.3 percent of GDP .
Private sector debt is at 30.9 percent of GDP , but it is mostly peso - denominated , with only around 30 percent of all private sector debt denominated in foreign currency ...
The peso ’s loss in value , therefore , will not have a devastating effect on the economy due to sudden appreciation of foreign currency loans that were denominated in U.S. dollars .
--
Furthermore , peso depreciation helps with two other key economic factors for Mexico : remittances and exports ...
Even though fewer U.S. dollars are going back to Mexico in absolute terms , they have a greater purchasing power .
Also , an influx of money from Mexico ’s lucrative drug trade into local banks may have helped them weather the worst of the recession .
Stratfor : Ironically , the solution to Mexico ’s revenue problem may be the drug trade .
Trafficking in drugs brings
Mexico ’s drug cartels more than $ 40 billion of estimated annual revenue .
That is equivalent to around 5 percent of Mexico ’s GDP and is double what Mexican migrants send back as remittances .
Most importantly , it constitutes an indigenously produced source of foreign capital , a boon that every emerging / developing economy would want access to .
This capital has to go somewhere : the mattress of a local sicario ( essentially cartel enforcers ) , investments in the entertainment and tourism industry or offshore bank accounts .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
" For years , we have been using laser cooling to trap and manipulate atoms , " David DeMille tells PhysOrg.com .
" This has been very useful for both basic science and many applications .
Recently there has been great interest in cooling and trapping molecules as well .
Their rich internal structure makes molecules useful for a wide range of new experiments and possible applications . "
Of course , the complexity that makes molecules interesting also makes them more difficult to manipulate than atoms .
Using lasers to cool molecules , therefore , comes with its own set of problems .
DeMille , a scientist at Yale University , believes that a solution may have been found .
He has been working with Yale colleagues Edward Shuman , John Barry and David Glenn to come up with a viable method of laser cooling for molecules .
Their ideas and preliminary experimental results on the subject can be found in Physical Review Letters : “ Radiative Force from Optical Cycling on a Diatomic Molecule . ”
“ Arguably the most difficult part of cooling molecules is trying to apply a force that opposes the molecule ’s velocity .
For atoms , this is accomplished using the Doppler effect .
A moving atom sees incident light at a Doppler - shifted frequency .
By the appropriate choice of laser frequency , you can ensure that the atom preferentially absorbs photons opposing its motion . ”
DeMille says .
“ The atom receives a small kick along the laser beam from each photon it absorbs , then emits its own photon in a random direction .
This cycle returns the atom to its original state , but on average it has been slowed down a little .
Do this some tens of thousands of times , and you can slow an atom enough for it to be trapped and manipulated . ”

With molecules , though , things become tricky .
The emission of a photon typically sets a molecule to rotating or vibrating .
“ They do n’t return to the same state they started in , ” DeMille explains .
“ The frequency of the laser is no longer correct for its photons to be absorbed by the molecules . ”
In order to get around this problem , the team at Yale built on a couple of different ideas .
He says that Michael di Rosa of Los Alamos National Laboratory pointed out several years ago that certain molecules were not likely to begin vibrating , so that they could be used .
However , di Rosa ’s scheme would take at least six different lasers working at the same time such that the rotating ( and occasionally vibrating ) molecules would all absorb photons .
A recent idea came from Jun Ye ’s group at JILA , who pointed out that some classes of molecules could avoid vibration and rotation , but in these molecules the time needed to complete an absorption - emission cycle would be so long that slowing and cooling would be inefficient .
“ We took elements of these two ideas , ” DeMille says , “ and combined them .
We looked at situations where you could have the best of both schemes and picked what should be the easiest case . ”
Using strontium monofluoride , the team at Yale was able to experimentally demonstrate a scheme for optical cycling in this diatomic molecule using two diode lasers , which are common and inexpensive .
“ We deflected a beam of molecules using a large number of photon kicks from the laser , which is an important step toward laser cooling . ”
Based on these results , lasercooling of strontium monofluoride should be within reach .
“ We suggest that by adding one more of these simple diode lasers , we should be able to take it the next level and actually cool the molecules .
Our calculations show it should work , and we are in the process of experimenting with it now . ”

When it comes to curious kids with technically adept mates , or desperately secretive pedophiles trading their nasties , the internet filter will be nothing but a minor inconvenience .
“ Our pilot , and the experience of ISPs in many Western democracies , shows that ISP - level filtering of a defined list of URLs can be delivered with 100 % accuracy , ” Senator Stephen Conroy said yesterday when announcing that mandatory internet censorship — sorry , “ filtering ” — is going ahead .
“ It also demonstrated that it can be done with negligible impact on internet speed . ”
Conroy is right on both counts , as it happens — provided you gloss over that reference to “ many ” unnamed democracies .
I would n’t call a dozen countries with ISP - level filtering “ many ” , and in some of them filtering is n’t mandatory .
And provided you restrict your aims precisely to those carefully worded factoids cherry - picked from Enex TestLab ’s trial report .
And provided you never make a mistake .
Blocking a defined list of URLs [ specific web addresses ] such as the ACMA blacklist of Refused Classification material , even 100 % of it , falls far short of “ protecting ” children from “ inappropriate ” material , to use the wording of Labor ’s original cyber - safety policy .
Google ’s index passed a trillion web pages a year and a half ago .
ACMA ’s manually compiled blacklist of a thousand - odd URLs reported by concerned citizens is a token drop in that ocean , a mere 0.0000001 % .
ACMA told Senate Estimates that of the 1175 URLs on their blacklist on September 30 , 54 % were Refused Classification material , and only 33 % of those related to child sexual abuse .
The rest of the blacklist ?
41 % was X18 + material , and 5 % was R18 + material without a “ restricted access system ” to prevent access by minors .

The same key problems with a filter - based approach , which Crikey has reported many times before , are confirmed by the Enex report .
If you go beyond the pre-defined ACMA blacklist to catch a wider range of content , the false positive rate — material blocked when it should n’t be — is still up to 3.4 % .
Enex ’s examples include the incorrect blocking of “ sperm whales ” and “ robin red breast ” .
In the industry , this is known as the Scunthorpe Problem .
Australia ’s biggest telco , Telstra , was n’t part of the official trial , but it conducted its own tests and discussed the results with Enex .
“ Telstra found its filtering solution was not effective in the case of non-web based protocols such as instant messaging , peer - to - peer [ file sharing like BitTorrent ] or chat rooms .
Enex confirms that this is also the case for all filters presented in the pilot . ”
For all filters .
Telstra also reported that its filtering system could be overloaded if pages on heavy traffic sites like YouTube ended up on the blacklist .
Every request for anything on YouTube would have to be routed to the secret filter box to see whether it was listed .
“ This is also the case for all filters presented in the pilot , ” reports Enex .
For all filters .
In any event , as the Enex report reminds us , “ A technically competent user could , if they wished , circumvent the filtering technology . ”
In its own tests , Telstra did n’t even bother testing circumvention because they take it as given .
“ ISP filtering reduces the risk of Australians being inadvertently exposed to RC - rated material when they are online , ” Senator Conroy said .
And again Conroy is dead right .
Reduces the risk .
Inadvertent exposure .
But when it comes to curious kids with technically - adept mates and plenty of time on their hands , or desperately secretive pedophiles trading their nasties , the filter will be nothing but a minor inconvenience .
This is the season when pundits feel compelled to make annual forecasts .
I will make mine , as I traditionally do , in the first letter of January .
But already we have seen a wide range of forecasted outcomes .
Are we going to grow at 5 - 6 % or at 1 - 2 % or dip back into recession ?
Why such disparity ?
I think part of the reason is a basic disagreement on the nature of the just - lapsed recession .
Today we explore that issue .
Then I point you to a way to help those who are desperately in need and only wish they had our problems .
For those interested , I enclose a picture of my new granddaughter .
And finally , I start the process of getting ready , after ten years , to actually buy some stocks .
Yes , it is true .
Am I throwing in the towel and becoming a bull , or do I just see an opportunity ?
Stay tuned .
It 's All About Deleveraging
I did a very interesting one - hour show this week with Tom Ashbrook on his National Public Radio syndicated radio show called On Point .
About 20 minutes into the show , Professor Jeremy Siegel of Wharton came on , and we had a pleasant debate and lively Q and A with listeners .
Jeremy of course was the bull , expecting that next year the US will grow by 5 - 6 % .
I was the " bear , " expecting growth in the 1 - 2 % range .
You can listen in at http://www.onpointradio.org/2009/12/an-economic-warning.
It 's also available as a podcast on iTunes ( " On Point with Tom Ashbrook " ) for a few more days .
I have liked Jeremy the times we have been on the same platform , and we have traded emails over the past few years .
He is a consummate gentleman .
He is also the author of Stocks for the Long Run .
His thesis is buy and hold .
Long - time readers know that I find such thinking to be wrong , if not dangerous .
I believe that stocks go in long cycles ( an average of 17 years ) based on valuations , and that we are still in a long - term secular bear phase .
I want to see valuations come way down before I suggest that the index - investing waters are once again safe .
That day will come .
Just not for a while .
In the meantime , Jeremy has given us the reason for his very bullish call .
Paraphrasing , he said , " Look at past recoveries from recessions .
They were always strong in the first year .
Suggesting 5 - 6 % is not all that aggressive . "
And I would agree with him - if the past recession was a typical recession .
But we have just gone through a recession that was unlike any other we have experienced since the Great Depression .
Typical recessions are inventory - adjustment recessions , caused by businesses getting too optimistic about sales and then having to adjust .
You get temporarily higher levels of unemployment as inventories drop , and then you get the rebound .
It is not quite as simple as that , but close enough for this letter 's purpose .
This recession was caused not by too much inventory but by too much credit and leverage in the system .
And now we are in the process of deleveraging .
It is a process that is nowhere near complete .
While the crisis stage is over ( at least for now ) , there is still a lot of debt to be retired on the consumer side of the equation , and a lot of debt to be written off on the financial - system side .
And this is true in Europe as well , and maybe more so ; but today we will look at some data in the US .
Total consumer debt is shrinking for the first time on 60 years .
And the decline shows no sign of abating .
Credit card companies have reduced available credit by $ 1.6 trillion dollars .
And for good reason .
My friend and London partner Niels Jensen sent me the following charts from UrbanDigs.com .
Credit card delinquencies are hovering near all - time highs .
Bank charge - offs for credit cards are going to rise as the unemployment numbers get worse :
And the strain is also in the housing sector .
Residential delinquencies are up 1.2 % just in the last quarter , and now stand at a stunning 9 % .
( For whatever reason the heading did not copy , but this is residential delinquencies . )
Frank Veneroso noticed something unusual in the latest Federal Reserve Flow of Funds report .
They changed their methodology for analyzing housing prices to a model more like the Case - Shiller index , which most believe to be more accurate .
That meant they deducted another $ 2 trillion from household net worth than in the previous quarter .
They just caught up with reality , so no big news there .
But there is some big news if you look closely .
About one - third of the homes in the US have no mortgages .
Typically , these are nicer homes , as the " rich " have paid off their homes .
So you can estimate that to be somewhere between 35 - 40 % of the total value of US homes .
Writes Frank :
" So now the flow of funds accounts tell us that the total value of residential real estate is $ 16.53 trillion .
The share owned by households with a mortgage is probably $ 10 trillion to $ 11 trillion .
Total mortgage household debt now stands at $ 10.3 trillion .
In effect , for all households with a mortgage taken in the aggregate , their loan - to - value ratio is now close to 100 % and perhaps close to half of them have a zero to negative equity . "
The biggest single factor in foreclosures is negative equity coupled with unemployment .
That makes sense , because if you could sell your house and get some equity , you would .
As I have written in past letters , we are going to see a significant increase in mortgage resets in 2010 , which will result in even more foreclosures .
There is a lot more pain to come .
This is not an environment that is typical of past recessions .
There is a lot of deleveraging to be done , both as banks write off bad debts on homes and as consumers walk away from mortgages badly underwater .
Commercial Woes
The coming debacle in commercial real estate loans is well - documented .
Total loan delinquencies at banks are rising precipitously every month , just as total loans to commercial and industrial customers are falling at an unprecedented rate , over 17 % in less than two years !
While Obama is urging banks to lend , bank regulators are telling banks to raise capital and shore up their balance sheets .
One way they do that is to lend less to consumers and businesses and invest in US government bonds .
Given the high rate of delinquencies and charge - offs of all sorts of debt , it is unlikely that we are going to see growth in loans in 2010 .
Further , the surveys I read suggest that consumers are working hard to reduce their debt .
The New Frugal is part of the New Normal .
Past post - recession expansions have been built on growing credit and leverage .
That will not be the case this time .
We are going to see reduced lending and borrowing .
Even though the federal government is running massive deficits , the stimulus portion of the debt will be running down in the latter half of 2010 .
There will be little political will to continue with massive stimulus and deficits .
While this is good in the long run , in the short run it will reduce GDP .
All of this suggest to me that while there will be growth in 2010 , it will be tepid by past post - recession standards .
And with that thought , I will end my 2009 writing about the economy .
When I next write in 2010 , we will look at what the year may bring us .
Masked youths hurled firebombs and chunks of marble at police during a protest in Athens to mark the first anniversary of the police shooting of a teenager whose death caused widespread riots .
Police fired volleys of teargas to disperse the youths in running street battles in the centre of the capital as several thousand demonstrators marched to commemorate the death of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos .
The teenager 's death sent youths rampaging through cities for two weeks last December .
, the rioters smashed bank windows , and overturned rubbish bins and set them alight as they hurled rocks and firecrackers at riot police .
Authorities said 134 people were detained for public order offences in Athens and 80 in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where a similar demonstration also ended in violence , with youths throwing petrol bombs at police and setting fire to cars .
At least five protesters were injured in the clashes , including a woman who was hit by a police motorcycle .
Police said 16 officers were hurt .
More than 6,000 police officers had been deployed across Athens in an effort to prevent violence .
Police on motorbikes chased rioters amid scenes of chaos at Syntagma square in Athens , with youths punching and kicking officers pushed off their bikes .
One policeman who lost control of his motorbike struck a female pedestrian , who was injured and taken to hospital .
At Athens University , masked protesters broke into the building and pulled down a Greek flag , replacing it with a black - and - red anarchist banner .
The dean of Athens University was injured when the youths broke into the building , and was in intensive care in hospital , authorities said .
As night fell , about 200 masked demonstrators were holed up in the neoclassical university building , smashing marble chunks off the university steps and ripping up paving stones from the courtyard to use as missiles against the police .
A football match at Athens Olympic stadium between local clubs Panathinaikos and Atromitos was suspended for 30 minutes because of teargas used by police against rioters outside the ground .
The anger many people have over losing the public option and the Medicare buy - in is understandable .
Both were good policies that nearly passed without any strong backing by the White House .
For the White House to not even try to twist arms to include either policy stings .
And given people 's unpleasant experiences with health insurance companies , the idea of a public alternative was an extremely alluring one .
But what bothers me is not so much the anger ; it 's the complete loss of perspective .
Suddenly nothing matters but the public option , even though neither the public option nor the Medicare buy - in would have addressed the concerns the " Kill the Bill " crowd now raises .
Everything else in the bill is somehow secondary , even though the insurance regulations , the Medicaid expansion , the exchanges , the subsidies and the employer mandate all affected tens of millions more people than either the public option or the Medicare buy - in did , even before their removal .
So while the removal of the public option and the Medicare buy - in make these bills somewhat worse , the truth is they do n't fundamentally change these bills in a way that should change your mind about passing them .
Nor does the removal of a public option fundamentally change the nature - or theory - behind an individual mandate , the policy that is many people 's key sticking point .
Let 's take a look at these points , one by one :
---
A mandate is a bailout of the insurance companies !
You 're funneling public money to private corporations !
So is Medicare a bailout of the private hospital industry ?
Are food stamps a bailout of the private food industry ?
Is heating assistance a bailout of energy companies ?
Should we require that all publicly - funded financial assistance be spent only on publicly - owned enterprises ?
But the mandate is a government requirement to purchase insurance !
You 're not required to buy food and you 're not required to pay for gas or electricity !
Okay , you 're right .
The government is n't going to penalize you if you decide to go hungry rather than spend food stamps on corporate food .
And the government is n't going to penalize you if you decide not to purchase electricity or heat because it goes to a private utility .
But given that most people see these things as necessities , is the government betraying the public by not offering these goods directly ?
Granted , some of you may feel government should directly provide these things ( especially utilities ) .
But given that governments ( federal , state , and local ) generally do rely on funneling public money to private enterprises in so many other areas , why is federal assistance that goes to health insurance companies the tipping point ?
The problem is n't the assistance , per se ; it 's that the government should n't fine me for refusing to pay for private insurance , especially because I can't afford it !
It you earn less than 133 % of the federal poverty level ( Senate bill ) or 150 % of the federal poverty level ( House bill ) , then you 'll get covered by Medicaid .
If you fall just above that , and earn up to 300 % of poverty level ( Senate bill ) or 400 % of poverty level ( House bill ) , you 'll receive subsidies .
If you earn more than that and are n't eligible for subsidies , you may fall within a hardship exemption in which case you 'll have to pay neither for insurance nor a penalty tax .
Nate has a good graphical depiction of how a low - income family 's premiums would fare under the Senate bill .
But if you do earn enough to pay for health insurance and you still choose not to , fine .
You do n't have to .
But then you 'll be relying on publicly - funded emergency rooms and free clinics if you need serious care and it's more than appropriate that you pay a small tax - less than the cost of an insurance premium - that ultimately helps support those institutions .
But the mandate is going to cause premiums to skyrocket !
The insurance companies will have a captive market !
Only if people can opt out of the system will the insurance companies have an incentive to keep their prices low , since people wo n't otherwise purchase them .
Insurance is not a normal good .
Insurance works through risk - pooling .
If you require that insurers take anyone regardless of health status , and if you insist that everyone be charged the same rates , but you do n't ensure that everyone buys into the system , then healthy people can opt out , and the only people purchasing insurance are those who are older , sicker , and need to use insurance more .
With fewer healthy people in the system , the pool is sicker and more expensive to insure , and the cost - per - person climbs .
This is why virtually every health economist who has studied the issue says we need an individual mandate to enforce the insurance regulations .
But do n't take my word for it : take Paul Krugman's .
He said this in 2008 , comparing then - Candidate Obama 's mandate - less plan with Hillary Clinton's :
Mr. Obama claims that people will buy insurance if it becomes affordable .
Unfortunately , the evidence says otherwise .
After all , we already have programs that make health insurance free or very cheap to many low - income Americans , without requiring that they sign up .
And many of those eligible fail , for whatever reason , to enroll .
An Obama - type plan would also face the problem of healthy people who decide to take their chances or do n’t sign up until they develop medical problems , thereby raising premiums for everyone else .
Mr. Obama , contradicting his earlier assertions that affordability is the only bar to coverage , is now talking about penalizing those who delay signing up — but it ’s not clear how this would work .
So the Obama plan would leave more people uninsured than the Clinton plan .
How big is the difference ?
To answer this question you need to make a detailed analysis of health care decisions .
That ’s what Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T. , one of America ’s leading health care economists , does in a new paper .
Mr. Gruber finds that a plan without mandates , broadly resembling the Obama plan , would cover 23 million of those currently uninsured , at a taxpayer cost of $ 102 billion per year .
An otherwise identical plan with mandates would cover 45 million of the uninsured — essentially everyone — at a taxpayer cost of $ 124 billion .
Over all , the Obama - type plan would cost $ 4,400 per newly insured person , the Clinton - type plan only $ 2,700 .
If you oppose an individual mandate , you need to provide an alternate way to avoid adverse selection issues that are going to creep up .
And this , by the way , has nothing to do with whether a plan is public or private .
Social Security and Medicare work , for example , because everybody pays in .
If you allow younger people to opt out , the programs become unsustainable .
But without a public option , insurance companies will price - gouge to jack up their profits !
We need a public option to keep prices in line !
Insurance companies are vile for a host of reasons .
That 's why I want to pass this bill - to ban abusive practices and regulate them .
But it 's not true to say that health insurance is especially profitable .
Yes , in the aggregate , insurance companies earn large profits , but per policyholder , their profit margins are actually quite thin .
This is why the negotiated - rates public option would not have offered premiums that were much lower than the private plans in the exchange .
If the only thing keeping insurance premiums high were insurance profits , then a non-profit plan should have realized enormous savings .
It did n't .
And that shows that many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of what drives health care costs and why single - payer is so cost - effective .
While insurance profits are part of the cost problem , they are only a small part of the problem .
Insurance premiums are expensive because medical care in the United States is expensive .
The reason a single - payer system holds costs down so well is n't because it lacks a profit motive - it 's because by being the only payer ( hence , " single payer " ) , and by speaking for the entire market , the government can exercise monopsony power and negotiate extremely low rates for medical services while integrating care over the entire landscape .
This is also the reason why a " Medicare + 5 " public option saved a lot of money .
Medicare can get good rates because it has enormous scale , covering virtually everyone older than 65 .
By allowing the public option to piggyback off Medicare rates , you could save money since Medicare gets good rates due to its size .
The best - case scenario for a negotiated - rates public plan was for it cover a lot of people .
But if at the outset it never offered rates that were lower than private insurance , then it was n't at all clear that it would ever grow to be anything more than a sliver of the market .
That 's why Jay Rockefeller proposed that even a negotiated - rates public option initially offer Medicare rates .
That way it could acquire a large customer base and when the plan needed to negotiate rates on its own , it would have a scale large enough to negotiate genuinely good prices .
That , however , was rejected even by the House , meaning at best we would have gotten a government - chartered non-profit with practical effects little different from the OPM non-profits being offered instead .
But without a public option , why wo n't insurance companies jack up their rates since they have a captive market ?
The exchanges already address the issue of concentrated markets .
Multiple plans , from multiple insurers , will be offered within them .
Unlike today , there will be a functioning market , so if any one insurance decides to jack up their rates , other plans can compete by offering lower ones .
Additionally , the exchanges enforce a high medical - loss ratio of 80 - 85 % and the administrators of the exchange can remove a plan that violates that .
But that means that the exchanges rely on regulation .
And insurance companies can game the system and circumvent the regulations .
Then improve the regulations .
If you 're going to argue that regulations are futile and will never work , then what 's the argument for regulating anything , ever ?
Why do n't we dismantle all other health care regulations and simply provide public options for hospitals , clinics , and doctors ?
Actually , that 's a bad example , because the bills already provide " public options " for health centers and doctors .
Public options that will directly provide health care to 20 - 25 million people .
( But let 's throw that out , since the bill was stripped of a weak , opt - out public insurance plan with 3 - 4 million people . )
Regulations are only as good as the people that enforce them .
If the Republicans come back to power , they 'll stop enforcing the regulations and may dismantle them .
This is a fair point .
But , taken to its logical extreme you 're again insisting that all regulation is futile , in which case we might as well de-regulate everything since the Republicans will do it anyway when they return to power .
Also , why would a public plan be any more protected from Republican hands then regulations ?
Conservatives systematically de-funded the Veterans Health Administration in the 1970s and 1980s .
( It took the Clinton Administration to fix it . )
And the Conservatives in the UK systematically underfunded the NHS in the 1980s and 1990s .
The threat of Republican rule is no reason to argue against trying regulations , just as the threat of Republican rule is not a reason to not create public programs .
But the regulations did n't work in Massachusetts .
Their plan is unaffordable and insurance premiums have gone up .
Massachusetts plans were already heavily - regulated .
Virtually all the major Massachusetts insurers are non-profits with high medical loss ratios .
Yes , premiums in Massachusetts are expensive and climbing .
That , however , is because the cost - of - living is high in Massachusetts and because health care costs are among the highest - and fastest - growing - in the nation .
The state has some of the best medical care in the country , with cutting - edge research and teaching hospitals , and prestigious institutions that charge more because they can .
Moreover , in the segment of the market that was most affected by the individual mandate - the individual and small - group markets - insurance premiums have dropped 40 % since the mandate was imposed .
In short , insurance profits are not driving the price of premiums in Massachusetts .
That is n't to say that Massachusetts does n't have a cost problem .
But the cost problem in Massachusetts came about because Massachusetts did n't even attempt cost control measures and because the Massachusetts effort made no effort to squeeze providers .
Having now covered everybody , the state is poised to enact far - reaching reforms to completely overhaul the reimbursement system , moving the entire state away from fee - for - service medicine .
But that 's a Republican plan !
It 's " RomneyCare " !
( Note : Added on update )
Do n't give Mitt too much credit .
The law was written by the overwhelmingly Democratic legislature and Ted Kennedy , acting as the elder statesman of Massachusetts politics .
All Mitt did was smile and sign the paper .
Oh , and veto several sections - vetoes that were promptly overridden by the legislature .
In fact , if you 're going to credit a Republican , credit '90s governor Bill Weld , who helped implement many of the insurance reforms that preceded this effort .
But these bills have no cost controls !
We 're going to be forced to buy junk insurance that 's going to face higher and higher costs .
The bills - the Senate bill especially - do plenty on cost control .
No , it 's not enough .
But it 's a significant start .
It will save money over ten years , and will make several important changes to the system .
FireDogLake and frontpager mcjoan both ridiculed Ron Brownstein 's blog post on the Senate Finance bill 's cost control measures , since Brownstein ignored the cost savings that could be accrued by a robust , Medicare + 5 public plan .
But since the only public plan that had any chance of inclusion was a negotiated - rates plan , Brownstein 's points were perfectly valid .
Worth pointing to was health economist Jonathon Gruber 's views on the Senate bill :
" I 'm sort of a known skeptic on this stuff , " Gruber told me .
" My summary is it 's really hard to figure out how to bend the cost curve , but I can't think of a thing to try that they did n't try .
They really make the best effort anyone has ever made .
Everything is in here .... I can't think of anything I 'd do that they are not doing in the bill .
You could n't have done better than they are doing . "
Ezra Klein also runs through five major cost - saving measures in the bills , with bundled payments , " prudent purchasing , " and an independent Medicare payments commission at the top of the list .
Bundled payments are being strengthened by Sen. Warner .
Prudent purchasing was inserted by Sen. Kerry .
Meanwhile Sens. Rockefeller , Whitehouse , and , yes , Joementum , have called for strengthening the Medicare commission .
Lastly , Atul Gawande in the New Yorker argues that the Senate health care bill will likely produce even greater cost - savings in the long - term because of the numerous pilot projects it launches .
None can be evaluated right now , because all are experimental and hard to model , but some may prove to be major cost - savers in the future .
... what does the reform package do about [ health care costs ] ?
Turn to page 621 of the Senate version , the section entitled “ Transforming the Health Care Delivery System , ” and start reading .
Does the bill end medicine ’s destructive piecemeal payment system ?
Does it replace paying for quantity with paying for quality ?
Does it institute nationwide structural changes that curb costs and raise quality ?
It does not .
Instead , what it offers is . . . pilot programs .
...
Where we crave sweeping transformation , however , all the current bill offers is ... a battery of small - scale experiments .
The strategy seems hopelessly inadequate to solve a problem of this magnitude .
And yet — here ’s the interesting thing — history suggests otherwise .
All told , the Senate bill alone will save , according to CBO estimates , $ 132 billion over ten years and up to $ 1.3 trillion over 20 years .
Look , even a weak public option was the best part of this bill .
Without it , this bill does nothing to help people .
I would certainly dispute that .
As we 've already established , a negotiated - rates public option would not have been a significant cost - saver .
It was a useful extra regulatory tool and it could have provided a good vector for payment and delivery reforms .
But the subsidies , the insurance regulations , the exchanges , the Medicaid expansion , and the expansion of community health centers and the public health service all affected tens of millions more people than a negotiated - rates , opt - out public option .
Some of those things are good .
But we should start over and write a better bill that includes a public option and push it through reconciliation .
Really ?
We should start all over ?
Start over on subsidies ?
Start over on Medicaid expansion ?
Start over on the exchanges ?
Start over on the insurance regulations ?
All for , at best , a negotiated - rates public option ?
( OK , yes , there 's Cenk Uyger 's suggestion of a universal Medicare opt-in .
But that 's basically a single - payer system and even in the extreme off - chance that you could somehow marshal 50 votes for it in the Senate , given the narrow margin for the actual bill in the House , a single - payerish bill is not going to pass that body . )
Admittedly , reconciliation may have been a better strategy from the start .
Both Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders have said you could get a pretty comprehensive bill that way , but other Senate liberals like Tom Harkin and Jay Rockefeller disagree .
Still , even if you could only get a more limited expansion of public programs through reconciliation , maybe that would have been a better strategy for Obama 's first year .
Maybe he could have pushed through a limited expansion of Medicare and a federalization and expansion of Medicaid and SCHIP through reconciliation .
Then we could have tackled the less controversial reforms later , in a couple of years .
But we are where we are .
And at this point , going through reconciliation means starting all over .
It is n't at all clear how much of the bill could get through .
Yes , a public option would survive , but much else might not .
And for all the reasons I 've outlined before , I do n't think a negotiated - rates public option is more important than everything else in this bill .
And any bill prepared for reconciliation would have to be written and cleared by Budget Committee chairman and Conservadem , public - option skeptic Kent Conrad .
Why not just keep what 's in the bill , while improving what you can now and seeking to improve more in the future ?
Congress will never fix the bill !
The only solution is to make Congress start all over again and produce something better , right now !
There 's a disconnect here and I do n't quite understand it .
How can these two things be said in the same breath ?
If you 're convinced Congress will never fix , improve , or modify existing legislation , then why are you so confident that the same Congress will start all over and produce a better bill ?
If Congress is too compromised to fix and improve the bill , then how are they not too compromised to produce a better bill , right now ?
You 're a shill for the Administration and the insurance companies !
You 're polishing a turd and calling it a diamond !
You wo n't even say where these bills need to be fixed !
Ahem .
I think the Administration badly - bungled the public option fight .
I think they erred in not fighting to at least include the Medicare opt - in , which , though limited , was still a good policy and had a likely 59 votes .
While I think presidents have less leverage over individual senators than people sometimes assume , you can't tell me that a little arm - twisting would n't have gotten them one extra vote .
As for the insurance companies ?
Frankly , I 'd go farther than most on this site and say that my ideal system would n't just be a Canadian - style single - payer system but an American NHS based on the VA , which not only provides excellent , integrated care but does so at a far cheaper price than even single - payer .
Still , I have a sense of realism about what can pass Congress .
And while I think the Obama Administration and the congressional leadership could probably have gotten something a little better , the end result is still pretty good .
Of course , there are plenty of places the final bill can be improved .
Speed up the implementation .
( 2014 ? Really ? )
Fix the age discrimination clause by at least reducing the disparity in premiums to 2:1 like the House does , rather than 3:1 like the Senate does .
Provide more subsidies .
Expand Medicaid above 133 % .
Raise the medical - loss ratios for the OPM non-profit plans to 90 % .
Replace the Senate 's " two exchanges per state " with a single national exchange that allows states to opt out and create their own exchanges only if they have stronger controls .
Allow states to implement single - payer .
See if you can allow people to buy into state employee public health plans ( a public option compromise that was floated early on ) .
Add in the House bill 's antitrust provisions .
Going farther , put in a federal reinsurance program for catastrophic care , like John Kerry proposed in 2004 .
And although this may not be viable as part of this reform effort , federalize Medicaid and SCHIP and make them components of Medicare .
( The bills already raise Medicaid reimbursements to Medicare levels and both Medicaid and SCHIP are huge fiscal burdens for the states while also being extremely inconsistent across states in terms of eligibility and administration . )
But none of these things require killing the bill .
Many of these things can be fixed now , or can be added in future years , even just as part of budgetary appropriations .
So , no .
Do n't kill the bill .
There 's plenty that 's good here .
A weak public option did not make or break this health care bill .
Do n't ignore all the good things that are in this bill because of one thing that is n't .

UPDATE : Thanks for getting me on the Rec list , guys !
UPDATE # 2 : Hey everyone , thanks for the comments and the recs !
I 'm glad we 're having this discussion .
A couple items I 'll briefly address .
Some have asked me what I think about the Nelson abortion restrictions .
The policy - " one premium , two checks " - seems asinine to me .
I generally defer to Barbara Boxer and Patty Murray on this , who have both said they will vote to pass , but I can understand people being upset by this .
Hopefully it can be challenged in court .
( I'm all for understanding and respect of opposing viewpoints , but just for once , I 'd like to see Pro-Lifers show some respect and understanding of the pro-choice position , instead of insisting that we 're all a bunch of baby - killing heathens . )
Also , I 've gotten some push back on a few of the points I 've made , so let me quickly run through them .
(1) Slinkerwink and others objected to my comparing subsidized health insurance to food stamps , for example .
Slink argued that things like heating assistance , food stamps , etc. , were part of a government 's social contract to provide basic necessities .
There is a potentially valid argument in here ; health insurance is an intermediary that stands between a person and the needed service - health care .
So you could argue that food stamps would be most comparable to direct government funding of a person 's health care needs .
We do n't , after all , require people to buy food through private " food insurance . "
Still , the insurance model is how we provide all of our medical services in this country .
( Again , I do n't think it 's absolutely necessary , which is why I would actually prefer a VA - type American NHS to provide care directly to people . )
Unless you 're going to change the complete model , however , then I do n't think there 's really a major distinction between providing subsidies for health insurance and providing subsidies for any other privately - provided service .
In the food industry , in the energy industry , and elsewhere in the health care industry , like hospitals , you have public funds flowing into private , profit - seeking enterprises .
Subsidies for insurance are perfectly in line with that model .
(2) Second , there was some pushback on the claim that the negotiated rates public plan would not have offered lower rates .
Yet in the very quote Slink cites , the CBO says that " The rates the public plan pays to providers would , on average , probably be comparable to the rates paid by private insurers participating in the exchanges . "
Yes , the CBO did say that it would have some downward pressure on the price of low cost plans .
And the CBO said it could be an attractive option for people who were sicker or harder to insure .
( Although one could argue , of course , that this means that the public option was just going to be a " dumping ground " for the private insurers ) .
Those are reasons why a " weak " public plan was a still a good idea .
But they validate the point that it had a relatively small bearing on the overall nature of this bill and only a small effect on overall costs .
Now , if we were talking about a strong , Medicare - for - all option being stripped from the bill , then you could say it had been irrevocably weakened .
But that 's not what was pulled .
Anyway good night guys .
It 's late , and I just got back from seeing Avatar ( which , though slightly overlong , was awesome ) .

Expect higher health care costs in 2010
( Money Magazine ) --
Last month was open - enrollment season , and my wife and I got an unpleasant surprise .
For 2010 we 're looking at an annual health - insurance premium that 's $ 1,600 higher than it is now , plus higher deductibles .
Instead of flat co-pays , we 'll pay co-insurance , a share of the total costs .
And this is with a plan provided by a Fortune 500 company that still spends big bucks on relatively generous benefits .
You may well be in the same boat .
According to human - resources consultant Hewitt Associates , the average large - company employee will pay $ 4,023 in premiums and out - of - pocket costs next year -- 10 % more than in 2009 and more than three times the level in 2001 .
We are witnessing the slow death of what some political scientists dub the corporate welfare system .
Until quite recently employees of giant companies essentially lived in Canada , but with shorter lines for the MRI machines .
That is , they did n't have to think very hard or very often about medical expenses .
But the relentless increase in health - care costs is unraveling those arrangements year by year .
And for many people at smaller firms -- not to mention the self - employed -- those days are already long gone .
You 'll miss those co-pays
Hewitt 's Cathy Tripp calls the shift from co-pays to co-insurance -- the big trend this year -- " cost transparency . "
You 'll feel the true cost of doctor visits , the thinking goes , and therefore spend less .
But hospitals do n't yet post their prices for procedures the way Target does for dish soap .
The delivery of my second child wound up costing $ 1,000 more than that of our first just two years earlier .
I have no idea whom I would have talked with to figure out that tab ahead of time .
For families , the new " transparency " can actually feel pretty murky .
It makes it harder for them to predict what their medical costs will be in a given year .
It wo n't get simple soon
There are two schools of thought on why health care is so expensive .
And there 's truth in both .
The first says that patients are ignorant of costs .
( The prescription : more of those out - of - pocket payments . )
The second looks at the pricing power of doctors and hospitals , as well as their financial incentives .
Years of research out of Dartmouth have documented that spending on health can vary wildly from one region to another , but that the places spending more do n't get better health results .
Ideally , you want providers to focus on getting you well with just as much treatment as will help and not a scan or pill more .
But our piecework system of paying for care rewards them for doing more things .
The health bills now before Congress have some measures that try to change how health providers are paid .
But they 'd just be a start .
( Most have to do with how Medicare pays its bills , not what your insurer does . )
The fact is , cost control will be a year - by - year exercise in political will , not a single bill .
We 've had some practice cranking the " more out - of - pocket " lever to address rising health costs .
The " pick a fight with docs and hospitals " lever may be harder for Washington to pull .
Unfortunately , it does n't look like any kind of accountability will be achieved here in the U.S. anytime soon .
The latest evidence of this came on November 2 , when the Second Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case of Maher Arar against U.S. officials who had sent him to Syria , where he was interrogated under torture for a year .
Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian citizen , was detained at JFK Airport in September of 2002 while on his way home to Canada from a vacation .
After his rendition to Syria and all the torture and abuse , Arar was eventually released , with the Syrian government stating that they had found no connection to any criminal or terrorist organization or activity .
Still , that Court of Appeals apparently believes that the U.S. should not be held accountable for violating international law by putting Arar through that abuse .
The court cited the Bush administration 's favorite excuse -- state secrets .
Case dismissed .
God bless America .
Maria LaHood , senior staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , who represented Arar , aptly summed up the implications of the decision as follows :
" With this decision , we have lost much more than Maher Arar 's case against torture -- we have lost the rule of law , the moral high ground , our independent judiciary , and our commitment to the Constitution of the United States . "
The only voice of reason out of the Second Circuit Court was in a dissent by Judge Guido Calabresi :
" I believe that when the history of this distinguished court is written , today 's majority decision will be viewed with dismay . "
Meanwhile , the rest of the world is not going to wait around for us to get our act together .
On November 4 , an Italian judge convicted 23 Americans , most of them CIA operatives , for the abduction and rendition of Muslim cleric Abu Omar , who was captured in Milan in 2003 .
One of the defendants , a CIA base chief , received an eight - year sentence , while the others were sentenced to five years each .
The defendants were all tried in absentia and are considered fugitives .
And while it 's unlikely that any of those 23 Americans will ever see the inside of an Italian prison cell , the Italian court 's decision makes a statement to the U.S. and to the world : that laws were broken and accountability is crucial in a world that respects the rule of law .
Tom Parker , Amnesty International 's policy director for counterterrorism and human rights , had this to say :
" The United States should n't need a foreign court to distinguish right from wrong .
The Obama administration must repudiate the unlawful practice of extraordinary rendition -- and hold accountable those responsible for having put this system in place -- or his administration will end up as tarnished as his predecessor's . "
Obama talks about human rights .
But talk -- even Obama 's fancy variety -- is cheap .
Continuing the practice of rendition is not change I can believe in .
In fact , it is no change at all .

At least 1,300 slum dwellers from Kibera - Nairobi ’s largest informal urban settlement - have been moved to new blocks of flats under a slum - upgrading programme .
" I can't believe I have left Kibera for good !
My new home is so clean , we have a toilet inside the house ; it is a dream come true , " Pius Okello , 46 , father of six , said .
Okello , who had lived in Kibera 's Soweto East zone for 10 years , was one of those who moved on 16 September .
The government provided trucks and workers to help the residents settle into their new homes , which they have dubbed ` Canaan ’ , the Promised Land .
Kibera is one of the largest informal settlements in sub-Saharan Africa .
According to UN - HABITAT , estimates of its population range from 500,000 to 800,000 , with densities of over 3,000 people per hectare - one of the most densely populated informal settlements in the world .
The monthly rent for a room in the new flats , about a kilometre from Kibera , is Ksh 500 ( US$ 7 ) and tenants pay an additional Ksh300 ( $ 4 ) for electricity and Ksh200 ( $ 2.5 ) for water .
The kitchen , toilet and bathrooms are shared but if a family takes three rooms , they get exclusive use of these facilities .
" I took three rooms because I have six children and I take care of four other children of my dead brother when schools close ; at least now my wife and I have our privacy and the children have a bedroom for the first time , " Okello said .
" The only problem is that I feel that water and electricity charges are high because they are charged per room ; I should be charged a single fee for the whole house . "
The ongoing $ 300,000 Kenya Slum Upgrading Programme ( KENSUP ) was mooted in 2000 , and jointly funded by the government , HABITAT and the World Bank Cities Alliance .

Targeted intervention
Raila Odinga , Kenya 's prime minister and member of parliament for Langata , in which Kibera falls , participated in moving the slum dwellers to their new homes .
" Absence of decent housing means abundance of other problems , " he said in an address to the residents .
" Today , we take the first step towards meeting the basic needs and rights of slum dwellers and saying No to slum related problems .
This is an initial step towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals . "
Nairobi has some of the most dense , unsanitary and insecure slums in the world , according to HABITAT , with almost half of the city 's population living in over 100 slums and squatter settlements .
" The objective of the programme is to improve the overall livelihoods of people living and working in slums through targeted interventions to address shelter , infrastructure services , land tenure and employment issues , as well as the impact of HIV / AIDS in slum settlements , " according to HABITAT .

Editor 's note : CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose new book is " Late Edition : A Love Story . "
( CNN ) -- Maybe if you 're a New Yorker , you grow accustomed to the sight .
Maybe if you live in the city , it becomes just another part of the Manhattan landscape .
But if you 're from somewhere else , visiting , and you 're not expecting to encounter it .
. . .
Well , you sense that you 've been in front of this building before , even though you never have .
You feel it before you fully see it .
So it was , early on a recent afternoon , that I was walking east on 72nd Street , approaching Central Park West .
I glanced to my left .
To say the building is spooky is perhaps too easy .
Yet everything about it -- the high gables , the balustrades , the gas lanterns burning even in the daytime , the black iron gates leading into the open interior courtyard -- seems purposely designed to give off an aura of portent .
Possibly that impression is merely retrospective -- most likely , when the massive residential building was constructed well over a century ago , the desire was simply to erect a place of urban elegance .
And perhaps to the people who live there now , it looks only like home .
When the 1968 movie " Rosemary 's Baby " was filmed , and the exterior of this building -- the Dakota -- was chosen as the site of the eerie tale , the die may have been cast .
For anyone who ever saw the movie , the temperature drops a few degrees as soon as those walls come into sight .
Yet it is what happened here 29 years ago this week that draws curious visitors still .
I heard a voice behind me .
" Is this where . . .? "
A young woman was asking her friend the question .
" Yes , " the friend said , not needing to hear the rest .
Mark David Chapman shot John Lennon to death next to those courtyard gates on the night of December 8 , 1980 , as Lennon was returning to his home inside the Dakota .
Lennon and his wife , Yoko Ono , had spent the evening at a recording studio known as the Record Plant , working on a song called " Walking on Thin Ice . "
As they neared the entrance to the Dakota just before 11 p.m. , Chapman , who that same afternoon , at the same entrance , had asked for and received an autograph from Lennon , waited with a gun .
Lennon never had a chance .
He would be pronounced dead at the St. Luke 's - Roosevelt Hospital Center .
His public life had been somewhat quieter since the breakup of the Beatles ; although many of his admirers around the globe were aware that he had become a resident of New York , relatively few knew exactly where in the city he lived .
On the night of the murder , though , as the news of his death quickly spread , so , too , did photographs and live television images of the Dakota .
The building on that night became synonymous with heartache , with senseless loss , with joy extinguished ..
And here -- as in the waning days of 2009 you find yourself standing on this block without having planned it , as you look at the building you have never before seen with your own eyes -- is what strikes you :
To anyone in this city , in this country , in this world , who is younger than 32 or 33 years old , the memory of Lennon is of a man who has always been dead .
The murder was past tense by the time people who are now that age first became aware of his name .
The Dakota , in its own way , may be , to them , like Ford 's Theatre in Washington , D.C. , or the triple underpass in Dallas .
A place where something terrible happened , yes , but something terrible that happened in history , not in the recollected narrative of their daily lives .
I crossed the street called Central Park West and stepped onto the pathway to the park itself .
A little girl , around five years old , was coming out of the park with her parents .
They obviously had been talking about Lennon , for she said to them :
" Is that where he 's buried ? "
As if approaching Grant 's Tomb .
Her father said to her :
" No , he was killed there .
I do n't know where he is buried . "
And they crossed the street , toward the Dakota .
The array of John Lennon merchandise for sale by vendors at the entrance to the park -- photos , drawings , postcards -- is understandable from a purely commercial point of view , but is jarring nonetheless near the shadow of the building where he died .
It may not be intended as a sign of disrespect , and maybe the sight of this , too , is something to which people who live in New York have long ago become accustomed .
Just inside the entrance to the park is the famous Strawberry Fields , named in his memory .
The main gathering point is the mosaic with , at its center , the single word : " Imagine . "
One sign near the mosaic announced that the playing of musical instruments is not permitted , but on this day a man sat on a bench facing the mosaic and strummed a wooden acoustic guitar .
As he played the song " In My Life , " he sang , with a wavery voice , the words :
" There are places I remember . . . . "
Fans remember Lennon
On Tuesday , as the anniversary of the murder arrives , perhaps the mood will be solemn in Strawberry Fields .
But on this day , at least on this hour of this day , it was intermittently lighthearted .
People sprawled on their backs on top of the mosaic , grinning and spreading their arms and legs in " Hard Day 's Night " or " Help ! " quasi-Beatles poses .
Friends with cameras knelt near them , trying to angle the lens upward at a severe enough degree to include the looming vision of the Dakota in the shot .
There was a little informal line as people waited their own turn to pose on the " Imagine " mosaic .
The man with the guitar sang :
" But of all these friends and lovers . . . . "
Another snap of another camera .
" . . . there is no one , compares with you .
. . . "
Twenty - nine Decembers ago , a man on 72nd Street wanted only one thing :
To get home for the night .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene .
Pastor
Ted stands astride two hay bales triumphant and seemingly oblivious to the frigid night air inside the Haggard family barn , where 75 people have gathered for a prayer service .
Dressed in jeans and a favorite gray NYC sweatshirt , Haggard launches into a Borscht Belt routine for evangelicals that plays to raucous laughter .
He wisecracks that God ’s preoccupation with keeping tabs on Barack Obama may delay immediate answers to their prayers .
A joke about the biblical significance of preaching in ramshackle sheds glides effortlessly into tonight ’s homily from Acts 28:17 , in which Paul , exonerated , returns to Jerusalem from Rome to persuade the Jews that the Messiah has indeed come .
In Haggard ’s reading , he is Paul : not guilty as charged by the authorities , and preaching true redemption to the skeptics .
His exegesis simultaneously taps into evangelical anxieties about persecution and lambastes its harsh authoritarianism , a foil for the self - styled apostle banished from his secular and spiritual kingdom for committing modern American evangelicalism ’s cardinal sin of homosexuality .
The teachings of Paul play a starring role in Haggard ’s personal and professional resurrection following the 2006 sex and drugs scandal that led to his abrupt resignation from the twin pulpits of conservative religious power : New Life Church in Colorado Springs and the National Association of Evangelicals and an unceremonious exile to Phoenix , Arizona .
Haggard fancies himself the rebel bucking authority , and bringing Christ ’s true message to the masses .
“ I ’m gonna be like Paul , ” he tells me , relishing his new itinerant role .
“ This is insanity but I ’m gonna to do it . ”
The fallen pastor ’s own Road to Damascus is taking place just off Interquest Parkway in Colorado Springs , a city referred to as the Jerusalem of evangelicalism .
Meet Ted Haggard 2.0
“ I ’m going to teach the Scripture , ” Haggard tells me in his living room two days before the service .
“ But I ’m going to teach it first person singular .
I ’m going to tell you how God has worked in my life and you can work it out with my story with the Scriptures and the Holy Spirit and how God ’s going to walk you through your life .
But I ’m not going to tell you what God thinks .
You have to determine that on your own . ”
Haggard ’s weekly Oval Office phone calls and grip and grin NAE photo ops with former President George W. Bush are now mere vestiges of an old life , prior to what he calls the “ crisis . ”
At New Life , which Jeff Sharlet described as “ not just a battalion of spiritual warriors but a factory for ideas to arm them , ” worship services were extravagant multimedia , fog machine - choked productions , in which Haggard used his pulpit to wage spiritual war against satanic forces , including the demon of homosexuality .
“ It would be devastating for the children of our nation and for the future of Western civilization , ” he told Christianity Today in 2005 , “ for us to say that homosexual unions or lesbian unions or any alteration of that has the moral equivalence of a heterosexual , monogamous marriage . ”
At the pinnacle of Haggard ’s power , he moved seamlessly between the firebrand populism of evangelical believers and the institutional halls of fundamentalist realpolitik .
Now , from his rustic pulpit ( not unlike the basement from which he launched New Life , or , perhaps , an intentional manger ) , Pastor Ted weaves a personal metaphorical tale of running afoul of the authoritarian religious leadership to which he once belonged .
“ We do n’t really know you but we know you ’re bad , ” Haggard preaches from atop the hay bales as he awkwardly tries to weave a reference to the authorities who banished him New Life .
“ The Kingdom of Earth is bound by rules , ” he declares from his New Living Translation Bible .
“ There is no forgiveness in the Kingdom of Earth .
The only hope is for the Kingdom of Heaven to invade the Earth . ”
The cracker barrel - styled reading of Acts — and of I Corinthians 13 at the prayer meeting the week before where 150 people reportedly swarmed his house — are emblematic of Pastor Ted ’s uncanny , Zelig - like talent for reflecting the emerging Christian Right zeitgeist of the moment .
In the mid-1980s , the so - called Charismatic and Pentecostal “ shift in gravity ” from the Deep South westward had much less to do with a random vision to build a church in Colorado Springs than the rapid population boom fueled by cheap land that would lead to a new free market Christianity political power base in the Western United States .
In less than a decade , Haggard built one of the most influential megachurches in the nation .
Not Everybody Loves a Comeback Story
Today , Haggard and his wife Gayle jet set nearly every weekend to speak at emergent churches across the nation with a well - worn script about forgiveness and redemption .
“ Out of Hebrews I know I am forgiven past , present and future , ” he tells me during our living - room chat .
“ Out of John , I know that anyone who says he has no sin is a liar .
Out of some of the other Scriptures , I know I am cleansed .
I know I am a new creation .
I know my mind is renewed . ”
Haggard ’s new role makes some of his fellow travelers very unhappy .
H.B. London , the dour head of pastoral ministries at Focus on the Family , denounced the prayer services in the press , in a widely - circulated email , and on his blog .
London reportedly told the Religious News Service of Haggard ’s plans to hold prayer services , “ When you think of the ethics of that , it , to me , just defies explanation . ”
Not to be left out of the media feeding frenzy , other high - profile pastors in the conservative evangelical Christian community quickly piled on .
C. Peter Wagner , who co-founded the World Prayer Center with Haggard and is well known for the exorcism - obsessed New Apostolic Reformation movement , told the Colorado Springs Gazette that Haggard is deceiving himself and that he ’s not fit to preach .
“ He must have someone confirm him in the body of Christ ” before he can preach again , Wagner said .
Former Foursquare pastor Jack Hayford , another NAR bigwig and member of Haggard ’s now - disbanded restoration team , and Gary Black of Rock the Nation youth ministry echoed the tightly - scripted public excoriations about the incomplete apostolic protocol .
Said Black , “ I would be shocked to think he ’s ready to lead a church . ”
After the public humiliation of the “ crisis , ” attacks by his former peers continue to sting .
Haggard shifts uncomfortably in a plaid recliner and repeatedly points to London ’s email for emphasis as we talk in his living room .
“ I do n’t believe I will ever be forgiven by the modern day Pharisees , ” said Haggard not only because he broke the rules but that he refuses to disappear from public view .
“ Redemption can never come to the sinner .
I ’m going on with my faith walk and they despise me because of it . ”
Haggard ’s tenuous relationship with fellow Colorado Springs evangelical kingpin James Dobson of Focus on the Family is fairly legendary and well documented .
What ’s new is the startlingly provocative description of his former compatriots as authority - and rules - fixated Pharisees — a notion that also reinforces his own disquieting personal portrayal of himself as a modern - day apostle , a notion no doubt borrowed in part from New Apostolic teachings .
From Master of the Universe to Castaway
While the fundamentalist helm comes unglued over the prospect of a new Haggard ministry ( and a new book deal he ’s currently negotiating ) there is the potential that it could seriously backfire .
Vilify him too viciously and too personally without a carefully crafted patina of Christian charity and they risk being perceived by the flock as self - righteous .
Haggard ’s own spectacular self - destruction offers an important cautionary tale for those who traffic in intolerant fundamentalist morality when their own human frailties are revealed .
Ignore him and the rules - based authoritarian cottage industry comes undone .
The era of fallen pastors , like Jimmy Swaggert , slinking off to obscurity , appear to be over .
Now disgraced right - wing authoritarians appear on Dancing with the Stars , where corrupt former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay cha-cha ’d his way into the hearts and minds of American TV viewers .
Haggard seems to be testing these new limits with a carefully crafted rebellion against the rule makers .
Haggard ’s theological world view is as ultra-conservative as theirs , but he has studiously avoided the public persona of the scolding fundamentalist preacher stereotype .
He talks now of modeling his prayer sessions on the glory days of Billy Graham and Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright before the evangelical movement took on the oppressive moralism of the 1980s and ’90s when Jerry Falwell , Pat Robertson , James Dobson and their media empires came to power .
“ When religion became politicized it became dualistic in thinking , ” he explains .
“ Right - wrong .
Good - bad .
So rather than it being a gospel of good news and rescue , it became a finger - pointing gospel of judgment . ”
“ If I have the opportunity I will return evangelicalism back to its Christ message rather than its judgment message , ” Haggard vows , now that he has been a victim of said judgment .
“ This is all going to work out and it ’s going to embarrass the people who have been hateful and judgmental because the facts of my crisis are not that bad . ”
It ’s that sense of pretzel logic that is most confounding when Haggard talks about judgments .
In terms of his “ crisis , ” he wo n’t cop to being gay — just “ sexually complex . ”
Yet , Haggard clings to the fundamentalist perspective of homosexuality as sin while claiming that he was never an anti-gay preacher .
Then , in the same breath he admits to supporting civil unions for gay and lesbian couples .
But as a pastor , he would n’t bless one .
It ’s not a position that is likely to score him many liberal or conservative points .
Haggard credits his therapists , The Trials of Ted Haggard director Alexandra Pelosi , Oprah , and the secular media with offering the compassion and respect his family needed to rebuild their lives .
“ I do n’t hear from the Rick Warrens or the James Dobsons , ” confided Haggard .
“ The Chuck Smiths or the Chuck Colsons .
I do n’t hear from the TBNs or the Daystars .
Or the denominational leaders . ”
“ My therapy for the past two and a half years has been recovering from rejection by the church . ”
It remains to be seen whether Haggard ’s new anti-authority message merged with his patented soft - sell evangelical vibe can spark a rebellion against the old guard .
But like Paul , Pastor
Ted does not see himself as a quiet exile .
WEIRD , wild and decidedly offbeat research findings have emerged in 2009 .
Among the most bizarre medical discoveries were : .
- Pulling a tick off the wrong way can lead to meat allergy .
An Australian doctor found the link while studying rising cases of the allergy among people who live on Sydney 's tick - prone northern beaches .
" I now tell everybody I see who lives anywhere near ticks to use ` Aerostart ' ( spray - on engine cleaner ) or another high - alcohol substance , " said Dr Sheryl van Nunen .
" Stun the tick before you scrape it out and it can't inject what it injects . "
- Serial coffee drinkers are more likely to feel " the presence of dead people " , British researchers found .
They asked students about their caffeine intake and those with the highest were also most likely to report seeing , or hearing , things that were not there .
- The hotter a common laser printer gets , the more likely it is to spew out potentially hazardous " ultrafine particles " , Australian scientists warned .
The particles can be as toxic as cigarette smoke , and 60 per cent of printers in one study were found to emit them .
- British scientists have created a custom - made bacteria that glows green when it comes into contact with chemicals leaked by buried explosives , meaning it can be used to safely detect the presence of landmines .
- A UK study found men who reported more frequent masturbation and sex during their 20s and 30s went on to have an increased risk of prostate cancer .
However this was at odds with Australian research prompting claims " bashful " Brits may have skewed the result .
" Men who have n't got the disease ... are less likely to admit to high levels of self - satisfaction , " said Melbourne 's Professor Graham Giles .
- They provide relief from the body 's aches and pains but they can also burn , doctors from an Adelaide hospital 's emergency department warned after treating a string of " wheat bag " injuries .
- The first US case of " cannabinoid hyperemesis " was recorded in the medical literature .
The syndrome was first described in 2004 in 20 South Australian men .
Sufferers experience nausea and vomiting as a result of chronic cannabis use , but these ill effects are relieved by taking a very hot shower .
" Grown men , screaming in pain , sweating profusely , vomiting every 30 seconds and demanding to be allowed to use the shower .
It 's a very dramatic presentation , " an Adelaide - based doctor said .
- US surgeons successfully restored a woman 's sight by pulling out one of her teeth , placing a lens inside the tooth and then implanting the tooth in her eyeball .
The technique can only be used when a person has a scarred cornea on an otherwise healthy eye .
- Australian medicos found a new use for saline solution .
The hospital staple is very effective at removing a leech from an eyeball .
A Sydney hospital treated a woman who had a leech " tucked up underneath her upper eyelid " .
" Our little fellow started off at about half a centimetre and by the time we removed it , it was about 2 cm long - it had quite a good lunch , " said doctor Toby Fogg .
- Caffeine does temporarily dull the body 's ability to feel pain , according to a US study that looked at how long cyclists could maintain maximum exertion .
- A study of children taken to emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand has found boys were over - represented , even when accounting for their higher accident rate .
" All of the nurses in my department think it is because males are the weaker sex , " said Dr Jason Acworth .
- A 62 - year - old cancer survivor was temporarily denied entry into the US because the drug he was taking had wiped out his fingerprints .
The journal Annals of Oncology issued a travel warning for the drug capecitabine , which lists inflammation of the hands and peeling palms among its side effects .
" Patients ... may have problems with regards to fingerprint identification when they enter US ports or other countries , " it warned .
- Brain scans on 30 Brisbane - based mums showed that some experienced a " natural high " when looking at photos of their crying child , while for others the same scenario inspired feelings of " disgust " .
- A paper in the Journal of Clinical Practice listed cases of people who drank up to nine litres of cola a day .
One man was confined to an electric scooter as a result .
Another saw his GP for muscle weakness , and admitted to drinking more than four litres a day during a trip to the Australian outback .
Excess soft drink consumption can cause " mild weakness to profound paralysis " , researchers warned .
- Many smokers feel more compelled to quit when asked to ponder the impact of their habit on their pet 's health , a US study revealed .
- Having a hook worm in your stomach was found to be an effective treatment for coeliac disease .
The parasite reduced the sensitivity of the immune system , which would otherwise malfunction and attack the stomach lining .
Despite the " yuck factor " , 20 study participants opted to keep their hookworm at the end of an Australian trial .
- Research into a 17 per cent jump in Australian men who sought tests for prostate cancer found the cause was Sam Newman .
The controversial AFL identity went public with his diagnosis in early 2008 , and it had a similar impact on prostate cancer testing as Kylie Minogue had on breast screening following her 2005 diagnosis .
- A testosterone patch designed to pep up a woman 's sex drive received the thumbs down in a study published in the UK's Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin .
The side effects included acne , excess hair , breast pain , weight gain , insomnia , voice deepening and migraine .
" Significant numbers " of women placed on a placebo patch reported an increase in sex drive .
Turkey 's government has done more for science than many .
A row over a censored magazine and a sacked editor could put the good work at risk .
It has been the biggest crisis in Turkish academia since last year 's lifting of the headscarf ban in universities .
Last week a portrait of Charles Darwin was taken off the cover of the March issue of the government - backed science magazine Bilim ve Teknik ( Science and Technology ) just before it went to press .
TÜBİTAK , Turkey 's national science funding agency , which publishes the magazine , then sacked its editor , Çiğdem Atakuman .
Scientists , assuming censorship , are justifiably outraged and protests are ongoing .
Science minister Mehmet Aydın , a historian of philosophy and religion , expressed discomfort at the cover 's removal — but also fanned the flames by commenting : “ What kind of a fight can we have with Darwin ?
The guy is already dead . ”
He made matters worse by later adding : “ [ TÜBİTAK ] is supposed to reflect the views of all those who have served science , no matter how mistaken they can be . ”
“ Although they are keen funders of research , most senior officials , in common with most of the population , do not believe in evolution . ”
TÜBİTAK vice - president Ömer Cebeci , who sits on the magazine 's editorial board , pulled the plug on Darwin .
He denied censorship , charging that Atakuman had secretly changed an issue intended to cover global warming .
Not true , says Atakuman , who says Cebeci told her that the Darwin cover was a “ provocation ” at a time of imminent local elections .
One editorial - board member of Bilim ve Teknik has resigned in protest at what he , at least , considers censorship .
This row has brought into focus two issues that plague Turkish science .
One is political interference in the scientific civil service ; the other is high levels of public support for creationism .
In Turkey , as in many countries , the civil service is expected to mirror the ruling party 's ideology .
So , although they are keen funders of research , most senior government officials , in common with most of the population , do not believe in evolution by natural selection .
The education minister Hüseyin Çelik , for example , has proclaimed his belief in intelligent design .
Yet Turkey is one of three current candidates for membership of the European Union ( EU ) .
Ankara and Istanbul house the largest overseas missions of the European Commission , whose officials are monitoring all aspects of Turkish public life and constantly advising on what needs to be done to harmonize laws and practices with those in the EU .
Science and technology was one of the first ' chapters ' that the EU said it was satisfied with and that , provisionally , did not require further reform .
Officials will now almost certainly be alarmed to see the extent of political interference in TÜBİTAK .
Only last week , the European Parliament issued a report stating that Turkey needed to make much faster progress in areas such as censorship .
European officials will see this latest episode as evidence that the country has some way to go on that score .
TÜBİTAK needs to initiate a transparent investigation into the Bilim ve Teknik affair .
The organization should also consider making an unambiguous statement of its position on evolution , intelligent design and creationism to reconfirm its credentials as a serious scientific body .
In the past , TÜBİTAK has provided reliable information on Darwin 's theory in a country where creation is offered as an alternative to evolution in high - school biology teaching .
The agency could do that again .
After all , none of the world 's religions commands its believers to be creationists .
Many Islamic scholars and thinkers have speculated on the origins of life .
Turkey 's ruling party must learn from this latest affair .
It must keep religion out of science policy , and be seen to be doing so .

“ Is this , as you call it , a church ? ” a tourist asked Monday on the west side of Civic Center .
Nope , I answered , it ’s city hall .
He , his wife and daughter looked at me blankly .
“ Denver government , ” I tried again .
And , again , no response .
The daughter translated in a language I could n’t identify .
There was chatter among family members until finally the man looked at me , incredulous .
“ Thank you and goodbye , ” he said curtly .
I blame this confusion on the baby Jesus — the plaster one on the city ’s steps .
The replica has been debated and litigated for decades , yet remains , stretched in his plaster hay , leaving foreign tourists wondering if the building is a Christian holy place .
Generations of columnists have used this space to ponder what ’s up with the manger and the life - size figurines of the characters attending Jesus ’s birth as described in the Gospels .
How is this possible , the question goes , given the separation between church and state ?
Generations of newspaper readers have responded by calling us godless idiots .
Hands off our Christ Child , their messages go .
Is n’t anything sacred ?
The nativity scene has been part of the city ’s holiday display since early last century .
“ If it had n’t been there for 85 years , I would n’t put it out there , ” Mayor John Hickenlooper told me a year after taking office .
Now after 90 years and counting , Jesus is apparently here to stay .
“ The display . . . is a holiday tradition in Denver , having survived numerous legal challenges over the years .
Even mayors have been unsuccessful in changing the display , ” reads a less than glowing statement by Hickenlooper ’s office .
James Sprecher , 23 , paid no attention to the religious figures while rushing out of city hall Monday after paying a fine .
“ It does n’t affect my life one way or the other , ” he said .
Denverite Alisha Wetstine , 31 , grew up visiting the manger at Christmastime , as did her mother .
Her own 2 - and 5 - year - olds could take it or leave it , she said , “ as long as they replaced it with something shiny . ”
Wetstine , meantime , expressed concern that the baby ’s looking sick .
“ He ’s skinnier than I remember him , ” she said .
“ And sort of funny looking , actually . ”
“ It ’s beautiful artistically and all , ” added Willie Hayes , 51 , a Denver paralegal .
“ But I ’m pretty sure it should n’t be here legally .
A religious shrine has no business on city land . ”
U.S. and Colorado Supreme Court rulings actually allow nativity scenes on government property if decorations also include figures such as a Santa Claus , reindeer and toy soldiers .
Those decisions have always mystified me — like telling your kids it ’s OK to burp really loudly at the dinner table , as long as they fart too .
After those rulings , the city added a Hannukah menorah , presumably to appease Jews who were cranky about the crèche .
The colorful candles are gone now , without official mention from the mayor .
As a card - carrying menorah lighter , I , for one , am comfortable with the apparent removal on the theory that less religion is usually more at city hall , which should n’t look like a synagogue , just as it should n’t a church .

Doctor Who : an interactive guide to his regenerations
As we prepare for the departure of David Tennant and the arrival of Matt Smith as the 11th incarnation of the Doctor , we look back at how his predecessors met their fates
Variations of a new blue pigment were developed by chemists at Oregon State University , based on manganese .
An accidental discovery in a laboratory at Oregon State University has apparently solved a quest that over thousands of years has absorbed the energies of ancient Egyptians , the Han dynasty in China , Mayan cultures and more - the creation of a near - perfect blue pigment .
Through much of recorded human history , people around the world have sought inorganic compounds that could be used to paint things blue , often with limited success .
Most had environmental or durability issues .
Cobalt blue , developed in France in the early 1800s , can be carcinogenic .
Prussian blue can release cyanide .
Other blue pigments are not stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions .
But chemists at OSU have discovered new compounds based on manganese that should address all of those concerns .
They are safer to produce , much more durable , and should lead to more environmentally benign blue pigments than any being used now or in the past .
They can survive at extraordinarily high temperatures and do n't fade after a week in an acid bath .
The findings were just published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society , and a patent has been applied for on the composition of the compound and the process used to create it .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation .
An unusual " trigonal bipyramidal coordination " of manganese compounds was used to create a new blue pigment that is safe to produce , durable and environmentally benign .
" Basically , this was an accidental discovery , " said Mas Subramanian , the Milton Harris Professor of Materials Science in the OSU Department of Chemistry .
" We were exploring manganese oxides for some interesting electronic properties they have , something that can be both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic at the same time .
Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment .
" Then one day a graduate student who is working in the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while I was walking by , and it was blue , a very beautiful blue , " he said .
" I realized immediately that something amazing had happened . "
What had happened , the researchers said , was that at about 1,200 degrees centigrade - almost 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit - this otherwise innocuous manganese oxide turned into a vivid blue compound that could be used to make a pigment able to resist heat and acid , be environmentally benign and cheap to produce from a readily available mineral .
The newest - and possibly the best - blue pigment in world history was born , due to manganese ions being structured in an unusual " trigonal bipyramidal coordination " in the presence of extreme heat .
" Ever since the early Egyptians developed some of the first blue pigments , the pigment industry has been struggling to address problems with safety , toxicity and durability , " Subramanian said .
The pigment may eventually find uses in everything from inkjet printers to automobiles , fine art or house paint , researchers say .
The scientists said in their journal article that the new compound yields " a surprisingly intense and bright blue color , " and they have outlined its structure and characteristics in detail .
Collaborating on the work were researchers in the Materials Department at the University of California / Santa Barbara .
" A lot of the most interesting discoveries are not really planned , we 've seen that throughout history , " Subramanian said .
" There is luck involved , but I also teach my students that you have to stay alert to recognize something when it happens , even if it is n't what you were looking for . "
" Luck favors the alert mind . "

Priključen na halucinogeni Južni tok : Andrija Hebrang

Brat Boro i Nadanova muškost
U jednoj novinskoj anketi gdje se kojetko izjašnjava o kandidatima za Pantovčak , oglasio se i Boro Gotovina , po zanimanju umirovljeni hrvatski branitelj i brat generala Ante Gotovine .
Ova nam je ugledna ličnost , široj javnosti poznata i po batinanju novinara , otkrila da će svoj uvaženi glas dati Draganu Primorcu , što je i više nego očekivano ako se zna da njih dvojica imaju sličan rukopis , da po onome koga se dohvate pišu s obje ruke , a pomognu se i nogom koristeći kaligrafsku tehniku zvanu mavashi geri .
Među Gotovininim opservacijama o predsjedničkim kandidatima najzanimljivija je ona o Nadanu Vidoševiću .
U njega brat Boro nema povjerenja , jer Vidošević , kaže , " nema muškosti , a preferiraju ga žene koje ga nisu dovoljno upoznale " .
Ne objašnjava pritom ugledni ocjenjivač ni kako se uvjerio u stanje Vidoševićeve muškosti ni otkud mu saznanja o ženama nedovoljno upućenim u predmet Gotovinina interesa .
Znatiželjni čitatelji stoga pojma nemaju je li brat Boro išao pa pitao , je li virio pa se uznemirio , jesu li mu dame prilazile same ili ih je svijećom tražio .
Ne znaju ni zašto se Gotovina uhvatio samo Vidoševićeve muškosti , zašto u svojoj analitičnosti nije potegnuo i muškost Bandićevu , Tuđmanovu , Jurčevićevu , Kajinovu , Josipovićevu ...
Nije vrag da samo jednu muškost drži vrijednom svoje pozornosti .
Ako ste pomislili da se Gotovina ustremio na tu jednu muškost iz dobrohotnosti prema ženama , on će vas bez puno truda uvjeriti koliko drži do kavalirskih sklonosti koje ste mu neoprezno pripisali .
O jedinoj dami koju spominje u anketi , buraz Boro džentlmenski kaže kako ona definitivno ne zaslužuje ni ocjenu ni njegov komentar .
I dodaje kako ta žena nikad neće biti njegov predsjednik države , " čak kad bi i bila izabrana " .
Jer mu je prezir prema ženama sva mjera muškosti .

Zimske sorte kuhanoga kupusa
Da vam pričam o mome doživljaju globalnoga zatopljenja ili vam je dosta i vašega ?
Vjerujem da vam nije ni do čega , ali ja ovu toplinu oko srca ipak moram s nekim podijeliti .
Ponosno vam , dakle , prijavljujem kako mi je globalno zatopljenje omogućilo da oborim osobni toplinski rekord i da se zateknem na minus 27 stupnjeva Celzijusa .
Netko će možda odmahnuti rukom na tako mizeran rezultat , jer je preživio i veću hladnoću , ali onima koji nisu bili na tolikom minusu moram prenijeti svoje mistično - religijsko iskustvo .
Na tih mi se minus 27 iza svakog bijelog crnogoričnog stabla ukazivao vrag koji me je tjerao da od svih mjesta na uskuhanom planetu putujem baš kroz globalno nezatopljene predjele , globalno nezagrijanim autom i da obijam vrata planinskih krčmi , uzalud traže ći kavu , čaj ili kuhano vino .
Taj vrag je sredio da nigdje ne bude ni struje ni plina , a ni etnografskog muzeja u kojem bi se mogao pronaći štednjak na drva .
I nagonio me je taj vrag da se polumrtav - poluhladan smijem i Kopenhagenu i američko - kineskoj klimatskoj neodgovornosti o kojoj je spiker na radiju govorio globalno uspaljenim glasom .
Photo : wordpress.com
Po dolasku u civilizaciju , na humanih minus 15 , zatekao sam i struju i kavu , a i novine s prigodnim tekstom o kanadskom geologu Williamu Pattersonu koji je navodno dokazao znanstvenu utemeljenost apokaliptičnog filma " Dan poslije sutra " , gdje se svijet smrzne baš uslijed globalnoga zatopljenja .
U drugim novinama drugi klimatsko - katastrofični scenarij , naravno , i on znanstveno utemeljen .
Raspričala se makedonska klimatologinja Nataša Markovska o Sahari koja putuje na sjever i prijeti da se popne na Biokovo , a ja i na to ostao mrtav-hladan .
Zašto ?
Pa zbog upravo dokazane činjenice da globalno zatopljenje pogoduje uzgoju kuhanoga kupusa u glavama .
Što znači da za svijet nema zime .

Pravljenje pravih navijača
Otrovna si kao zmija , proći ćeš ko Ćuruvija !
– skandirali su tifosi Partizana svoju ubilačku poruku Brankici Stanković , novinarki kojoj nije bilo dosta što je svojim lanjskim TV - serijalom o mafijaškoj mreži u srpskom nogometu izazvala epidemiju hapšenja , nego se sada zamjerila i nevinoj dječici s tribina .
Ona je u svom novom serijalu otkrila da su mnogi ugledni navijački lideri ujedno i optuženici za teška kriminalna djela koja nikako da dođu na sudsku naplatu .
I zaključila da razlog za njihovo neprocesuiranje ne leži u mistificiranom balkanskom javašluku nego u čudesnoj činjenici da u upravama klubova sjede brojni suci i predsjednici sudova .
Sljedbenici prozvanih bogova iz navijačke gomile odgovorili su novinarki masovnim prijetnjama ubojstvom i silovanjem , pa se i policija prestala praviti da to nije njezin posao .
Privedeno je nekoliko autora prijetećih elektronskih poruka , a potom i sedmorica iz mnoštva koje je na tribinama rimovalo zmiju i davno ubijenog Slavka Ćuruviju .
Među komentarima koji hvale odlučnost policije i unisonost javnih osuda navijačkoga nasilništva što stižu sa sportskih i političkih adresa , za oko zapinje jedan gdje se kaže kako prijetnje Brankici Stanković nažalost još uvijek nisu osudili – pravi navijači .
Ta fraza o pravim navijačima šuplje je odzvanjala i u nedavnom hrvatskom ratu protiv izljeva mržnje i nasilja na tribinama , zavr šenom prije no što je započeo .
Đurđa Adlešič , imenovana državnim centarforom za borbu protiv huligana , povukla se u roku odmah , jer je za nju , kao i za cijelu hrvatsku vlast , ta na sva usta najavljivana " odlučna akcija " bila samo mlaka politička tekma s dogovorenim rezultatom 0:0 .
Brankica Stanković ne bježi s terena , jer njezina utakmica protiv moćnika i siled žija nije lažirana .
I nastavlja igrati sama protiv gomile .

Hebrangov Boško Čubrilović
Teško da se na scenu šibenske kazališne zgrade ikada popeo lošiji glumac od Andrije Hebranga .
To se čudo od antitalenta usred svoga dosadnog predizbornog monologa počelo nakašljavati , onako kako to rade frustrirani nosioci sporednih uloga kada žele upozoriti na svoju scensku prisutnost .
Nakašljao se , dakle , Andrija Hebrang , ne bi li pokazao da on nije mačji kašalj kakvim ga smatraju , a disciplinirana je publika to shvatila kao znak da povadi papirnate maramice i da počne kašljati , kihati , šmrcati , soptati , dahtati i preglumljivati umiranje .
Pohrlio auditorij iz dvorane tražeći spas od gušenja , ali se glavni glumac nije dao otjerati s pozornice .
Odverglao je svoj rasplinuti monolog do kraja , nastavio je govoriti i kada je napokon sišao s bine , pa mu se u nekontroliranom brbljanju dogodilo da otkrije i scenski trik kojim se pokušao upisati u povijest šibenskog teatra .
" Kihavac nam je netko u klimu stavio !
To su uobičajene metode kojima se koristi hrvatska ljevica u borbi za Pantovčak ! " – bulaznio je Hebrang kao da se doista nagutao ukapljenog nervnog plina , kao da ga je netko priključio na halucinogeni " Južni tok " .
Unatoč tome što je policija utvrdila da nije bilo nikakvog kihavca u ventilacijskom sustavu i unatoč tome što je Paško Mikulandra , koji je u dvorani štrcnuo suzavac iz bočice , bio član nekoliko desnih strančica , ne treba sumnjati da će Hebrang do kraja kampanje , a možda i do kraja svijeta , halucinirati o ljevičarskom plinskom napadu .
Pamti on kako je njegova stranka 1990 .
kapitalizirala nevje što režirani atentat plinskim pištoljem na Franju Tuđmana u Benkovcu .

CHICAO – After a 10 - week strike to save their jobs , health care and union , seventy Teamster Local 743 members at S K Handtools voted 3 to 1 to accept the company offer and began returning to work Nov. 6 .
The strike garnered national headlines after the company dropped health care coverage without notifying the workers , many of whom went into debt for thousands of dollars of medical expenses before they found out .
S K Handtools , maker of metal tools including the Sears Craftsman brand , tried to maintain production with scabs but the unity of the workers and solidarity from the labor movement prevented a resumption of full production .
All the scabs have been fired and the workers are being called back by seniority .
“ These brave sisters and brothers stood together on the picket line 24 hours a day and became the voice of workers in the national health care debate .
Political pressure from the governor , several U.S. congressmen and U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis , along with the informational leafleting at Sears stores , showed SK that the Union was serious in its demands , ” stated Local 743 President Richard Berg .
The National Labor Relations Board issued an unfair labor practice complaint saying the company had bargained illegally by stopping health care coverage without notice .
Negotiations for a new contract had begun earlier in the year , and the company had demanded wage concessions but never expressed concerns about health care coverage .
Illinois Gov.
Pat Quinn was one of many elected officials and supporters who condemned the callous action of the company and joined the workers on the picket line .
In ending the strike , the workers were forced to make the difficult concession of a 20 percent pay cut the first year of the new contract .
Small increases accompany the 2nd and 3rd year of the contract .
The company refused to pay for the medical bills of the workers .
SK Handtools , in business for 88 years , is a small company and maintained it was in financial trouble because of the economic crisis and could n’t continue to operate without some concessions .
By preserving their jobs and union the workers win a chance to fight another day and restore the concessions .
“ Because we are Teamsters and willing to fight , we ’re now the only employees at SK with health insurance .
This is something that all Americans should have , ” said Emilio Lunar , SK steward and strike leader .

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg speaks during the Muslim Voices : Arts & Ideas festival in New York June 5 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent more of his own money in pursuit of public office than any other individual in U.S. history , spending $ 85 million as of Friday on his latest reelection campaign , the New York Times reported on Saturday .
Citing newly released campaign records , the Times said Bloomberg was on pace to spend between $ 110 and $ 140 million before the November 3 mayoral election .
That means the self - made billionaire will have spent more than $ 250 million in his three bids for mayor of America ’s most fabled city .
In contrast , New Jersey Governor and former Goldman Sachs chairman Jon Corzine spent about $ 130 million in two races for governor and one for the U.S. Senate , the Times reported .
And publisher Steve Forces poured $ 114 million into two bids for president , it said .
Bloomberg ’s wealth , much of it from the Bloomberg LP media and information empire , is estimated at $ 16 billion .
He has used it to establish what the Times called an “ insurmountable financial dominance ” in the race .
His opponent , William C Thompson , a Democrat , has spent just $ 6 million in the race .
A Thompson campaign spokeswoman on Friday told the Times the mayor ’s spending was “ obscene . ”
The bulk of Bloomberg ’s spending has gone into television , radio and Web advertising , it said .
But some of the money has trickled down to recession - hit small businesses , including Goodfellas Brick Over Pizza on Staten Island and in the Bronx .
The Bloomberg campaign has so far forked over $ 8,892 for pizza at Goodfellas alone .
Thomson Reuters competes globally with Bloomberg in the delivery of multimedia news , data and enhanced information .
Berkeley activists can sue federal agents for their role in a 2008 raid in which officers seized their computers and records in search of alleged threats by animal - rights advocates , a federal judge ruled Monday .
The activist group Long Haul Inc. can try to prove that the search of its Berkeley offices exceeded legal boundaries , that agents misled the judge who issued a search warrant and that it was targeted because of its left - wing views , said U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White .
An unaffiliated group with offices in the same Berkeley building , East Bay Prisoner Support , also won the right to sue on the same grounds .
Both groups have also sued the University of California , whose police were involved in the raid .
The university did not join the federal government 's attempt to dismiss the suit .
Long Haul operates a bookstore , public computer terminals and meeting rooms at a storefront on 3124 Shattuck Ave .
A judge approved the search warrant in August 2008 after a UC police detective said threatening messages to animal researchers at UC Berkeley two months earlier had been sent from a computer at the storefront .
UC police , two federal agents and other officers entered the building the next day while it was closed .
The suit said they had broken into locked doors and cabinets , seized all 14 computers in the building , combed through library and bookstore records , and taken computer drives and other items from both Long Haul and East Bay Prisoner Support , which was not named in the warrant .
The suit said officers had no evidence that either group was involved in illegal acts and had failed to tell the judge that both groups publish newspapers , a status that requires special justification for law enforcement searches .
In seeking dismissal , the federal government said its officers had believed that tracing the threats and seizing the records was necessary to prevent serious harm .
But
White said that argument depends on disputed facts he can't resolve at this stage , and that the two - month interval between the messages and the raid weakens the government 's claim of an emergency .
White , an appointee of former President George W. Bush , said the two groups could also sue the government for allegedly violating their right of free speech , but must present evidence that officers had been motivated by the groups ' political views .
I saw a 3 pound bag of apples for $ 1 at the farmer ’s market .
One dollar !
I did n’t even know what I was going to do with it .
Apple pie , apple cake , doughnuts , fresh cider , apple crisps , the options are endless , and it did n’t matter because it felt like it was basically free .
Sometimes , you just feel like a winner and yes , it is that easy to make my day .
I decided on apple sauce because Lon loves apple sauce , but that was just too easy .
I had to make it special .
Cinnamon , ginger , all spice , nutmeg would all be old news , good news , and he would n’t complain , but I just would n’t be completely satisfied .
That ’s when I took a sip of my tea , while the scent from peeling apples was wafting around me , and it hit me , Earl Grey Apple Sauce .
I itched until the apple sauce was done and with one taste I knew , I just won again !
I ’m on a roll !
It ’s Earl Grey perfumed apple sauce , and it ’s wonderful .
I had it on some yogurt this morning and I ate tons by itself last night .
Put it on vanilla ice cream or smother it onto pork chops .
Honestly , I do n’t even know what kind of apples were in my 3 lb bag .
I think it was a mix and you can use whatever type you like , but the amount of sugar and water needed will vary by apple type so just use this recipe as a guideline , and then you can adjust at the end .
Earl Grey Apple Sauce
~about 5 cups
3 lbs apples , peeled , cored , and quartered
1 cup water
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 Earl Grey tea bag ( paper removed )
Instructions –
1 . Stir together apples , water , sugar , and salt in a medium pot .
Bring to a boil .
2 . Add tea bag , making sure it is submerged in the water .
Turn down to a simmer , cover and cook for 15 minutes , stirring occasionally .
Un-cover and continue to simmer for another 15 minutes .
3 . Remove the tea bag and discard .
Mash apples in the pot with a potato masher for chunky , or place in a blender for a smoother apple sauce .
You can add water or cook off more liquid , depending on your preference .
You can also adjust the sweetness to your preference .
Serve warm or cold .

Title : Deflecting a Hazardous Near - Earth Object Author(s ) : D.K. Yeomans , S. Bhaskaran , S.B. Broschart , S.R. Chesley , et al .

Abstract :
This short report on Near - Earth Object ( NEO ) hazard mitigation strategies was developed in response to a request for information by the U.S. National Research Council 's Space Sciences Board on December 17 , 2008 and for the Planetary Defense Conference that took place 27 - 30 April 2009 in Granada Spain .
Although we present example simulations for specific techniques that could be employed to deflect an Earth threatening NEO , our primary goal is to discuss some of the general principles and techniques that would be germane to all NEO deflection scenarios .
This report summarizes work that was carried out in early 2009 and extends an earlier , more detailed study carried out in late 2008 .
After a long year hallmarked by bare - knuckle politics and a bevy of experimental attacks against a freshman president , a lone voice has resonated more than others in the war against reality .
Glenn Beck , the Fox News personality notorious for wandering , vague allegations of communism , racism and all - around quasi-evildoings within the Obama administration , has been named “ Misinformer of the Year ” by watchdog group Media Matters .

“ When he was n’t calling the president a racist , portraying progressive leaders as vampires who can only be stopped by ‘ driv[ing ] a stake through the heart of the bloodsuckers , ’ or pushing the legitimacy of seceding from the country , Beck obsessively compared Democrats in Washington to Nazis and fascists and ‘ the early days of Adolf Hitler , ' ” the group opined .
“ He wondered , ‘ Is this where we ’re headed , ’ while showing images of Hitler , Stalin , and Lenin ; decoded the secret language of Marxists ; and compared the government to ‘ heroin pushers ’ who were ‘ using smiley - faced fascism to grow the nanny state . ' ”
Among Beck ’s 2009 highlights , he most memorably :
And that ’s just the beginning .
In honor of Mr. Beck , Media Matters pieced together a lengthy recap of of his other highlights , available here .
“ For what it ’s worth : past Misinformer of the Year recipients include Sean Hannity ( 2008 ) , ABC ( 2006 ) , Chris Matthews ( 2005 ) , and Bill O’Reilly ( 2004 ) , ” Mediaite added .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
From their very first days , newborns ' cries already bear the mark of the language their parents speak , reveals a new study published online on November 5th in Current Biology , a Cell Press publication .
The findings suggest that infants begin picking up elements of what will be their first language in the womb , and certainly long before their first babble or coo .
" The dramatic finding of this study is that not only are human neonates capable of producing different cry melodies , but they prefer to produce those melody patterns that are typical for the ambient language they have heard during their fetal life , within the last trimester of gestation , " said Kathleen Wermke of the University of Würzburg in Germany .
" Contrary to orthodox interpretations , these data support the importance of human infants ' crying for seeding language development . "
Human fetuses are able to memorize sounds from the external world by the last trimester of pregnancy , with a particular sensitivity to melody contour in both music and language , earlier studies showed .
Newborns prefer their mother 's voice over other voices and perceive the emotional content of messages conveyed via intonation contours in maternal speech ( a.k.a. " motherese " ) .
Their perceptual preference for the surrounding language and their ability to distinguish between different languages and pitch changes are based primarily on melody .
Although prenatal exposure to native language was known to influence newborns ' perception , scientists had thought that the surrounding language affected sound production much later , the researchers said .
It now appears that is n't so .
Wermke 's team recorded and analyzed the cries of 60 healthy newborns , 30 born into French - speaking families and 30 born into German - speaking families , when they were three to five days old .
That analysis revealed clear differences in the shape of the newborns ' cry melodies , based on their mother tongue .
The cry melody of french ( left ) and german ( right ) babies differs considerably with respect to the accentuation .
Image : MPI für Kognitions - und Neurowissenschaften
Specifically , French newborns tend to cry with a rising melody contour , whereas German newborns seem to prefer a falling melody contour in their crying .
Those patterns are consistent with characteristic differences between the two languages , Wermke said .
The new data show an extremely early impact of native language , the researchers say .
Earlier studies of vocal imitation had shown that infants can match vowel sounds presented to them by adult speakers , but only from 12 weeks on .
That skill depends on vocal control that just is n't physically possible much earlier , the researchers explain .
" Imitation of melody contour , in contrast , is merely predicated upon well - coordinated respiratory - laryngeal mechanisms and is not constrained by articulatory immaturity , " they write .
" Newborns are probably highly motivated to imitate their mother 's behavior in order to attract her and hence to foster bonding .
Because melody contour may be the only aspect of their mother 's speech that newborns are able to imitate , this might explain why we found melody contour imitation at that early age . "

Lightweight USB Framework for AVRs ( LUFA ) December 8 , 2009
Lately I ’ve been killing off course requirements by taking project based courses .
Happily , Bart Massey offered a Linux device driver course that gave me an opportunity to get my hands dirty in the embedded world again .
The project was to make an AVR based USB gadget do something … anything .
Most prior experience with µ Cs was with Rabbits – a fitting name seeing as the useful and higher level libraries seemed to multiply like rabbits .
Unfortunately , the AVRs did n’t have any apparent high level library for USB ; many of the examples used commented byte arrays as USB descriptors .
While understandable , this feels harder to debug , ugly , and just generally wrong .
Enter LUFA .
LUFA
LUFA is a high - level USB library for AVRs generously released under MIT .
It has considerable documentation , but no real guide stating what the bare - minimum functions are for any new / custom gadget – this is my attempt at providing such a guide .
After you verify your AVR is supported by LUFA go ahead and download LUFA to an includes directory for your project .
All code here is made possible by LUFA and its included examples – I ’ll only claim to being the original author of any and all bugs .
My Device
Before going any further you should have an understanding of what your device will do , how many and what type of USB endpoints it will use ( BULK , INTERRUPT , CONTROL , ISOCRONOUS ) , and what driver will support it .
If you are making something that will use a generic driver , such as a HID , then you probably can stop here as there is plenty of code for you to use – this post is aimed at people making custom devices .
I ’m using a Teensy 2.0 with three bulk interfaces ( two OUT one IN ) .
One OUT provides commands to the gadget , which will change its state .
Another OUT will send jobs to the gadget and the final IN will read the results of those jobs .
This requires a custom driver which I and several other folks developed for course work .
The Makefile
Its probably safe for you to rip - off one of the makefiles from an example in LUFA / Demo / Devices / LowLevel / .
Noitice several of the defines change the API , defines I used for this post / project include :
-DUSB_DEVICE_ONLY #
Saves space if you only need gadget - side code - DNO_STREAM_CALLBACKS #
Changes the API to exclude any callbacks on streams - DINTERRUPT_CONTROL_ENDPOINT
#
So you do n't have to call USB_USBTask ( ) manually on a regular basis - DUSE_FLASH_DESCRIPTORS #
Save RAM , leave these in the Flash - DUSE_STATIC_OPTIONS= " ( USB_DEVICE_OPT_FULLSPEED | USB_OPT_AUTO_PLL ) "
EDIT : All the makefiles I ’ve seen are broken , they do n’t properly track dependencies , so either fix that or be sure to ‘ make clean ’ prior to each build .
Enumeration
When your gadget is plugged in its going to have to enumerate its interfaces by sending descriptors to the host .
Start by declaring a global USB_Descriptor_Device_t along with Language , Manufacturer and Product structures :
USB_Descriptor_Device_t PROGMEM DeviceDescriptor = { .
Header = {. Size = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Device_t ) , . Type = DTYPE_Device} , .USBSpecification = VERSION_BCD ( 01.10 ) , . Class = 0xff , . SubClass = 0xaa , . Protocol = 0x00 , . Endpoint0
Size = FIXED_CONTROL_ENDPOINT_SIZE , . VendorID = 0x16c0 , . ProductID = 0x0478 , . ReleaseNumber = 0x0000 , .ManufacturerStrIndex = 0x01 , . ProductStrIndex = 0x02 , .SerialNumStrIndex = USE_INTERNAL_SERIAL , .NumberOfConfigurations = FIXED_NUM_CONFIGURATIONS
} ; USB_Descriptor_String_t PROGMEM LanguageString = { .
Header = {.
Size = USB_STRING_LEN ( 1 ) , . Type = DTYPE_String} , . UnicodeString = {LANGUAGE_ID_ENG} } ; USB_Descriptor_String_t PROGMEM ManufacturerString = { .
Header = {.
Size = USB_STRING_LEN ( 3 ) , . Type = DTYPE_String} , . UnicodeString = L" JRT " } ; USB_Descriptor_String_t PROGMEM ProductString = { .
Header = {. Size = USB_STRING_LEN ( 13 ) , . Type = DTYPE_String} , . UnicodeString = L" Micro Storage " } ;
You ’ll also need a descriptor that enumerates your interfaces and endpoints .
Seeing as this is specific to your project , and C is a significantly limited language , you ’ll need to make a quick structure declaration then fill that structure :
typedef struct { USB_Descriptor_Configuration_Header_t Config ; USB_Descriptor_Interface_t Interface ; USB_Descriptor_Endpoint_t DataInEndpoint ; USB_Descriptor_Endpoint_t DataOutEndpoint ; USB_Descriptor_Endpoint_t CommandEndpoint ; } USB_Descriptor_Configuration_t ; USB_Descriptor_Configuration_t PROGMEM ConfigurationDescriptor = { . Config = { .
Header = {. Size = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Configuration_Header_t ) , . Type = DTYPE_Configuration} , .TotalConfigurationSize = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Configuration_t ) , . TotalInterfaces = 1 , .ConfigurationNumber = 1 , .ConfigurationStrIndex = NO_DESCRIPTOR , .ConfigAttributes = USB_CONFIG_ATTR_BUSPOWERED , .MaxPowerConsumption = USB_CONFIG_POWER_MA( 100 ) } , . Interface = { .
Header = {. Size = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Interface_t ) , . Type = DTYPE_Interface} , .
InterfaceNumber = 0 , . AlternateSetting = 0 , . TotalEndpoints = 3 , . Class = 0xff , . SubClass = 0xaa , . Protocol = 0x0 , .InterfaceStrIndex = NO_DESCRIPTOR } , .DataInEndpoint = { .
Header = {.
Size = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Endpoint_t ) , . Type = DTYPE_Endpoint} , .EndpointAddress = ( ENDPOINT_DESCRIPTOR_DIR_IN | BULK_IN_EPNUM ) , . Attributes = ( EP_TYPE_BULK | ENDPOINT_ATTR_NO_SYNC | ENDPOINT_USAGE_DATA ) , .EndpointSize = BULK_IN_EPSIZE , .PollingIntervalMS = 0x00 } , .DataOutEndpoint = { .
Header = {. Size = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Endpoint_t ) , . Type = DTYPE_Endpoint} , .EndpointAddress = ( ENDPOINT_DESCRIPTOR_DIR_OUT | BULK_OUT_EPNUM ) , . Attributes = ( EP_TYPE_BULK | ENDPOINT_ATTR_NO_SYNC | ENDPOINT_USAGE_DATA ) , .EndpointSize = BULK_OUT_EPSIZE , .PollingIntervalMS = 0x00 } , .CommandEndpoint = { .
Header = {. Size = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Endpoint_t ) , . Type = DTYPE_Endpoint} , .EndpointAddress = ( ENDPOINT_DESCRIPTOR_DIR_OUT | COMMAND_EPNUM ) , . Attributes = ( EP_TYPE_BULK | ENDPOINT_ATTR_NO_SYNC | ENDPOINT_USAGE_DATA ) , .EndpointSize = COMMAND_EPSIZE , .PollingIntervalMS = 0x00 } } ;
So now you see I have a device with a single interface and three bulk endpoints ( two OUT and one IN ) .
Remember , in USB terminology OUT means from the HOST to the GADGET while IN means from the GADGET to the HOST .
While there is a direction to these channels , USB 1.0 and 2.0 BULK communications start with the host sending a message to the device ( i.e. IN endpoints are polled ) and the device should always respond .
Now that we have descriptors lets be sure to send them when the host tries to enumerate the device .
uint16_t CALLBACK_USB_GetDescriptor ( const uint16_t wValue , const uint8_t wIndex , void ** const DescriptorAddress ) { const uint8_t DescriptorType = ( wValue >> 8 ) ; const uint8_t DescriptorNumber = ( wValue & 0xFF ) ; void *
Address = NULL ; uint16_t Size = NO_DESCRIPTOR ; switch ( DescriptorType ) { case DTYPE_Device : Address = ( void * ) &DeviceDescriptor ; Size = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Device_t ) ; break ; case DTYPE_Configuration : Address = ( void* ) &ConfigurationDescriptor ; Size = sizeof ( USB_Descriptor_Configuration_t ) ; break ; case DTYPE_String : switch ( DescriptorNumber ) { case 0x00 : Address = ( void * ) &LanguageString ; Size = pgm_read_byte(&LanguageString .Header .
Size ) ; break ; case 0x01 : Address = ( void* ) &ManufacturerString ; Size = pgm_read_byte( &ManufacturerString .Header .
Size ) ; break ; case 0x02 : Address = ( void * ) & ProductString ; Size = pgm_read_byte( &ProductString .Header .
Size ) ; break ; } break ; } * DescriptorAddress = Address ; return Size ; }
With this , and calling USB_Init ( ) when your device starts up , you should have a gadget that is properly enumerated by the matching driver .
Once a configuration is selected we need to configure the endpoints , but after that we can finally send and receive data !
void EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged ( void ) { int i,succ=1 ; succ &= Endpoint_ConfigureEndpoint ( BULK_IN_EPNUM , EP_TYPE_BULK , ENDPOINT_DIR_IN , BULK_IN_EPSIZE , ENDPOINT_BANK_SINGLE ) ; succ &= Endpoint_ConfigureEndpoint ( BULK_OUT_EPNUM , EP_TYPE_BULK , ENDPOINT_DIR_OUT , BULK_OUT_EPSIZE , ENDPOINT_BANK_SINGLE ) ; succ &= Endpoint_ConfigureEndpoint( COMMAND_EPNUM , EP_TYPE_BULK , ENDPOINT_DIR_OUT , COMMAND_EPSIZE , ENDPOINT_BANK_SINGLE ) ; LED_CONFIG ; while (!succ ) { LED_ON ; _delay_ms ( 1000 ) ; LED_OFF ; _delay_ms ( 1000 ) ; } for( i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i ++ ) { LED_ON ; _delay_ms ( 50 ) ; LED_OFF ; _delay_ms ( 50 ) ; } }
Now to handle any data on the endpoints , you ’ll probably want to tight loop around code that checks each endpoint , reads data , and performs some action :
if ( USB_DeviceState != DEVICE_STATE_Configured ) return ; Endpoint_SelectEndpoint ( BULK_IN_EPNUM ) ; if ( Endpoint_IsConfigured ( ) && Endpoint_IsINReady ( ) && Endpoint_IsReadWriteAllowed ( ) ) { do_something ( state , data , &len ) ; err = Endpoint_Write_Stream_LE(( void *) data , len ) ; // FIXME handle err Endpoint_ClearIN ( ) ; } Endpoint_SelectEndpoint ( BULK_OUT_EPNUM ) ; if ( Endpoint_IsConfigured ( ) && Endpoint_IsOUTReceived ( ) && Endpoint_IsReadWriteAllowed ( ) ) { err = Endpoint_Read_Stream_LE( data , len ) ; do_other_thing ( data , len ) ; Endpoint_ClearOUT ( ) ; } Endpoint_SelectEndpoint( COMMAND_EPNUM ) ; if ( Endpoint_IsConfigured ( ) && Endpoint_IsOUTReceived ( ) && Endpoint_IsReadWriteAllowed ( ) ) { usb_cmd_t cmd ; err = Endpoint_Read_Stream_LE( &cmd , sizeof ( usb_cmd_t ) ) ; update_state ( cmd ) ; Endpoint_ResetFIFO( BULK_IN_EPNUM ) ; Endpoint_ResetFIFO( BULK_OUT_EPNUM ) ; Endpoint_ClearOUT ( ) ; }
And that ’s the whole deal .
Some things to take note of :
1 ) I do n’t know why I needed Endpoint_ResetFIFO ( ) – my results lagged by one message without them but I feel certain this is not the correct way to fix the issue .
Perhaps I need to reset the endpoints some time after configuration and before use , but I ’m not sure which callback to use for that , if that ’s the case .
2 ) C needs phantom types .
Many of these functions are n’t intended for use with CONTROL endpoints .
See the LUFA documentation for which functions to use if you have non-BULK endpoints .
3 ) Be sure to number your ENDPOINTS starting at 1 ( the * _EPNUM values ) .
I ’ve seen unusual behavior when numbering started higher – not sure if that was against standards or not .
Conclusion
At a minimum , you must declare a “ USB_Descriptor_Device_t ” variable , three “ USB_Descriptor_String_t ” variables ( Language , Manufacturer , Product ) , a custom “ USB_Descriptor_Configuration_t ” structure and variable .
Also declare a function named “ CALLBACK_USB_GetDescriptor ” and one called “ EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged( void ) ” which calls
“ Endpoint_ConfigureEndpoint ( *_EPNUM , EP_TYPE_{BULK , INT , CONTROL , ISOC} , ENDPOINT_DIR_{IN, OUT} , *_EPSIZE , ENDPOINT_BANK_{DOUBLE,SINGLE} ) ; ” for each endpoint in the configuration .
Finally use “ Endpoint_SelectEndpoint (*_EPNUM ) ” followed by “ Endpoint_Is{INReady , OutReceived} ( ) && Endpoint_IsReadWriteAllowed ( ) ” to select an endpoint and check for data .
Finish all this by reading your stream “ Endpoint_Read_Stream_LE ( buf , len ) ” and issue a call to “ Endpoint_Clear {IN, OUT} ( ) ” when done .
During the summer , I ’ve had the pleasure to mentor Michał Mandrysz , as he created an External Lightmapping Tool for Unity , as part of Unity ’s Summer Of Code .
As of today , you can download the tool from the resources section of our website .
What is it ?
A tool that lets you use 3d Studio Max to make great looking lighting for your game .
I ’ve been making lightmaps for ages already , why would I care ?
Because with this tool , you can actually layout your scenes in Unity .
Previously if you wanted to use lightmaps , you ’d usually layout your scenes in 3d Studio Max or Maya or some other tool , and would have had a hard time moving things around in Unity later on .
Do you have some examples for this ?
Take a look at this video tutorial from Michał , going over the example project included with the tool .
Great .
Do I need to prepare my assets in any way to make this work ?
You need to provide lightmap texturecoordinates for all meshes that you want to have lightmapped .
However each object can have its own seperate lightmap sheet .
The tool will take all lightmap sheets from all specified objects in the scene , put them all into one mega lightmap sheet , export your scene to fbx , have Max import the fbx , have Max generate a lightmap , and then that lightmap gets picked up by Unity automatically .
Take a look at this more detailed screencast , which goes trough this process , and shows how to go from an empty project to a lightmapped environment .
But I do n’t use max !
I use …..
There ’s nothing in the tool that makes the technique inherently limited to 3d Studio Max .
However the tool does provide some nice extensions to Max that make the lighting baking a one click process .
With a bit of effort , one could take this project , and make it work for other authoring tools .
I still have some other question

Scientists in Belgium have uncovered a new way to shake things up .
Violent bouncing of a water droplet coated with oil causes the oil layer to move inside and fracture into many oily globs .
In a paper published in the December Chaos , researchers at the University of Liège in Belgium call this microemulsion of oil and water the mayonnaise droplet .
From earlier experiments , researchers knew that oily droplets bounce several times on a bed of oil before merging with the oil base .
But Denis Terwagne and colleagues wanted to know what would happen to an oil - coated water droplet if the bouncing was prolonged .
To find out , the team constructed a moving base that would quickly raise and lower the oil bed , similar to using a horizontal Ping - Pong paddle to keep a ball bouncing .
When the oil - coated water droplet hit the oil surface and deformed , some of the outer oil layer was ushered into the interior of the droplet .
Subsequent bounces shattered this interior oil glob , creating a thoroughly mixed oil - in - water - in oil droplet , the researchers found .
Understanding the forces that govern the mayonnaise droplet may help scientists design new microfluidic systems .
Bouncing droplets could enable more efficient ways to create complex mixtures of liquids , such as for cosmetics or pharmaceuticals .

There are many cheap luxuries which my dive buddies can bring aboard our little dive boat , and one of these is the Handpresso , a portable , pump action espresso maker .
We had two of these on board our boat .
There ’s nothing like a shot of espresso ( or a latte ) right after a dive .
Surfacing from the ocean leaves you discombobulated and dizzy from the waves to the point that water may not be enough to help you get your bearings back .
However , a shot of espresso can do the trick .
Above is a video of some of my dive buddies using pods for the Handpresso .
All you need is hot water , pump it up to 10 bar and extract the pod into your cup .
By George , it even produces crema !
There are many versions of the Handpresso — the most popular would be the pod version for the sake of portability .
But the Handpresso Wild Domepod is also a winner for ground beans .
What a perfect Christmas gift for traveling caffeine lovers !
The whole set will cost you about 169,00 € .
Not bad !
PRESIDENT OBAMA should not lament but sigh in relief that Iran has rejected his nuclear deal , which was ill conceived from the start .
Under the deal , which was formally offered through the United Nations , Iran was to surrender some 2,600 pounds of lightly enriched uranium ( some three - quarters of its known stockpile ) to Russia , and the next year get back a supply of uranium fuel sufficient to run its Tehran research reactor for three decades .
The proposal did not require Iran to halt its enrichment program , despite several United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding such a moratorium .
Iran was thus to be rewarded with much - coveted reactor fuel despite violating international law .
Within a year , or sooner in light of its expanding enrichment program , Iran would almost certainly have replenished and augmented its stockpile of enriched uranium , nullifying any ostensible nonproliferation benefit of the deal .
Moreover , by providing reactor fuel , the plan would have fostered proliferation in two ways .
First , Iran could have continued operating its research reactor , which has helped train Iranian scientists in weapons techniques like plutonium separation .
( Yes , as Iran likes to point out , the reactor also produces medical isotopes .
But those can be purchased commercially from abroad , as most countries do , including the United States . )
Absent the deal , Iran ’s reactor will likely run out of fuel within two years , and only a half - dozen countries are able to supply fresh fuel for it .
This creates significant international leverage over Iran , which should be used to compel it to halt its enrichment program .
In addition , the vast surplus of higher - enriched fuel Iran was to get under the deal would have permitted some to be diverted to its bomb program .
Indeed , many experts believe that the uranium in foreign - provided fuel would be easier to enrich to weapons grade because Iran ’s uranium contains impurities .
Obama administration officials had claimed that delivering uranium in the form of fabricated fuel would prevent further enrichment for weapons , but this is false .
Separating uranium from fuel elements so that it can be enriched further is a straightforward engineering task requiring at most a few weeks .
Nine city workers who were assigned to clean up blight in Northeast Philadelphia instead acted like a " band of brigands " by illegally entering homes and ransacking them of cash , jewelry , TVs and guns , District Attorney Lynne Abraham said yesterday .
The nine are current or former employees of the Department of Licenses and Inspections or the Mayor 's Office of Community Services who were assigned to the Community Life Improvement Program ( CLIP ) , an anti-blight program supervised by the Managing Director 's Office .
From June 2006 to January 2008 , the nine conspired " to invade people 's homes " to steal whatever they could , Abraham said at a news conference while announcing the results of a grand - jury investigation into the case .
CLIP was implemented in Northeast Philly in 2002 to deal with quality - of - life issues , such as a homeowner who did n't mow his lawn , who left trash on his property or who did n't fix a broken window .
If an owner failed to fix a problem after having been given notice , a city crew was sent to fix it and the owner was billed .
The grand jury 's investigation centered on five homes from which items were allegedly raided .
In each case , L&I inspectors failed to get a court order to enter the home , Abraham said .
Instead , L&I inspectors and CLIP crew members either broke into the homes or abused their position as city employees to throw residents out of their homes , while alleging that they were at the homes to check on property - code violations , Abraham said .
Once inside , the CLIP crew stole whatever it could , hauling out furniture and other valuables and dumping them into city trucks , she said .
This was " a clean - and - seal operation , which very rapidly became a clean - and - steal operation , " Abraham said .
In one case , city workers broke into a home on Convent Avenue and forced the elderly residents and their disabled daughter out of the house , she said .
The crew stole $ 25,000 from the house and virtually all of the furniture , Abraham said .
Firearms were also stolen from a few homes .
In one case , an elderly widow on Greymont Street whose deceased husband was a gun collector was victimized by the theft of safes containing guns , as well as her husband 's tools and other items , Abraham said .
The widow testified to the grand jury that a couple of months after CLIP " cleaned " her house , she received a $ 17,854.72 bill from the city and had to take out a second mortgage on her house to pay it .
Abraham said of the guns stolen from houses , seven were recovered , but at least 25 are still missing .
One was recovered from a murder suspect , she said .
The nine defendants are being charged with corrupt organization , theft , conspiracy , burglary and related offenses .
The two alleged leaders were Rycharde " Rick " Sicinski , 55 , of Germania Street near Arendell Avenue , an L&I employee who was head CLIP inspector ; and Henry Turrentine , 52 , of Brighton Street near Whitaker Avenue , an L&I employee who served as CLIP crew chief .
Crew members testified that these two supervisors would go through the properties first and " take a look around and then tell the workers what was in the houses and where to find it , " the grand jury 's presentment says .
Others being charged are :
* Algie Cuffee Sr. , 57 , of Tulpehocken Street near Baynton , a former L&I employee , who was one of two sub -crew chiefs overseen by Turrentine .
* Algie Cuffee Jr. , 23 , of Upper Darby , Cuffee Sr. 's son .
Cuffee Jr. was employed by the Mayor 's Office of Community Services and had worked on a CLIP crew .
He is accused of selling guns stolen from the " cleaned " houses to other people or giving the guns away in exchange for marijuana .
Five others being charged worked as CLIP crew members :
* Anthony Scarcia , 31 , of Knorr Street near Walker ;
* Jermaine Adderly , 33 , of Wanamaker Street near Media ;
* Lamont Williams , 37 , of Woodlawn Street near Chew Avenue ;
* Wilfredo Cintron , 40 , of B Street near Ontario ; and ,
* William Roldan , 29 , of Rising Sun Avenue near Tyson .
Abraham contended that this " crime wave " was encouraged by a lack of oversight by L&I and the Managing Director 's Office .
Deputy Managing Director Thomas Conway , who oversees CLIP , did not return a call .
Mayor Nutter said in response to the D.A. 's news conference : " We want to re-emphasize that we have a zero - tolerance policy in our government for corruption of any kind . "
Two former managing directors , Pedro Ramos and Loree Jones , who served under then - Mayor John Street during the period the grand jury investigated , said yesterday that they had not been aware of any CLIP complaints .
Councilwoman Joan L. Krajewski , who came up with the CLIP idea with her staff , said yesterday she was " disheartened " to hear of these allegations because CLIP " is a good program " with numerous accomplishments .
The grand - jury investigation stemmed from an investigation by the Gun Violence Task Force .
Anyone believed to have been victimized by a CLIP worker is asked to contact Assistant District Attorney Sharon Piper at 215-686-9582 .

Hospital cleaners play a vital role , the study found Hospital cleaners are worth more to society than bankers , a study suggests .
The research , carried out by think tank the New Economics Foundation , says hospital cleaners create £ 10 of value for every £ 1 they are paid .
It claims bankers are a drain on the country because of the damage they caused to the global economy .
They reportedly destroy £ 7 of value for every £ 1 they earn .
Meanwhile , senior advertising executives are said to " create stress " .
The study says they are responsible for campaigns which create dissatisfaction and misery , and encourage over - consumption .
Waste workers promote recycling , researchers note
And tax accountants damage the country by devising schemes to cut the amount of money available to the government , the research suggests .
By contrast , child minders and waste recyclers are also doing jobs that create net wealth to the country .
The Foundation has used a new form of job evaluation to calculate the total contribution various jobs make to society , including for the first time the impact on communities and environment .
Eilis Lawlor , spokeswoman for the New Economics Foundation , said : " Pay levels often do n't reflect the true value that is being created .
As a society , we need a pay structure which rewards those jobs that create most societal benefit rather than those that generate profits at the expense of society and the environment " .
Tax accountants are said to destroy £ 47 in value for every £ 1 generated She said the aim of the research was not to target individuals in highly paid jobs , or suggest people in low paid jobs should earn more .
" The point we are making is more fundamental - that there should be a relationship between what we are paid and the value our work generates for society .
We 've found a way to calculate that , " she said .
A total of six different jobs were analysed to assess their overall value .
These are the study 's main findings :
The elite banker " Rather than being wealth creators bankers are being handsomely rewarded for bringing the global financial system to the brink of collapse Paid between £ 500,000 and £ 80 m a year , leading bankers destroy £ 7 of value for every pound they generate " .
Childcare workers " Both for families and society as a whole , looking after children could not be more important .
As well as providing a valuable service for families , they release earnings potential by allowing parents to continue working .
For every pound they are paid they generate up to £ 9.50 worth of benefits to society . "
Hospital cleaners " Play a vital role in the workings of healthcare facilities .
They not only clean hospitals and maintain hygiene standards but also contribute to wider health outcomes .
For every pound paid , over £ 10 in social value is created . "
Advertising executives
The industry " encourages high spending and indebtedness .
It can create insatiable aspirations , fuelling feelings of dissatisfaction , inadequacy and stress .
For a salary of between £ 50,000 and £ 12 m top advertising executives destroy £ 11 of value for every pound in value they generate " .
Tax accountants " Every pound that a tax accountant saves a client is a pound which otherwise would have gone to HM Revenue .
For a salary of between £ 75,000 and £ 200,000 , tax accountants destroy £ 47 in value , for every pound they generate . "
Waste recycling workers " Do a range of different jobs that relate to processing and preventing waste and promoting recycling .
Carbon emissions are significantly reduced .
There is also a value in reusing goods .
For every pound of value spent on wages , £ 12 of value is generated for society . "
The research also makes a variety of policy recommendations to align pay more closely with the value of work .
These include establishing a high pay commission , building social and environmental value into prices , and introducing more progressive taxation .

Apple 's iPhone is known for its Byzantine application approval process and somewhat insular platform .
Undeterred by these challenges , Novell has succeeded in bringing Mono , its open source implementation of Microsoft 's .NET framework , to the iconic device .
Novell announced Monday the official launch of MonoTouch , a new framework that allows application developers to build native iPhone software with C# and other .NET programming languages .
It is designed to conform with the requirements stipulated by Apple for App Store eligibility .
This will allow .NET developers to take advantage of their existing skills and potentially reuse some of their existing code when they build software for the iPhone .
MonoTouch applications will have a fully native look and feel and will be indiscernible from conventional iPhone applications .
Apple forbids the inclusion of mechanisms that enable execution of arbitrary third - party code .
This rule effectively bars the use of nonstandard runtimes , JIT engines , and bytecode interpreters .
In theory , that seems like an insurmountable obstacle for intrepid developers who want C# on the iPhone .
In practice , it turns out that this challenge is not impossible to overcome .
The developers behind the Mono project use static compilation to bring C# to Apple 's platform without falling afoul of the App Store rules .
Mono typically uses a just - in - time ( JIT ) compilation model where bytecode is translated into native machine code at runtime .
But the compiler also supports an alternate model called ahead - of - time ( AOT ) compilation , which will convert .
NET Common Intermediate Language ( CIL ) into native code at compile - time .
This makes it possible for developers to statically compile their Mono - based applications into native executables that do not require a VM or any other specialized runtime components , thus meeting Apple 's strict requirements .
We first explored the potential of Mono on the iPhone in January when we looked at Unity , a 3D engine built on Mono that is used by a growing number of games that are available from the App Store .
Unity also takes advantage of the AOT compilation approach and has proven that Apple considers it acceptable .
MonoTouch does n't include support for WinForms or WPF .
Instead , it introduces a comprehensive set of bindings for Cocoa user interface widgets and other standard iPhone APIs .
This means that MonoTouch applications will have a fully native look and feel and will be indiscernible from conventional iPhone applications .
The downside , however , is that MonoTouch developers will have to rewrite the user interfaces for their existing .NET applications when they port them to the iPhone .
" We decided instead to go with a native binding [ for ] the iPhone APIs .
It would not be a cross platform API and it would tie developers to the iPhone platform , but it would also mean that applications would look and feel native , and developers would get closer to the iPhone , " Mono developer Miguel de Icaza explained in a blog entry .
When the MonoTouch developers tested their APIs by porting Apple 's iPhone code examples from Objective - C to C# , they discovered that the C# versions required considerably less code .
C# is arguably a more expressive language in several key ways .
In particular , de Icaza points out that C# constructor initializers help reduce the amount of code that is required to set up widget properties .
To simplify the application development workflow , MonoTouch includes add-ins for the MonoDevelop IDE that support integration with Apple 's Interface Builder .
MonoTouch also supports the iPhone simulator which will allow developers to test software without having to run it on an actual device .
As MonoTouch necessitates static linking , users will need a commercial license .
This will cost $ 999 per seat for the enterprise edition and $ 399 per seat for the personal edition and will include one year of updates .
For additional details , you can refer to the MonoTouch website .
I love tradition , and after all these years of writing this column – seems like one hundred , but it ’s actually closer to ten – it ’s high time to start one ( a tradition , that is ) .
Thus , the Antiwar.com awards are born !
Taking our cues from another tradition – the Sicilian tradition of revenge – I ’m going to name these various awards after certain well - known persons , people who are famous for one reason or another , that is , well enough known so that the mere mention of their name evokes the characteristic that the award memorializes .
And so , right off the bat , we have the Andrew Sullivan Award for ideological blindness and utter hypocrisy , which goes , this first year of its existence , to none other than … yes , you guessed it : Andrew Sullivan .
The Sullivan Award goes to the person who brazenly condemns others for shortcomings he ( or she ) epitomizes , and who blames others for the consequences of policies that he ( or she ) once loudly advocated , and now is desperately trying to run away from .
That Sullivan has truly earned the award that ’s named after his sorry self seems beyond dispute .
After all , here is someone who now disdains the " excesses " of the Bush years – the warmongering , the bloodthirstiness , the hair - trigger belligerence – and yet called for dropping a nuclear bomb on Iraq because he had talked himself into believing ( on the strength of zero evidence ) that the anthrax attacks were masterminded by Saddam Hussein .
Yes , the author of " The Daily Dish " has half - assedly apologized to his readers for his past views , with all sorts of exculpatory excuses and qualifications , yet it is telling that he has never apologized for or even retracted this call to genocide .
And he ’s supposed to be some sort of Christian , a Catholic I believe .
What a hypocrite !
He deserves this " award , " and in spades .
As sweet as revenge can be , it ca n’t be all about that – after all , we need something positive , something uplifting and inspiring : in short , we need the Ron Paul Award , to be given to the person who has done the most to talk foreign policy common sense to the broadest sectors of the American people in a way that is both understandable and informed .
And who among us could credibly claim this prize other than Ron himself ?
Sure , there are plenty of others whose books , articles , and public pronouncements have done their bit in educating the American people as to the whys and wherefores of non-interventionism , but no one else has done it in such a systematic and ultimately appealing way – and all without compromising his message one bit .
And when one takes into consideration his audience – who , after all , would dare to get up at a Republican presidential debate , no less , and say the 9/11 attacks were " blowback " generated by US foreign policy ?
– one has to salute his courage and persistence .
Ron Paul is The Man !
While Rep. Paul ’s clear - sighted vision and burgeoning success in building a lasting anti-interventionist movement on the Right is cause for optimism , there is still a dark side to the conservative mentality , and this is especially true of the paleoconservatives , for whom gloominess is an occupational hazard .
The old ways are gone , and nothing can bring them back , they keen : we ’re doomed !
Doomed , I tell you !
And no one of this tribe is gloomier than Daniel Larison , the Eeyore of the paleo - right .
If a Republican member of Congress so much as whispers criticism of Obama ’s Afghanistan policy , or even comes right out and says we ought to withdraw and start tending to our own problems , Larison is right in there assuring us that he ( or she ) does n’t mean it , ca n’t mean it , and is merely " pretending " to mean it , because , you see , they deviate on some other point , or just because they ’re modern conservatives , who can’t , after all , be anything less than bloodthirsty monsters .
In order to qualify for this award , it is n’t enough that you kvetch and nitpick – because anybody can do that .
I ’ve done it myself .
No , you have to kvetch and nitpick whilst defending the interventionist policies of the present administration , i.e. the Afghan " surge , " thus doing precisely what you criticize others for doing .
It also helps if the nominee for this particular award writes in the dull , gray , lifeless style of someone about to overdose on Prozac .
And so the Daniel Larison Award for simultaneously nitpicking and double - talking goes to … Daniel Larison !
Okay , back on the " positive " side of things , we have the John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt Award for Speaking Truth to Power .
This goes to those writers who , in stating an obvious truth – one that has only been whispered while looking over one ’s shoulder – have ignored the peril this places them in professionally , and gone ahead and published .
It took real bravery to point to the elephant in the room that practically everyone wanted to avoid noticing – the Israel Lobby ’s unprecedented and intolerably unhealthy grip on the making of US policy in the Middle East – and Professors Mearsheimer and Walt certainly deserve an award that is the anti-interventionist equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor .
Their book , The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , exposed the real power behind the American throne , one that is hurting us in ways we will be experiencing for many years to come .
The smear campaign that followed publication of the book was truly horrific , but the crudity of the attacks backfired : far from marginalizing the authors , the Smear Brigade only publicized a book that might have fallen between the cracks , a fate shared by many far less weighty tomes .
Going from the sublime to the grotesque , we present the very first Charles Johnson Award , which goes to that individual in the public eye who has no compunctions about stabbing his former friends and allies in the back and attacking them for the very traits he or she exemplifies .
Johnson , who is , as you may know , a blogger with a reputation for giving a forum to vilest sort of anti-Arab racism , and whose blog , " Little Green Footballs , " became a haven for the hateful , has now repudiated his awful past in favor of his equally awful present – which consists of smearing those who fail to toe the Johnsonian line on everything from the role of religion in public life to the reality ( or non-reality ) of global warming .
Having succored racists and Islamophobes of the most extreme sort for years , Johnson has now taken to denouncing these very same racists as the vilest creatures on God ’s green earth – without , of course , mentioning his key role in encouraging , organizing , and egging them on .
Although he would n’t cite God , you see , because , having abandoned the epithet he used to defame Islam as ( sarcasm on ! )
" The Religion of ‘ Peace , ’ " he has now decided that all religion ( except one , of course ) is the Enemy .
Think of him as a cut-rate Christopher Hitchens – an intellectual hooligan without the erudition , or the accent – incapable of writing a blog post longer than a few short and mostly cut-and - pasted paragraphs , albeit with the Hitchensonian nastiness intact .
The Charles Johnson Turncoat Award – this is an " honor " Charles has earned several times over .
And last , but not least , we have the Justin Raimondo Award for Verbosity in the Face of an Intractable Deadline , otherwise known as the Annoying Hack of the Year prize , which recognizes in the recipient several characteristics rarely found in a single writer .
First , one must write often – not weekly , not twice weekly , but at least thrice - weekly , even when you have n’t got all that much to say .
Furthermore , one must say it while getting in all sorts of little digs and vicious asides at people one finds annoying , preferably in the most tasteless manner imaginable .
It always helps nominees for this particular award if their prose is undisciplined , far too casual given the seriousness of its ostensible subject .
And , most importantly , it is absolutely necessary for the recipient of this much - coveted honor to alienate and even insult as many of his or her readers as possible .
For example , if you know half your audience consists of committed liberals who sympathize with your foreign policy views , but hate your domestic political agenda , why you simply must emphasize the latter – preferably by rubbing their faces in it without making any real attempt to persuade .
That ‘ll show ’em !
I have to say , I am humbled to be the first recipient of the Annoying Hack of the Year Award , and I just want to thank all the little people who made it possible …
That ’s it for this year , folks .
Please do send me your nominees , because we really should be giving these awards out more often than on an annual basis .
With Christmas upon us , and the New Year beckoning , we ’re all of us busy : but do n’t worry , Antiwar.com is standing at the parapets , keeping watch on the War Party .
We ’ll let you know if something comes up .
In the meantime , have a wonderful Christmas – I ’m taking a very short break this upcoming weekend , so there will be no column on Friday , but I ’ll be back on Monday , bright and early , earning my award …
Evo Morales .
[ See the ALBA countries ' declaration on the Copenhagen talks below . ]
By Ron Ridenour
December 23 , 2009 -- “ Nobel War Prize winner walked in and out of a secret door , and that is the way capitalism and the United States Empire will end up leaving the planet , through a secret back door . ”
So spoke Venezuela President Hugo Chavez from the plenary podium on the last afternoon , December 18 , of the 12 - day long Copenhagen climate conference ( COP15 ) .
“ While the conference was a failure , it , at least , led to more consciousness of what the problem is for all of us .
Now starts a new stage of the struggle for the salvation of humanity , and this is through socialism .
Our problem is not just about climate , but about poverty , misery , unnecessary child deaths , discrimination and racism — all related to capitalism ” , Chavez said at the Bolivarian Alliance of the Peoples of Latin America ( ALBA ) press conference held at the Bella Centre immediately following Chavez ’ last remarks at the plenary .
Bolivia 's President Evo Morales followed Chavez ’ remarks by saying :
Barack Obama said a while ago -- the only delegate to walk in and out of the stage from a concealed door -- that he came here not for more words but for action .
Well , then you should act by using the money you are spending for wars against the peoples of Afghanistan and Iraq , for militarising Colombia with seven military bases to save lives , to save the planet our Mother Earth .
Both presidents , the only heads of state representing eight of the nine ALBA countries present at COP15 , [ 1 ] denounced the failure of the Copenhagen conference in both form and content .
Chavez : “ There are no documents presented for consultation by all .
The responsibility is a lack of political will by a few rich countries , including the host Denmark , headed by the US Empire . ”
Morales : “ There is profound difference between their document [ 26 rich countries drew up a so - called ` Copenhagen Accord ' ] [ 2 ] and the peoples fighting for humanity and the planet .
This group of friends led by Obama accept that temperatures can increase by 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 .
This will end the existence of many island states ; it will end our snow - capped mountains .
And Obama only seeks to reduce gas emissions by 50 % in 2050 .
But we want and need 90 to 100 % reduction , in order to save the planet .
Then they speak of spending crumbs for mitigation and adaptation .
The third theme , which they are only just now debating , is how to set up a system of controls for monitoring agreements and what sanctions there will be if this is not done .
That is why we want an International Climate Justice Tribunal that can sanction failure to comply with agreements , so that we can govern based on balance and achieve real solutions . ”
President Morales was referring to one of the five questions -- to be answered yes or no -- that he proposes for a global referendum on climate change .
The other four are :
1 . Do you agree with re-establishing harmony with nature , recognising the rights of Mother Earth ?
2 . Do you agree with changing this model of over - consumption and waste that the capitalist system represents ?
3 . Do you agree that developed countries reduce and re-absorb their domestic greenhouse gas emissions so that the temperature does not rise more than 1 degree Celsius ?
4 . Do you agree with transferring all that is spent on wars to protecting the planet and allocate a budget for climate change that is bigger than what is used for defence ?
At the press conference , and on various other occasions during the three days of his attendance , Morales posed the problem and the solution to it thus :
" The rich countries seek to divide the rest of us ... by offering crumbs of money .
Mother Earth ca n’t be preserved with money alone .
Europe ’s food almost entirely depends upon petrol .
What happens when there is no petrol ?
This dependency on fossil fuel is a threat to humanity , so we have to change the structures of food .
It is a structural problem of two forms of life : one way of living is the way of over - consumption and waste , the way of luxury , of egoism and individualism - capitalism .
The other way is vivir bien — living well — food enough for all and living in harmony with others and our Mother Earth , in solidarity and complementarily . "
At the final press conference -- for which I was one of two media consultants during this two weeks , along with Nick Buxton -- for the ALBA countries , Bolivia , Cuba , Ecuador , Nicaragua and Venezuela attended .
Cuba 's vice - president Esteben Lazo said that socialism offers greater protection for the Earth than does capitalism :
Before our revolution , capitalism had nearly depleted all our forests .
We have focused on replanting and now 20 % of the land is covered by forests .
We also educate our school children about ecology , and about the ALBA network .
We are founded on principles of solidarity , of human rights and nature ’s rights .
Democracy anecdotes
Nick and I had rushed to put out a media advisory announcing the above press conference , about which we were informed only 90 minutes before that Morales would be attending rather than leaving Copenhagen earlier that day as he had planned .
We wrote it in a blink and passed out 200 fliers .
At the appointed time , the press room began to fill with media and delegates from several countries .
Bolivia was the only state , of which I know , that insisted on allowing anyone to attend our press conferences , in accordance with Morales ' practice of inclusiveness and transparency .
The time allotted was 30 minutes .
Morales did not arrive on time , which he usually does .
We heard from a top Bolivian delegate inside the plenary that Evo had just gotten an opportunity to respond from the floor to the rich countries ' secret document , now leaked .
Fifteen minutes ticked by and he did not arrive .
Another phone call informed us that Chavez would be following Evo and then they were both coming to the media hall .
Oh , no !
Chavez never talks briefly .
We would lose the conference time and 100 people present would be disappointed .
Use the “ dead ” time , my experience told me .
I asked two Indigenous social movement delegates if they would take the podium and speak , perhaps about their movements and the five - point referendum .
They agreed .
I translated for them .
They spoke of how this very act of taking the podium before their president ’s arrival illustrated how democratic the new Plurinational State of Bolivia actually is .
Social movements work hand in glove with the government and their president -- reelected less than two weeks before with a 64 % majority .
As the activists were speaking , about their movement and the referendum , in walked presidents Morales and Chavez followed by the Cuban , Ecuadorian and Nicaraguan leaders .
The activists and I calmly walked off the stage and the leaders took our seats as we nodded to one another .
Morales ’ entourage of ministers and ambassadors took their seats .
They are known to us as Eugenio , Pablo , Roberto , Ivan , Angélica , David , Rene and not Your Honorable , Excellency , Minister , Ambassador .
When speaking with or about their presidents , most common people call them Evo and Chavez .
On other occasions -- such as before 3000 persons at the ALBA People 's Meeting held in a sports stadium on December 17 , where Morales and Chavez spoke alongside top leaders from Cuba , Ecuador and Nicaragua -- the leaders of the Bolivian and Venezuelan governments thoughtfully thanked their teams of paid workers and volunteers , and the organisers of political events .
They also praised the activists inside and outside the Bella Centre conference .
They applauded the 100,000 plus demonstrators who mobilised on December 12 -- twice the size of the hitherto largest demonstration ever held in the Banana Republic of Denmark -- and the 1500 activists arrested preventatively , nearly none of whom had performed an illegal act .
Only two handfuls were eventually charged with any violation .
Several hundreds had their hands handcuffed behind their backs and were forced to sit on the cold ground and asphalt for up to five hours before being bussed to makeshift cage cells .
No water , no toilet .
This is the treatment a “ democratic ” police state can render potential “ terrorists ” under their new terror laws , which they deem to be necessary to accompany their imperialist wars .
In addition to these demonstrations , there were smaller ones attended by hundreds or thousand in several parts of the city everyday .
Some were decidedly opposed to capitalism and its wars .
I participated in one in front of the Yankee Embassy of Murder the day before its president was to receive the so - called Nobel Peace Prize .
Evo Morales
Evo Morales , 50 , comes from the people ’s struggles .
He was an amateur soccer player , a musician , a coco farmer and a union organiser and leader before entering politics .
He is a man of dialogue with his people .
I note one illustration .
When he came out of a news conference , the Indian Youth Climate Network , a group of youth from India , wanted him to hear a song one of them had written about Bolivia .
He stopped to listen to “ I wish I was Bolivian ” , sung to the tune of “ Homeward Bound ” by Simon and Garfunkel .
“ Every day they are stalling and they are saying the same old things again , But one bright country stands apart ,
They ’re saying things close to my heart , They ’ve got a plan with hope in hand , They ’re saying c’mon , let ’s just start ...
Bolivia , I wish I was Bolivian ...
Just one degree temperature rise , 300 ppm in the skies , 100 per cent emissions down by two thousand forty , Does anyone know the price of waiting ?
Fighting , hating , procrastinating , My future stands in front of me , While people here make history , I hope and pray that it will be , What the world ’s children wish to see , Bolivia , We ’ve got to take the boldest steps , There ’s work to do ; clean up the mess , Bolivia ”
The evening before , Morales attended one of the hundreds of side events organised by people ’s movements and NGOs .
This one was about the Indigenous peoples of the Americas .
He spoke briefly giving plenty of time for questions and comments from the floor .
Anyone could speak and there was no formality or nervousness before the president .
At one point , Evo Morales said that he could n't always set in motion all that we wanted but it would be easier now , given that the Movement Towards Socialism , the president ’s party , had won so overwhelming in the presidential electoral campaign and also now controls both parliament houses .
“ Politics is a science of serving the people .
I live to serve the people .
Participating in politics is part of assuring our dignity , our traditional way of life .
It is my duty to take your message to the heads of state here .
If I make a mistake , let me know so that I can rectify it .
“ I do n't think we 'll make progress here .
We must organise and mobilise all the more .
Not just climate justice activists , but all of us : workers , farmers , media people , academics , everybody .
That is the answer . ”
Following this meeting , several Indigenous people told me that those are not empty words .
“ We always speak out in meetings with the president and we offer criticisms and make demands .
He listens . ”
Niels Boel , a writer for the daily Danish newspaper Information had one of two dozen bilateral interviews with Evo Morales .
He wrote :
As the police fought against demonstrators ... the world ’s greatest activist , Bolivia ’s President Evo Morales , got off with being chased by the press .
While he did not go to jail this time , the world 's first Indigenous president knows what prison and torture are all about .
He was so treated under previous Bolivian presidents doing capitalism ’s bidding .
As Boel wrote :
Solutions for Morales come only from people 's organizations , which can overcome capitalism .
And that is why I say this conference was a smashing success .
Especially because of Morales and Chavez ’ anti-capitalist dialogue in those few days , and the many thousands carrying picket signs displayed during the massive march that damned the greedy economic system ( " Change the system , not the climate " ) , capitalism is now on the agenda of many more people than in a long time .
Even some of the mass media could not avoid headlining this message from the two “ bad boys ” .
“ I have heard many debates in the UN where presidents condemn climate change but they never say -- cowardly enough -- what causes it .
We say clearly that it is caused by capitalism ” , Morales said in closing .

Notes
1. ALBA is comprised of : Antigua and Barbuda , Bolivia , Cuba , Dominica , Ecuador , Honduras ( which was not present given the illegal coup d´état against the legitimate President Manuel Zelaya ) , Nicaragua , St. Vincent and Grenadines , and Venezuela .
2 . This exclusive accord , rejected by the other nations , is a non-binding political agreement setting an objective for them to keep a maximum rise in temperature by 2 degrees Celsius ; a voluntary commitment to publicise the amount of each developed country 's greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation action for developing states ; short - term funding for development countries up to 2012 of $ 30 billion annually , to increase to $ 100 billion annually between 2013 and 2020 .
( The US alone is spending $ 1.5 trillion dollars to rescue the banks responsible for the financial and economic global crisis . )
These 26 countries suggest that there be another climate conference in Mexico in a year 's time .
Post - note : Some institute calculated that the amount of carbon emissions from this two - week ordeal was greater than some of the island nations exude in a year .
One of the wastes during this failed non-summit , non-climate conference was the amount of paper used by 30,000 delegates and 3000 journalists and technicians .
The official figures published by the UN even on the first day stated that 8 million sheets of paper were provided .
I guess that Nick and I used 2000 sheets of paper , which we distributed to let media people know of our news conferences .

Substantial penalty expected to be handed down to the operators of Cumbrian plant
The safety record of Britain 's nuclear industry will be tarnished tomorrow when managers at the Sellafield complex in Cumbria are fined for exposing staff to radioactive contamination .
A substantial penalty is expected to be imposed by Carlisle crown court following a successful criminal prosecution brought by the Health and Safety Executive .
Concerns about conditions at the plant come just a week after an eminent group of scientists and military experts described as " ludicrous " the manner in which 100 tonnes of plutonium was stored at Sellafield – and at a time when the wider nuclear industry is trying to build public support for a new generation of reactors .
Sellafield , now owned by Amec , Areva of France and URS Washington of the US , pleaded guilty this summer to failing to discharge its duties under section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 .
Two contractors were exposed to danger while they were refurbishing a concrete floor at the plutonium storage plant .
A spokesman for Sellafield declined to comment but industry executives said the company was braced for a financial hit .
The Cumbrian facility was fined £ 500,000 plus costs of more than £ 50,000 three years ago following the discovery of a large leak of highly radioactive materials at its Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant ( Thorp ) .
The incident dated back to April 2005 , and although no one was injured there was concern that the leak had continued for eight months before it was detected .
Sellafield was then under the control of the British Nuclear Group – an arm of the state - owned BNFL – which has since ceded control to the private sector consortium Nuclear Management Partners , which is made up of Amec and its two partners .
BNFL was itself fined £ 30,000 and ordered to pay £ 21,000 costs in January 2004 after a diving accident when the company was checking underwater outfall pipes .
Tomorrow 's court appearance follows safety concerns raised by anti-nuclear campaigners the British Pugwash Group in a report on Britain 's plutonium stockpile , which is centred on Sellafield .
Retired general Sir Hugh Beach , one of the report 's authors , told the BBC : " It 's a total absurdity that we should have 100 tonnes of separated plutonium sitting up at Sellafield in tin cans ... that is manifestly ludicrous . "
The BPG , named after the venue of a 1957 nuclear safety conference in Nova Scotia , fear the nuclear stockpile could become a target for terrorists .
These difficulties are highlighted as the government and industry try to move ahead with plans to build more than half a dozen new nuclear plants to generate low carbon electricity .
The Health and Safety Executive has already taken a tough line on the designs for new reactors by telling Areva and Westinghouse of the US that it needs much more work to be done before it could give the green light to the plants they have proposed for construction here .
Pine Mouth Revisited
by Michael Y. Park
A little while ago , I wrote up something about the phenomenon people are calling " pine mouth " : the bizarre metallic taste people get in their mouths after eating certain pine nuts .
It 's extremely unpleasant , it can last for weeks , but it does n't seem to be permanent .
Since then , it seems like more and more people are experiencing pine mouth .
Many folks seemed to be complaining that they had it happen after getting pine nuts from certain distributors , so I called them up and tried to figure out if they or anyone else could figure out what was going on .
Here 's what I found .
A couple complaints came about FreshDirect pine nuts , so I talked to FreshDirect 's corporate HQ , and here 's what their spokeswoman told me : " We have seen in the media that there have been issues raised about the taste of pine nuts imported from China .
At FreshDirect , we always work to find the best products at the best prices for our customers .
And , while FreshDirect has carried pine nuts from China in the past , we no longer carry them . "
Also , many complaints seemed to come from those who'd eaten Trader Joe 's pine nuts in the last couple months .
( I 've eaten plenty of Trader Joe 's pine nuts in the past few months and never had a problem , but the way . )
I called up the Trader Joe 's people , but they told me that they do n't discuss their business practices .
But here 's an interesting twist :
A lot of people who've had pine mouth have pointed the finger at pine nuts from China .
( Most pine nuts come from either the Chinese - Russian border or Turkey , I 've been told . )
Trader Joe 's stopped using products from China by Jan. 1 , 2008 ( remember when Chinese melamine contamination and the like was the biggest product - safety fear ? ) .
The company now uses two varieties of pine nuts : Hong ( or red ) from Russia and Korea , and Xue ( or cedar ) from Russia .
So since Trader Joe 's does n't use Chinese pine nuts , it does n't seem like simply purely another Chinese issue , although it 's worth noting that the Russian - Chinese border can be extremely porous , and much of the Russian - grown pine nuts are processed by the Chinese anyway .
There was a complaint about Sam's Club pine nuts , so I called them up .
Their corporate spokeswoman made no comment and referred me to Amport Foods , a Minneapolis company that imports pine nuts and had supplied Sam's .
CEO Andrew Spellman declined to make a lengthy comment , saying only : " The issue of pine mouth is a new revelation to Amport Foods .
It 's too early to supply any answers , as we do n't know what the problem really is . "
But then I talked to someone who works at a company that works with pine nuts , who asked to remain unnamed , and the remarks were illuminating .
" We do n't know what we 're dealing with , and we need to get some real answers on it , " the source said .
( And forgive me from using the plural " they " instead of correct singular for this person from now on . )
According to the source , the company they work for went from essentially no complaints about pine mouth to several in the past six months .
( But note that we 're talking about , say , four or five cases from a volume of pine nuts in the millions of pounds . )
" It seems to be this crop year , " they said , and spoke of a rumor of a possible , unconfirmed case involving pine nuts grown in Arizona .
" We 're dumbfounded .
We can't find a pattern to it , " they said .
In fact , it 's been a horrible year for the pine - nut crop in general .
Quality is extremely poor , and prices have skyrocketed threefold , leaving some retailers forgoing selling them at all .
But pine mouth does n't help , of course .
An immediate question is whether or not the pine nuts might have been contaminated with chemicals or handled improperly .
But the pine nuts the source works with come from a Western - built processing plant on the Russia - China border , and the pine nuts are naturally grown " on mountain water , " and the trees are n't sprayed .
" That 's what 's got everyone surprised , " the source said .
So what to do for the average diner ?
A new crop of pine nuts should be available in the next six weeks to two months .
And you can take what solace you can from the fact that no one seems to have reported a serious health problem aside from the obviously unpleasant two weeks or so of a metallic taste in the mouth .
In Britain , which is undergoing the same issue , researchers have ruled out heavy - metal contamination or chemical differences in the pine - mouth nuts and regular nuts .
Some guess it might be oxidation .
Now , I 've tried to contact agricultural , food , and medical experts about this as well , but so far everyone 's come up blank .
I 'll keep trying , though , and will let you know here when I find out anything more .

I also have a " pine mouth " story .
We hosted a dinner sometime in May of this year ( 2010 ) .
One of the side dishes : grilled asparagus with pine nuts !
At least three of the six people in our party got some variation of " pine mouth " within 2 - 3 days after the dinner .
Two of the six people did not have any effect , and we are unsure about the 6th ( we did n't ask her ) .
We had bought the pine nuts from a Kroger in Houston in bulk from a self - serve bin- upon returning to the store , we did note that these pine nuts were called " Chinese pine nuts " .
For me , the bitter taste lasted about 5 days , with the worst being on the 2nd day ( i.e. , it was unpleasant eating absolutely anything ) .
For the other two people , one had it very mildly and it started on day 3 , lasting a few days .
The third person had it for about a week , moderately .
So much for pine nuts !
I do n't think I 'll be serving them to company again .
Otherwise , I may start getting " Respectfully Decline " on my party invitations !

DO NOT EAT THE KALE SALAD WITH PINE NUTS FROM WHOLE FOODS IN EVANSTON , IL !!!
I did about 2 days ago , and now I have pine mouth .
I can't eat bread or drink coffee , and right now all I can stand to eat is some veggies and water .

Problem Solved !
I am one of the unlucky ones afflicted by Pine Mouth after eating some cheaper nuts from a local grocery store .
I could n't figure out what was wrong when , a day later , I had a disgustingly bitter flavor in my mouth .
Like many here , no matter what I did , the flavor did not go away .
I was lucky enough to stumble on one random suggestion on one of the many websites I looked through after identifying my issue as Pine Mouth .
Brush your mouth , tongue , cheeks , and teeth with BAKING SODA !
I had to do it a couple of times , but it seems to have worked .
Food tastes wonderful again .
Try it !

I too have a case of " Pine Mouth " and I did confirm with Safeway , where I had purchased them that they were from China .
The person ( in the veggie section ) said that she had heard similar complaints before me .
I suggested she remove them from the shelves .
She agreed ... I have called our local news station to alert the public .
I am on day 3 of this and really do not feel like eating anything because of the disgusting after effects .
I implore all of you to contact the media to get the word out .....

I am on my third day of the bitter chemical taste in my mouth .
I had pine nuts from Trader Joe's , the ones from Korea and Russia two days before it started .
I am desperate for a cure - since coffee and wine taste the worst and they are my favorite indulgences .
If anyone has a remedy that works , please post !

I just googled " chemical taste " and found your blog .
I was sure I had some horrible disease after suffering for the last few days with this chemical taste .
I too have been eating pinenuts over the last few days ... a handful here and there .
The brand is Good Sense .
Made in Spain or China or Portugal .
I never experienced this before but to say the least I 'm dumping the rest of the package .

Opps sorry for all the typos , I wish there was an edit button :-)
So far I 've been able to eat toast with tons of butter and not have the bitter flavor afterward .
Something about the oil and fat must coat my taste buds or something .
Good luck to you all who are suffering with this too .
Shame on Trader Joe 's for ignoring the problem .

I just got pine mouth and rad both these articles hoping to find relief .
Oh god , it 's the worst experience ever .
A constant bile and bitter flavor .
I traced it to pine nuts from Trader Joe 's in NYC , also listed as coming from " Korea or Russia or Vietnam " on the package .
My email to TJ 's only came back with reply , " this is a natural occurrence . "
I 've eaten raw and toasted pin nuts all my life , plus pesto , and never had this happen .
I 'm so miserable :-(
Is there any remedy ?
I 'm on day 2 so far .

I have cooked with and snacked on pine nuts from Trader Joes ( the bag says they are a product of Korea , Russia or Vietnam , and the expiration date is February , 2011 ) for the past three days .
Initially , no problems with a bitter taste .
But on the 3rd day , both my husband and I were hit with a bitter taste at the back of our throats .
His symptoms are not as strong as mine ( but I ate more pine nuts than he did ) .
I have the bitter sensation whether I eat or not , though a sip of red wine and coffee intensify the sensation .
Yucch !

i swear i do not work for the company but i have found a temporary cure for this problem .
i grabbed a few pine nuts the other night and the next day EVERYTHING I ate tasted bitter , metal .
wine was horrible and could n't eat .
i thought i was crazy and then went online and traced it back to the pine nuts .
my doctor said this is more crap we need to worry about from china .
anyway , the temporary cure is miracle frooties .
i saw these on the food network months ago .
it is derived from a berry that turns sour to sweet .
it is used for cancer patients and just a cool thing to try which is why i originally bought it .
anyway , i just drank my first glass of orange juice since i ate the pine nuts .
it lasts for like a half hour but enough time to eat a meal and enjoy it .
any questions feel free to e-mail me at bills2345@aol.com b/c i simply find this very interesting and wanted to see what other people think and how they got it .

Fisher nuts ?
Sound familiar ?
Cans of roasted salted nuts ?
Well , I purchased Fisher " Culinary Touch " pine nuts ( dry roasted ) from Walmart Superstore .
They are not rancid , expiration date is a year from now , very nice mild taste in fact .
My husband and I ate the recipe I made with them , both of us grabbing another handfull as well .
He ate more than I did , perhaps twice as much .
I developed this pine mouth .
It did n't show up for over 24 hours , and after two days I thought something was very wrong with me since everything I ate tasted bitter , so of course I googled " bitter taste " and clearly the culprit is the pine nuts .
It 's been 4 days now and everything is just as bitter as the first day .
My husband had NO symptoms ... no bitter mouth .
Evidently it does n't affect everyone .
Plus , not sure if everyone did this , but I toasted them as well .
Oh , by the way , I just noticed that Fisher is honest about where they came from .
Says right on the package : Contains pine nuts from China .
Until I see a package that says " Guaranteed not to cause Pine Mouth , I wo n't put another pine nut in my mouth !!

I wish that I had read this article before I had the horrible experience of pine mouth !!
I bought a bag of pine nuts from Trader Joes .
They were from Korea / Russa .
I used it in a spinach recipe and then started eating them out of the bag while I was cooking .
I had a few more the next day .
Later on the second day , I started experiencing a metal taste in my mouth whenever I ate or drank .
I was miserable .
I finally found your article and felt much relief when I found out the reason .
I am going to Trader Joe 's tomorrow to complain .
They should n't be selling them .
I can't imagine I have to live with this for the next 2 weeks Yikes .
Thanks for the article .

I used pine nuts in a cornbread stuffing the other day on Thanksgiving .
Since then after eating I 've been experiencing the same bitter taste in my mouth .
While cooking today it was really noticeable , my taste buds were really thrown off I could n't tell if my receipe was cooked like usual .

Hi to all the unfortunate .
I also have this rank taste in the back of my mouth every time I eat .
I had a few handfulls of Morrisons own brand pine nuts , although it says these are packaged in the UK the after ringing thier customer services they wo n’t disclose where it get ’s the pine nuts from .
I think it would be an for us all to put down what stores we bought our pine nuts from so that less and less of us have to go through this again .

I was always a big fan of pine nuts and always bought them from Costco .
Never had a problem in the past but this bag ( from China packaged in US ) has really done a number on me .
I cannot eat or drink anything without this horrible taste that begins at the back of my tongue .
I sure hope there is no lasting effect from this .
I 'm miserable and it has only been two days .
Thanks for your continued update on this strange ordeal !

Concerning pine nuts , I just bought about an oz from my favorite health food store , I ate some & my husband only had a few .
He has been complaining ever since about this metallic taste in his mouth , that everything he eats tastes terrible , I bought these @ Health Plus in Sandusky OH , have no idea where they 're shipped from .
Had it not been for this forum , I never would have figured it out .
Thanks much !!!
At least we know , and sometimes that in itself is a relief !

I suspect that the awful taste I have had for several days now is related to Amport Pine Nuts Best by 7-22-10 , 2039Y .
I have emailed them today .

I am experiencing pine mouth for the 1st time , not a pleasant experience .
I purchased pine nuts on 9/26/09 and made pesto .
The brand pine nuts are Aurora Natural and is a product of China .
The pine nuts can be described as smaller and not as white as previously purchased .
I am looking for a remedy !

I , too , had this awful reaction last summer .
Since I was eating at a friend 's house and the problem did n't arise until days later , I could n't investigate the source of her ( damn ) pine nuts .
But as a result , I avoid them like the plague now because there is nothing as unpleasant to me as not being able to enjoy food .
I was never a huge fan of pine nuts , but hello - pesto ?
And yesterday , my boyfriend was eating pignoli cookies from an Italian bakery and I could not would not partake .
Poor me !
( Let 's check in with him in a few days though , eh ? )

Yes , Michael , great investigative journalism !
Though I find it shocking that retailers ( and , even more upsettingly , the FDA ) , have dropped the ball on this & left only journalists to investigate .
As I said in a comment on your original post , I experienced this condition and it was very unpleasant .
I used to eat pine nuts ( usually from Fresh Direct ) often and never had a problem with them , until one time I ate a batch that looked slightly different ( smaller & darker , as if Fresh Direct had used a different supplier ) and ended up with a bitter taste in my mouth for nearly 2 weeks .
It took me a few days to figure out what had caused it , but when I googled " bitter taste in mouth " and saw all the info on the subject , I realized it must 've been the pine nuts .
I contacted Fresh Direct through their online feedback form and never heard back .
I avoided pine nuts for several months afterward , but I love them so much that recently I tried a batch from Fresh Direct again ( they looked normal , not like the smaller , darker ones ) and they did not cause any symptoms .
It 's interesting that , in some cases , 2 people have eaten nuts from the same batch and only 1 person has had the symptoms .
As commenter vellal pointed out , maybe it has something to do with the genetic differences in taste buds that make people experience some flavors differently ?
This wikipedia article that vellal recommends explains the topic well : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster
Regardless , I find it very upsetting that these items are in our food supply and we have no idea what 's causing the problem .

Did everyone who experienced this taste sensation know it was from the pine nuts immediately ??
I had a very strange bitterish taste in my mouth after trying a " store bought " potato salad and it was with me for 4 or 5 days after , each time I ate , but never without food in my mouth .
I had , however , the same week , eaten pine nuts .

' wflaan ' is correct .
Never buy pine nuts in a regular supemarket , they are outrageously expensive and therefore have a very low turnover .
Trader Joe has been a reliable source for me and so has mail order .
I keep them refrigerated , and for longer term storage , I freeze them .

My husband and I were discussing this a few weeks ago and found that we both had the experience of long lasting metallic taste from our garden fresh oregano .
I am no longer using my home grown oregano because of this .
We have also had the pine nut experience ; not as strong as with the oregano , however , just as annoying .
Very interesting stuff .
Thanks for the update .

Thanks for the update .
I suffered with pine mouth for two weeks after eating Flavor Tree pine nuts from Whole Foods .
Sadly , it disturbed me enough that I now avoid all foods with pine nuts .
I followed through with Whole Foods and asked that they remove the pine nuts or , at least , make consumers aware of the issue .
I did get a generic response but not one that convinced me that they thought it was a serious issue .
Perhaps those deciding on what brands of pine nuts to carry should eat a handful of the nuts , wait a couple days then make their decision .

I always thought that this Pine Nut phenomena was due to slightly rancid nuts .
Pine Nuts turn rancid VERY easily due to their high oil content .
This is not new , I have noticed this several times over the past few years .

Weird !
I get a strange taste in my mouth after eating pineapple , but it definitely does n't last for two weeks .
I 'll be curious to see if they find an explanation .

I 'm aure people are looking into this , but I wonder if the differences in people who do and do n't get pine mouth from the same batch of nuts parallels the genetic difference noted in people who do and do n't perceive bitterness when tasting PTC and PROP .
( See ' supertaster ' on wikipedia ) .

I find this truly interesting , and have been trepidatious in my pine nut eating since the original , just to be on the safe side .
( I know , I 'm not helping the industry . )
Like the industry side , though , I 'm anxious to have answers so I know what to look for in quality and what to avoid .

I 've had a similar experience a number of times over the last year , except that I associated it with raw carrots that , to be honest , had seen better days .
Its really frustrating for someone who likes to eat !
My personal theory is that it 's some sort of mold .

UK broadband users are to get a £ 500 million bill for tackling online piracy , according to a report in today 's Times newspaper , working out at £ 25 per user per year .
Ministers have confirmed that the Digital Economy Bill , which has already generated mass protest , will force ISPs to raise the costs of an average broadband subscription by £ 25 a year , costs associated with warning users , then slowing or stopping the connections of those who subsequently refuse to stop downloading .
Ministers have also confirmed that the measures will result in £ 1.7 billion in extra sales for the music and film industries , and an extra £ 350 million for the government in extra VAT .
Charles Dunstone of the Carphone Warehouse , who has been a vocal critic of the scheme , said , " Broadband consumers should n't have to bail out the music industry .
If they really think it 's worth spending vast sums of money on these measures then they should be footing the bill ; not the consumer . "
A spokeman for the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills , said , " the overall benefits to the country far outweigh the costs . "

Record numbers of stretch limos and private jets are descending on Copenhagen as thousands of CO2 belching , caviar scoffing , prostitute molesting , hypocritical climate crooks prepare to orchestrate the next round of mass raping in pursuit of their much cherished world government and its handmaiden , a global tax on carbon emissions .
In another stark reminder that these globalists could n’t give a damn about CO2 emissions , only eviscerating economies and the middle class , their own behavior is completely at odds with how they are indignantly demanding other people live their lives .
A London Telegraph report reveals how the combined CO2 footprint of the conference will amount to no less than 41,000 tons , equal to that produced by an African country over the same period .
Despite the fact that the climate crooks constantly berate and browbeat Joe Public about not driving hybrid vehicles and taking two holidays a year via commercial airliners , the Copenhagen criminals are arriving in luxurious private jets before whizzing around town in gas - guzzling stretch limos .
“ We thought they were not going to have many cars , due to it being a climate convention , ” Majken Friss Jorgensen , managing director of Copenhagen ’s biggest limousine company told the Telegraph .
“ But it seems that somebody last week looked at the weather report . ”
“ Ms Jorgensen reckons that between her and her rivals the total number of limos in Copenhagen next week has already broken the 1,200 barrier .
The French alone rang up on Thursday and ordered another 42 .
“ We have n’t got enough limos in the country to fulfil the demand , ” she says .
“ We ’re having to drive them in hundreds of miles from Germany and Sweden . ”
“ And the total number of electric cars or hybrids among that number ?
“ Five , ” says Ms Jorgensen . ”
While readying speeches about how the middle class will be forced to lower their living standards , pay higher taxes on all forms of travel , and make personal sacrifices in order to save the planet from the alleged menace of CO2 , Copenhagen globalists will be relaxing on the 140 extra private jets that are being forced to drop off attendees in Copenhagen and then fly back to other airports and even other countries just to park due to the lack of spaces .
Elitists will scoff scallops , foie gras and sculpted caviar wedges , while lecturing the general public about how eating meat is harming the earth .
And while the climate crooks wag their finger at you for having the audacity to own an SUV , they will be running up a bill of over $ 200 million dollars , and guess who is going to be picking up the tab ?
“ According to an analysis by the Taxpayer ’s Alliance , a conservative cost of Copenhagen is £ 130 million .
It includes £ 6.3 million on flights , £ 20 million on hotels and £ 3.3 million on food , ” reports the Daily Mail .
“ The figure also includes the salaries for delegates and the contribution from the Danish government of £ 37 million .
Most of the money will come from taxpayers . ”
Meanwhile , eco-fascism has proven it ’s still very much alive and well with the news that “ 56 major newspapers in 45 countries are today publishing a shared editorial calling on politicians and negotiators gathering in Copenhagen to strike an ambitious deal on combating climate change . ”
Of course , behind the contrived grandstanding on behalf of such publications that they are somehow speaking with one united voice in the interests of humankind , all this really shows is that the same establishment attempting to bang the last few nails in the coffin of freedom , by taxing carbon dioxide , the life - giving gas that humans exhale and trees absorb , also happen to own and control the vast majority of the global media .
Far from being an upstanding act of benign advocacy , as it is being framed , the fact that 56 major world newspapers are all spewing the same propaganda , especially in light of the Climategate scandal that most of them have failed to even acknowledge in any depth whatsoever , smacks of the kind of editorial control the Nazis exercised in 1930 ’s Germany or Joseph Stalin enjoyed in Communist Russia .

Meanwhile , according to an article in Spiegel Online , prostitutes are preparing for globalists to descend on Copenhagen by offering free sex .
The Mayor of Copenhagen attempted to limit the expected deluge of summit attendees enjoying the use of prostitutes by sending a letter to hotels across the city urging delegates and guests at the conference , “ Be sustainable , do n’t buy sex . ”
Prostitutes responded by offering free sex to any Copenhagen attendee who produces the Mayor ’s letter .
Summits of this size are routinely accompanied by a huge spike in the sex trade in whatever city they happen to be taking place .
While servants of the global elite and their masters lecture us about our moral imperatives , half of them are out committing adultery on a nightly basis during the same global conferences at which they habitually pose with righteous indignation .
Make sure you have plenty of vomit bags on standby over the next couple of weeks , because you are going to be endlessly lectured by a gaggle of amoral , money - grubbing , control freak thugs who could n’t care less about the environment unless they can invoke it as a pretext for taxing you out of existence while declaring the very particles that you breathe to be a deadly poison .

WASHINGTON 
Thirty million people without health insurance stand to gain coverage under a deal announced on Saturday by Senate Democrats .
To get the 60 votes needed to pass their bill , Democrats scrapped the idea of a government - run public insurance plan , cherished by liberals , and replaced it with a proposal for nationwide health plans , which would be offered by private insurers under contract with the government .
The legislation also includes a proposal that would limit insurance coverage of abortion .
The provision , which was the last piece of the puzzle to fall into place , was negotiated by the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada , to win the support of Senator Ben Nelson , Democrat of Nebraska , who is an opponent of abortion .
Under the agreement , states could choose to prohibit abortion coverage in the insurance markets , or exchanges , where most health plans would be sold .
In my efforts to teach myself Scala , I tried solving a problem I ’ve tackled in various languages , 6510 assembly code ( did n’t get far … ) , pl/sql , Java ( with and without Drools ) and Groovy among them .
Usually I get bogged down in some detail of the language so I never get to reap any actual benefits of my efforts in daily life .
The plus side of this never ending task is that by now I do n’t have to spend effort on defining a problem but instead can start coding right away .
So this story is about how to parse text in Scala and is part of THE software package that will automagically generate a menu for a week and the shopping list for that menu together with whatever else my family will need that week and send it to www.albert.nl and have the groceries delivered to my door .
Thinking big and starting small , I set about ( again ) parsing a set of recipes so I can extract the list of ingredients necessary for the shopping list .
Since all of my practical knowledge of Scala came from reading the book by Martin Odersky , there was some evolution in my code .
As we go , I ’ll try and amuse you with some of the clunky contraptions I ’ve created along the way while trying to shake of old habits .
The aim is to parse a list of recipes like the one below :
[ text ]
name ZucchiniWithMinceMeat
season summer
category easy
cookingtime 45 minutes
preheat oven at 180 degrees
fry 500 gram mincemeat
fry 1 piece Zucchini
add 1 can mashedTomatoes
add 1 bag groundCheese
bake for 30 minutes
[ / text ]
and turning it into a list of groceries like this :
[ text ]
mincemeat 500 gram
Zucchini 1 piece
mashedTomatoes 1 can
groundCheese 1 bag
[ / text ]
Scala offers a parser for text named StandardTokenParsers in the package scala.util.parsing.combinator.syntactical .
The idea is that a specific parser extends StandardTokenParsers .
The parser should provide
lexical .
delimiters is the list of characters used to separate tokens in the input .
lexical .
reserved defines a set of key words , i.e. the while , if , for etc of your language .
The snippet below shows my definitions ( it is part of com.xebia.cooking .CookBookDSL.scala , which you can find in the zip file attached to this post . ) .
[ scala ]
lexical.delimiters ++= List ( " ( " , " ) " , " , " , " " , "
" )
lexical .
reserved ++= List ( " name " , " season " , " fry " , " pack " , " can " , " bag " , " piece " , " at " , " for " , " bottle " , " gram " , " oven " , " preheat " , " bake " , " serve " , " with " , " add " , " degrees " , " category " , " cookingtime " )
[ / scala ]
lexical is of type Lexical and is an inherited attribute of StandardTokenParsers .
The parser is started like this :
[ scala ]
def parseCookBook( cookBook : String ) : CookBook = {
cookbook ( new lexical .
Scanner ( cookBook ) ) match {
case Success ( recipeList , _ ) => new CookBook ( recipeList )
case Failure ( msg , _ ) => throw new ParseErrorException ( msg )
case Error( msg , _ ) => throw new ParseErrorException ( msg )
}
}
[ / scala ]
The input is a string representation of a cookbook .
parseCookBook returns an object of type CookBook which we will discuss later .
The parsing is kicked off by calling the cookbook method with an instance of a Scanner as a parameter .
The Scanner will emit tokens that are matched with the rules of the grammar as we ’ll see below .
Using Scala ’s case construct the result of the parser is translated in either a CookBook instance or results in an exception .
The parser consists of a set of rules in the form of method definitions that look like the one below :
[ scala ]
def recipeName : Parser [ String ] =
" name " ~ ident ^^ { case " name " ~ name => name }
[ / scala ]
The rule defines the name of a recipe as a String .
The text to the left of the ^^ operator defines the tokens that must appear in the input for the rule to match .
In this case we expect the string “ name ” followed by an identifier .
ident is defined in StdTokenParsers ( along with numericLit which I ’ll use later ) and matches a string of alphanumeric characters .
The tokens that are thus parsed are used to select a action to the right of the ^^ sign .
“ name ” ~ name introduces a variable named name that is initialized with the value of the ident token .
name is then returned as a result of the rule by placing it to the right of the => sign .
A slightly more complex example is shown below :
[ scala ]
def ingredient : Parser [ Ingredient ] =
opt ( amount ) ~ ident ^^
{ case Some( amount ) ~ ingredient => ( new Ingredient ( ingredient , amount ) )
case _ ~ ingredient => { new Ingredient ( ingredient ) }
}
[ / scala ]
This rule matches text like “ 500 gram mincemeat ” , “ 1 piece Zucchini ” but also “ salad ” or “ tomatoes ” .
The amount part of the definition is made optional .
Instead of just one case clause like we saw in the first rule , this rule has two cases .
The first matches an amount followed by an ingredient , the second matches just an ingredient without the amount part .
One rule can build on the results of other rules as illustrated below :
[ scala ]
def step : Parser [ Step ] =
( fryStep | preHeatStep | serveWithStep | addStep | bakeStep ) ^^ { case step => step }
[ / scala ]
A step in a recipe is something like “ preheat oven at 180 degrees ” or “ fry 500 gram mincemeat ” .
The clauses to the left are alternatives that are defined as separate rules .
The result is always a Step instance .
Steps are important because some of them define ingredients which , in some hypothetical future version of my magnum opus , will result in a shopping list ( do I hear laughter ? ) .
One last sample rule shows repeating elements :
[ scala ]
def listOfSeasons : Parser [ List [ Seasons ] ] =
repsep ( season , " , " ) ^^ { listOfSeasons : List [ Seasons ] => listOfSeasons }
}
[ / scala ]
This rule matches one or more occurrences of a season separated by a comma using the repsep clause .
The result is a List of objects of type Seasons .
The parser code uses classes that represent concepts in my domain , like Ingredient , Step and Recipe .
I ’ve defined these classes in a separate source file named Recipe. scala .
Most of the classes are empty and just serve to define concepts .
They may become more interesting later ( you know , when I implement this wonderful … , etc , etc… ) .
Others , like StepWithAnIngredient serve to collect ingredients that will be used to create a shopping list .
Anyway , one thing I learned from writing the classes in the Recipe. scala file is the use the mkString method .
Given my Java background I wrote toString methods like this :
[ scala ]
override def toString = {
val result : StringBuilder = new StringBuilder ( " Steps : " )
list.foreach(step => result.append(step ) .append ( "
" ) )
result.toString ( )
}
[ / scala ]
I was feeling pretty happy about this ( you know , remembering to use the foreach method ) until I realized this kind of thing is way easier implemented like this :
[ scala ]
override def toString = " Steps : " + steps.mkString ( "
" )
[ / scala ]
You can call mkString on any instance you like and it will return a string representation , which is especially convenient in the case of iterable objects .
Another powerful Scala feature is the set of methods defined on lists .
One such method is filter that accepts a closure executed on each element of the list .
If the condition returns true the element is added to the result .
In the example below , the _ represents a recipe , i.e. an element of the list of recipes .
[ scala ]
def findRecipesBySeason( season : Seasons ) : Seq [ Recipe ] = {
recipes.filter(_.seasons.contains ( season ) )
}
[ / scala ]
Another thing that had me thoroughly confused at first was the syntax for constructor parameters .
The example below shows the variables amount and unitName defined in the Amount class , the Java way :
[ java ]
public class Amount {
private int amount ;
private String unitName ;
public Amount ( int amount , String unitName ) {
this.amount=amount ;
this.unitName=unitName ;
}
// getters and setters omitted for brevity …
}
[ / java ]
And in Scala :
[ scala ]
class Amount ( val amount : Int , val unitName : String ) {
override def toString = amount + " :" +unitName
}
[ / scala ]
The parameters following the name of the class are turned into public val’s .
With my Java background and my compulsion to hit ctrl - 1 in Eclipse , it took me awhile to realize how easy and concise the Scala syntax is .
Note that the Recipe. scala file contains a list of class definitions .
In Scala there is no one - to - one mapping from public classes to source files .
This allowed me to combine a list of related concepts in a single source file .
Finally , I found that the best way to develop parsers is by taking very small steps at a time .
It is pretty easy to mess things up beyond repair by changing too much at at once .
This Scala parser is by far the most complete version I ’ve built so far .
I ’m now starting to like the language , even though my lack of experience gets in the way at least 15 times an hour .
Who knows , I might actually create something useful this time …

During the Unite conference , Unity Technologies announced that 6,500 people have signed up and joined the Unity community in the past 48 hours .
" We announced in the keynote that we had 13,000 registered members now , and that ’s taken us five years , " said Unity product evangelist Tom Higgins .
" Within 48 hours we ’ve added another 6,500 to that number . "
Although many of these will have been merely to download the Unity package , it ’s likely that a good percentage of these will stick around – further enriching the community , which Unity uses as one of its selling points .
Develop has also heard that at least one high - profile customer of Unity has praised the move , saying that it will give them a wider base of people to hire from .
Saturn as you rarely see it : Cassini mission captures planet in its natural colours with little sign of the spectacular rings
Famed for it 's spectacular ring system , this stately , natural - colour image has captured Saturn as you rarely see it .
The planet dwarfs its icy moon Rhea in this image from Nasa 's Cassini mission , with just a single dark band where we would expect to see the thousands of orbiting rings .
A natural colour view of Saturn and its icy moon Rhea
Rhea , which is 949 miles across - almost the distance from Land 's End to John o' Groats - is captured orbiting beyond the rings on the right of the image .
A small shadow below the rings on the left is cast by its moon Tethys .
This awe - inspiring picture was taken with the wide - angle camera on the Cassini - Huygens robotic spacecraft mission , a co-operative project bewteen Nasa , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
Images taken using red , green and blue spectral filters and then combined to create this natural colour view .
Classic sight :
The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft returned this image of Saturn taken with its narrow - angle camera in May 2004
The image was taken aboard the Cassini orbiter on 4 November , from 808,000 miles away .
Saturn is the second biggest planet in our Solar System and takes up the same space as around 833 Earths .
Classified as a gas giant the planet has sixty - one known moons .
Astronomers have been baffled by Saturn 's rings ever since they were discovered by Galileo in 1610 .
The rings are each composed of billions of ice and rock particles , which range from being as small as a grain of sugar to as large as a house .
Tennessee Tenth Amendment Resolution update and an apology
Back in February of this year , I posted about the Tennessee resolution to affirm states rights .
here
That post is still getting readers and there are many searches for any information about the Amendment .
I apologize for not following up on it .
On the 27th of June , the Governor of Tennessee signed the Resolution after it had been passed by both the state senate and house .

While HJR0108 is strongly - word in support of the principles of limited , constitutional government that the 10th Amendment represents , it is a Joint Resolution and does not carry with it the force of law .
But supporters say that this is an important first step to get their message out not only to grassroots supporters , but to the media , and legislators in other states as well .
The Tenth Amendment Center also posts a map displaying action taken by individual states .

As they say at the site “ Follow - up , of course , is a must . ” I apologize for not posting about this before .
Gul says Istanbul will not enforce the ICC arrest warrant against Bashir
Turkish President Abdullah Gul has accused the EU of interfering after Ankara was asked to reconsider an invitation to the president of Sudan .
Omar al - Bashir has been indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
But Mr Gul said he was invited to a summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , not for bilateral talks with Turkish officials .
Turkey , which has applied for EU membership , does not recognise the ICC .
It says it has no plans to arrest Mr Bashir , who is due to attend an OIC economic summit in Istanbul on Sunday and Monday .
Turkey insists it is not shifting away from its traditionally close ties to the West .
But the BBC's Jonathan Head , in Istanbul , says the country is certainly choosing some controversial new partnerships .
The visit by the Sudanese president comes fresh on the heels of the Turkish prime minister 's groundbreaking state visit to Iran in October , when Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared that country 's nuclear programme to be entirely peaceful .
Mr Bashir 's visit to Turkey will be his third in the past 18 months , but his first since the ICC arrest warrant was issued in March .
A coalition of Turkish human rights groups is protesting against the visit , our correspondent says .
They have accused the government of double standards for condemning Israel over its actions in Gaza , and then hosting a president who is blamed for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Darfur .
A book called Crazy Wacky Theme Restaurants : Japan landed in my mailbox a couple of months ago .
It 's a beautifully - designed volume full of photos and essays chronicling author La Carmina 's journey into the world of fetish restaurants in Japan .
Carmina , who is from Vancouver , has a Gothic - Lolita Japanese fashion blog , and when she goes out , she wears Japanese street style - inspired attire .
She writes about Japan because she is " fascinated " by the culture .
" I can't pinpoint exactly what it is , " she tells me over the phone from her book tour .
" There 's something very fresh and westernized about Japanese design .
It 's a certain sensibility . "
Carmina 's not the only one who feels this way — obsession with Japanese culture is everywhere .
I did n't realize just how big it was until I became an intern at Wired four years ago .
On my first day there , an editor asked me to write textbook graffiti in kanji for the September issue 's Japanese School Girl Watch section .
The simple fact that I'm Japanese quickly became one of my greatest advantages as an aspiring writer .
I started paying attention to my motherland as a repository of story ideas .
I looked at things differently when I went back home , honed my story - finding skills , and launched my own blog , TokyoMango .
I got major Japan - related assignments from magazines , consulting gigs from print and radio outlets , and a book deal .
It was really strange for me , because all I thought I was doing was telling people about the place I came from .
One thing was clear : Weird Japan sells .
It 's an almost guaranteed success for book publishers and major traffic bait for blogs .
But writing about my own country 's quirks has its downside .
I strive to tell each story objectively without condescension or sensationalism , but every time I write an article about , say , the engineer who has a body pillow girlfriend or the grad student who married a Nintendo DS character , I get hundreds of racially - charged comments from readers , long ranting responses from defenders of Japanese culture , and dozens of emails from people at big media outlets who want to find out more about these " strange " phenomena .
Why do so many love to gawk at this mysterious , foreign " other " that is Japanese culture ?
There are plenty of strange things going on in the US too , but when it happens in Japan , it 's suddenly incomprehensible , despicable , awesome , and crazy .
This fascination does n't just end with angry commenters , either .
Over the last couple of decades , it has spawned a huge industry of magazines , blogs , and products themed around Japanese culture marketed to Westerners by Westerners who are also obsessed with Japanese culture .
My friend Joi Ito and I talk about this a lot .
He , like me , is Japanese and was brought up with both American and Japanese influences .
This question resonates not only with the work that we do , but with our personal identities .
While we do our fair share of sitting around analyzing Japanese culture , it 's also deeply personal to us when someone criticizes our country or our opinions of it .
One big reason for the global obsession may be that Japanese culture is like an altered , offbeat version of American culture .
The Japanese schoolgirl uniform " sailor fuku " is adapted from American sailor uniforms , for example , and the whole maid cafe phenomenon takes its origins from French maids .
Everyone can relate to anime at least a little bit , because all of us grew up with some cartoon influence in our lives .
" Americans in particular like Japanese culture because it is eerily close to their own — with just a few tweaks , " W. David Marx , CNNGo's Tokyo city editor and an American living in Japan , says over email .
" Japan often feels like a hyperextended high - tech version of 1950s America — frozen gender roles , mass culture incapable of controversy or antisocial sentiments , an entertainment world run by the mob .
Japan is basically the Jetsons .
We do n't have to take it seriously , but we are entertained . "
Japan also has one of the biggest consumer markets outside of the US , and it 's a relatively safe place to fetishize .
" A lot of the sick stuff is on the surface , but it 's not threatening , " Ito says .
" Nobody will beat you up .
You ca n't fetishize about the Muslim Brotherhood ; that would be dangerous . "
Overriding all this Japanalysis , though , is the fact that none of this is meant to be taken seriously .
One important premise of Japanese popular culture is the commitment to have fun and not take offense .
Japanese humor works on many different levels and its nuances can be hard to explain to people who did n't grow up with it .
If you 're one of those people who watched our wedding video between the man and his DS girlfriend and said things like : " He 's such a loser " " He takes it too seriously LOL " and " God help this poor soul " — not to mention the racist comments about Japs and nukes and one - inch dicks — you just do n't get it .
You 're not in on the joke .
You 're the one taking it too seriously , and you might be imposing your own biases and hang - ups on someone else 's situation .
Being majime ( too serious ) is not cool in Japan ; likewise it is important for voyeurs of Japanese culture to recognize that most everything pop-culture -y that is exported to the West comes at us with a wink .
If you 're all up in arms about it , then maybe the joke is on you .
On the outside , guys like Sal9000 ( the guy who married his DS girlfriend ) and Nisan ( the guy with the body pillow girlfriend ) may seem " weird " or " crazy . "
But they 've really just found creative ways to toy with amorphous concepts like love and romance that complement their own unique lives .
Same with the venues in Carmina 's fetish restaurant guide .
Make what you will of getting drunk in a fake church or being chased out of an Alcatrez - themed restaurant by masked crazies , but it 's most important to remember that it 's all in good fun .
The way I see it , Japanese popular culture is like abstract art .
Both involve many components that can be interpreted in many ways .
If you ask the artist what it means , he might say , " What do you think it means ? "
And whatever meaning you attach to it is more a reflection of who you are than the composition of the art itself .
As Camina writes in her book : " you can moan ' this is stoopid ' … or you can work with it .
Roll with it . "
I think we'd all understand Japan a little better if we made a commitment to roll with it .
The aim of Love Plus is to court and build a relationship with one of three cartoon - style women , but virtual romance was not enough for this particular player , identified only by his username Sal9000 .
A family from Wirral , Merseyside , has won the right to claim compensation after their son was attacked by another three - year - old with a car jack two years ago .
Jay Jones needed stitches in his head after the assault , which happened when the two toddlers were left alone for a few minutes in a car in Birkenhead in December 2007 .
Within hours , doctors at Arrowe Park hospital , Merseyside , were confident that Jay would survive , but it took much longer to confirm that he would suffer no lasting brain damage .
He suffered nightmares and bedwetting for months afterwards and was terrified to go near windows because it reminded him of being in the car .
Jay 's family won a ruling on Tuesday allowing for compensation for the injuries he received , even though his attacker was not prosecuted because of his age .
Jay 's mother , Renai Williams , 29 , said the Tribunals Service ruled in her favour although the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority ( CICA ) had twice refused to pay out as it disputed whether such a young child could be guilty of a crime of violence .
Williams told the BBC : " This has been a long and hard - fought process .
We have been knocked back twice by the CICA because in my opinion they did n't take my son's case seriously .
My son was hit 11 times on his head and face with a car jack , his attacker kept on lashing out even though Jay was screaming out in pain and covered in blood .
It was a vicious attack with such force that his attacker , who was also only three himself , managed to crack the car windscreen . "
Williams and her partner had been preparing to go to a post - Christmas dinner and had allowed their son to travel with friends .
" We were getting ready to get into the car when we received a phone call from the other family saying we had better come quick , " Williams said .
" We drove round , but we were n't too worried – boys fight .
But when we got there we noticed the crack in the car windscreen – that was the first bit of panic .
Then the other parents came running out the house .
" My partner , Jay 's dad David , got out of the car saying ' where 's Jay ? '
They pointed to the house and he went inside and I heard him shouting ' what happened ' and they pointed to the car jack , which had blood on it .
David came out carrying Jay , who was covered in blood and all limp .
He just looked dead . "
Jay spent two nights in hospital and suffered bruising to his head and wounds on his arms .
Simon Gibson , a partner at Kirwans , said CICA rejected the family 's claims initially , arguing that the attacker lacked sufficient knowledge to be able to carry out a criminal attack .
The age of criminal responsibility in England , Wales and Northern Ireland is 10 .
" From the point of view of criminal law that makes good sense , but a claim for damages is civil law .
Under that you only have to prove the act was deliberate , " he said .
" We succeeded on Tuesday before an independent appeal .
They said this was a unique case . "
Gibson said the ruling could open the floodgates for similar claims – even schoolyard attacks involving young children .
CICA said : " We express our sympathy to all victims of crime and their families .
All cases are decided on their own merits and , if an applicant does not think their case was assessed fairly , they may apply to have it reviewed .
If the applicant remains unhappy after the review they can appeal to an independent tribunal . "
The amount of compensation is yet to be decided .

MP Damian Green has had his DNA profile deleted since being arrested Innocent people trying to get their DNA records removed from police databases in England and Wales face a postcode lottery , the Conservatives have said .
Figures they obtained show some forces delete the profiles of most applicants , but others refuse to remove any at all .
The average removal rate is only 22 % , with six forces not removing any .
Chief Constable Chris Sims , of Acpo , said the police would work with the government to develop clearer guidance over DNA retention .
Last year the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the DNA records of people who had not been charged or convicted cannot be held indefinitely .
In November the government announced new measures to address the court 's judgement , which the Home Office said balanced the public 's concerns with the operational needs of the police .
Government policy on DNA is a shambles - it is imperative that the police return the DNA of all innocent people .
Damian Green , shadow immigration minister
The measures - including new guidance for police forces - will go before Parliament as part of the Crime and Security Bill announced in the Queen 's Speech last month .
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have said they would oppose the plan .
They argue the system should be the same as in Scotland , which already deletes most of the profiles where there has been no charge or conviction .
Shadow immigration minister Damian Green , who requested the figures under the Freedom of Information Act , said : " Government policy on DNA is a shambles .
It is imperative that the police return the DNA of all innocent people . "
The forces that did not remove the DNA profiles of any of applicants were Nottingham , Dyfed Powys , Cambridgeshire , City of London , Humberside and Gloucestershire .
Those most likely to remove the information were South Yorkshire and Wiltshire , with 80 % or more of requests granted , see details below .
Mr Green managed to reclaim his own DNA from the Metropolitan Police following his arrest in 2008 - as part of an inquiry into Home Office leaks - and subsequent release .
I do n't see why it 's being retained , for what reason ?
I have done nothing wrong
Johanna Upton But Johanna Upton , a former magistrate from St Leonards in Sussex , has been trying unsuccessfully to get her DNA records wiped for five years .
She was arrested following a misunderstanding over a remark she made about her ex-husband .
Although she was released without charge , Kent Police have refused repeated requests to take her off their DNA database .
" I just feel it 's an invasion of my privacy , " she said .
" It 's not something I wish to share and I do n't see why it 's being retained .
For what reason ?
I have done nothing wrong . "
Anyone who is arrested but not charged or convicted can apply to a Chief Constable to have their DNA records removed , but current guidelines from the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) say it should only happen under " exceptional circumstances " .
Chief Constable Chris Sims , an expert on forensic science at Acpo , said DNA was " hugely important in many investigations " but it was also " vital " the database remained " reasonable and proportionate " .
The government claims that over the last decade , the DNA database has given the police possible leads on an offender 's identity in nearly half a million cases .
Following public consultation it is now recommending a six year limit for retaining the DNA of most unconvicted adults .
Home Office minister Alan Campbell said the DNA database played a " vital role " in preventing crime and " bringing offenders to justice " .
' Proportionate plan ' Repeat offenders or people convicted of serious crimes would have their DNA profiles held indefinitely .
Unconvicted 16 to 17 - year - olds would have them held for six years where they were arrested for a serious offence , three years for arrests over minor offences .
Unconvicted younger juveniles would face a three - year limit .
Last month Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he believed the proposals represented the most proportionate approach to DNA retention , " as well as the most effective way of ensuring the database continues to help us tackle crime " .
But the Conservatives say none of the recommendations are yet law and in the meantime leaving so many innocent people on the DNA database is undermining public confidence in the police .
" We need a new policy which is clear and fair , " said Mr Green .
" A Conservative government would adopt the Scottish system where the vast majority of innocent people have their DNA removed immediately . "
For the Liberal Democrats , Chris Huhne said all innocent people 's DNA should be automatically removed when an investigation was completed .
" Police forces that prove reluctant even to respond to requests for removal are damaging their own reputation with the public , " he said .
" They are misjudging what will have to happen , regardless of the election result , if we are to comply with the European Court of Human Rights judgement respecting privacy . "

The laudable work done by bestselling author Jonathan Safran Foer in revealing deplorable conditions of farm animals -- is illegal and constitutes terrorism .
With the publication of Jonathan Safran Foer 's captivating and powerful book , Eating Animals , much has been said and written about his undercover investigative work , which gives America a view inside the hidden world of factory farms .
What has not been commented on , however , is the disquieting fact that under existing federal and state laws , Mr. Foer 's undercover actions -- while clearly an important public service -- are actually illegal , and what 's more , they constitute acts of domestic terrorism .
Sound absurd ?
It should .
But the reality is this :
In 2006 , President Bush signed into law a little - known but sweeping piece of legislation called the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act ( AETA ) , an expansion of the previously existing and equally little - known Animal Enterprise Protection Act .
With speed and lack of reflection rivaling the passage of the USA Patriot Act after 9/11 , Congress pushed this animal industry - crafted law through in a single day , with only a lone dissenting vote in opposition , that of Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich .
Was Mr. Kucinich the only one to read that AETA makes into domestic terrorism any actions that physically interfere with the operation of any animal enterprise , or that cause physical or economic damage to the said enterprise , regardless of motive or reason ?
Yes , you read that correctly .
Under AETA , the following actions by Mr. Foer -- all described in his book -- constitute animal enterprise terrorism :
Mr. Foer , a New York resident , illegally and under the cover of night , enters a turkey factory farm in California with an animal rights activist identified only as " C. "
This is interstate travel and conspiracy , and also a violation of California 's own sweeping Animal Enterprise Protection
Act and other laws prohibiting trespassing on , filming in , or otherwise documenting the operations of a factory farm .
Following the initial trespass , " C. " -- with the clear foreknowledge and consent of Mr. Foer -- euthanizes a sick and suffering turkey chick writhing on the floor .
Now we 're talking conspiracy and destruction of property of an animal enterprise .
There are further actions and statements in the book that could also be interpreted as Mr. Foer interfering , or at least trying to interfere with the operation of various animal enterprises .
Indeed , much of what Mr. Foer exposes stirs such moral indignation that it'd be strange if people did n't take to the streets to demand change , thereby possibly interfering with the operation of one animal enterprise or another .
For all this , our laws say , Mr. Foer could be prosecuted as a domestic terrorist .
But of course he wo n't be .
I hope .
Not because what I say is n't true , but because Mr. Foer is protected by his stature as a celebrated author .
Unfortunately , animal rights activists such as " C. " are not so lucky .
Despite FBI and Congressional claims to the contrary , AETA has -- and is -- being used to criminalize and prosecute legal , constitutionally protected activities aimed at exposing and stopping the hidden cruelties of America 's animal industries .
One person who tried to warn Congress of the threat of such prosecutions was investigative journalist Will Potter , who testified about the civil liberties implications of AETA before its passage , and who continues to be the lone voice covering this issue at his excellent and eye - opening blog , greenisthenewred.com , which draws chilling parallels between the persecution of animal rights and environmental activists today and the civil rights abuses of the McCarthy era .
Consider this :
In 2006 , six young American activists affiliated with the animal rights group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA received a combined sentence of 23 years in federal prison , simply for operating a website that called for legal protests against the multinational animal testing giant Huntingdon Life Sciences ( HLS ) and its suppliers .
After radical underground activists unaffiliated with the campaign engaged in post - protest vandalism , the organizers were arrested , charged with inciting animal enterprise terrorism , and convicted in one of the most chilling and speedy secret trials in memory , from which all press was banned .
Shockingly , the SHAC USA verdict was recently held up on appeal by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court in Philadelphia , which found that even legal , constitutionally protected activity can be criminalized in the context of AETA prosecutions .
Earlier this year , four northern California animal rights activists were arrested and charged with terrorism for protesting , chalking the sidewalk , and leafleting outside the homes of animal researchers .
The FBI continues to characterize " animal rights extremists " and " eco-terrorists " as the nation 's leading domestic threats , even though not a single person in our country has ever been physically harmed by these people .
Ever .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
Dave Grohl is furiously pounding on his drum kit , his shoulder - length hair flying in 16 directions .
It 's a scene straight out of 1993 , except Kurt Cobain is n't at the mic .
It 's Josh Homme , best known as the frontman for Queens of the Stone Age .
At his side , a gentleman in a button - down shirt lays down fat bass lines with the quiet confidence of a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer with nothing left to prove except that he can still have fun .
The man is John Paul Jones from Led Zeppelin , and the band is Them Crooked Vultures .
The supergroup trio has just released its self - titled debut disc .
When they hit the stage at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles , they 're greeted with a hero 's welcome .
Their current single , " New Fang , " is indicative of the Vultures ' sound : quirky time signatures in the vein of Queens of the Stone Age , anchored by chunky Zeppelin - influenced riffs , with enough stops - and - starts to keep a drummer on his toes .
" I think the idea was that it should sound like me playing drums and John playing bass and Josh playing guitar and singing , " said Grohl , who is clearly relishing a more behind - the - scenes role in this band than he does as the leader of the Foo Fighters .
We caught up with the Vultures backstage in their first - ever television interview .
Onstage , Grohl and Homme want to show that they can keep up with a world - class bass player .
Offstage , the 63 - year - old bass player more than keeps up with two world - class smart alecks .
CNN : How did this project come together ?
Who 's the mastermind behind it ?
Dave Grohl : I 'd known Josh for a long time .
We 've been friends for years and years .
Worked with John on a Foos record maybe five years ago .
Josh and I talked about doing a project away from our other bands .
Foo Fighters were taking a break ; Queens of the Stone Age were taking a break .
We thought we'd do something together , so we decided to invite the greatest bass player in the world .
Josh Homme :
But he could n't make it .
Grohl : So we got John Paul Jones .
( Laughter )
CNN : Dave , did n't this come together at your 40th birthday party ?
Something about [ the theme restaurant ] Medieval Times ?
Grohl : Yeah , I had my 40th birthday in January this year , and I thought it would be funny to have the party at Medieval Times .
John Paul Jones :
Where you normally have your 14th .
Grohl :
So I invited the guys to come to the party .
John flew all the way from England to come to it .
Homme : Well , they already have Medieval Times .
Jones : Yeah , I left it behind to go to it -- 400 years ago , when my band started .
CNN : You had to figure out what to name the band .
Grohl : I have a band called Foo Fighters .
John was in a band called Led Zeppelin .
Josh 's band is called Queens of the Stone Age .
It was all relative .
So Them Crooked Vultures did n't sound so ridiculous .
Homme : I think in these modern times , a little bad English -- we came up with the name after we 'd done the music , and it felt like what someone would say once we left town .
Like ( goes into Jimmy Cagney voice ) " Them Crooked Vultures . "
CNN : Did it all come together at someone 's house or at a studio ?
Homme : I got a studio called Pink Duck .
Jones : A very macho sort of place .
Homme :
It 's a little bungalow hideaway .
...
It was nice having that secret .
It was nice knowing that we were going to surprise everyone .
CNN : We were watching your soundcheck -- and Dave , it looked like you were having a good time pounding on the drums once again .
Grohl :
It hurts .
CNN : Do you have blisters ?
Grohl : I have problems .
CNN : I know you were looking for aspirin after soundcheck .
Jones : I get blisters standing next to him .
In my ears .
Grohl :
It 's great playing the drums .
The drums are n't my first instrument , but it 's the instrument I can play and not really have to think about what I 'm doing .
I just sort of do it off the top of my head .
CNN : What 's it like playing in a band with John Paul Jones ?
Homme :
He 's right here .
Hello - o-o .
Jones :
It 's great .
I 'm really enjoying it .
CNN : Where do you want to take this project ?
Is it the first of many albums , many tours ?
Homme :
There 's no need to Nostradamus your way through that .
Just kind of let it do it 's thing .
We have a little Magic 8 Ball that we bought together -- our first gift -- so we might use that a little , too .
Grohl : I look at it like every day is one step closer to breaking up .
CNN : John , how do you deal with all this juvenile humor ?
Jones : I hate it .
The kids , you know ?
Homme :
You know what ?
We 're never going to grow up .
Ever .
CNN : But is n't that the point of being in a rock band ?
Homme : I do n't know .
I 'm such a child , I have no idea .
Grohl : Pssh , no -- the MONEY !
What are you , crazy ?!
You know how rich we are ?
Whoo !
CNN : Well , that 's just it ; you guys do n't really need to do this .
Jones :
No , you 're right .
Bye !
( They all walk away laughing )
Debugging the kernel using Ftrace - part 1
LWN .net needs you !
Without subscribers , LWN would simply not exist .
Please consider signing up for a subscription and helping to keep LWN publishing
Ftrace is a tracing utility built directly into the Linux kernel .
Many distributions already have various configurations of Ftrace enabled in their most recent releases .
One of the benefits that Ftrace brings to Linux is the ability to see what is happening inside the kernel .
As such , this makes finding problem areas or simply tracking down that strange bug more manageable .
Ftrace 's ability to show the events that lead up to a crash gives a better chance of finding exactly what caused it and can help the developer in creating the correct solution .
This article is a two part series that will cover various methods of using Ftrace for debugging the Linux kernel .
This first part will talk briefly about setting up Ftrace , using the function tracer , writing to the Ftrace buffer from within the kernel , and various ways to stop the tracer when a problem is detected .
Ftrace was derived from two tools .
One was the " latency tracer " by Ingo Molnar used in the - rt tree .
The other was my own " logdev " utility that had its primary use on debugging the Linux kernel .
This article will mostly describe features that came out of logdev , but will also look at the function tracer that originated in the latency tracer .
Setting up Ftrace
Currently the API to interface with Ftrace is located in the Debugfs file system .
Typically , that is mounted at / sys / kernel / debug .
For easier accessibility , I usually create a / debug directory and mount it there .
Feel free to choose your own location for Debugfs .
When Ftrace is configured , it will create its own directory called tracing within the Debugfs file system .
This article will reference those files in that directory as though the user first changed directory to the Debugfs tracing directory to avoid any confusion as to where the Debugfs file system has been mounted .
[ ~ ] # cd / sys / kernel / debug / tracing [ tracing ] #
This article is focusing on using Ftrace as a debugging tool .
Some configurations for Ftrace are used for other purposes , like finding latency or analyzing the system .
For the purpose of debugging , the kernel configuration parameters that should be enabled are :
CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER
CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
CONFIG_STACK_TRACER
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
Function tracing - no modification necessary
One of the most powerful tracers of Ftrace is the function tracer .
It uses the - pg option of gcc to have every function in the kernel call a special function " mcount ( ) " .
That function must be implemented in assembly because the call does not follow the normal C ABI .
When CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE is configured the call is converted to a NOP at boot time to keep the system running at 100 % performance .
During compilation the mcount ( ) call - sites are recorded .
That list is used at boot time to convert those sites to NOPs .
Since NOPs are pretty useless for tracing , the list is saved to convert the call - sites back into trace calls when the function ( or function graph ) tracer is enabled .
It is highly recommended to enable CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE because of this performance enhancement .
In addition , CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE gives the ability to filter which function should be traced .
Note , even though the NOPs do not show any impact in benchmarks , the addition of frame pointers that come with the - pg option has been known to cause a slight overhead .
To find out which tracers are available , simply cat the available_tracers file in the tracing directory :
[ tracing ] # cat available_tracers function_graph function sched_switch nop
To enable the function tracer , just echo " function " into the current_tracer file .
[ tracing ] # echo function > current_tracer [ tracing ] # cat current_tracer function [ tracing ] # cat trace | head - 10 # tracer : function # # TASK - PID CPU# TIMESTAMP FUNCTION # | | | | | bash - 16939 [ 000 ] 6075.461561 : mutex_unlock <- tracing_set_tracer < idle >-0 [ 001 ] 6075.461561 : _spin_unlock_irqrestore <-hrtimer_get_next_event < idle >-0 [ 001 ] 6075.461562 : rcu_needs_cpu <-tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick bash - 16939 [ 000 ] 6075.461563 : inotify_inode_queue_event <- vfs_write < idle >-0 [ 001 ] 6075.461563 : mwait_idle <- cpu_idle bash - 16939 [ 000 ] 6075.461563 : __fsnotify_parent <-vfs_write
The header explains the format of the output pretty well .
The first two items are the traced task name and PID .
The CPU that the trace was executed on is within the brackets .
The timestamp is the time since boot , followed by the function name .
The function in this case is the function being traced with its parent following the " <- " symbol .
This information is quite powerful and shows the flow of functions nicely .
But it can be a bit hard to follow .
The function graph tracer , created by Frederic Weisbecker , traces both the entry and exit of a function , which gives the tracer the ability to know the depth of functions that are called .
The function graph tracer can make following the flow of execution within the kernel much easier to follow with the human eye :
[ tracing ] # echo function_graph > current_tracer [ tracing ] # cat trace | head - 20 # tracer : function_graph # # CPU DURATION FUNCTION CALLS # | | | | | | | 1 ) 1.015 us | _spin_lock_irqsave ( ) ; 1 ) 0.476 us | internal_add_timer ( ) ; 1 ) 0.423 us | wake_up_idle_cpu( ) ; 1 ) 0.461 us | _spin_unlock_irqrestore ( ) ; 1 ) 4.770 us | } 1 ) 5.725 us | } 1 ) 0.450 us | mutex_unlock ( ) ; 1 ) + 24.243 us | } 1 ) 0.483 us | _spin_lock_irq ( ) ; 1 ) 0.517 us | _spin_unlock_irq ( ) ; 1 ) | prepare_to_wait ( ) { 1 ) 0.468 us | _spin_lock_irqsave ( ) ; 1 ) 0.502 us | _spin_unlock_irqrestore ( ) ; 1 ) 2.411 us | } 1 ) 0.449 us | kthread_should_stop ( ) ; 1 ) | schedule ( ) {
This gives the start and end of a function denoted with the C like annotation of " { " to start a function and " } " at the end .
Leaf functions , which do not call other functions , simply end with a " ; " .
The DURATION column shows the time spent in the corresponding function .
The function graph tracer records the time the function was entered and exited and reports the difference as the duration .
These numbers only appear with the leaf functions and the " } " symbol .
Note that this time also includes the overhead of all functions within a nested function as well as the overhead of the function graph tracer itself .
The function graph tracer hijacks the return address of the function in order to insert a trace callback for the function exit .
This breaks the CPU 's branch prediction and causes a bit more overhead than the function tracer .
The closest true timings only occur for the leaf functions .
The lonely " + " that is there is an annotation marker .
When the duration is greater than 10 microseconds , a " + " is shown .
If the duration is greater than 100 microseconds a " ! " will be displayed .
Using trace_printk ( )
printk ( ) is the king of all debuggers , but it has a problem .
If you are debugging a high volume area such as the timer interrupt , the scheduler , or the network , printk ( ) can lead to bogging down the system or can even create a live lock .
It is also quite common to see a bug " disappear " when adding a few printk ( ) s. This is due to the sheer overhead that printk ( ) introduces .
Ftrace introduces a new form of printk ( ) called trace_printk ( ) .
It can be used just like printk ( ) , and can also be used in any context ( interrupt code , NMI code , and scheduler code ) .
What is nice about trace_printk ( ) is that it does not output to the console .
Instead it writes to the Ftrace ring buffer and can be read via the trace file .
Writing into the ring buffer with trace_printk ( ) only takes around a tenth of a microsecond or so .
But using printk ( ) , especially when writing to the serial console , may take several milliseconds per write .
The performance advantage of trace_printk ( ) lets you record the most sensitive areas of the kernel with very little impact .
For example you can add something like this to the kernel or module :
trace_printk ( " read foo %d out of bar %p
" , bar - > foo , bar ) ;
Then by looking at the trace file , you can see your output .
[ tracing ] # cat trace # tracer : nop # # TASK - PID CPU # TIMESTAMP FUNCTION # | | | | | <...>- 10690 [ 003 ] 17279.332920 : : read foo 10 out of bar ffff880013a5bef8
The above example was done by adding a module that actually had a foo and bar construct .
trace_printk ( ) output will appear in any tracer , even the function and function graph tracers .
[ tracing ] # echo function_graph > current_tracer [ tracing ] # insmod ~/ modules / foo.ko [ tracing ] # cat trace # tracer : function_graph # # CPU DURATION FUNCTION CALLS # | | | | | | | 3 ) + 16.283 us | } 3 ) + 17.364 us | } 3 ) | do_one_initcall ( ) {
3 ) | /* read foo 10 out of bar ffff88001191bef8 */ 3 ) 4.221 us | } 3 ) | __wake_up ( ) { 3 ) 0.633 us | _spin_lock_irqsave ( ) ; 3 ) 0.538 us | __wake_up_common ( ) ; 3 ) 0.563 us | _spin_unlock_irqrestore ( ) ;
Yes , the trace_printk ( ) output looks like a comment in the function graph tracer .
Starting and stopping the trace
Obviously there are times where you only want to trace a particular code path .
Perhaps you only want to trace what is happening when you run a specific test .
The file tracing_on is used to disable the ring buffer from recording data :
[ tracing ] # echo 0 > tracing_on
This will disable the Ftrace ring buffer from recording .
Everything else still happens with the tracers and they will still incur most of their overhead .
They do notice that the ring buffer is not recording and will not attempt to write any data , but the calls that the tracers make are still performed .
To re-enable the ring buffer , simply write a ' 1 ' into that file :
[ tracing ] # echo 1 > tracing_on
Note , it is very important that you have a space between the number and the greater than sign " > " .
Otherwise you may be writing standard input or output into that file .
[ tracing ] # echo 0 > tracing_on /* this will not work ! */
A common run might be :
[ tracing ] # echo 0 > tracing_on [ tracing ] # echo function_graph > current_tracer [ tracing ] # echo 1 > tracing_on ; run_test ; echo 0 > tracing_on
The first line disables the ring buffer from recording any data .
The next enables the function graph tracer .
The overhead of the function graph tracer is still present but nothing will be recorded into the trace buffer .
The last line enables the ring buffer , runs the test program , then disables the ring buffer .
This narrows the data stored by the function graph tracer to include mostly just the data accumulated by the run_test program .
What 's next ?
Another of the media ’s enforcers of Acceptable Opinion was unleashed the other day , this one at the Huffington Post .
There Sam Stein exposed the terrible extremists — including Tom Woods , Charles Goyette , and Thomas Naylor , the three I focus on here — who have been featured on the Glenn Beck television program .
I ” m not a big fan of Beck myself , but the people HuffPo chooses to single out for its Two Minutes Hate tell us all we need to know about approved ( and disapproved ) opinion in America .
First , Stein introduces us to Thomas Naylor , a man of the Left who learns that even leftists are dangerous “ extremists ”  so long as they support political decentralization .
Naylor , a 72 - year - old professor emeritus of economics at Duke University , runs the Second Vermont Republic , which takes the position that the United States has grown so large as to be politically and socially dysfunctional .
Politics needs to be returned to a human scale , he argues , and in his mind that includes an independent Vermont .
To a normal person , that ’s a debatable , if infrequently considered , question .
To an automaton who enforces Acceptable Opinion , it ’s grounds for burning the heretic .
Now how about actually letting Naylor speak for himself ?
He recently wrote :
We have slept through the annihilation of Afghanistan , Iraq , and Palestine , a war with Islam , the rendition of terrorist suspects , prisoner abuse and torture , the suppression of civil liberties , citizen surveillance , corporate greed , pandering to the rich and powerful , global warming , full spectrum dominance , imperial overstretch , and a culture of deceit .
Massive military spending , multi-trillion dollar deficits and Wall Street bailouts , mounting trade deficits , and a precipitous decline in the value of the dollar have gone virtually unnoticed .
During our long period of slumber the United States government has lost its moral authority .
It is owned , operated , and controlled by Wall Street and Corporate America .
The United States has become ungovernable , unfixable , and , therefore , unsustainable economically , politically , militarily , and environmentally .
It has evolved into the wealthiest , most powerful , most materialistic , most racist , most militaristic , most violent empire of all times .
Sammy , just so we can all be sure we ” re saying precisely the things you and the other Enforcers would like us to say , can you explain to us exactly why this opinion is to be forbidden ?
We will never receive an answer to that question .
It is not the job of the Enforcer to answer questions .
It is only his job to enforce .
And according to the bloggers who have picked up on Sammy ’s story , the exceedingly kind and gentlemanly Thomas Naylor , whom they do not know the first thing about , is hateful for refusing to believe we live in the best of all political worlds .
Not Sam Stein , though .
Stein , who smears a 72 - year - old retired college professor who never uttered a hateful word in his life , is full of nothing but love , baby .
Then it ’s on to Tom Woods , who is normally attacked in this kind of context on the grounds that he once went to an event at which some guy in the bathroom was on the phone with his cousin who said something offensive .
It ’s crazy and “ radical ”  for Woods to claim there really wasn ” t a “  Civil War , ”  says Stein , and to argue that more inflammatory names for that war are , strictly speaking , more historically accurate .
Naturally , Stein makes no attempt to explain what Woods means .
Enforcers don” t explain .
They enforce .
Woods ”  simple point is that if a Civil War involves two or more parties engaged in a contest over control of the same government , then the American Civil War was no such thing .
Even Sam should be able to understand that .

</iframe ></p>
The other , related problem with Woods — and yes , his entire career is indeed summed up in a couple of unexplained , out - of - context sentences — is that the conclusions he draws about that war are not of the customary angels - and - devils variety .
There is , I trust I need not remind the reader , but one acceptable interpretation of American history , in which the learned experts at the Huffington Post will instruct us until the end of time .
The Internet is the great equalizer , though , and any fair - minded person can find out about Tom Woods for himself .
This bio doesn ” t really sound like the person being described at HuffPo , does it ?
Lots of “ extremists ”  ( whatever that means ) getting reviews like these ?
How about the antiwar anthology Woods wrote with left - liberal Murray Polner , the $ 50,000 book prize he won , the books he ’s published with Columbia University Press , Basic Books , and Random House , his two New York Times bestsellers , the 11 - volume encyclopedia of American history he co-edited , the dozen foreign - language translations of his books , the dozens of mainstream outlets in which he ’s been published , or his degrees from Harvard and Columbia , including the Ph.D. ?
How about Woods ’s treatment of Lysander Spooner ’s antislavery interpretation of the Constitution ?
How does that square with Stein ’s absurd version of things ?
Or how about this essay ?
Then there ’s the slight problem with Stein ’s smear of Woods — who , it is insinuated but not directly stated , is probably racially insensitive — that most white supremacists don” t have black godchildren .
But the Enforcer doesn ” t like complicating factors .
Woods bad .

My favorite attack is the one on radio host and author Charles Goyette , who is taken to task and condemned as a “ 9/11 truther ”  simply for observing that the government ’s official 9/11 story is “ worse than Swiss cheese . ” 
Oooh !
Off to the Memory Hole with him !
Um , Sam , no one ( and I include here the majority of the American people who , like me , do not describe themselves as “ truthers ”  ) thinks the government has told us the whole 9/11 story .
But good for you — how refreshing to encounter a progressive with such confidence in George W. Bush and our elected leaders !
Why , they ” d never withhold information from the people .
I mean , Dick Cheney , withhold information ?
So those four words are why we should never , ever listen to a word that radio veteran Goyette says .
Here , on the other hand , is what a normal person would have noticed and reported about Charles Goyette : five years ago he was dumped from the Clear Channel radio network for his opposition to the war in Iraq .
They expected their right - of - center hosts to toe the so - called right - wing line .
He refused , and lost his job .
That ’s kind of interesting , is n ” t it ?
To a normal person , yes .
But we ” re talking about Sam Stein the Automaton here .
What you find interesting , he just finds distracting .
To him , one phrase Goyette uttered on one program — surely you haven ” t already forgotten those awful , unforgivable four words !— over the course of years in radio is pretty much all you need to know .
Disclosing Goyette ’s antiwar stand that cost him his job would only confuse Sammy ’s delicate readers at the Huffington Post , who need their character assassination in the simplest comic - book style — Goyette bad .
Here ’s Stein ’s problem , and motivation .
The decentralist ideas , including state nullification of federal laws , that these people promote are on the march .
There is no doubt about that .
State nullification of federal laws , in the Jeffersonian tradition , is being openly discussed — and carried out — once again .
Right now it is the job of the Sam Steins of the world , who do not want us entertaining such unauthorized thoughts , to start throwing things .
His stupid and libelous article is an example .
But mark my words : within five years nullification will be a regular feature of American life .
We ” ve already seen dozens of states nullifying federal legislation pertaining to various aspects of civil liberties .
That ’s only going to grow , what with increasing frustration among Americans regarding the one - party regime that rules them : no matter who gets elected , it ’s the same bailouts , the same police state , the same spending , and the same wars .
Add to that the growing realization that nothing else has worked , and you will start to see Americans looking to other methods .
This is absolutely forbidden , from Sam Stein ’s point of view .
Sam Stein wants us to carry on with all the ineffectual things we ” ve tried for decades now .
That ’s the way he likes it .
Anyone proposing anything different can expect the Enforcer routine :
He ’s an extremist !
Avert your eyes , citizens !
Sam , it is n ” t going to work .
No one cares about your opinion .
If HuffPo dismisses someone as an extremist , normal Americans consider it a badge of honor .
Note that no neoconservatives are attacked in the Stein piece .
So it ’s all right , or at least within the range of acceptable opinion , to favor ( as many neocons do , some quite vocally ) preemptive war , the deliberate targeting of civilian areas , lying to the population to win their support for war , and the killing of at least hundreds of thousands of innocents while displacing millions more .
That ’s all right .
On the other hand , people who oppose all these things on moral grounds , but who believe that a system in which the perpetrators of these atrocities enjoy monopolistic control of all political decisions for 300 million people might not be the most humane form of social organization — now these people need to be smeared .
Surprise us , Sammy , and write us a column someday whose every thought we couldn ” t predict in advance .
I bet you can ” t , and I ” m sure you won ” t .
What would an Enforcer of Acceptable Opinion be without exquisitely conventional opinions ?
As usual , peel a so - called progressive and what do you find ?
Another dime - a - dozen automaton shilling for the regime .
James
Altucher , one of our favorite market mavens , has just published his list of predictions for 2010 .
The most striking : AOL gets picked up by Microsoft .
From the Wall Street Journal :
AOL is a private - equity dream come true at current levels .
Over the next four years it is going to generate more cash than market cap and then the rest is gravy if it can figure out how to wind down or sell the business without losing too much money or , heaven forbid , transform the business so it becomes exciting again .
But , before that happens , why would n’t Microsoft buy it ?
Check out this chart comparing aol.com + yahoo.com + msn.com .
Rather than buy Yahoo for $ 22 billion it can buy AOL for one - tenth of that and now compete face - to - face against Yahoo .
It ’s a no- brainer and I expect it to happen in 2010 once the dust settles around its spinoff / IPO from Time Warner ( TWX ) .
Eddie Elfenbein has summarized the nine other predictions for next year .
1. ) The S&P 500 will touch 1300 at some point during the year .
2. ) Unemployment goes down to 8 % .
3. ) GDP hits an annualized 6 % by Q2 as inventories get restocked .
4. ) Dendreon ( DNDN ) is acquired .
5. ) B will the best letter in the BRIC countries : Brazil , Russia , India , China .
6. ) Health care will greatly outperform the S&P in 2010 .
7. ) Banks start lending money again .
8. ) Either Apple or Amazon will develop the killer tablet computing product ( or be close to it for 2011 ) .
9. ) The world will not end .
New FDA Records Obtained by Judicial Watch Indicate 28 Deaths Related to Gardasil in 2008
Judicial Watch , the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption , announced today that it has obtained records from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) documenting 28 deaths in 2008 associated with Gardasil , the vaccination for human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , up from 19 deaths in 2007 .
The total number of Gardasil - related deaths is 47 since the vaccine was approved in 2006 .
Overall , the FDA documented 6,723 " adverse events " related to Gardasil in 2008 , of which 1,061 were considered " serious , " and 142 considered " life threatening . "
The following are several " adverse events " documented by the FDA ’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) :
" 15 months from the completion of the GARDASIL HPV vaccination , I had full blown cervical cancer .
My oncologist would like to do a hysterectomy at this time , but [ as I have ] always wanted children , I have chosen to wait . . .
I have two of the [ strains ] that the shot is suppose to prevent . . .
I now have cervical cancer and I am left wondering what role the GARDASIL HPV vaccination played in the hasty onset . "
( ID : 319836 )
" After receiving her second dose of GARDASIL … she could crawl but … needed to use crutches or a wheel chair …
She was experienced problems breathing and had ‘ super migraines ’ that never went away …
She had swelling in her face , jaw and wrists .
The patient was diagnosed with GUILLAIN - BARRE syndrome , myelin sheath degeneration and peripheral neuropathy .
Patient was hospitalized twice … patient has not recovered from symptoms . "
( ID : 318052 )
A 19 - year - old girl with no medical history immediately experienced side effects after receiving the Gardasil vaccine .
Within eleven days her symptoms included " Aggression , Arthralgia , Complex partial seizures , Confusional state , Convulsion , Crying , Dizziness , Epilepsy , Fatigue , Feeling abnormal , Grand mal convulsion , Immediate post - injection reaction , Irritability , Myalgia , Nausea , Pain , Postictal state , Somnolence , Syncope , Tremor , and Unresponsive to stimuli . "
( ID : 320598 )
" Two weeks after the third dose , the patient developed a complication .
She was taken to the hospital by ambulance but passed away during the transport from an unknown cause …
Upon arrival in ER unresponsive , pupils fixed and dilated , no cardiac activity .
Resuscitation unsuccessful and patient expired . "
( ID : 314769 )
The FDA VAERS reports show that since last June , 235 cases detailed permanent disability .
There were also 29 new cases of Guillain - Barre Syndrome , and 147 cases of " spontaneous abortions , " or miscarriages , when the vaccine was given to pregnant women .
Moreover , 62 girls developed warts after receiving the vaccine .
This development is of particular concern because Gardasil , which is designed to prevent two strains of genital warts , is not supposed to react with other HPV strains .
However , not only did previously healthy women experience genital warts after the vaccination , but 21 girls developed warts on other areas , most commonly the face , hands and feet , and in one case , " all over her body . "
( ID : 330671 )
Of the 47 reported deaths , 41 occurred within a month of receiving the vaccine and of those 17 were within two weeks or receiving the vaccine .
In most of the deaths the cause is still unknown .
" The FDA is supposed to be a guardian of public health , and yet the agency continues to turn a blind eye to what seems to be an extremely serious public health problem .
The public relations push for Gardasil by Merck , politicians and public health officials needs to pause so that these adverse reactions can be further studied , " said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton .
" The already serious problems associated with Gardasil seem to be getting worse .
No one should require this vaccine for young children . "
FT : Japan ’s Unique Mobile Apps Tuesday , December 22 , 2009
There must be few places in the world where mobile phone usage has become so integral a part of everyday life as in Japan .
Japanese use mobile phones for so much more than speaking and emailing – which replaces SMS in Japan – and it sets them apart from other markets across the globe .
For example , about 45 % of mobile phone usage in Japan is for data , which compares with about 20 % in the US , according to Nathan Ramler , an analyst at Macquarie Securities .
On top of this , Mr Ramler points out that only 2 % of that data usage is for e-mail , while the time used for speaking on the phone is just 140 minutes per month for DoCoMo , Japan ’s largest telecommunications company with about 50 % market share .
That is about four and a half minutes of talking time a day .
Internet access makes up a big part of the usage .
More people use their mobile phones to access the internet than their personal computers .
The younger generation in particular use mobile phones as their primary access , Mr Ramler says .
The importance Japanese people place on data usage is all too evident on the Tokyo trains , where it seems that most commuters in their 40s and younger sit or stand engrossed in their mobile phone , whether playing games , watching television , listening to music , reading keitai ( mobile ) novels and comics , or e-mailing .
But what is perhaps more interesting than the common mobile technology such as cameras , videos , TV , radio , music and GPS , are the numerous obscure functions that the Japanese have developed for their handheld devices .
Fe -ku chakushin : the fake incoming call .
This is the perfect bad - date escape .
By surreptitiously pressing a couple of buttons on your phone under the table at dinner , the function causes the phone to ring a few seconds later , enabling the owner to pick up , pretend to speak with someone , exclaim horror at the “ situation ” , excuse him or herself from the date and head for the exit .
Secret History : A recent survey by Macromill , an online researcher , showed that 61 % of respondents – in this case Japanese mothers with young children – secretly check the contents of their husband ’s mobile phone .
Of that figure , 35 % are checking to see if their husbands are having an affair , while 28 % are checking to see if their other half is hiding something from them .
For those husbands ( or wives ) who do have something , or someone , to hide , some handsets offer a function that can prevent certain phone numbers or emails being recorded in the incoming and outgoing call / mail history .
Eco-oto : Eco sound .
Many women in Japan are self - conscious about using public toilets or lavatories in restaurants and bars , with fear of being heard by next door ’s occupant .
It has led to many flushing the toilet throughout their time in the lavatory .
But digital contents developer Polygon Magic has come up with an application to stop the water waste and end the embarrassment .
It recreates the flushing noise , which can be set at either 30 , 60 , 90 or 120 seconds and with adjustable sound levels .
Golf Lessons : Japanese “ salarymen ” are infamous for their love of golf and it is common to see them practising their swings as they wait for the train .
Fujitsu ’s new handset for NTT DoCoMo has a function that uses 3D motion - sensor technology to monitor golf - swing movements .
It uses the data collected to provide a diagnosis of the owner ’s swing and offers advice for improvement .
The list of such functions grows daily .
Companies such as NTT DoCoMo for example , are currently working on services that target the older population – an area of business that is set to grow with the country ’s greying population .
Even Japanese who do not think they use their mobile phones much still seem to use them for a wide range of purposes .
As well as email and conversation , Shiyo Takahashi , the manager of a high - end store in Tokyo , uses his phone for betting on currency markets , checking rates , the weather , banking , train and concert ticket purchases and sometimes GPS .
Among the younger generation , mobile novels and manga ( comics ) have become extremely popular .
Some novels have even been written on a mobile phone .
A brief read of a keitai comic on a mobile phone highlights an added dimension : at a dramatic point in the story as you electronically turn the page , the phone vibrates .
Shopping is also a popular activity .
For example , Macromill ’s survey of mothers showed that of the respondents who used their mobile phone for shopping , 65 % did so at least once a month , with nearly 30 % doing so at least once a week .
“ The way Japanese consumers use their phones is unique , ” says Macquarie ’s Mr Ramler .
“ Other markets may catch up with certain aspects of web browsing and mobile content consumption , but some mobile phone use will always reflect local cultures .
“ While security features and convenient services have universal appeal , how each market or country specifically addresses them is likely to reflect the local culture and local patterns of consumption . ”

Understanding licenses , bit by bit
An idea that is suggested every now and then is to look at software licensing and give it a kind of “ Creative Commons ” feel ; that is , present the terms of the license in a pleasant and orderly way by means of icons .
Now , we ’ve already come to the realization that calling something “ Creative Commons licensed ” is vague to the point of being useless ( just “ some rights reserved “ ) .
Calling something “ Free Software ” is also vague , but there is a rock - solid guarantee at the bottom : the term guarantees you , the recipient of the software , at least the Four Freedoms .
Any Open Source software you receive usually means at least the Four Freedoms as well .
So you need to say which CC , which Free Software license , which Open Source license .
CC has six licenses ; they are split neatly and orthogonally along the commercial / non-commercial and yes / share - alike / no axes .
The thing is , CC is a much simpler system because it applies to work where there are no patent concerns , where embedded systems do n’t have a place , where share - alike has a simpler meaning .
I have trouble bringing this same simplicity to software licensing , but I thought I would give it a try .
First off , every Free Software license gives you the right to run ( presumably also to compile and then run ) , study , and modify the work ; it must be possible to ( re ) distribute the ( modified ) work .
So those are the basic permissions .
We could put them under a basic “ Free Software ” symbol , like I ’ve done here .
Now we get to modifiers of the basic license .
What is allowed by one Free Software license , and not allowed by another ?
Where do the licenses differ on essential points ?
Going through such an exercise opens up the debate on what constitutes an essential point of difference between licenses .
Still , I think we can agree that many licenses ask you to deliver the complete corresponding source along with a binary .
Details ( written offers , etc. ) differ greatly though .
In the interest of simplicity , though , we ’ll just lump it all together as “ publish the source ” .
The BSD License allows binary distribution without publishing the source , so it does n’t get this symbol .
Now to distinguish strong copyleft from weak copyleft — that ’s really important when you want to know what the effect is on your own code and own license choices if you are going to incorporate another piece of Free Software into yours .
I suppose , actually , that we do n’t need to distinguish this dimension from the previous “ publish the source ” dimension : I think every “ publish the source ” license is also one of the two kinds of copyleft ( although I can imagine a license that says you must re-publish the original source , but not necessarily your modifications ) .
So how about Tivoization ?
Or in other words , embedding into a device and then selling , renting or lending the device instead of delivering the software sec ?
It ’s a real difference between GPLv2 and GPLv3 .
It ’s explicitly mentioned in some faux Free Software licenses that allow use except when embedded .
I call them faux ( fake ) because Freedom 0 is the Freedom to use , for any purpose , and clauses 5 and 6 of the Open Source Definition do much the same .
So let ’s add that dimension into the mix .
I ’ll throw in patent grants as another factor .
This is an over - broad blanket , because the subtleties of patent licensing are devilish .
The Apache License , version 2 for instance contains a patent grant with a termination clause .
So does the CDDL .
So , let ’s take a look ( squinting through this rather imperfect telescope ) at the big picture .
We ’ll take the top 10 licenses ( according to Black Duck Software ) and for each , label it with icons like these and comment on what ’s been missed out by the icon scheme .
Note that these are not necessarily all Free Software licenses , and not all of them are widely used across the Free Software ecosystem .
GPLv2
“ The original and best ” Most widely used license , apparently applied to nearly 50 % of all Free Software projects .
I imagine that 50 % also comes from things like “ v2 or ( at your option ) any later version ” licensing .

Artistic is applied to a huge number of Perl modules , which are counted individually , which is why Artistic shows up as a significant license force , even if it is almost unused outside of the Perl community .

The CPOL is a strange license .
It is not OSI approved , as near as I can tell .
It seems to disallow the distribution of modified works , certain uses are disallowed by the license ( immoral ones ) , there ’s a no - sale clause , indemnity , and some other bits that make this license difficult for me to place anywhere in the world of Free Software .

It looks roughly — very roughly — like BSD plus a patent clause .

Comments on my artistic icon skills should be addressed to Nuno Pinheiro .
You may be able to hire him to do very nice icons for this set - up , and Björn Balazs can do usability testing on them .
Kolourpaint FTW .
Now , as for the accuracy of this table , I ’ll say it ’s a best - effort one - morning overview , so there may be plenty of errors in there .
The point is the principle of reducing the licenses to a sequence of icons .
The icon for patent is a patent troll ( notice the glowing red eyes ) because I could n’t think of anything better .
So , errors and omissions aside — I welcome corrections in the comments on this blog — we need to ask the question : does this scheme of badges highlight any ( all ? ) of the essential differences between the different licenses ?
If not , what additional discriminatory characteristic should we add to distinguish them ?
Based on this list , we see that BSD 2 - clause and MIT are “ the same ” .
Are they really ?
Well , it depends on how you interpret the second clause of the BSD 2 - clause license and whether the single MIT clause implies it .
In a world of good faith , you could satisfy the MIT license by doing what the BSD 2 - clause license asks you to do .
So I think I could be satisfied that this is a same - difference identification of two licenses .
But we could look at some others — is Apache equivalent to Mozilla in all meaningful ways ?
How about LGPLv2.1 and Artistic ?
That , however , will have to wait for another day .
Where I set out to demonstrate that you ca n’t reduce licenses to blurbs and icons , I have n’t done so yet — and still , such a reduction might be useful from a license selection standpoint , because you can pick and choose based on broad categories of license behavior .

Iraqi troops , backed by US advisers , captured a senior leader in a Mahdi Army offshoot group with links to Iran during a raid in Baghdad .
The senior leader of the Promise Day Brigade was detained in northern Baghdad , with the help of intelligence gathered from both US and Iraq security forces .
The Promise Day Brigade commander , who was not identified , was “ believed to be facilitating the distribution of weapons and funding to PDB [ Promise Day Brigade ] attack groups throughout Baghdad , ” the US military said in a press release .
“ Attack groups then use the weapons and funding to conduct deadly acts of violence against civilians and security forces in Iraq . ”
The US military said the commander “ is allegedly tied to PDB [ Promise Day Brigade ] leaders operating from safe havens in Iran . ”
The Promise Day Brigade was formed by anti-American Shia leader Muqtada al Sadr during the summer of 2008 after he announced he would disband the Mahdi Army and formed a small , secretive military arm to fight Coalition forces in June .
The group has not been linked to any major attacks since its formation last summer .
The Iraqi military has stepped up operations against the Promise Day Brigade and the Mahdi Army since the beginning of November , when two members of the PDB were captured in Baghdad on Nov. 6 .
Starting with that capture , 18 members of the Promise Day Brigade and the Mahdi Army , including two commanders , have been arrested in Baghdad and Amarah [ see list below ] .
The biggest catch took place on Nov. 29 , when Iraqi forces captured the leader of the Promise Day Brigade in Amarah .
That same day , Iraqi officials announced they were seeking to capture a senior member of the Qods Force , the special operations branch of Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps .
Iran has backed a host of Shia terror groups in Iraq , including the Mahdi Army and the Promise Day Brigade , the Asaib al Haq , and the Hezbollah Brigades [ see LWJ report , “ Iraqi forces search for Qods Force agents ” and “ Ramazan Corps and the ratlines into Iraq ” for more details on Iran ’s involvement in Iraq ] .

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) -- Senate Democrats have reached a " broad agreement " on health - care legislation , news reports said late Tuesday .
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said his party had reached a compromise that will unite liberals and centrists , a report from Dow Jones Newswires said .
Reid , however , offered no details on the deal , but did say reports that senators dropped the public option were " not true , " according to Reuters .
The Senate 's leader said he planned to submit the new legislation to the Congressional Budget Office for cost forecasts , Dow Jones said .
The compromise is the result of talks with 10 senators whom Reid called upon to forge a deal , including the group 's leaders Sens.
Charles Schumer , D- NY , and Mark Pryor , D - Ark .
Nebraska 's Republican governor has a stern message for Ben Nelson ( above ) , the senior Democratic senator from his state :

| REUTERS Neb. gov. to Nelson : Keep the money
Nebraska ’s Republican governor has a stern message for Ben Nelson , the senior Democratic senator from his state :
We do n’t want Washington to cover all the costs of the proposed expansion of Medicaid under health care legislation .
“ The last few days have made Nebraskans so angry that now it ’s a matter of principle , ” Gov. David Heineman told POLITICO .
“ The federal government can keep that money . ”

Told about the governor ’s comments , Nelson said : “ If he wants to subject Nebraska to future liability — it ’s his call . ”
And he called it “ foolish , ” because the money would n’t be available until several years down the road , when other states would almost certainly lobby to get increased federal aid .
Nelson is engaged in a tense war of words with his home - state governor over his health care vote and the Medicaid deal he helped secure for their state , a signal that Nelson ’s political opponents plan to bloody him up for his health - care stand — and that could impact his standing ahead of his 2012 reelection campaign .
“ The reason he ’s in hot water right now is that he ’s not listening to Nebraskans — it ’s very unusual for him , ” Heineman said .
“ I am shocked . ”
Asked about the governor ’s direct aim at him , Nelson said it ’s just “ partisan politics . ”
The back - and - forth exchanges are somewhat unusual , Nebraska political analysts say , because the state ’s governor and senators have historically stayed out of each others ’ affairs .
“ I think that ’s what ’s been the courtesy , ” said Nelson , who was governor of Nebraska from 1991 - 98 .
“ But if he chooses not to recognize that courtesy and continue it there ’s not much I can do about it . ”
Some see that this battle could presage a potential Nelson - Heineman 2012 matchup for the Senate seat , but Heineman said being governor is “ the one job I love doing ” and that he has expressed no interest in the seat , though he would n’t rule it out .
Heineman said while he usually he tries to avoid getting involved in Senate affairs , “ health care is different , ” given the costs to his state and fears that it would raise taxes and negatively impact people ’s insurance premiums .
Since he announced he would vote for the health care bill last Saturday , Nelson has been the subject of intensifying criticism from the right for appearing to reverse his position and support the measure after securing deals to exempt Nebraska from new Medicaid payments , ease an excise tax on home - state insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield , and for brokering a middle - ground deal over whether federal dollars can be spent on abortion services .
Nelson has denied a quid - pro-quo over the deals , saying his position has been consistent and that he voted for the bill to deliver relief from rising health care costs to Nebraskans .
But that has n’t stopped fierce attacks in his Republican - leaning state , with scathing editorials and sharp attacks from Republicans dubbing the Medicaid deal the “ Cornhusker Kickback . ”
The Omaha World Herald , the state ’s largest newspaper , carried an editorial cartoon Sunday of a man waiting in line to return an item he ’d purchased — the item was Nelson .
“ I think he probably earned himself the title ‘ the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in 2012 , ’ ” said Jennifer Duffy , a Senate expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report .
“ Think of the ads you can run with Ben Nelson before - and - after quotes . ”
Despite being a Democrat in a solidly GOP state , Nelson has found long - running success at the ballot box after first being elected governor with a bare 50 percent of the vote .
He lost once , when — as a sitting governor — he ran for the Senate in 1996 but lost to Republican Chuck Hagel , a senator with whom he had a frosty relationship .
Nelson , 68 , is considered one of the most cautious legislators in the Senate and has long been one of the biggest swing votes in the upper chamber .
His frequent defections on votes have even prompted unsuccessful attempts by Republicans to convince him to switch parties .
But now the GOP senses a fresh opportunity to knock off Nelson .
For Heineman to run , he would have to begin a Senate campaign after the 2010 elections , in which he ’s seeking a second full term as governor .
If Heineman declines , there ’s a deep bench of state officials and three GOP congressmen who might be eager to take Nelson on next cycle .
“ I think he ’s going to definitely take a hit as a result of this , the question is for how long , ” John Hibbing , a political science professor at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln , said of Nelson and his health care position .
Nelson dismisses the chatter , saying that if he listened to analysts or the polls he would never have even run for governor initially .
“ I just do n’t make decisions on the basis of that , ” Nelson said .
“ I ’ll stand on my record . ”
Asked if he would run in 2012 , Nelson said : “ I have n’t made a decision on that — but I certainly have n’t made a decision not to . ”
He has wavered before , including in 2006 , when he was unsure whether to run for a second term .
He ultimately skated to reelection .
But he could face a bigger hurdle back home in the wake of his role in the health care debate — after raising a litany of concerns initially but ultimately voicing support for the measure .
In particular , Heineman and his Nebraska GOP colleagues , such as Sen . Mike Johanns , have taken direct aim at language Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) inserted into the bill that would require the federal government to pick up the tab for any new Nebraska beneficiaries under the proposed expansion of the Medicaid law .
Even though all states have their costs paid by the federal government through 2016 , Nebraska is the only state where the federal government would permanently pick up the tab — a carve - out that the Congressional Budget Office said would cost federal taxpayers $ 100 million .
“ We do n’t like that , ” Johanns , also a former governor , said in an interview .
“ We just think that ’s so un-Nebraskan .
You know , we live out there on the prairie .
It ’s hot in the summer .
It ’s cold in the winter , and we ’re kind of less - government sort of people .
We do n’t want a special deal . ”
Heineman added that he ’s “ never seen the emotional intensity on an issue that I ’m seeing right now .
This violated our sense of ethics . ”
Nelson insists that he was n’t seeking a special deal for his state on the Medicaid provisions , saying that he was merely pushing for an option for states either to join the expanded Medicaid program with the federal government incurring all the costs or to have the option to bow out altogether .
And he said that given that states wo n’t have to pay until 2017 , Congress will have a chance to revisit the language and expand federal funding in order to eliminate an “ unfunded mandate . ”
“ This was not like getting a pot of money for the state of Nebraska for Medicaid , ” Nelson said .
Nelson , who strongly opposes abortion , also said he would oppose any bill that would allow federal dollars to pay for abortion services .
But he struck a deal that would attempt to segregate federal dollars from private dollars spent on abortion and allow states to implement even tighter restrictions , and that infuriated anti-abortion activists who have supported him in the past .
“ I ca n’t imagine me doing something like that on a big issue , without knowing that by the time I ’m doing a news conference to announce the bill they ’re all standing behind me , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) .
“ I think there ’s a backlash there and it will hurt him in terms of trust with pro-life people back home . ”
Nelson defended his record opposing abortion , pointing to an unsuccessful amendment he authored that would have imposed even tighter abortion restrictions .
“ Some people chose different language than what I ’ve prepared , [ but ] it does n’t make me any less pro-life , ” Nelson said .
“ They ’d have to live with their own conscience if they ’re attacking me on this . ”
And Nelson said the ferocity of the opposition has not intensified since Saturday , saying that calls to his office from Nebraskans are “ probably fewer right now ” than before .

A Taiwanese man has been named the first ever person to successfully " complete " World of Warcraft , collecting the game 's staggering 986 Achievements to effectively do everything there is to do in the hugely successful MMO .
This is literally the most amazing news of the day .
' Little Gray " beat the game after killing 390,895 creatures , administering 7,255,538,878 points of damage , completing 5,906 quests ( averaging 14 quests a day ) , raiding 405 dungeons and hugging 11 players .
I believe we can safely add another statistic to the numbers -- he has had sex 0 times during this period .
Some nitpicky WoW f*ckheads are trying to downplay Little Gray 's accomplishment , claiming he received one event - tied achievement ( B.B King ) due to a glitch , and did not win it fairly .
You know what , though ?
Who the Hell cares ?
He 's done more than any human being ever reasonably should , so let 's not quibble over one little point .
He 's a WoW player .
He will probably achieve nothing else in life .
Let the man have this .
New report paints the human race ’s picture as grim and unstable if more action is n’t taken against climate change to protect the “ building blocks ” of large populations .
In the run-up to historic climate talks in Copenhagen , a new report by the Worldwatch Institute and United Nations Foundation ( U.N.F ) warns that mankind ’s impact on the environment threatens not just the health of other species , but of the human race as well .
The report , Global Environmental Change : The Threat to Human Health , notes that rapid changes in climate and land are shifting the distribution of diseases like malaria , making more people sick in many cases .
These shifts pose the biggest threat to poor populations in developing countries , according to the report .
Most of the damage can be prevented , though , via national - level risk assessments and technical and financial assistance that help countries adapt to the health impacts of accelerating environmental change .
The report was authored by Samuel S. Myers , MD , an instructor at Harvard Medical School and a research associate at the Harvard University Center for the Environment .
“ It is increasingly apparent that the breadth and depth of the changes we are wreaking on the environment are imperiling not only many of the other species with which we share the ecological stage , but the health and well being of our own species as well , ” Myers wrote .
Many of the threats to human health will come through our effects on the planet ’s water supply , according to the report .
Inadequate access to drinking water , sanitation and hygiene already causing an estimated 1.7 million deaths a year .
But the future will bring growing constraints on accessing freshwater because of changing climate , declining water quality and rising resource demand due to population growth and economic development .
As a result poorer populations will be more vulnerable to the health consequences of water scarcity than ever before .
The picture only gets bleaker .
As large , vulnerable populations are exposed to more hunger , water scarcity and natural disasters , the world ’s refugee problem will worsen .
Last year , an estimated 42 million people worldwide were considered refugees or displaced persons , the report notes , and the U.N. estimates that climate change alone will displace an additional 250 million to 1 billion people by 2050 .
The report calls for a range of efforts to counter the threat , including wealthy countries assisting lower - income countries adapt to the coming environmental changes .
Solutions should provide general benefits such as improving public health infrastructure , developing more tolerant crop strains , increasing freshwater storage capacity , creating early - warning systems , and providing better disease surveillance .

Pediatric researchers have identified a novel gene involved in childhood asthma , in one of the largest gene studies to date of the common respiratory disease .
Because the gene , called DENND1B , affects cells and signaling molecules thought to be instrumental in the immune system overreaction that occurs in asthma , the discovery may have singled out an important target for new treatments .
A research team led by Hakon Hakonarson , M.D. , Ph.D. , director of the Center for Applied Genomics at The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , implicated a location on chromosome 1 associated with moderate - to - severe , childhood - onset asthma .
The study appeared December 23 on the Online First website of the New England Journal of Medicine .
It will be published in the journal 's print issue on January 7 , 2010 .
Asthma is a complex disease , in which a large number of genes , as yet mostly undiscovered , are thought to interact with each other and with environmental factors to produce asthma's characteristic wheezing , coughing and shortness of breath .
It also is highly heterogeneous , manifesting differently in different patients , and appears to operate differently in childhood - onset asthma compared to adult - onset asthma .
Previously , researchers had identified only one other asthma- susceptibility gene using a genome - wide association study ( GWAS ) , in which automated genotyping tools scan the entire human genome seeking gene variants that contribute to disease risk .
That gene , ORMDL3 , on chromosome 17 , was discovered in 2007 by U.K. researcher William O.C. Cookson , M.D. , who collaborated with Hakonarson in the current study .
In this current study , Hakonarson 's team performed GWAS on a sample of 793 white North American children with persistent asthma , compared to control group of 1,988 children .
They replicated the study in a separate group of 2,400 European subjects and controls , then did further analyses on a third group of 3,700 African American children .
" By analyzing a large cohort of children with moderate to severe asthma , all of whom require controller medications on a regular basis , we managed to enrich our study for genetic signals and achieve sufficient statistical power to uncover and replicate a novel asthma gene , " said Hakonarson .
In addition to observing the previous results for chromosome 17 , his group found a novel location on chromosome 1q31 , with eight single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) associating robustly with asthma .
A SNP ( pronounced " snip " ) is a change to a single chemical base along the DNA helix .
Unlike other studies , here the researchers found the same gene for asthma susceptibility in children of both European and African - American ancestries .
Within this region on chromosome 1q31 the gene with an apparent role in asthma is DENND1B , already suspected as a player in the body 's immune response .
DENND1B expresses a protein of the same name , which is active in particular types of dendritic cells and specific T lymphocytes , including natural killer cells .
Both of these immune cell subtypes form cross-talks between them ( commonly referred to as the antigen presenting synapse ) and regulate how the body responds to foreign material such as viruses , bacteria and allergens .
" We now know that the DENND1B gene and its protein are involved in the release of cytokines , which are signaling molecules that in this case tell the body how it should respond to foreign particles , " said Hakonarson , who is a pulmonologist .
" Many of these particles are well - known triggers of asthma .
In asthma , patients have an inappropriate immune response in which they develop airway inflammation and overreaction of the airway muscle cells , referred to as airway hyperresponsiveness .
The gene mutations in DENND1B appear to lead to overproduction of cytokines that subsequently drive this oversensitive response in asthma patients . "
By identifying an asthma susceptibility gene with a compelling link to the pathobiology of asthma , says Hakonarson , his team may also have pinpointed a tempting therapeutic target , if researchers can develop drugs to contain this signaling pathway .
" Because this gene seems to regulate many different cytokines , intervening in this pathway has great potential for treating asthma , " he added .
" Other asthma - related genes remain to be discovered , but finding a way to target this common gene variant could benefit large numbers of children . "
Grants from The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , the Cotswold Foundation , the Lundbeck Foundation , and the National Human Genome Research Institute supported the research .
Hakonarson is on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine .
In addition to other faculty members from Children 's Hospital and Penn , Hakonarson 's major collaborators were Hans Bisgaard , M.D. , of Copenhagen University Hospital , Denmark ; Kathleen C. Barnes , Ph.D. , of Johns Hopkins University ; William O.C. Cookson , M.D. , of Imperial College , London ; and Michael Kabesch , M.D. , of Ludwig Maximilian University , Munich .
I am the librarian at an urban public elementary school ( grades K - 5 ) in New York .
We are a high needs school with a large population of English Language Learners ( 54 % of our students ) , and only 52 % of our students read at or above their grade levels .
To put things simply : my youngest students need science books .
Due to the very low ratio of books per student , children can only check out one book per library visit ( once every two weeks for the younger grades , and once every four weeks for the older grades ) .
It is difficult to hear children ask for books when you know that you cannot satisfy their requests .
I go through this ordeal almost daily , especially when it comes to science books .
I do n't have books about many of the topics my students study in class , and the books that I have are usually written at a level far beyond their comprehension .
To add to this problem , the science books we have are old and outdated .
The average publication year of a science book in the library is 1999 - 10 years old .
This means when I have a book that matches a student 's interest and reading level , there is a significant chance that the book will be older than the child who wants to read it .
Adults may be savvy enough not to judge books by their covers , but children are much more likely to turn away in disdain when faced with an old and dilapidated
To put things simply : my youngest students need science books .
They need these books to be both interesting and exciting .
They need books that both expand on what they learn in class and cover topics on which they are naturally curious - earth , space , plants , weather , electricity , and more .
Most of all , they need books on these subjects that they are able to read and understand !
This means that the books must be at a very low reading level , and specifically written for students in second grade and below .
The economic downturn has taken many things away from students , and new , relevant library books were among the many casualties in the school budget this year .
With your help , hundreds of students will have access science books that they can read , enjoy , and - most importantly - take in on their own .
Walter Bright is the man that liked C++ so much , he created the first native C++ compiler called Zortech C++.
He then decided the language had grown so much by layering on needed features that it made sense to look at it afresh and try to design a language that , he says , ‘ gets there in a straight line , rather than try to be compatible with obsolete decisions made 20 or 30 years ago .
He claims that the design of C++ is rooted in its ASCII past , making support of modern requirements like Unicode Transformation Format difficult .
He believed that C++ had reached a certain level of maturity ; its period of rapid evolution was over so the time was right to see what could be done with a redesign .
‘ In 1999 , I found myself at a crossroads , and decided that it was therefore the right time to stop grumbling , stop saying “ I ’d have done it this way ” , and put my money where my mouth was ’ .
“ I do n’t agree with the notion
that programmers must be
moulded to fit the software ,
and that the cure for bugs
is better education ”
Out of his development came D , a general purpose systems and applications programming language which he claims is a higher level language than C++ , yet retains the ability to write high performance code and interface directly with the operating system API ’s and with hardware .
Bright says that D is well suited to writing medium to large scale million line programs with teams of developers .
‘ It ’s easy to learn , provides many capabilities to aid the programmer , and is well suited to aggressive compiler optimization technology .
The D programming language has been carefully designed to improve programmer productivity based on decades of experience programming , working with programmers and development tools . ’
Walter graduated from Caltech in 1979 with a degree in mechanical engineering .
He worked for Boeing for 3 years on the development of the 757 stabilizer trim system , before switching to writing software , specialising in compilers .
He has been writing them ever since , for Pascal , C , C++ , Abel , Java , Javascript and D .
It was this experience , both as a user and implementer of languages that put him in a good position to design a successor to C and C ++.
ASCAP Now Demanding License From Venues That Let People Play Guitar Hero

We 've been detailing how the various collection societies around the globe have been trotting out all sorts of dubious reasoning to try to get more people to pay up for a license .
In the US , ASCAP has been particularly ridiculous , seeking public performance licenses for ( legally licensed ) ringtones as well as the 30 - second previews you find on music download stores like iTunes .
ASCAP has already succeeded in forcing YouTube to pay up as well .
Of course , the end result has actually been harming many up and coming songwriters and musicians , as more and more venues are choosing to forego music entirely , because it 's just not worth having to pay up the fees that ASCAP charges .
In the latest overreach , sent in by reader faceless , ASCAP is demanding a licensing fee from a venue that has the video game Guitar Hero for people to play .
While the venue does sometimes have live musicians , it has purposely chosen to only allow original music ( no covers ) from artists and songwriters not covered by ASCAP , to avoid having to pay the fee .
As the venue owner notes , it 's ridiculous to think that the venue should have to pay for a license just to let people play , saying , But , of course , that 's not how ASCAP views any of these things , insisting that the value itself comes from the music , and thus the songwriters must absolutely be paid .
Of course , this is n't the first time ASCAP has come down hard on music video games .
Earlier this year , it insisted that the video game companies themselves should pay performance licensing fees as well -- so in this case it looks like they 're trying to double or triple dip .
Of course , the most likely end result ?
The venue will drop the game , and fewer people will hear the music .
This harms everyone -- the songwriters , the musicians , ASCAP and the venue .
But ASCAP seems to think it 's the right move .
This is why more and more musicians are recognizing that what 's good for ASCAP is not good for songwriters

WASHINGTON  Debating an overhaul of the health care system , the Senate found itself tied in knots on Thursday over a bipartisan proposal to allow people to import lower - cost prescription drugs from Canada and certain other countries .
Democratic leaders delayed a vote , in part , because they feared that the proposal would be approved , potentially blowing apart a deal negotiated by the White House and the pharmaceutical industry .
The industry , represented by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , or PhRMA , adamantly opposes legalizing additional imports and says the government could not guarantee the safety of imported medicines .
As members of Congress before last year ’s election , President Obama and his chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , supported efforts to allow drug imports .
But now the Obama administration , like pharmaceutical companies and the Bush administration , is raising safety concerns .

When Final Fantasy XIII was announced in 2006 , millions of fans around the globe began anticipating the title .
This year , Square Enix stated that the title would hit North America and Europe sometime in 2010 .
On the other hand , the official release date for Final Fantasy XIII in Japan is December 17th of 2009 .
The discrepancy between the release dates has been a cause for commotion within the gaming community , and now fans in North America and Europe are anticipating the title more than ever before .
Although the release date outside of Japan is set for 2010 , there is one positive bit of news .
When asked about the international release date of Final Fantasy XIII , Square Enix CEO Yoichi Wada stated that the there ’s a chance that Final Fantasy XIII will release internationally before the end of the fiscal year .
This means that the game might release in the states before July 2010 .
While that ’s still a long time from now , many have believed that the international version might release in late 2010 .
Final Fantasy XIII is one of the largest upcoming RPGs and will be receiving its very own PlayStation 3 bundle in Japan later this year .

The New South Wales Supreme Court has ordered a review of compensation for a woman raped 500 times in foster care .
Justice Stephen Rothman has ruled the Victims Compensation Tribunal made an " error of law " in its determination for the woman who was raped from the age of five to 16 .
In 2008 the tribunal ruled she was eligible for compensation on the basis of one act of violence , even though she made seven compensation claims .
The judge noted that although 500 rapes were perpetrated , the woman did not claim 500 awards of compensation .
He said the man who raped the woman was the son - in - law of her foster parents .
The judge quashed the decision and ordered the case be sent back to the tribunal .
BAGHDAD  Iraq ’s government sold development rights to two of its largest untapped oil fields at a public auction held under extraordinary security on Friday , three days after a series of coordinated bombings killed more than 100 people here in the capital .
A partnership of Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas , a state - owned Malaysian company , won the larger field , Majnoon , in southern Iraq , which contains an estimated 12.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil .
The second field , Halfiya , also in the south , was won by a consortium led by China National Petroleum Company that included Petronas and Total of France .
It is believed to hold some 4.1 billion barrels .
The auction , the second since the 2003 invasion , attracted representatives of dozens of the world ’s largest oil companies , including ExxonMobil , British Petroleum and Russia ’s Lukoil .
“ I was nervous when I was sitting there , ” said Mounir Bouaziz , a vice president at Shell , after he submitted the winning bid for the Majnoon field .
“ We are pleased and relieved to have won this .
It has taken a lot of work to get this , including months and months of study and discussions . ”
Time for another episode of “ Hot Air Comments of the Day , ” a look into the pestilent sewer of hatred , racism , talk of violent overthrow of the government , calls for the murder of President Obama and “ liberals ” in general , and all - around evil - minded nastiness that is the Hot Air comments section .
This is n’t “ cherry - picking . ”
Every single thread of comments at Hot Air is full of the kind of stuff you ’re about to read .
Starting with someone who wants to personally take part in lynching President Obama .
I could n’t care less what the Obamunist ’s view is , I intend to put the rope around his neck when Obamunist hangs and I DARE for him or his lackeys to send anyone after me .
I guarantee our military will support me in this , why ? , because I work with these good folk every day .

There are people calling for violent revolution against the US government in almost every thread , no matter what the topic .
Tick … tick … tick … it ’s getting closer to the time when people will simply begin to take matters into their own hands .
I hope most of the military and law enforcement will be on board .
I have no idea what Obama ’s thinking , but not all people will simply accept his dictate to spend the rest of their lives in misery kissing his communist a $ $.

I find the idea that the US government should be overthrown slightly less radical and wacky than stating that prudent people suffer an unjust and unConstitutional Congress until the Supreme Court okays the Revolution .

They think Obama ’s worse than Hitler .
Yes , but Hitler was able to get the Olympic games for Berlin .
Obama could n’t match that ! ;-)

Spirit ’s three left wheels are mired in sand , and only one of the three right ones is working well ( Illustration : NASA / JPL - Caltech )
A second wheel may now be broken on NASA ’s Spirit rover , dampening hopes for freeing the robot from a sand trap it has been trapped in for seven months .
The injury will also increase the rover ’s risk of freezing to death in the coming winter .
Spirit has been struggling to escape from a patch of soft , sandy soil since April .
Its three left wheels are almost entirely buried and have little traction , and its right - front wheel is of no use – it seized up permanently in 2006 .
Now , Spirit ’s right - rear wheel is also having problems and may be permanently disabled .
The right - rear wheel stalled on 28 and 21 November during attempts to start driving the rover out of the sand trap .
Each wheel has its own motor , and the rover team commanded Spirit to try to spin the wheel again during a series of tests on 3 and 4 December – but it did not budge .
Advertisement
In the previous stalls , the wheel had at least moved a little bit before unexpectedly stopping .
But no motion at all was detected in the tests .
“ That ’s troubling , ” says rover project manager John Callas of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
“ It ’s conceivable we ’re witnessing a deterioration on the wheel . ”
If the wheel cannot be coaxed into working again , then Spirit will likely be trapped forever , Callas says .
Low light
“ It was questionable whether we could get a five - wheel - driving rover out , ” he says .
“ If we have a four - wheel - driving rover [ with ] only one driving wheel on the right - hand side … then extracting the rover from its current embedded location is unlikely . ”
Spirit could die if it remains stuck when winter arrives six months from now at the rover ’s location in Mars ’s southern hemisphere , Callas says .
In previous winters , Spirit rested on slopes that angled its solar arrays in a way that captured as much sunlight as possible .
That allowed the rover to power heaters designed to keep its electronic innards from freezing .
No power
But Spirit ’s solar panels are not currently at a good angle to maximise sunlight .
Meanwhile , dust is slowly accumulating on the panels , reducing their efficiency .
If the rover is unable to move , it could run out of power and die in the frigid Martian night .
“ If we extrapolate current dust accumulation rates out to the next winter six months away , it does look troubling , ” Callas says .
“ There ’s a real possibility Spirit would not have power to survive the winter at its current attitude . ”
Further tests were to be performed on Tuesday to try to determine the source of the wheel ’s trouble .
A rock stuck in the wheel seems unlikely at this point , since previous jams have not prevented the wheel motor from moving altogether , as was observed in this case , Callas says .
Stock still
Another possibility is that brushes used to make electrical contacts inside the motor have worn out , which is the leading hypothesis for what permanently disabled the right - front wheel in 2006 , he says .
If Spirit turns out to be permanently stranded , scientists have planned a set of observations to do while it remains alive .
These include tracking Spirit ’s radio signals as a way of measuring the motion of Mars itself .
Measuring slight wobbles of the planet ’s spin axis could reveal details of the world ’s internal structure , but the rover needs to be stationary to get precise measurements .
The team would also monitor the rover ’s accelerometers , searching for vibrations due to small meteorite impacts on the Martian surface .
Another of NASA ’s Mars probes , the Mars Odyssey orbiter , temporarily stopped relaying data from Spirit and its twin Opportunity back to Earth in November following a glitch , but the problem has since been resolved .
For those of you without perfect vision , the actual Theory of Hipster Relativity is : M = ( BN^2 ) ^- 1 Music equals the inverse of Band multiplied by band 's Notoriety squared .
Before you go emailing me saying " that equation does n't make any sense ! " , reflect on the fact that it is based upon hipsterism , a frame of reference that is highly illogical in and of itself .
Writing this strip gave me a ton of ideas for new t- shirts - would people like to see a " Music Plus Science Equals Sexy " shirt , perhaps ?
Or maybe the Theory of Hipster Relativity ?
I am open to suggestions .
I can't seem to get enough of the Poster Children lately .

Tonight 's comic was especially fun to write as it's been a while since I was able to do a comic about music and music culture .
I know a lot of people enjoy that sort of strip , so it is nice to be able to do one every once in a while .
Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I do !
One last thing : Scary Go Round has just gotten another 100 % more awesome .

“ I ’m going to change when I get to the LAX airport ” .
A friend of mine was recently flying from Australia to Los Angeles .
He planned to wear a pair of jeans on the first flight and then change for his connecting flight within the States .
“ I always get treated better when I ’m dressed up .
You ’re much more likely to get upgraded ” .
( Side note :
Why my friend would rather get upgraded for the two hour Stateside flight and not the 14 hour transpacific flight is still a mystery to me ) .
Me ?
I ’m a vagabond when I fly .
But , then again , I travel with three young kids so I ’d be happy if people just did n’t give us nasty looks .
I ’d feel quite content if for once we were not on the very last row of the airplane .
I do n’t expect anyone is going to invite the Ford Five to flaunt their stuff in First Class .
But , I do agree that airlines treat people better based on how they are dressed .
And the airlines are not the only people who treat you better based on your outfit .
“ Even when I go to buy something from the mall I get dressed up .
They always give me a better deal ” .
Now this was a new one to me – getting better treatment and even discounts while shopping just because you dressed up .
Since I ’m a negotiaphobic and have only one negotiating skill I would n’t really know .
Has anyone had any experiences with this ?
It seems to make complete sense .
Once again , I usually mosey down to the mall in my off work casual gear .
Do you think I ’d save money if I just stayed dressed up for the shopping trip ?
I know people suggest you dress nicely when you go to the bank for a loan , when you buy a new car , and when you go for a job interview .
Why would shopping be any different ?
I have even read about a man who traveled from church to church in different outfits .
On the first occasion , he showed up in a suit and was warmly welcomed .
On the next occasion , he arrived unshaved and dressed in drab clothes .
He said when he dressed down he was often not even greeted .
There was certainly never a warm welcome .
My brothers , as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ , do n’t show favoritism .
Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes , and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in .
If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say , “ Here ’s a good seat for you , ” but say to the poor man , “ You stand there ” or “ Sit on the floor by my feet , ” have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts ?
( James 2:1 -4 NIV )
It seems as though even the church might have issues with judging a book by its cover .
Conclusion :
How you dress makes a huge difference on how you are treated .
Look , if you want to make a statement and buck the system – go for it .
Just realize that your ‘ statement ’ is going to cost you .
I guess my friend was right .
How you dress makes a huge difference on how you are treated .
Nevertheless , let me be perfectly clear that nice clothes do not equal expensive clothes .
I buy second hand clothes ( here is my humorous story on how I got started second hand shopping ) .
I buy nice clothes ( usually ) .
The two are not mutually exclusive .
Just remember there are many advantages to shopping second hand .
Next time you head to the mall , perhaps Dockers would be more appropriate than Levis .
Next time you fly you might need some slacks instead of sweats .
The result ?
You ’ll probably save some serious cash .
Anyone tested this theory ?
Anyone willing to go shopping today and let us know what you find out ?
A history of the radical movements the Diggers and the Levellers which sprung up around the English Civil War .
“ I think that the poorest he that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he , and therefore truly , sir , I think it is clear to every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government . ”
The political and social upheaval that resulted from the English Civil War in the seventeenth century [ effectively two conflicts between 1642 - 1646 and 1647 /48 ] led to the development of a set of radical ideas centred around movements known as ‘ Diggers ’ and ‘ Levellers ’ The Diggers [ or ‘ True Levellers ’ ] were led by William Everard who had served in the New Model Army .
As the name implies , the diggers aimed to use the earth to reclaim the freedom that they felt had been lost partly through the Norman Conquest ; by seizing the land and owning it ‘ in common ’ they would challenge what they considered to be the slavery of property .
They were opposed to the use of force and believed that they could create a classless society simply through seizing land and holding it in the ‘ common good ’ .
To this end , a small group [ initially 12 , though rising to 50 ] settled on common land first at St George ’s Hill and later in Cobham , Surrey and grew corn and other crops .
This small group defied the landlords , the Army and the law for over a year .
In addition to this , groups travelled through England attempting to rally supporters .
In this they had some successes in Kent and Northamptonshire .
Their main propagandist was Gerard Winstanley who produced the clearest statement of Digger ideas in ‘ The Law of Freedom in a Platform ’ published in 1652 .
This was a defence and exposition of the notion of a classless society based in secularism and radical democracy
The relatively small group of followers of Digger ideas was never particularly influential and was quite easily suppressed by Cromwell and Fairfax .
The most significant of these movements were The Levellers whose revolutionary ideas resonated throughout the succeeding centuries , mostly notably in the demands of the Chartists in the nineteenth century .
The Levellers ’ ideas found most support in the ranks of the ’ New Model Army ’ , formed by Oliver Cromwell in 1645 and were largely responsible for the defeat of the Royalist forces led by Charles I , particularly in the decisive Battle of Naseby in June 1645 .
By the end of the first civil war in 1646 Leveller ideas were particularly influential and culminated in the Putney Debates where ordinary soldiers debated revolutionary ideas with their generals ; it was at this series of meetings that Leveller Colonel Thomas Rainborough argued the case for universal suffrage :
Unfortunately , this outbreak of democracy within the ranks of the army was relatively short - lived ; the outbreak of the second civil war in 1647 allowed the generals to reassert their authority and Leveller influence began to wane .
An attempted mutiny by Leveller soldiers was brutally suppressed in Burford , Oxfordshire in 1649 ; leaders were executed by Cromwell ’s soldiers and others were tried for high treason .
Why this brutal suppression ?
What did the generals find so threatening about the Levellers ?
Who were the Levellers ?
The Levellers were a relatively loose alliance of radicals and freethinkers who came to prominence during the period of instability that characterised the English Civil War of 1642 – 1649 .
The most prominent Levellers were John Lilburne , Richard Overton , William Walwyn , John Wildman , Edward Sexby and Colonel Thomas Rainborough .
What bound these people together was the general belief that all men were equal ; since this was the case , then a government could only have legitimacy if it was elected by the people .
The Leveller demands were for a secular republic , abolition of the House of Lords , equality before the law , the right to vote for all , free trade , the abolition of censorship , freedom of speech and the absolute right for people to worship whatever religion [ or none ] that they chose .
This programme was published as ‘ The Agreement of the People ’ .
These ideas came out of the social classes from which the Levellers originated ; they were mainly skilled workers and peasants and the ‘ petty bourgeoisie ’ .
Since many of them had fought in Cromwell ’s New Model Army they were used to discussion , argument and the free dissemination of ideas ; it was this intelligent debate allied to the need for discipline that had led to the defeat of the Royalists and the victory of the republic .
The Levellers were essentially radical idealists ; their demands could be seen as a form of early socialism [ they were pretty much the same as the demands of the Chartists some two hundred years later ] , but they had little or no understanding of the workings of a capitalist economy .
It is unfair , though , to expect this of them since capitalism as an organised form of social production would only assert itself much later in the development of Britain as an industrial nation .
Indeed , it is important to note that their views on the social order were not particularly progressive ; these were rooted in the notion that prior to 1066 and the Norman Conquest a democratic society had existed in Anglo - Saxon times where the land was held in common by the people [ perhaps this is in line with Karl Marx ’s idea of the concept of ‘ primitive communism ’ ; that is , the form of social organisation that existed in pre-industrial society ] .
The victory of William the Conqueror in 1066 had enabled him to impose a form of foreign [ that is , Norman ] domination on the people . [ 1 ]
This enabled him to reward his followers with huge swathes of land seized from the formerly ‘ free men ’ of England .
This was particularly so in the North of England where opposition was brutally suppressed .
The Levellers argued that since God had created all men as equals , the land belonged to all the people as a right .
Their programme was , then , essentially an attempt to restore the situation that they believed had existed previous to the Norman Conquest ; they wanted to establish a ‘ commonwealth ’ in which the common people would be in control of their own destiny without the intervention of a King , a House of Lords and other potential oppressors .
The Agreement of the People was drawn up by a committee of Levellers including John Lilburne which was to have been discussed at a meeting of the commonwealth armies at Newmarket in June 1647 .
In brief this is what they asked for :
· Power to be vested in the people
· One year Parliaments , elected by equal numbers of voters per seat .
The right to vote for all men who worked independently for their living and all those who had fought for the Parliamentary cause
· Recall of any or all of their MPs by their electors at any time
· Abolition of the House of Lords
· Democratic election of army officers
· Complete religious toleration and the abolition of tithes and tolls
· Justices to be elected ; law courts to be local and proceedings to be in English [ not French ! ]
· Redistribution of seized land to the common people
" [ T ] here had never been anything like such a spontaneous outbreak of democracy in any English or Continental Army before this year of 1647 , nor was there anything like it thereafter till Workers ’ and Soldiers ’ Councils met in 1917 in Russia " [ 2 ]
It is hardly surprising , given this programme of demands , that the rich and powerful felt threatened by the Levellers .
This is particularly so , given that some of the Leveller demands , almost 400 years on , have still not been met !
Since Leveller demands went so much further than Cromwell and other republican leaders could even begin to meet , then they had to be crushed .
The outbreak of the second civil war gave them the opportunity to do this and so the movement which would have surely rid the people of the parasitical classes once and for all was brutally put down .
The final victory of the Parliamentary forces later in 1648 not only led to the execution of the King , but also the suppression of Leveller ideas for a time .
Leveller ideas , though , posed a real challenge to the power and authority of Cromwell particularly with their attitude to the situation in Ireland .
The New Model Army had been set up to defend Parliament at home , not to act as a mercenary force which would advance the imperialist ambitions of the English ruling class .
The Catholics in Ireland , it was argued , had a claim to freedom and equality which was just as valid as that which the Levellers were arguing for at home .
In ‘ The English Soldier ’s Standard ’ , it was argued that military intervention in Ireland would only mean that the Irish would become a subject people exploited by precisely those who the Levellers were struggling to overcome in England .
The point was that influential levellers were implacably opposed to the reconquest of Ireland .
When significant elements of the New Model Army refused to embark for Ireland it was obvious that a crucial point had been reached .
Radical elements had to be crushed in order for Cromwell to assert his authority .
This was achieved at Burford in Oxfordshire where Fairfax and Cromwell surprised the Levellers and defeated them [ albeit it with only a handful of casualties ] .
From this time [ May 1649 ] the New Model Army was completely in the control of Cromwell .
This does not mean , though , that Leveller ideas were totally eradicated .
On May Day 1649 , the third and final version of the ‘ Agreement of the People ’ was published .
This is the last collective statement of the Leveller leaders and is their most complete political programme .
Its preface stated :
“ Peace and freedom is our design ; by war we were never gainers , nor ever wish to be . ”
In this version of the Agreement , there is a restatement of essential Leveller ideas , though there is a divergence between them and the aims of the Diggers to eradicate the ownership of private property .
In all other respects , the programme is not dissimilar to earlier versions ; the emphasis is still on universal [ male ] suffrage , accountable government , religious toleration , civil rights , and so on .
Leveller ideas mainly appealed to the dispossessed in society ; that is , those who were most threatened by what the Levellers were proposing were unlikely to be persuaded by appeals to the ‘ common good ’ .
Since the Levellers were unable to mobilise their followers to any great degree and , given their defeat at Burford , they lacked the ability to challenge the army or government , it is almost inevitable that they were unable to pose any future threat to the ruling class or [ restored ]
Monarchy .
Nevertheless , this is not to say that Leveller ideas are irrelevant or were consigned to the ‘ dustbin of history ’ .
Both the Levellers and Diggers are of crucial importance to the development of working class history since they stand in the proud tradition of English radicalism and challenge to the ruling orthodoxy .
Like the Tolpuddle Martyrs and the Chartists of a later period , the Diggers and Levellers posed a serious threat to the ruling class ; their direct appeals to the poor and dispossessed resonate throughout the centuries – whilst the language and mode of expression may have changed , the essential demands of these radicals remain as vibrant and necessary today as they were when they were first put .
Some 450 years after the Diggers established their commune at Cobham , we still need to establish the common ownership of property and the development of society based on need , rather than profit .
The words of Winstanley echo throughout the centuries :
“ When men take to buying and selling the land , saying ’ This is mine ’ , they restrain other fellow creatures from seeking nourishment from mother earth ….. so that he that had no land was to work for those , for small wages , that called the land theirs ; and thereby some are lifted up into the chair of tyranny and others trod under the footstool of misery , as if the earth were made for a few and not for all men . ”
Our task must to be rescue the words of the Diggers and Levellers from obscurity and to locate them quite firmly in the context of working - class history and struggle ; to seek inspiration from their words and actions ; to ensure that all of these disparate voices are united under the common theme of working class resistance to poverty and oppression

Ecuador broke off diplomatic ties with Bogota after the attack
A Colombian attack on a rebel camp in Ecuador in March 2008 was carried out with support from US forces based in Ecuador , a new report alleges .
The report was prepared for the Ecuadorian government .
It says that US intelligence provided from a base within Ecuador was used in the execution of the attack .
The report comes at a bad time as Ecuador and Colombia were just beginning to re-establish diplomatic relations .
' Anti -drug missions '
The Colombian military operation in March 2008 saw a Colombian rebel base within Ecuador bombed .
At the time Washington had a military base in Manta , in the north of Ecuador , granted under an agreement that allowed the US to conduct anti-drug missions in the region .
The report said that the support provided by US military went beyond that agreement .
Now the US has a military pact with Colombia , which gives the Americans military access to bases here .
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has frozen diplomatic links fearing that the US - Colombia military pact is the first step to an attack on his nation .
Massachusetts town of Dudley changed the language to the town ’s bylaw which now makes owning more than 3 cats without a kennel license illegal .
A $ 50 kennel licence is required if you want to keep more than 3 cats .
The change happened after a neighborhood feud over 15 cats owned by Mary Ellen Richards .
One of her neighbor had complained that her cats had ruined his yard .
Some of Mrs. Richards ’ 15 cats are allowed outside , and one neighbor said the cats have ruined his yard .
The discussion at town meeting last night had Mrs. Richards warning residents that the $ 100 per day fines being imposed on her could also be imposed on them if they fail to get kennel licenses for their pets .

Not surprisingly , Mrs. Richard was not happy with the decision and has put her home up for sale and plans to move to a “ more cat - friendly community , ” but vowed to fight the fines .
I wonder what did the other cat owners in Dudley think about the new law ?
Recently by Gary North : On Sacrificing for an Idea
I have surveyed the Austrian School ’s theory of money .
This theory began with Ludwig von Mises ’ “ Theory of Money and Credit ” ( 1912 ) .
I presented Mises ’ theory of fractional reserve banking and the creation of the business cycle in my mini-book , Mises on Money ( 2002 ) .
The previous parts of this series are on - line here .
I have done my best to get across a line of reasoning regarding money .
This line of reasoning is not shared by other schools of economic thought .
To the extent that it is understood by the decision - makers in the governments of the world and central banks , it is resisted .
It is regarded as old - fashioned and out of touch with newer , more scientific theories of money and banking .
The crisis of 2008 has led to a revival of interest in the Austrian School ’s theory of the business cycle .
Why ?
Because several Austrian School economists and newsletter writers warned of the looming crisis .
They did so two years before it hit .
These predictions were dismissed as radical and out of touch .
The most widely viewed debate over this matter — after the fact — took place on CNBC in 2006 .
Peter Schiff warned of the recession .
Arthur Laffer dismissed it .
Finally , the Wall Street Journal ran an article on Mises ’ prediction of the Great Depression .
The article ran on November 6 , 2009 .
Better late than never .
MY FUNDAMENTAL POINT
In Part 1 , I made the point that the Austrian School ’s theory of money is an extension of its overall theory of economic exchange .
This distinguishes the Austrian School ’s view from all rival views of money .
The rival views insist that the free market is insufficient to provide a reliable monetary system .
Either the national government or the nation ’s central bank must intervene in the free market in order to provide stability and reliability to the money system and therefore to the economy .
The logical extension of this outlook is that there is a great need for a world government and a world central bank , which together provide such stability internationally .
Most economists and politicians refuse to say this in public , but this is a matter of prudence , not logic .
In contrast , the Austrians say that the free market can provide such a system of world money .
We have already seen this system in operation .
It was called the gold standard .
It operated for most of the nineteenth century .
It needed no world government and no world central bank to make it work .
It did not need trained economists to make it work .
You can imagine how popular Austrian School economics is with economists — about as popular as the gold standard .
The non-Austrians insist that money needs government coercion in order to be money .
Money may have started without coercion , but this condition cannot last for long , nor did it .
The defenders of this position rarely come out and explain why , in terms of their theory of markets , money is different from other goods and services .
If private property and the right of exchange produce efficient markets for other scarce resources , why not for money ?
They do not say , exactly .
They just insist that this is the case .
Then , not surprisingly , we find that in exception after exception , they insist that other aspects of the economy also cannot function without state coercion .
In niche after niche , in sector after sector , we are told that market - clearing bids cannot arise .
But the biggest sector of all is money .
WHAT IS MONEY ?
Mises defined money in 1912 .
Money is the most marketable commodity .
This identifies the central benefit of money : a means of exchange .
Contrary to the standard textbook accounts , money is not a measure of value .
There is no measure of value .
Value is subjective .
You could as easily measure your love for your children .
Also contrary to these accounts , money is not a store of value , although it is a valuable thing to store .
There is no store of value .
There is at best continuity of price .
Money is a unit of account .
It makes possible modern double - entry bookkeeping .
Mises said that this was one of the greatest inventions of the modern world .
Mises argued that money arose out of voluntary exchange .
A commodity that had been sought and bought for attributes other than its use as a means of exchange became a commonly accepted means of exchange .
This created new demand for it .
The government did not create money .
Individual decision - makers did .
Civil government soon insisted on sovereignty over money .
It stamped coins .
This authenticated the coins .
But , when governments found that they could steal from the public by debasing the gold or silver coins with cheaper ( base ) metals , the newer unauthentic coins de-legitimized the inflating governments .
Authenticity became unauthenticity .
Fiat money is a form of counterfeiting .
In a world of fiat national moneys that are in competition with each other , national governments have become members in a kind of competitive cartel of counterfeiters .
“ My counterfeit money is better than yours ! ” they insist .
Gresham ’s law states that bad money drives out good money .
This law holds true only when governments set price controls — fixed rates of exchange — between different forms of money .
The artificially overvalued money drives the artificially undervalued money out of circulation .
We do not see gold and silver coins in use as money today because governments have artificially overvalued their own national currencies .
FIVE DECIDING ISSUES
There are five fundamental issues in every social order and every institution : ( 1 ) sovereignty , ( 2 ) authority , ( 3 ) law , ( 4 ) sanctions , and ( 5 ) continuity .
Put in easily memorized form , they are :
1 . Who ’s in charge here ?
2 . To whom do I report ?
3 . What are the rules ?
4 .
What do I get if I obey ?
( disobey ? ) 5 .
Does this outfit have a future ?
With respect to money , the Austrian theory of money answers these questions as follows :
1 . The free market2 .
The individual who has money 3 .
The right of exchange / contract4 .
Profit and loss5 .
Long use encourages future use
With respect to money , the other schools of opinion differ from each other , but not on these issues :
1. The state2 .
The fractional reserve banking system3 .
Never allow price deflation4 .
Big bank bailouts5 .
People will adjust to price inflation
The universal outlook of the non-Austrian schools of thought is that a steady price deflation is always bad , but a little price inflation is not so bad , and it is surely better than price deflation , recession , or depression .
In all theories of money except Austrianism , the state is seen as the necessary agent of planning .
Even in schools of thought that proclaim the inefficiency of central planning , the members hold to the necessity of scientific central planning of money .
All of them call for the economists employed by the state - created central bank to adjust the money supply in order to achieve specific outcomes .
Deep within every non-Austrian free market economist , there is a central planner screaming to get out .
FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING
Under fractional reserve banking , banks are allowed to lend out money that has been promised to depositors .
The depositors think of their deposits as money .
So do borrowers .
Borrowers spend this money .
Then , one dark day , depositors also try to spend this money .
A bank run begins .
Let us review how the system works .
A bank accepts a deposit of $ 100 .
It sends $ 10 to the regional Federal Reserve Bank as its mandated legal reserve .
It lends out $ 90 .
The borrower spends this money .
His bank takes $ 9 and sends it to the FED .
Then it lends out $ 81 .
On and on it goes , until the original $ 100 deposit turns into $ 900 .
Inflationary ?
You bet !
The fractional reserve process allows the banking system to expand the money supply .
This creates an economic boom by lowering commercial interest rates .
To lend this new money , banks must find borrowers .
To lure them in , the banks have to offer lower interest rates than what prevailed before the fiat money was created .
Entrepreneurs who borrow the money begin new projects .
But then they find that they are running short of capital .
The increase in fiat money did not represent an increase in thrift : future - orientation of consumers , i.e. , a willingness to defer consumption .
Businessmen must now compete for more money to finish projects .
Interest rates rise .
More companies then shut down incomplete projects .
The recession begins .
Fractional reserve banking rests on an impossibility : that all depositors can withdraw currency at the same time , even though the money has been loaned out .
The bank ’s contract allows depositors to withdraw currency on demand .
This contract is inherently fraudulent .
It can not be fulfilled in a banking crisis .
There are two legal claims on the same money : depositor and borrower .
If the bank ’s contract with depositors had specified that the money would not available until the subsequent loan was repaid by the borrower , there would be no problem .
The problem arises from the simultaneity of economic value across time .
Future value is always discounted by time .
This is the phenomenon known as the time value of money .
Mises called it time preference .
The heart of the contract ’s problem is that current money is always worth more than future money .
The value of future money is discounted by three factors :
1 . The discount of all future value2 .
The risk of non-payment3 .
The inflation premium ( depreciated money )
Fractional reserve banking rests on an impossibility : “ The discount applied to future money will not change . ”
When a banking crisis occurs because of this , the size of the discrepancy between the present value of money and its future value , there are bank runs .
The discount applied to future money increases due to a rising risk of default .
“ A bird in hand is worth two under the bush . ”
Depositors want their now even more valuable present money rather than a legal claim on now less valuable future money .
The banks do not have the currency to pay off the depositors .
The bank then calls in whatever loans that it can .
The debtors cannot repay .
They go bankrupt .
Then banks that lent them the money go bankrupt .
A depression takes place because pricing of capital goods was made on a false assumption : the depositors would never all demand their money at the same time .
The assumption is false because the initial premise was false : “ The present value of future money will not depreciate so much as to cause a run on the banks . ”
But could n’t banks raise the interest paid to depositors ?
Of course .
They could get out their iPhones and speed dial 1-800 - FREE - LUNCH 1-800 - FREE-LUNCH .
Maybe depositors get fired because their employers could not meet the demand for repayment to the banks .
The depositors then demand immediate money .
Banks cannot deliver .
The collapse of overextended banks exacerbates the depression .
The inverted pyramid of debt collapses .
What goes up ( boom ) must come down ( bust ) .
But not for long .
The central bank then steps in and creates new money to forestall this collapse .
Another round of counterfeiting begins .
BOOM - BUST , BUST - BOOM
The reason why economies suffer from booms and busts is because the fractional reserve banking process continues .
It continues because there is an enforcer who calls the bust to a stop before prices have adjusted to the new conditions of supply and demand .
The enforcer is the central bank .
A central bank ’s primary function in every nation is to keep large banks in the banking cartel from going bankrupt .
The big banks are never allowed to go belly - up .
The central bank always intervenes and creates new fiat money to bail out the big banks .
If it does n’t , the government does .
The cure for the bad outcome of fiat money inflation — depression — is always another round of monetary inflation .
This sets off the boom - bust cycle once again .
Once started , the process continues , generation after generation .
The groups that prospered from the fiat money — induced boom demand bailouts .
Some of them do get bailed out by the government .
These bailouts are paid for by new government debt ( no change in the money supply ) and also by fiat money issued by the central bank .
There is never a day of final reckoning .
Everyone plays kick the can .
This is point five : continuity .
It is the continuity of deferred judgment ( point four ) .
The profit and loss system is not allowed to work .
Monetary reform never takes place because everyone wants to defer final judgment .
Everyone wants to go to heaven , but nobody wants to die .
Everyone wants a stable economy with growth .
No one wants recession and increased bankruptcies to re-price capital goods .
So , kick the can always results in another round of monetary inflation .
The boom - bust cycles repeat .
This is continuity in the modern fiat money economy .
The voters want it .
The debtors want it .
The banks want it .
Businessmen want it .
The result : American prices as measured by the consumer price index have risen by a factor of 20 since the Federal Reserve System began operating in 1914 .
The dollar has depreciated by about 95 % .
There is never a monetary reform that in fact reforms the system .
All monetary reforms are applications of kick the can .
WHERE DOES IT ALL END ?
If kick the can continues , fiat money will depreciate .
People will take on new debt on the assumption that inflation will let them repay their debts with money of reduced purchasing power .
When recession hits , they demand government action .
This means more inflation .
Mises argued that when people catch on to the game , they will take evasive action .
They will make plans in terms of rising prices .
Other economists have agreed .
But this led Mises to argue that the economic contraction would come if the supply of money were not increased at an ever - higher rate and unexpected rate .
Inflation would become hyperinflation .
He saw this take place in Austria a decade after The Theory of Money and Credit was published .
He was once asked if he had a hedge against inflation .
He replied : “ Age . ”
There must be a default at some point .
The question is : “ Which kind ? ”
If the central bank ceases to inflate , a recession begins .
If the government or the central bank refuses to intervene , many banks go under .
This shrinks the money supply .
The recession becomes a depression .
Bankruptcies and unemployment increase .
Tax revenues fall .
The government cannot pay its debt and also meet all of its promises .
It must choose :
1. Default on all of the debt2 .
Default on part of the debt3 .
Tell the central bank to inflate4 .
Raise taxes and cut expenditures
Choice # 3 starts the process over .
The ultimate result : the destruction of the currency .
This is default through inflation .
It is nonetheless a default .
CONCLUSION
Decide which way of default is most likely .
Then decide when .
Then plan accordingly .
Or you can do what the policy - makers do .
Kick the can .
Most people do .
But then , one day , there is a day of reckoning .
However , until then .
. . .
“ We ’ll have fun , fun , fun till the market takes our T - bills away . ”

Hi all ,
I 've been lurking here for a while - but this is my first post - so I hope I 've got the
formatting right !
I thought perhaps this might be of interest to the community here :
ChucK : Strongly - timed , Concurrent , and On - the - fly Audio Programming Language
From the language specification :
" ChucK is a strongly - timed language , meaning that time is fundamentally embedded in the language .
ChucK allows the programmer to explicitly reason about time from the code .
This gives extremely flexible and precise control over time and ( therefore ) sound synthesis . "
The idea of a programming language providing explicit support for being able to statically reason about how much real time a procedure requires ( as opposed to it 's O ( n ) time - complexity ) seems new to me , and potentially of significant value in areas well outside ChucK 's domain of audio processing i.e. real - time systems in general , and possibly even other application areas .
Your thoughts appreciated !
IOWA CITY , Iowa -- Iowa quarterback Ricky Stanzi was taken to the locker room after suffering a sprained ankle in the Hawkeyes ' ( No. 4 BCS , No. 8 AP ) 17-10 loss to Northwestern .
Head coach Kirk Ferentz said X - rays were negative , but it does n't look good for him to play next week .
" The bad news is it 's a severe sprain , " Ferentz said .
" My guess is he 'll be out of action here the next couple weeks . "
" If they 've X - rayed it , I 've got to think it 's fairly serious .
...
It takes time for those things to get right .
...
Right now we have to take the approach that he wo n't go , and if he does , that 's a bonus . "
Stanzi was drilled by Corey Wootton in the end zone , and his fumble was recovered by Marshall Thomas for a touchdown that brought Northwestern within 10 - 7 .
Stanzi was limping as he was helped off the field .
He was replaced by redshirt freshman James Vandenberg , whose first pass was intercepted .
Later in the game , Northwestern quarterback Dan Persa suffered a hand injury and and never returned .
Stanzi was 4 of 9 for 134 yards with a touchdown and an interception before leaving the game .
He came into the game 17 - 3 as the starter since taking over the middle of last season .

Recent college graduates with dreams of post - degree grandeur are being pummelled by the recession and forced to live with the reality of how much their degrees cost and how difficult it is to use them right now .
A report released this week by The Project on Student Debt shows that 2008 college graduates owe and average of $ 23,200 on their educations , a figure 25 percent higher than what their older brothers and sisters owed when they graduated from college in 2004 .
On top of double - digit debt , the report also cites unpublished numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that show how seriously college graduates are being affected by unemployment .
In the third quarter of 2008 , the unemployment rate for graduates ages 20 to 24 was 7.6 percent .
One year later , the rate has jumped to an all - time high of 10.6 percent .
The report also breaks down average student debt by state on a user - friendly map which shows a concentration of high averages in the Northeast and a concentration of low averages in the West .
The District of Columbia ( $ 29,793 ) , Iowa ( $ 28,174 ) and Connecticut ( $ 26,138 ) have the highest averages while Utah ( $ 13,041 ) , Hawaii ( $ 15,156 ) and Kentucky ( $ 15,951 ) have the lowest .
Though the report deals in averages , there are many students who owe much more than their state ’s average , and the number of students who owe twice the national average has been creeping up over the past few years .
Joaquín Guzmán Loera , also known as “ El Chapo , ” is Mexico ’s most wanted drug lord .
He ’s also , according to Forbes magazine , one of the world ’s most powerful men .
Out of the 67 people listed , Guzmán came in at number 41 , ahead of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ( number 67 ) , French President Nicolas Sarkozy ( number 56 ) and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ( number 43 ) .
Power is not always used responsibly .
As head of the Sinaloa Cartel , Guzmán , 54 , has amassed a billion dollar fortune and caused a staggering amount of violence and bloodshed along the way .
He escaped from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart in 2001 , days before his extradition to the United States ( the American government is offering a $ 5 million reward for his arrest ) .
He went on to lead a bloody drug war that has caused the deaths of 14,000 people since President Felipe Calderon took office in 2006 .
This year alone , more than 2,000 people have been killed in Ciudad Juarez , which is where Guzman 's gang is battling the Juarez cartel .
" Of course he 's influential , rich and powerful , but he has cost so many lives , so many youths , " said Gabriela Lopez , a 25 - year - old businesswoman in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa .
" I wish they would make a list pointing out that as well . "
" I think he's an almost iconic figure in the underworld , " said Don Thornhill , a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent who tracked Guzman and other Mexican drug lords during his 25 - year career before retiring in 2007 .
" He 's certainly taken on legendary status because of his jail break .
I think he 's pretty savvy at making the right contacts , knowing the right people to pay off , which is why he has managed to keep going as long as he has . "

In Egypt , where most women wear the Islamic headscarf , Marwa Sherbini has become known as " the veil martyr " .
Read your emails on the case
There were alerts on state television as news broke that her murderer had been sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of an early release .
The Egyptian ambassador in Berlin , Ramzi Izz Al - Din , told Channel One that Alexander Wiens had received " the harshest ruling possible " .
He said he did not expect the ruling to be reduced if an appeal was filed .
Foreign ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki welcomed the verdict , saying it " served justice " and was " a warning to those motivated by hate " .
Wiens , 28 , stabbed Ms Sherbini at least 16 times in a courtroom in Dresden in July , when she was giving evidence against him in a defamation case .
He had called her a " terrorist " and " Islamist " in a children 's playground because she covered her hair .
She had asked him to make room for her three - year old son to play on the swings .
Ms Sherbini , a 31 - year - old pharmacist , was pregnant when she was killed .
Her son was in the courtroom at the time and her husband was stabbed and accidentally shot by a German guard when he tried to intervene .
High security Details of the case shocked Egyptians and there was outrage at what was seen as the slow response of the German authorities to offer condolences and deal with claims of Islamophobia .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
A week after the killing , German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her sympathies to Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak , but she did not comment publicly .
Meanwhile , thousands of people turned out for the funeral of Ms Sherbini in her home city , Alexandria .
Many held banners demanding retribution .
There were also small but angry protests outside the German embassy and in the Al - Azhar Mosque in Cairo .
Demonstrators described Germany as " a civilisation of tyrants " and shouted : " What happened to human rights ?
Where is justice ? "
Wiens 's trial was extensively covered in the Egyptian media , with particular attention given to the extra security measures taken in court .
Egyptian lawyers also travelled to Dresden and were allowed to present legal arguments .
Giving his response to the verdict , the head of the Egyptian Bar Association , Hamdi Khalifah , said it proved the German judiciary was " neutral " .
An international law professor at Zagazig University , Nabil Himli , believed it showed the system was not " biased against Islam or Arabs and that the German authorities are fair " .
' Bad image ' Still , many Egyptians have expressed the wish that Germany had a death sentence to use in this case .
Mr Akaz was injured as he tried to save his wife " She died , but he 's still alive , " Badr Shorbagy , a neighbour of Ms Sherbini from Alexandria , complained to the Associated Press news agency .
Ms Sherbini 's husband , Olwi Akaz , gave testimony in the trial , telling how his son , who now lives with family in Egypt , misses his mother .
Mr Akaz had moved to Germany to carry out doctoral research in molecular biology but has said he does not think he will continue to live in Dresden .
Tarek Sherbini , the brother of the dead woman , said " the image of the German people is very bad " following the attack and claimed it showed hatred of Muslims .
There was a recent sign of a continuing strain in relations when the Dresden orchestra postponed planned performances in Egypt .
Officials say they hope tensions will now ease .

PITTSBURGH
LIKE brides and bridegrooms the world over , the ones in this city and nearby towns bask in the glory of the white dress , the big kiss and the first dance .
But then , a large number of them happily cede the spotlight to a cookie .
Or a few thousand of them .
For as long as anyone here can remember , wedding receptions in Pittsburgh have featured cookie tables , laden with dozens of homemade old - fashioned offerings like lady locks , pizzelles and buckeyes .
For weeks ahead  sometimes months  mothers and aunts and grandmas and in - laws hunker down in the kitchen baking and freezing .
Then , on the big day , hungry guests ravage the buffet , piling plates high and packing more in takeout containers so they can have them for breakfast the next day .
No one knows for sure who started the tradition , or why it has n’t exactly taken hold outside this region .
Many people credit Italian and Eastern European immigrants who wanted to bring a bit of the Old Country to the big day in the New World .
Given that many of them were already well practiced at laying out a Christmas spread , baking 8 to 10 times as many treats for a few hundred special friends and relatives may not have seemed like such a stretch .
But even amid the increasing professionalization of the wedding , with florists mimicking slick arrangements ripped from Martha Stewart ’s magazines and wedding planners scheduling each event down to the minute , the descendants of those Pittsburgh settlers continue to haul their homemade cookies into the fanciest hotels and wedding venues around the city .
For many families today , it would be bordering on sacrilege to do without the table .
In Unity , population 1,900 , the Amish have found a particularly happy coincidence of interests .
The town is home to Unity College , an environmental school that teaches sustainable living practices and lends an earthy quality to the culture .
That a group of people with such small carbon footprints - erecting wind turbines to charge battery packs used for powering tools and lanterns , keeping food cold in summer in an insulated basement room lined with three wagonloads of ice chunks from a pond - would land here , strikes many as a perfect alignment .
“ I stand here all day and watch them , ’’ said Josh Miville , manager of Chase Toys in Unity , a shop that sells all - terrain vehicles and sits across from an Amish farm and the community ’s one - room schoolhouse .
“ And I ’ll tell you , they ’ve got something figured out that we do n’t .
It ’s the simple life .
No power bills , no cellphones , no worries . ’’
With their hand - stitched shirts and chaste frocks , the Amish still command double - takes in Maine as they bike to school and carpool to Wal - Mart .
But they quickly have become integral parts of their communities even as they observe boundaries to avoid technologies that they shun , such as electricity from the grid .
Among some Mainers , there is a small but not insignificant amount of Amish envy .
They have come from Michigan and Canada , Tennessee and Kentucky , and other offshoots of original Amish settlements in Pennsylvania .
Some are fleeing encroaching suburbs and neck - craning tourists , and seeking open - minded communities that will allow them to practice their brand of ultra-simple living .
Some are following a directive to spread the word of their lifestyle and Christian beliefs by starting communities in places far from other Amish settlements .
In a rugged stretch of Maine , where self - reliance and iconoclasm have been long honored , Amish are settling and finding eager neighbors .
Amish first made homes in Smyrna and Easton in Aroostook County and most recently in Unity and neighboring Thorndike , in the state ’s center , transforming landscapes into scenes that could be postcards from Lancaster , Pa. - byways dotted with pickups giving wide berth to horse - drawn buggies carrying women in bonnets and men with beards .
Today , about 200 Amish live in Maine , according to their leaders .
“ The Amish were the solution that we were looking for - that we could never have dreamed up , ’’ said Doug Fox , a neighbor of the Hochstetlers , one of Unity ’s eight Amish families .
Then a little more than a year ago men in banded straw hats and denim suits arrived and started buying big parcels .
They built sturdy houses on the hillsides above fields where they planted strawberries and butternut squash , and loosed goats and cows to graze .
They started small businesses on their land , turning out metal siding , wind turbines , and furniture , and sold vegetables and baked goods .
As dairy farms in Unity have struggled and died in recent years , town leaders worried the setting would draw developers more interested in erecting neo-Colonials and paving roads than preserving the town ’s agricultural heritage .
They recruited organic farmers who bought small plots .
But vast swaths remained .
UNITY , Maine -
The land was gorgeous .
Pastures bounded by forests and overlooked by the distant Dixmont hills .
And that was the problem .
“ You should see how hard they work , ’’ said Ron Rudolph , a town selectman and co-owner of an organic vineyard .
“ I could n’t believe the houses they put up - in days .
And the best part of it is , they do n’t drive cars that smoke up the area . ’’
Amish residents say the appreciation is mutual .
“ I like the laid - back lifestyle , ’’ said Andrew Stoll , a 35 - year - old father of five who moved to Unity from Michigan and runs a metal roofing business out of his barn .
His mother and three brothers also now make their homes here .
“ People are very neighborly . ’’
To be sure , when the Amish first arrived in town last year , they were curiosities , their culture a whispered topic that sent some people scurrying to laptop computers to figure out just what their dress and German - accented English were all about .
Residents were n’t sure whether to wave when they saw Amish bicycling along the road , which was now sometimes speckled with manure from horses pulling buggies .
Some leery residents asked the town clerk whether they paid property taxes .
She assured them they did .
But in short order , they became the cool kids that everyone wanted to know .
Recently , neighbors flocked to a pig roast the Hochstetlers hosted .
Meanwhile , the Unity Union Church men ’s fellowship lobbied for weeks to have the leading Amish men attend their meeting and explain the Amish lifestyle .
On any given day , the Amish have their pick of residents ’ standing offers to drive them to stores in nearby Waterville .
( The Amish in Unity do not own or drive cars but will accept rides . )
“ There ’s a friendly competition to see who knows the most about the Amish , ’’ said Fox , a professor of landscape horticulture at Unity College .
The Amish maintain some divisions .
They send their children to their own school and do not permit their children to visit the homes of non-Amish .
They are not easily reached because they do n’t have phones in their houses , though some have put phones in sheds .
Amish discourage phones in homes to preserve family time .
They do not read local newspapers or vote in elections .
And they often defer to their first language , Pennsylvania Dutch , a German dialect .
But Amish have increasingly become a part of town life .
Crosstrax , a funky deli that sells milk and cheeses from local farms , now also offers baskets of Amish - grown vegetables - last week , spaghetti squash from Amish in Thorndike .
Amish businessmen regularly show up at Chase Toys , where Miville receives faxes on their behalf .
And come Wednesdays , the store is flooded with calls from residents wanting to know whether Abner Stoll is selling his glazed doughnuts across the way that week .
“ The Amish do n’t so much influence the town as complement the town , ’’ said Naomi Caywood , a clerk at Crosstrax .
The Amish residents say they had little idea of Unity ’s makeup when they settled here .
They were looking for land and heard that Unity had ample stock at reasonable prices .
( One family bought a 200 - acre parcel for $ 350,000 and another a 100 - acre parcel for $ 235,000 , with money principally earned from small businesses . )
They say the land needs work to revive its haying potential , but they have been pleasantly surprised by the town ’s embrace of their efforts .
“ They want the land to be preserved , ’’ said Ervin Hochstetler , 45 .
He moved his wife , Esther , also 45 , and 11 children - now 12 children , ages 21 to 7 months - to Unity from Smyrna , and is planning to build wind turbines that produce compressed air for pneumatic tools .
The Hochstetler home is a study in efficiency , with solar panels on the roof and two small wind turbines in the field .
As they tucked into a meal of deer meat and potatoes for lunch on a recent day , their eldest daughter retrieved yogurt from the porch , where food is stored in winter .
On the wall , a sign read : “ To be content with little is hard , to be content with much is impossible . ’’
Still , the house is not without traces of contemporary culture .
The baby , Seth , happily bounced in a multicolored plastic ExerSaucer , and when the Hochstetlers hosted the pig roast at their home and neighbors brought bottles of soda and Little Debbie cakes , the Hochstelters did not turn away the offerings .

WASHINGTON  President Obama exhorted Senate Democrats on Sunday to put aside their differences and seize their moment in history by passing landmark health legislation .
But senators said he did not mention sticky issues like abortion or a new government - run insurance plan .
Though Mr. Obama gave them no guidance on the question , Senate Democrats on Sunday intensified their yearlong effort to build consensus around some form of a public insurance plan to compete with private insurers .
The Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada , named 10 senators  five centrists and five liberals  to seek a compromise .
Under a leading proposal , the federal Office of Personnel Management would negotiate with insurers to offer one or more national health plans to individuals , families and small businesses .
The personnel office has decades of experience arranging health benefits for federal employees , including members of Congress .
The push for a deal on the public option indicated the pressure Democrats were feeling to resolve their differences if they hope to pass the bill by their self - imposed deadline of Christmas .
On Monday , the Senate plans to take up another explosive issue , restrictions on insurance coverage for abortion .
On the afternoon of September 1 , 2009 , Gawker launched a wide - ranging , multi- front investigation into the hazing practices of a State Department contractor in Kabul .
About an hour later , we published the shocking results .
Today , the State Department listened .
The State Department has canceled its 5 - year , $ 189 million contract with Armor Group International , the security firm whose vodka - addled and totally not gay guards provided security for the American embassy in Kabul , Afghanistan , when they were n't busy slurping liquor off of one another 's buttcracks while naked .
As you may recall , the homoerotic hazing rituals that Armor Group employees were subjected to first came to light after we published photographs of the debauchery .
Well , actually they first came to light after the Project on Government Oversight published the results of its own exhaustive investigation into Armor Group .
We just called POGO and asked them for the pictures , which they kindly provided , and put them on the internet .
In this crazy , mixed up world of sexting and Facebook and whatnot , we ended up getting the credit for launching the subsequent State Department inquiry into the affair .
Mediaite wondered , " Does the Long Arm of Gawker Reach the State Department ? "
And MSNBC 's Contessa Brewer asked whether " it took Gawker posting the pictures to prompt the State Department to take action . "
We say , yes !
Yes , it did .
Accordingly , we 're taking the credit for getting the contract spiked .
Politico's Jim VandeHei , we 'll take our Pulitzer now , thank you very much .
TBILISI ( Reuters ) - Diggers tore into a Soviet World War Two memorial in Georgia on Thursday to make way for a new parliament in the former Soviet republic , drawing condemnation from Russia .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Pro-Western President Mikheil Saakashvili , whose country was defeated by Russia in a brief war last year , wants parliament sessions to be relocated to Georgia ’s second city of Kutaisi under an initiative to revitalize the former industrial hub .
Russia ’s defense ministry said it was “ concerned ” by the demolition of the 46 - meter - high ( 150 - feet ) concrete and bronze war memorial at the proposed construction site .
Parliament member and former prime minister Sergei Stepashin called it “ sacrilege . ”
Russia ’s Foreign Ministry said the move was “ disrespectful ” to Georgians who had fought in the Soviet army during World War Two , of whom some 300,000 were killed .
“ This is an attempt to erase from memory Georgia ’s hundreds of thousands of sons and daughters , who stood shoulder to shoulder with their brother nations , who selflessly fought on the front and gave their lives , ” it said on its website .
The dispute has echoes of Estonia in 2007 , when Russia reacted furiously to the removal of a statue of a Soviet Red Army soldier in the capital Tallinn .
Critics said the Georgian move reflected an indifference to public opinion by authorities under Saakashvili , whose rejection of the Soviet past has been his signature policy since taking power on the back of the 2003 “ Rose Revolution . ”
“ The decision to dismantle this memorial without asking the people and without asking the author of this memorial is a very good example of how our leadership ignores public opinion , ” said Georgy Akhvlediani of the opposition Christian Democrats .
NAKED HORSEMAN
One part of the monument , a statue of a naked Georgian horseman in front of the main concrete structure , has already been removed .
Authorities said it would be relocated within Kutaisi , 236 km ( 147 miles ) west of the capital Tbilisi .
City officials could not confirm Russian media reports that the main structure -- designed by Georgian sculptor Merab Berdzenishvili -- would be blown up on December 21 , the birthday of Saakashvili which he shares with Josef Stalin .
A spokeswoman for Saakashvili declined to comment when contacted by Reuters .
A Russian lawmaker said it was a crime .
“ The ... criminal nature of such evil acts must be raised at all international events , ” Alexei Ostrovsky , a committee chairman in the Duma , the lower house of Russia ’s parliament , told RIA Novosti news agency .
Relations between Russia and Georgia show no sign of improving since they fought a five - day war in August last year , when Russia crushed an assault by U.S. ally Georgia on the breakaway pro-Russian region of South Ossetia .
Tweet victory for Twitter ... the most used English word
It has become many celebrities ' favourite way to share their thoughts , however mundane , with the world .
But now internet phenomenon
Twitter has become the most popular word in the English language , according to researchers .
The microblogging website - which allows its 20 million users including Stephen Fry and Demi Moore to transmit 140 character messages across the globe instantly - beat Barack Obama into second place in a survey of the most - used phrases this year .
Twitter , which has celebrity fans such as Stephen Fry , has become the most used word in the English - speaking world
Texas - based group Global Language Monitor studied the internet and media over the past 12 months and recorded which words turned up most often .
Twitter 's surge in popularity , it has grown from 150,000 British users in 2008 to 2.6 million this year , helped it to the top spot ahead of Obama and H1N1 - the scientific term for swine flu .
Other words to enter common currency reflect the global economic crisis such as ' stimulus ' - referring to America's $ 800 billion economic aid package - and ' deficit ' .
Of the top 15 words , a further six are linked to the downturn such as ' outrage ' , ' bonus ' , and ' unemployed ' .
GLM 's Paul Payack said : ' In a year dominated by world - shaking political events , a pandemic and the aftermath of a financial tsunami , the word Twitter stands above all the others . '

In southwest Israel , at the border of Egypt and the Gaza Strip , there is a small crossing station not far from a kibbutz named Kerem Shalom .
A guard tower looms over the flat , scrubby buffer zone .
Gaza never extends more than seven miles wide , and the guards in the tower can see the Mediterranean Sea , to the north .
The main street in Gaza , Salah El - Deen Road , runs along the entire twenty - five - mile span of the territory , and on a clear night the guards can watch a car make the slow journey from the ruins of the Yasir Arafat International Airport , near the Egyptian border , toward the lights of Gaza City , on the Strip ’s northeastern side .
Observation balloons hover just outside Gaza , and pilotless drones freely cross its airspace .
Israeli patrols tightly enforce a three - mile limit in the Mediterranean and fire on boats that approach the line .
Between the sea and the security fence that surrounds the hundred and forty square miles of Gaza live a million and a half Palestinians .
Every opportunity for peace in the Middle East has been led to slaughter , and at this isolated desert crossing , on June 25 , 2006 , another moment of promise culminated in bloodshed .
The year had begun with tumult .
That January , Hamas , which the U.S. government considers a terrorist group , won Palestine ’s parliamentary elections , defeating the more moderate Fatah Party .
Both parties sent armed partisans into the streets , and Gaza verged on civil war .
Then , on June 9th , a tentative truce between Hamas and Israel ended after an explosion on a beach near Gaza City , apparently caused by an Israeli artillery shell , killed seven members of a Palestinian family , who were picnicking .
( The Israelis deny responsibility . )
Hamas fired fifteen rockets into Israel the next day .
The Israelis then launched air strikes into Gaza for several days , killing eight militants and fourteen civilians , including five children .
Amid this strife , Mahmoud Abbas — the head of Fatah , and the President of the Palestinian Authority , the governing body established by the Oslo peace accords of 1993 — put forward a bold idea .
The people of Palestine , he declared , should be given the chance to vote on a referendum for a two - state solution to its conflict with Israel .
Perhaps it was a cynical political maneuver , as the leaders of Hamas believed .
The fundamental platform of Hamas was its refusal to accept Israel ’s right to exist , yet polls showed that Palestinians overwhelmingly supported the concept of two states .
A referendum would be not only a rebuke to Hamas ; it also would be a signal to Israel — and to the rest of the world — that Palestinians were determined to make peace .
Abbas set the referendum for July .
Just before dawn on June 25th , eight Palestinian commandos crawled out of a tunnel into a grove of trees in Kerem Shalom .
A new moon was in the sky , making it the darkest night of the month .
With mortar fire and anti-tank missiles providing cover , the commandos , some of them disguised in Israeli military uniforms , split into three teams .
One team attacked an empty armored personnel carrier , which had been parked at the crossing as a decoy .
Another team hit the observation tower .
The two Israelis in the tower were injured , but not before they killed two of the attackers .
The third team shot a rocket - propelled grenade into a Merkava tank that was parked on a berm facing the security fence .
The explosion shook the tank ; then its rear hatch opened and three soldiers tried to flee .
Two of them were shot and killed , but a third , lightly wounded , was captured .
The attackers raced back into Gaza with their prize : a lanky teen - ager named Gilad Shalit .
Within days , the Israel Defense Forces , or I.D.F. , had bombed the only power station in Gaza , cutting off electricity to tens of thousands of people .
The borders were shut down as Israeli troops searched residential areas for Shalit , rounding up males older than sixteen .
On June 29th , Israeli officials arrested sixty - four senior Palestinian officials , including a third of the Palestinian cabinet and twenty members of parliament .
At least four hundred Gazans were killed over the next several months , including eighty - eight children .
The Israelis lost six soldiers and four civilians .
Israeli authorities promised not to leave the Strip until they recovered Shalit , but by November he still had not been found , and both sides declared a ceasefire .
Nothing had been resolved .
Another explosion was sure to come .
Certainly , no one was talking about peace initiatives any longer , and that may well have been the goal of those who captured Shalit .
From the Israeli perspective , at least , the Gaza problem was supposed to have been solved in August , 2005 , when Ariel Sharon , then the Prime Minister , closed down the Jewish settlements on the Strip and withdrew Israeli forces .
The international community and the Israeli left wing applauded the move .
But , almost immediately , mortar and rocket attacks from the Strip multiplied .
Five months later , Hamas won its parliament victory .
Ari Shavit , a prominent columnist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , told me recently in Jerusalem , “ We dismantled the settlements , and then we sat back and said , ‘ Let ’s have a new beginning . ’
What we got was rockets and Gilad Shalit .
People became very angry , and Shalit becomes an icon of that frustration . ”
We were sitting in Restobar , a noisy café in downtown Jerusalem .
Nearby , Shalit ’s parents and supporters maintain a tent ; from this makeshift office , they lobby for Israel to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for Shalit ’s freedom .
Shalit had just graduated from high school when he began his compulsory military service .
His father , Noam , has described him as “ a shy boy with a nervous smile and a studious disposition , ” who loved basketball and excelled in physics .
Two weeks after Shalit was captured , Hezbollah abducted two other Israeli soldiers , sparking thirty - four days of war in South Lebanon .
In that instance , the captured soldiers were already dead ; after the war , their remains were returned to Israel , in exchange for five Lebanese prisoners and the remains of hundreds of fighters .
But Shalit is presumed to be alive , and his plight has driven Israel slightly mad .
There are demonstrations , bumper stickers , and petition drives demanding his freedom .
On Web sites and in newspapers , counters chronicle how long Shalit has been in captivity .
“ Israel is obsessed with Gilad Shalit in a way that no other nation in history has been obsessed with a prisoner of war , ” Shavit said .
Gaza is a place that Israel wishes it could ignore : the territory has long had the highest concentration of poverty , extremism , and hopelessness in the region .
Gaza makes a mess of the idealized two - state solution because it is separated from the West Bank , the much larger Palestinian territory , not just physically but also culturally and politically .
In 2005 , the RAND Corporation proposed integrating a future Palestinian state with a high - speed rail and highway system that would connect the West Bank and Gaza .
Former President Jimmy Carter told me that , in 2005 , he and Ariel Sharon had agreed to promote a land swap between the Israelis and the Palestinians that would provide a corridor between the two halves of Palestine .
Such potential solutions have been poisoned by the frustration that both Israelis and West Bankers feel toward Gaza .
The political distance between the two Palestinian entities has caused many Israelis to start talking of a three - state solution , rather than two .
“ Hamas in Gaza is a fact of life until further notice , ” Yossi Alpher , a political consultant and a former Mossad officer , observed .
“ All our ideas about dealing with them have failed . ”
Shavit and other Israeli intellectuals have proposed that the Egyptians deed a portion of the Sinai to Gaza , to make the Strip more viable — “ a semi- Dubai , ” as Shavit terms it .
The Egyptians have expressed no interest .
“ Egypt ’s strategy for Gaza is to make sure it ’s Israel ’s problem , ” Alpher said .
Hamas , which was founded in Gaza during the intifada of 1987 , has come to embody the fears that many Israelis hold about the Palestinians .
Its charter declares , “ There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by jihad . ”
The document , which is in many respects absurd and reflects the intellectual isolation and conspiracy - fed atmosphere in Gaza at the time , cites the “ Protocols of the Elders of Zion , ” the anti-Semitic forgery , and links Zionism to the Freemasons , the Lions Club , and “ other spying groups ” that aim “ to violate consciences , to defeat virtues , and to annihilate Islam . ”
Part of the paradox of this conflict is that many Palestinians who firmly embrace the two - state solution have voted for Hamas .
In Restobar , Shavit pointed to a spot a few feet away .
“ In March , 2002 , there was a beautiful twenty - five - year - old girl dead on the floor , right there , ” he said .
A suicide bomber had targeted the café , which was then called Moment .
That month , eighty - three Israeli civilians were killed by Palestinians .
Jerusalem was in a panic .
Shavit was living nearby at the time , and on the night of March 9th he heard the bomb explode .
Running to the café , he saw mutilated bodies scattered on the sidewalk .
People had been blown across the street .
The dead girl was lying near the doorway .
Inside , at the bar , three young men were sitting upright on the stools , but they were all dead .
“ It was as if they were still drinking their beers , ” Shavit recalled .
Eleven Israelis died , and more than fifty were injured .
Hamas proclaimed it a “ brave attack ” intended to “ avenge the Israeli massacres against our people . ”
The Hamas attacks derailed the peace process initiated by the Oslo accords and hardened many Israelis against the Palestinian cause .
Photographs of Gazans celebrating the Moment bombing confirmed the dehumanized state of affairs .
Gaza became “ Hamastan ” in the Israeli newspapers .
In 2007 , after Hamas solidified its control of Gaza , the Israeli government declared Gaza a “ hostile entity , ” and began enforcing a blockade on a population that was already impoverished , isolated , and traumatized by years of occupation .
“ If we ’re going to talk , can we at least have the TV blaring ? ” Facebook

Email
Shopping
Hamas was not weakened by the blockade .
Instead , the collective punishment strengthened its argument that Israel wanted to eliminate the Palestinians .
The only thing that Gaza has that Israel wants is Gilad Shalit , but Hamas says that it will not free him until Israel releases fourteen hundred individuals , four hundred and fifty of whom have been convicted of terrorist killings , including the men who planned the Moment bombing .
On June 25 , 2007 , several days after Hamas took over in Gaza , the captors of Gilad Shalit released an audio recording to prove that he was still alive .
“ It has been a year since I was captured and my health is deteriorating , ” he said .
“ I am in need of prolonged hospitalization . ”
He urged the Israeli government to accept Hamas ’s demands for his release : “ Just as I have a mother and father , the thousands of Palestinian prisoners also have mothers and fathers — and their children must be returned to them . ”
Gaza is a sea of children .
The average woman there has 5.1 children , one of the highest birth rates in the world .
More than half the population is eighteen or younger .
“ We love to reproduce , ” Khalil al - Hayya , a senior Hamas official , told me on a searingly hot July day , as hundreds of young boys in green caps shouted slogans at a Hamas summer camp .
Hayya , a former professor of Islamic law , has six children ; a seventh was killed by an Israeli bomb .
There is very little for children to do in Gaza .
The Israeli blockade includes a ban on toys , so the only playthings available have been smuggled , at a premium , through tunnels from Egypt .
Islamists have shut down all the movie theatres .
Music is rare , except at weddings .
Many of Gaza ’s sports facilities have been destroyed by Israeli bombings , including the headquarters for the Palestinian Olympic team .
Only one television station broadcasts from Gaza , Al Aqsa—a Hamas - backed channel that gained notice last year for a children ’s show featuring a Mickey Mouse - like figure who was stabbed to death by an Israeli interrogator .
The mouse was replaced by a talking bee , who died after being unable to cross into Egypt for medical treatment .
The rabbit who followed the bee passed away in January , after being struck by shrapnel from an Israeli attack .
The main diversion for children is the beach , and on Fridays , after noon prayers , the shore is massed with families .
Unlike the topaz waters off Tel Aviv , here the sea is murky , a consequence of twenty million gallons of raw and partially treated sewage that is dumped offshore every day .
The main water - treatment plant is broken , and because of the blockade the spare parts that would fix it are unavailable .
Fishermen with nets wade into the surf as kids romp in the stinking waves .
Israeli authorities maintain a list of about three dozen items that they permit into Gaza , but the list is closely kept and subject to change .
Almost no construction materials — such as cement , glass , steel , or plastic pipe — have been allowed in , on the ground that such items could be used for building rockets or bunkers .
While Hamas rocket builders and bomb - makers can smuggle everything they need through the secret tunnels , international aid organizations have to account for every brick or sack of flour .
Operation Cast Lead — a three - week - long Israeli attack on Gaza , which began in December , 2008 — has left Gaza in ruins .
“ Half a year after the conflict , we do n’t have a single bag of cement and not a pane of glass , ” John Ging , the director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees , told me in July .
( Later that month , Israeli authorities announced that they would allow the U.N.R.
W.A. a limited amount of steel and cement .
Ging says that that has yet to happen . )
Humanitarian supplies that suddenly have been struck from Israel ’s list of approved items pile up in large storage warehouses outside the Kerem Shalom crossing , and international aid worth billions of dollars awaits delivery .
“ For the last two school years , Israeli officials have withheld paper for textbooks because , hypothetically , the paper might be hijacked by Hamas to print seditious materials , ” Ging complained .
( Paper was finally delivered this fall . )
When John Kerry , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , visited Gaza in February of this year , he asked why pasta was n’t allowed in .
Soon , macaroni was passing through the checkpoints , but jam was taken off the list .
According to Haaretz , the I.D.F. has calculated that a hundred and six truckloads of humanitarian relief are needed every day to sustain life for a million and a half people .
But the number of trucks coming into Gaza has fallen as low as thirty - seven .
Israeli government officials have told international aid officials that the aim is “ no prosperity , no development , no humanitarian crisis . ”
Visitors enter Gaza at its northeastern end , through the Erez Crossing — a high - security , barnlike building that is rarely congested , because scarcely any Palestinians are allowed to exit , and so few foreigners care to visit .
In 2004 , the first female suicide bomber for Hamas , Reem Riyashi , a twenty - two - year - old mother of two children , blew herself up there , killing four Israelis .
Since then , the Israeli staff has largely been replaced by security cameras and remote - controlled gates .
In Gaza , the rocky hills of Jerusalem have been ironed into a sandy plain sparsely adorned with oleander and cactus , as in South Texas .
The area near Erez used to be the region ’s industrial zone .
Until Operation Cast Lead , there were several concrete plants , a flour mill , and an ice - cream factory , but they have all been bombed or bulldozed , and the mixing trucks for the concrete have been knocked over .
Houses and mosques and shops lie in rubble ; entire neighborhoods have been demolished .
Israeli forces concentrated much of their fire , and their wrath , on northeast Gaza .
From Erez , one can easily see Sderot , the Israeli town that has suffered the most rocket attacks .
University of Florida researchers at work on a malaria elimination study in Africa have become the first to predict the spread of the disease using cell phone records .
The scientists analyzed more than 21 million calls to determine how often residents of Zanzibar travel and where they go .
A semi-autonomous region composed of two islands off the coast of Tanzania in East Africa , Zanzibar has drastically reduced malaria in recent years .
Its government commissioned the study as part of deliberations on whether to launch a total elimination campaign .
The calls indicated that most residents who leave the region make short trips to Dar es Salaam on the Tanzanian mainland nearby , where malaria is relatively uncommon .
However , they also revealed that a few Zanzibar residents travel back and forth from more distant areas of Tanzania where the risk of getting the disease is much higher -- posing the greatest threat to elimination .
" That group of the population is the real risk if Zanzibar wants to eliminate malaria , " said Andy Tatem , an assistant professor of geography , member of UF 's Emerging Pathogens Institute , and lead author of a paper on the research likely to appear in the January issue of the Malaria Journal .
" That is the population group that is likely to be continually reintroducing infection . "
Malaria is not transmissible from person to person .
But if infected elsewhere , travelers can be bitten by mosquitoes once back in Zanzibar -- and those mosquitoes could then fly on to bite and infect other Zanzibar residents , forestalling elimination .
Over the past decade , Zanzibar 's aggressive campaign against malaria has reduced infections from as much as 40 percent of its 1.2 million people to less than 1 percent , Tatem said .
The country is weighing the cost of a campaign to eliminate the disease against the cost of continuing indefinitely with the control measures now in place .
Its government commissioned what Tatem described as Africa 's first " elimination feasibility study , " including the travel research .

Most Zanzibar residents journey to and from mainland Tanzania via four - to six - hour ferry trips , but records of their origin and destinations are poor , Tatem said .
Inspired by recent cell phone - based epidemiological research in Europe , he and five colleagues obtained records of three months of calls from customers of the Zanzibar Telephone Company , which covers all of Zanzibar and Tanzania .
The October - December 2008 records , which contained no names or other identifying information , tracked the movements of a 770,369 customers by showing each customer 's calls and where the calls originated -- or at least the region where the call originated .
So , for example , the researchers could see that a person made calls from Zanzibar 's main city of Stone Town Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday , but on Thursday and Friday from Dar es Salaam .
Most callers never left Zanzibar , which means they posed no threat of reintroducing the Malaria parasite , Tatem said .
About 12 percent did leave the islands , but most of those only visited relatively safe Dar es Salaam , and usually for just one or two days at a time .
However , a few hundred residents made trips to regions of western and southern parts of Tanzania , where as many as 40 percent of the residents have the malaria parasite .
The cell records did not reveal any information about the threat from non-residents visiting Zanzibar .
Many visitors to the historic center of the spice trade are likely to be tourists who either come from countries where malaria is not a problem or are taking anti-malarial drugs , so pose little threat for malaria importation .
However , mainland residents visiting for work may carry infections , so future work will need to assess these risks too , Tatem said .
Tatem said the study gives Zanzibar 's government several options should it move forward with elimination .
The government could choose to give Zanzibar residents prophylactics against malaria before they travel , or it could screen all residents as they return , both very expensive propositions .
Or it could launch a targeted information and / or screening campaign aimed at the high - risk travelers .
Zanzibar will use the study in combination with another study -- of the challenges and costs of eliminating the remaining infections within the country -- to make its decision .
" Going for elimination can be very expensive , much more expensive than continuing with current sustained control , involving giving people bed nets ( to protect against mosquito bites at night ) , spraying the inside of houses with insecticide and providing anti-malarial drugs , " he said .
" But in the very long term the savings having no malaria may outweigh those costs . "
Spiders are not insects , as most of us think so , and we try to imitate their silk , which has amazing properties .
It is five times more powerful than steel and extremely elastic , stretching by 30 % more than nylon ( 2 - 4 times before breaking off ) .
Still , it does not vibrate like an elastic web for circus jumps , as it would throw away the spider 's food , and it does not get soaked during a rainfall .
A fishing web made of spider silk , with fibers having the thickness of a pencil , would stop a passenger plane .
There are spider species that can produce even 7 types of silk !
But , many spiders are far away from the image we all have about spiders , and some have really amazing properties .
1. Scuba diving has been invented by a spider !
The diving bell spider ( Argyroneta aquatica ) , 9 - 15 mm long , has the body covered by very fine and dense small hairs and lives in vegetated , fresh , not running water .
But , it cannot breathe like fish through gills and must get oxygen from the atmosphere .
This means it has to continuously go to the surface , interrupting its lurk and drawing the attention of its prey .
That 's why the spider has invented " scuba diving " to solve the issue .
Argyroneta uses its silk fibers to make a sack for collecting air , while underwater !
The spider binds a few stems of aquatic plants , and weaves its small bell mouth downward , giving it the form and the size of a thimble , made of fine , resistant fibers , well entangled amongst them , so that it can not be crossed by water .
When the sack is ready , the spider goes to the surface .
With the belly upside down , it crosses its last pair of feet , catching a few air bubbles between them and the very fine hair from the top of the abdomen .
The spider goes to the sack with the air bubbles and , at the top of the bell , it detaches the bubbles .
After many such kind of movements , the bell is full of air .
As the bell is very light now , it can detach , gushing to the surface , so the spider attaches it with numerous threads to the surrounding plants , like the aerostasts , fixed by strong ropes not to take flight .
When the oxygen in the air of the bell has been depleted , the spider tears the balloon .
The air goes to the surface and , patiently , the spider darns the bell and again fills it with fresh air .
With the air reserves ‘ at hand ’ , the spider starts lurking , while his breathing organs , located in the abdomen , are inserted inside the bell , its prey being made of insect larvae , water fleas and cyclops .
From the bell there start various alarm fibers .
The spiders stay with their feet leaned on these fibers and detect if an animal has touched one fiber , gushing rapidly , catching and paralyzing it with its toxic saliva .
The paralyzed prey will be brought into the bell and consumed there , with the spider in an upside down position .
For laying eggs , the female makes a special bell , split in two chambers : in the upper one , with the tip outside the water are laid the eggs , while in the lower chamber lives the mother guarding the eggs .
At 5 days old , offspring can make the bells by themselves .
During the winter , the spider closes the bell completely , wintering inside its submarine .
Some hide into the empty snail shells and cover them with a water - proof silk tap .
This spider has quite a painful bite .
2 . There are ... flying spiders !
What they do is actually ... ballooning !
They fabric from silk their ... aircrafts !
Thousands of flying money spiders from the Linyphiidae family can flood a terrain on the right days , using their " dragline " silk thread to take on the air .
Their ballooning is influenced by wind speed and sunshine .
The silk thread is carried by the wind , while the owners clang to the lower extremity .
The wind pushes on the thread while the sun heat forms updrafts for the take - off .
3 . All spiders have a venomous bite .
The effect of this venom varies from totally inoffensive for humans to nasty , painful , and even deadly , in the case of the black widows .
But , the powerful venom of the Brazilian wandering spider ( Phoneutria nigriventer ) does more than sending you to a hospital : it induces hours - long erection .
The toxins induce general pain and higher blood pressure , but also this uncomfortable erection .
The active compound is a peptide ( short protein ) named Tx2 - 6 .
When injected in rats , the animals experienced a significant raise in penis blood pressure and nitric oxide levels within corpora cavernosa , the two cylinders made of spongy tissues running along the penis .
The nitric oxide controls the neuronal pathway of an erection .
The cGMP enzyme makes the smooth muscles of the penis , corpora cavernosa , relax , so that the blood fills up this tissue , expanding it ( till about 10 times more in humans ) .
But , the PDE - 5 breaks down the cGMP , putting an end to the fiesta : the smooth muscles contract and the blood goes out of the penis , which turns back to its limp state .
Viagra , Cialis and Levtra act exactly against PDE - 5 . Tx2 - 6 works differently : by raising the nitric oxide levels .
4. Promiscuity is widespread amongst spiders , and the question is : if your girl cheats on you , would you break off your penis to impede her ?
Spiders do it , in the so - called sex war and sperm competition .
In the wasp spiders , the males simply place a chastity belt on their partner while copulating : the tip of their genital breaks off during sexual contact , plugging the sexual orifice of the female .
The male wasp spider is much smaller than the female , and after starting the intercourse , few seconds later the female attacks her partner , and if it does not manage a quick escape , it will die .
In fact , this is common amongst spiders : the ( sometimes much ) larger female eats the male .
( In order not to fall victims to their sweeties , in many species , the males deliver to their partners a large fly , which will keep them occupied ) .
In over 80 % of cases , the tip of the penis breaks off , remaining in the sexual orifice of the female like a cork , blocking it .
This mechanism ensures that paternity is maintained , preventing or impeding further copulation by the female , acting like a chastity belt .
The first male ensures this way that all the egg cells will be fertilized by it .
When the female genitalia is plugged , the male copulates only for 8 seconds ; otherwise it takes twice longer .
The dwarf spider secrets a viscous stuff in its genital , which it ejects after ejaculation , to make a cork impeding further copulations .
When these two mechanisms of stopping sperm competition are present , the females lay eggs through a separate aperture .
Spider species , with only one aperture for copulation and oviposition , do not have such contraceptive strategies .
5 . Some spiders have an innate artistic sense , like the St. Andrew 's cross spiders ( Argiope spiders ) , which have beautifully adorned webs with zigzag and spiral patterns .
The meaning of the patterned web of Argiope has been a puzzle till recent researches proved that adorned webs caught 60 % more insects , but also attracted more spider predators : 70 % more parasitic wasps .
6 . Ultraviolet light may harm organisms if it is in excess , but spiders can be turned on by it .
People and mammals , in general , ca n't detect ultraviolet light , but for jumping spiders it is essential for their mating .
These spiders do not weave a web .
Both male and female jumping spiders have markings on their faces and legs that glow in ultraviolet light , males being generally more colorful than females .
Tests made with full sun-light spectrum , which compasses UV , triggered in males and females the courtship behaviors ( which included bent legs and hunched or flexed abdomens ) .
Visual spectrum missing UV light left both females and males indifferent to each other .
Placing just males in UV light triggered the females ' courtship ritual , but 16 of 20 males ignored the females , who could not reflect UV light .
Placing just females in UV light produced the opposite : the males started the mating behavior to the glowing females , but 10 of the 12 females remained indifferent .
7 . You may have heard about ghost fishes or ghost crabs , but there are also ghost spiders , too .
The ghost spider ( Anyphaena californica ) lives in southern US and gets its name from the translucent look of its body .
8 . The spiders of the genus Myrmecium , encountered only in South America , mimic the ants so well , that most people cannot make the difference .
This way , these spiders are gaining protection from predators , through their resemblance to aggressive or unpalatable ants .
9 . The weirdest looking spiders are the spiny orb - weavers ( genus Gasteracantha ) .
Females are measured in centimeters , while the males in millimeters ( but this is common amongst spiders ) .
These spider females are really heavy , having the most varied and weirdest pattern of prominent spines and largely varying in shape abdomen .
From spike to spike , they can measure 3 cm ( 1.2 in ) in diameter .
A very similar look have the Australian spiders of the genus Austracantha , only that these species are smaller , having less than 1 cm ( 0.4 in ) .
10 .
You know that spiders are solitary creatures .
But , some spiders can have a complicated social life , forming colonies made of males and females .
The colonies weave common webs , which can have 7 m ( 23 ft ) in diameter , like spiders from Uloboridae family .
Such a colony harbors thousands of spiders .
In the case of these spiders , each individual has its own hunting net .
But , spiders of the genus Theridion ( family Theridiidae ) act like a team .
The colony members wait for passing prey concealed under the edge of a leaf or stick with threads trailing down beneath them .
If an insect gets stuck into the web , the spiders respond en masse , overwhelming it as a team .
They can even pull large victims back to their lair .
11 . The Australian spiders of the genus Phonognatha use silk in order to weave themselves a shelter from a leaf .
The leaf is rolled in spiral and secured with silk fibers , so that it does not unroll .
The shelter can also be made of paper , in urban areas , or even of snail shells .
The shelter is inserted on the spider 's web .
During the day , the spider rests inside the leaf , and during the night , when there are more insects , it stalks at the entrance of the shelter .
12 . The males of the Australian Peacock spiders ( Maratus species ) have red , blue and black colored flap - like extensions of the abdomen with white hairs that can be folded down , employed for display during mating : the male expands and raises the flaps so that the abdomen gets a white circular fringe .
This is very similar to what peacocks do .

crickets ... with few exceptions .
Essentially , if you are poor , Native American , a woman in the military ... tough .
History :
In 1973 , when abortion first became legal nationwide , poor women could obtain coverage for abortion through the Medicaid program .
Medicaid is the government health program for low - income people in the United States .
Between 1973 and 1977 , almost any woman who needed an abortion could obtain one , regardless of her ability to pay .
But in 1976 Congress passed the Hyde Amendment , banning federal Medicaid funding for abortion .
Since that time , federal Medicaid has paid for virtually no abortions .
Thirty - three states have also banned state Medicaid funding for abortion .
Women Are Denied the Right to Abortion
Bans on Medicaid funding for abortion deny the right to abortion to thousands of women and most severely affect poor women , women of color , and young women .
The cost of a first - trimester abortion can be more than half of what a poverty - level family lives on in a month .
Poor women and girls often delay their abortions as they try to scrape together the money they need .
These delays can force them into more expensive and complicated second - trimester abortions .
Sometimes , they never get the money they need .
As many as one in three poor women who would obtain an abortion if Medicaid covered it are instead forced to continue the pregnancy .
Congress also denies abortion coverage to many other women who rely on federal health plans : women in the U.S. military and Peace Corps , federal employees , disabled women , federal prisoners , Native American women covered by the Indian Health Service , and residents of the District of Columbia
.
My own NY State organization , New York Abortion Access Fund ( NYAAF ) is really hurting for cash .
It has been a tough year for the New York Abortion Access Fund ( NYAAF ) .
The nationwide economic downturn and upsurge in unemployed and uninsured Americans have lead to a rise in demand for our services .
More and more we are getting calls not just from clinics , but directly from women asking for help to pay for an abortion .
This increase in the numbers and types of requests we receive means we are reaching a wider population of women and families than ever before .
It also requires more time and effort .
Our all - volunteer board is stretched thin responding to requests for funding , referring women to clinics that can serve them and negotiating with those clinics to provide the most timely and affordable services possible .
The women NYAAF serves are ones who might otherwise slip through the cracks , including those who make just a little too much to qualify for public assistance , who do not qualify due to immigration status , who live in states that do not help cover the cost of abortion , or who face emergency situations that do not leave them enough time to apply for government help .
The emergencies , of course , are the most expensive .
Last month , we helped a fifteen - year - old rape victim pay for a procedure that required hospital treatment .
Arranging for her care took more than ten phone calls , countless emails and hours of negotiation .
We contacted every known source of abortion funding for which this young woman qualified and every time heard the same message : we are out of money , please call back later .
In the end , the doctor involved in the case waived the usual fee and NYAAF agreed to pay the remaining hospital costs : $ 4000 .
We were able to make that pledge and save that young woman ?s life because we had the funds on hand and a mechanism in place to get them quickly to where they needed to go .
But that pledge nearly drained our remaining 2009 budget , and in order to meet the demand for our assistance in 2010 , we need your help .

But I have to be honest .
I find the current outrage round here a little too loud and too late .

They have few advocates .

If you 've already given , or done a fund - raiser , or signed the petition , or helped some woman less fortunate than you are right now , this diary is n't addressed to you .
I remember the coat hanger days .
I knew women who could afford to go out of the country to get abortions .
I knew women who could n't , used back - ally methods and died .
So before you comment , do n't even raise my being sympathetic towards Stupak .

Another tidbit from Rosenberg , who offers guidance on what the Fed means when it says it will keep rates low for an “ extended period ” …
FED CAN’T RAISE RATES UNTIL AFTER 2011
The reason — there is a wave of mortgage refinancings coming in the housing market for one , and not only that , but in the commercial space , there are $ 2.7 trillion of debt coming due through 2011 and another $ 1.5 trillion of leveraged loans … .
In other words , the default rate is going to rise even further and the Fed tightening policy would only aggravate that situation .
In other words , the Fed is simply immobile for at least the next two years .
I ’ve argued in this space many times that the Fed is trapped .
Our monetary system , which is fueled by credit expansion , simply does n’t work in reverse .
To avoid deflation , credit must always be expanding in the aggregate .
If the private sector wo n’t borrow , the public sector must …. and vice versa .
If they de-lever in tandem , we get deflation .
We ’re told to be panicked by the prospect of deflation and yet the solution we ’ve been given — unprecedented public credit expansion + inflation of new asset bubble — leaves us worse off than when we started .
Alan Greenspan ’s 1 % interest rates inflated a disastrous credit bubble .
We think 0 % rates and quantitative easing will lead to a different result ?
“ If you looked at a transcript afterward , it might seem clear that you had won the debate on points , ” he said .
“ But somehow , with members of the audience , you always seemed to come off as elite , and Milton seemed to have won the day . ”
Mr. Samuelson said he had never regarded Keynesianism as a religion , and he criticized some of his liberal colleagues for seeming to do so , earning himself , late in life , the label “ l’enfant terrible emeritus . ”
The experience of nations in the second half of the century , he said , had diminished his optimism about the ability of government to perform miracles .
If government gets too big , and too great a portion of the nation ’s income passes through it , he said , government becomes inefficient and unresponsive to the human needs “ we do - gooders extol , ” and thus risks infringing on freedoms .
But , he said , no serious political or economic thinker would reject the fundamental Keynesian idea that a benevolent democratic government must do what it can to avert economic trouble in areas the free markets cannot .
Neither government alone nor the markets alone , he said , could serve the public welfare without help from the other .
As nations became locked in global competition , and as the computerization of the workplace created daunting employment problems , he agreed with the economic conservatives in advocating that American corporations must stay lean and efficient and follow the general dictates of the free market .
But he warned that the harshness of the marketplace had to be tempered and that corporate downsizing and the reduction of government programs “ must be done with a heart . ”
Despite his celebrated accomplishments , Mr. Samuelson preached and practiced humility .
The M.I.T. economics department became famous for collegiality , in no small part because no one else could play prima donna if Mr. Samuelson refused the role , and , of course , he did .
Economists , he told his students , as Churchill said of political colleagues , “ have much to be humble about . ”
Who do you turn to when you want to blow wide open the conspiracy that is global warming ?
That 's right .
Jesse " The Body " Ventura — the man who has variously been a special forces operative , motorcycle gang member , WWF wrestler and governor of Minnesota , and who now promotes himself as a seeker of the " truth " in a new TV show called Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura .
Having completed the job of exposing the 9/11 conspiracy in the previous episode of the series for the US cable network truTV ( slogan : " Not Reality .
Actuality " ) , last week Ventura set his investigative sights on global warming .
In just 60 minutes , he proved once and for all that we 've all been duped by a small cabal of profiteers obsessed with creating a new world order .
The whole scam , according to Ventura and his team of investigators who interview a smorgasbord of expert witnesses , can be pinned on just two men — Sir Maurice Strong , a former UN bigwig , and Edmond de Rothschild , the late billionaire banker .
They , the programme alleges , dreamt up the whole thing and duped the world into believing that carbon emissions are driving up global temperatures just so they could profit from carbon trading .
Quite a bold claim , so you would expect the programme to be positively dripping in hard evidence of such skulduggery .
Ah , that 's where things begin to unravel a little for Ventura .
The programme is , in fact , little more than an unchallenged airing for a veritable Who 's Who of climate scepticism .
This is probably the most blatantly one - sided " documentary " on climate change since filmmaker Martin Durkin 's now - notorious Great Global Warming Swindle first aired in 2007 .
That Martin Durkin himself appears in Ventura 's investigation as an expert witness speaks volumes .
But joining Durkin in this hit job are MIT 's sceptic - in - chief Richard Lindzen , Newsbuster 's Noel Shepard ( although he 's just described as an " investigative reporter " ) , right - wing shock jock and PrisonPlanet.com editor Alex Jones , and , of course , Viscount Monckton of Brenchley , who boldly testifies that there has been collusion between government officials , scientists and businessmen to develop the theory of global warming simply in order to make money .
Little , if any , room is given throughout the programme to airing any defence of the accused .
Instead , the programme takes on the veneer of an undercover cop show , with frankly hilarious scenes in which Ventura and his investigators are seen meeting shadowy characters in car parks and warehouses to receive tip - offs about who to chase down .
One scene in particular will divert the attention of any British viewer .
In a mystifying bit of casting , June Sarpong is hired as one of Ventura 's investigators to interview a scientist who is living incognito in the " wilderness " for fear of his life because he holds the view that the sun , not carbon emissions , is driving global temperatures up .
To the uninitiated , Sarpong is best known in the UK as a former presenter of a youth entertainment programme called T4 , who has interviewed , among others , Tony Blair and Al Gore ( who , unsurprisingly , is one of the targets in Ventura 's programme ) .
In 2007 , she was awarded an MBE for " services to broadcasting and charity " .
What 's more , she co-hosted the UK leg of Live Earth from Wembley Stadium in 2007 and her website says that her production company Lipgloss Productions has a TV series about climate change " in the pipeline " .
All of which begs the question : what on earth led her to get involved in this transparent piece of unsubstantiated propaganda ?
Now in drinkable , no -mess tea form , it 's BACON !
This black tea is comprised of smoky , ' bacony ' lapsang souchong , blended with a hint of apple and caramel flavored Ceylon teas , to recreate the taste of sugar - cured , apple - wood smoked bacon that you crave in the morning .

Images of the Prophet are considered blasphemous by Muslims .

The CRU e-mails have revealed how the normal conventions of the peer review process appear to have been compromised by a team * of global warming scientists , with the willing cooperation of the editor of the International Journal of Climatology ( IJC ) , Glenn McGregor .
The team spent nearly a year preparing and publishing a paper that attempted to rebut a previously published paper in IJC by Douglass , Christy , Pearson , and Singer ( DCPS ) .
The DCPS paper , reviewed and accepted in the traditional manner , had shown that the IPCC models that predicted significant " global warming " in fact largely disagreed with the observational data .
We will let the reader judge whether this team effort , revealed in dozens of e-mails and taking nearly a year , involves inappropriate behavior , including ( a ) unusual cooperation between authors and editor , ( b ) misstatement of known facts , ( c ) character assassination , ( d ) avoidance of traditional scientific give - and - take , ( e ) using confidential information , ( f ) misrepresentation ( or misunderstanding ) of the scientific question posed by DCPS , ( g ) withholding data , and more .
* The team is a group of climate scientists who frequently collaborate and publish papers which often support the hypothesis of human - caused global warming .
For this essay , the leading team members include Ben Santer , Phil Jones , Timothy Osborn , and Tom Wigley , with lesser roles for several others .

This story uses various " CRU e- mails " and our own personal knowledge of events and issues .
References will be made to items in an appendix that are arranged chronologically .
The e-mails have an index number which comes from a compilation at http://www.eastangliaemails.com/index.php .
2 . The story
Our record of this story begins when Andrew Revkin , a reporter for the New York Times , sends three team members an e-mail [ 30 Nov 2007 ] with the page proofs of the DCPS paper .
This is a week before the online publication .
The subject of Revkin 's email --
sorry to take your time up , but really do need a scrub of singer / christy / etc effort
-- implies prior correspondence .
Team member Mears quickly responds with an e-mail to fellow team members Jones , Santer , Thorne , Sherwood , Lanzante , Taylor , Seidel , Free , and Wentz [ 4 Dec 2007 ] .
Santer replies to all :
I 'm forwarding this to you in confidence .
We all knew that some journal , somewhere , would eventually publish this stuff .
Turns out that it was the International Journal of Climatology .
Santer knows this because he reviewed and rejected the DCPS paper when it was previously submitted to another journal .
Phil Jones responds to Santer :
It sure does !
Have read briefly -- the surface arguments are wrong .
I know editors have difficulty finding reviewers , but letting this one pass is awful -- and IJC was improving .
This exchange provides the first reference to the International Journal of Climatology .
The next day ( 5 Dec 2007 -- the day the DCPS paper appeared on - line ) , Santer sends an e-mail to Peter Thorne with copies to Carl Mears , Leopold Haimberger , Karl Taylor , Tom Wigley , Phil Jones , Steve Sherwood , John Lanzante , Dian Seidel , Melissa Free , Frank Wentz , and Steve Klein .
Santer says ,
Peter , I think you 've done a nice job in capturing some of my concerns about the Douglass et al. paper ... I do n't think it 's a good strategy to submit a response to the Douglass et al. paper to the International Journal of Climatology ( IJC ) .
As Phil [ Jones ] pointed out , IJC has a large backlog , so it might take some time to get a response published .
Furthermore , Douglass et al. probably would be given the final word . [ TL1 ]
The most critical point throughout these emails is the goal of preventing DCPS from providing what is considered normal in the peer - reviewed literature : an opportunity to respond to their critique , or as they put it , " be given the final word . "
One wonders if there is ever a " final word " in science , as the authors here seem to imply .
The next day ( 6 Dec 2007 ) , Melissa Free responds with a cautious note , evidently because she had presented a paper with Lanzante and Seidel at an American Meteorological Society conference ( 18th Conference on Climate Variability and Change ) acknowledging the existence of a discrepancy between observations and models -- the basic conclusion of the DCPS paper .
What about the implications of a real model - observation difference for upper -air trends ?
Is this really so dire ?
Santer responds ( 6 Dec 2007 ) with the key reason for attacking DCPS :
What is dire is Douglass et al .'s willful neglect of any observational datasets that do not support their arguments .
This " willful neglect " of " observational datasets " refers to the absence of two balloon datasets , RAOBCORE v1.3 and v1.4 .
( DCPS explain in an addendum that these data sets are faulty .
See below . )
A further e-mail from Jones ( 6 Dec 2007 ) discusses options to beat DCPS into print .
Wigley enters ( 10 Dec 2007 ) to accuse DCPS of " fraud " and that under " normal circumstances , " this would " cause him [ Douglass ] to lose his job . "
We remind the reader that DCPS went through traditional , anonymous peer review with iterations to satisfy the reviewers and without communicating outside proper channels with the editor and reviewers .
Tim Osborn , a colleague of Jones at CRU and a member of the editorial board of IJC , inserts himself into the process , declaring a bias on the issue and stating that Douglass 's previous papers " appear to have serious problems . "
Santer responds with gratitude for the " heads up , " again making the claim that DCPS ignored certain balloon datasets .
As noted below , DCPS did not use these datasets because they were known to be faulty .
On this day ( 12 Dec 2007 ) , an unsigned report appeared on RealClimate.org attacking DCPS , especially about not using RAOBCORE 1.4 .
This prompted the DCPS authors to submit an Addendum to IJC on 3 Jan 2008 to explain in one page two issues : ( 1 ) the reason for not using RAOBCORE 1.4 and ( 2 ) explaining the experimental design to show why using the full spread of model results to compare with observations ( as Santer et al. would do ) would lead to wrong conclusions about the relationship between trends in the upper air temperature versus the surface -- see Appendix A. ( A copy of the addendum may be found at http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~douglass . )
Osborn ( 10 Jan 2008 ) , writing to Santer and Jones , then discusses the " downside " of the normal comment - reply process , in which DCPS would be given an " opportunity to have a response . "
He explains that he has contacted the editor , Glenn McGregor , to " see what he can do . "
According to Osborn , McGregor " promises to do everything he can to achieve a quick turn - around . "
He also says :
( and please treat this in confidence , which is why I emailed to you and Phil only ) that he [ McGregor ] may be able to hold back the hardcopy ( i.e. the print / paper version ) appearance of Douglass et al. , possibly so that any accepted Santer et al. comment could appear alongside it .
He [ McGregor ] also intends to " correct the scientific record " and to identify in " advance reviewers who are both suitable and available , " perhaps including " someone on the email list you 've been using . "
Given the bias of Osborn and McGregor as expressed in the emails , one could wonder what it means to be a " suitable " reviewer of the Santer paper .
Santer responds with his conditions , highlighting the intent that he must have the " last word " .
1 ) Our paper should be regarded as an independent contribution , not as a
comment on Douglass et al. ...
2) If IJC agrees to 1 ) , then Douglass et al. should have the opportunity
to respond to our contribution , and we should be given the chance to
reply .
Any response and reply should be published side - by - side , in the
same issue of IJC .
I 'd be grateful if you and Phil could provide me with some guidance on
1 ) and 2 ) , and on whether you think we should submit to IJC .
Feel free
to forward my email to Glenn McGregor .
This Osborn e-mail and response by Santer essentially lays out the publication strategy apparently agreed to by Santer , Jones , Osborn , and editor McGregor .
Santer accepts Osborn as a conduit and defines the conditions ( having the " last word " ) .
This is exactly what he seeks to deny for DCPS , who published the original paper in this sequence in IJC .
DCPS are never informed of this process , which specifically addresses our paper , nor are we contacted for an explanation on any point raised in these negotiations .
Santer 's allegations regarding DCPS and his conditions for publication are simply accepted .
One wonders that if the results of DCPS were so obviously and demonstrably in error , why would anyone fear a response by DCPS ?
See Appendix A .
A new development occurs on this day ( 10 Jan 2008 ) as Jones tells the team ( Wigley , K. Taylor , Lanzante , Mears , Bader , Zwiers , Wentz , Haimberger , Free , MacCracken , Jones , Sherwood , Klein , Solomon , Thorne , Osborn , Schmidt , and Hack ) a " secret " he learns from Osborn : that one of the recipients on the Santer e-mail list is one of the original reviewers of DCPS who did not reject the article .
The problem !!
The person who said they would leave it to the editor 's discretion is on your email list !
I do n't know who it is - Tim does - maybe they have told you ?
I do n't want to put pressure on Tim .
He does n't know I 'm sending this .
It is n't me by the way - nor Tim !
Tim said it was someone who has n't contributed to the discussion - which does narrow the possibilities down !
Does Santer start wondering who the original reviewer is ?
Does Osborn reveal this part of McGregor 's secret ?
Then , on the matter of paying for expensive color plots , Jones adds , " I 'm sure I can lean on Glenn [ McGregor ] " to evidently deal with the costs .
Obviously , this was not offered to DCPS .
The final approval of the strategy ( Santer 's conditions ) to deny DCPS an opportunity to respond in the normal way is acknowledged by Osborn to Santer and Jones ( 11 Jan 2008 ) in that Osborn writes that McGregor , as editor , is " prepared to treat it as a new submission rather than a comment on Douglass et al. " and " my [ McGregor 's ] offer of a quick turn around time etc. still stands . "
Osborn also reminds Santer and Jones of the potential impropriety of this situation :
... the only thing I did n't want to make more generally known was the suggestion that print publication of Douglass et al. might be delayed ... all other aspects of this discussion are unrestricted ...
Santer now informs the team that the strategy has been agreed to ( 11 Jan 2008 ) .
DCPS were never notified of these machinations , and it is clear that Santer 's story of the situation was never investigated independently .
In this long e-mail , the issues of radiosonde errors is discussed and the fact one dataset , RAOBCORE v1.4 , is missing from DCPS .
To explain briefly , Sakamoto and Christy ( SC09 , accepted in 2008 and appearing in 2009 ) looked closely at the ERA - 40 Reanlayses on which RAOBCORE v1.3 and v1.4 were based .
SC09 demonstrated that a spurious warming shift occurred in 1991 ( a problem with a satellite channel : HIRS 11 ) , which was then assimilated into RAOBCORE , producing spurious positive trends in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere .
SC09 had been working on this since 2006 when they first met , so they were aware of the problems at that time .
Sherwood later comments ( 27 May 2008 ) on this evidence during the deliberations of Santer 's publication , so the team was aware of the problem , too .
Even though Santer had seen the DCPS addendum ( sent to him by McGregor ) with the explanation of the RAOBCORE problems as early as 10 Apr 2008 , their published paper contains the statement :
Although DCPS07 had access to all three RAOBCORE versions , they presented results from v1.2 only ...
Another interesting comment here is that Santer does " NOT " want to " show the most recent radiosonde [ balloon ] results " from Hadley Center and Sherwood 's IUK ( i.e. , withholding data that does not support his view ) .
The reason is likely that these two datasets , extended out in time , provide even stronger evidence in favor of DCPS .
The final paper cuts off these datasets in 1999 .
Douglass becomes concerned that he has not heard a response from McGregor on the Addendum sent on 3 Jan 2008 .
He writes on 1 Apr 2008 as to the status of the Addendum .
On 10 April 2008 , McGregor responds that he has " great difficulty locating [ the ] addendum . "
Douglass responds with the file number sent back to Douglass from IJC defining the event on 3 Jan but attaches the Addendum again .
This was obviously successful because that very day ( 10 Apr 2008 ) , McGregor sends the Addendum to Santer to " learn your views . "
Santer is afforded the opportunity to comment on the DCPS Addendum .
DCPS never hear from McGregor again concerning the Addendum .
McGregor informs
Santer that he has received one set of comments ( 24 Apr 2008 ) and though he
... would normally wait for all comments to come in before providing them to you , I thought in this case I would give you a head start in your preparation of revisions .
-- Santer informs the team of the situation ( 24 Apr 2008 ) .
One wonders if there was any possibility that Santer 's paper could have been rejected , given the many favors already extended to this submission .
McGregor now knows in the Addendum what the core response to Santer et al. might be , yet he evidently drops it from consideration .
At this point , DCPS are unaware of a response by Santer , as they were dealing with the RealClimate.org blog with this matter .
Santer is worried about the lack of " urgency " in receiving the remaining reviews and complains to McGregor ( 5 May 2008 ) .
He reminds McGregor that Osborn had agreed to the strategy that the " process would be handled as expeditiously as possible . "
McGregor hopes that the further comments will come within " 2 weeks " or so .
Osborn writes to McGregor on the next day ( 6 May 2008 ) that Santer 's ninety - page article was much more than anticipated , implying that Santer is being rather demanding , considering how much has been done to aid him .
One wonders why it should take ten months and ninety pages to show that any paper contained a " serious flaw " and why Santer et al. needed to be protected from a response .
A paper by Thorne now appears in Nature Geosciences which referenced the as - yet - unpublished paper by Santer et al. ( including Thorne ) .
Douglass writes to Thorne ( 26 May 2008 ) asking for a copy and is told ( 27 May 2008 _A ) that he cannot do so because Santer is the first author .
Douglass ( 27 May 2008 _B ) points out to Thorne Nature 's ethics policy --
NATURE JOURNALS ' POLICIES ON PUBLICATION ETHICS
Availability of data and materials
" An inherent principle of publication is that others should be able to replicate and build upon the authors ' published claims .
Therefore , a condition of publication in a Nature journal is that authors are required to make materials , data and associated protocols available .. "
-- and asks again for a copy of the paper .
At the same time , Douglass asks Santer for a copy ( 27 May 2008 _C ) .
Santer responds by saying , " I see no conceivable reason why I should now send you an advance copy of my IJoC paper . "
From the e-mails , we now know that the Santer et al. manucsript had not been accepted at this point , though it was cited in a Nature Geosciences article .
What is very curious is that in the e-mail , Santer claims that Douglass did
... not have the professional courtesy to provide me with any advance information about your 2007 IJoC paper ...
In fact , Santer had been a reviewer of this paper when it had been submitted earlier , so he was in possession of the material ( only slightly changed ) for at least a year .
Additionally , Santer received a copy of the DCPS page proofs about a week before it even appeared online .
In further e-mail exchanges the next day ( 28 May 2008 ) the author team discusses this uncomfortable situation of having a citation in Nature Geosciences and being unable to provide the paper to the public before " a final decision on the paper has been reached . "
Santer states they should " resubmit our revised manuscript to IJoC as soon as possible , " which implies that Douglass 's point about the ethics policies of Nature , which likely requires the availability of cited literature , may put them in jeopardy .
Santer writes to Jones ( 10 July 2008 ) that the two subsequent reviews are in , but reviewer number two was " somewhat crankier . "
Santer indicates that McGregor has told him that he will not resend the coming revised manuscript to the " crankier " reviewer in another apparent effort by McGregor to accommodate Santer .
Conclusion
On 21 July 2008 , Santer hears that his paper is formally accepted and expresses his sincere gratitude to Osborn for " all your help with the tricky job of brokering the submission of the paper to IJoC . "
Osborn responds that " I 'm not sure that I did all that much . "
On 10 Oct 2008 , the Santer et al. paper is published online .
Thirty - six days later Santer et al. appears in print , immediately following DCPS , who have waited now over eleven months for their paper to appear in print .
The strategy of delaying DCPS and not allowing DCPS to have a simultaneous response to Santer et al. has been achieved .
Brock Lesnar is so sick , he 'll be going to the Mayo Clinic so doctors can figure out what to do -- but it will probably require major surgery ... UFC Prez Dana White tells TMZ .
White tells us Lesnar -- the UFC heavyweight champ -- is " very , very sick " with some sort of intestinal disorder , although listening to White , it sounds a lot more serious than that .
White says the condition will require " major surgery . "
White is going to visit Lesnar in the hospital and is trying to get him transferred to the Mayo Clinic , one of the most renowned medical facilities in the world .
White says Lesnar -- formerly of the WWE -- was diagnosed with mono more than a week ago and was " bummed out " that he had to cancel the fight and went to Canada to rest .
White says Lesnar collapsed in Canada a week ago today and has been hospitalized ever since .
White acknowledges the current condition is not mono but he will not be specific .
White says the condition is not HIV or cancer .
And ,
White tells TMZ , " There 's a possibility Lesnar will never fight again . "
Many Americans dread April 15 , the deadline for filing their income tax returns .
But some well - heeled people are trembling over another looming tax day : Oct. 15 .
Thursday is the deadline for Americans to come clean about the money they have hidden offshore , in places like Swiss bank accounts .
No one can say with certainty how much money is out there  the accounts are secret  but the hoard may be tens of billions of dollars .
Several thousand wealthy people have come forward , hoping to avoid large fines or possibly even prison .
But many others are still weighing their options .
The choice is stark :
They can confess and pay the penalties , or gamble that they will not get caught .
With the deadline only days away , tax lawyers say they are being inundated by anxious clients .
“ We ’re seeing a flood of people , ” said Scott D. Michel , a tax lawyer in Washington .
His firm , Caplin & Drysdale , has 350 clients who are preparing to report their offshore accounts to the Internal Revenue Service .
The firm has 14 lawyers handling their cases , one of which involves a tax bill of hundreds of millions of dollars .

Swiss banks could pay a price for the country ’s decision to ban new mosque minarets , with calls for Muslims to empty their accounts in protest .
Withdrawals in response to Sunday ’s referendum result backing the ban are expected by the Turkish Minister leading his country ’s EU accession talks .
Egemen Bagis stressed the doors of the Turkish banking sector were wide open to Muslims .
Urging peaceful reactions to the ballot , he said Switzerland must remove what he called “ this shame ” as soon as possible .
Turkish leaders had already denounced the ban , with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warning against a rise in racism in Europe .
He believes such a question linked to religious rights should never have been put to the popular vote .
Swiss commercial and diplomatic relations with the Muslim world are under scrutiny after voters defied their government to back the right - wing initiative .
Those behind it say their aim is not to prevent people practicing their religion but to stop political Islam .
But , within Switzerland itself , many are alarmed at the outcome .
Thousands have taken to the streets of the French - speaking part of the country to demonstrate their disgust .
This was the scene yesterday in Copenhagen .
As you can see the scene is rather agitated with lots of police action , including use of billy clubs .
As of this writing , no pictures or video is available of Lord Monckton ’s account below .
Hopefully somebody in the crowd will post some .
I wish him well .
I ’ll also be glad when this conference is over .
It has shown government at its worst .
From The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley in Copenhagen at the SPPI blog :
Today the gloves came off and the true purpose of the “ global warming ” scare became nakedly visible .
Hugo Chavez , the Socialist president of Venezuela , blamed “ global warming ” on capitalism – and received a standing ovation from very nearly all of the delegates , lamentably including those from those of the capitalist nations of the West that are on the far Left – and that means too many of them .
Previously Robert Mugabe , dictator of Rhodesia , who had refused to leave office when he had been soundly defeated in a recent election , had also won plaudits at the conference for saying that the West ought to pay him plenty of money in reparation of our supposed “ climate debt ” .
Inside the conference center , “ world leader ” after “ world leader ” got up and postured about the need to Save The Planet , the imperative to do a deal , the necessity to save the small island nations from drowning , etc. , etc. , etc .
Outside , in the real world , it was snowing , and a foretaste of the Brave New World being cooked up by “ world leaders ” in their fantasy - land was already evident .
Some 20,000 observers from non-governmental organizations – nearly all of them true - believing Green groups funded by taxpayers – had been accredited to the conference .
However , without warning the UN had capriciously decided that all but 300 of them were to be excluded from the conference today , and all but 90 would be excluded on the final day .
Of course , this being the inept UN , no one had bothered to notify those of the NGOs that were not true - believers in the UN ’s camp .
So Senator Steve Fielding of Australia and I turned up with a few dozen other delegates , to be left standing in the cold for a couple of hours while the UN laboriously worked out what to do with us .
In the end , they decided to turn us away , which they did with an ill grace and in a bad - tempered manner .
As soon as the decision was final , the Danish police moved in .
One of them began the now familiar technique of manhandling me , in the same fashion as one of his colleagues had done the previous day .
Once again , conscious that a police helicopter with a high - resolution camera was hovering overhead , I thrust my hands into my pockets in accordance with the St. John Ambulance crowd - control training , looked my assailant in the eye and told him , quietly but firmly , to take his hands off me .
He complied , but then decided to have another go .
I told him a second time , and he let go a second time .
I turned to go and , after I had turned my back , he gave me a mighty shove that flung me to the ground and knocked me out .
I came to some time later ( not sure exactly how long ) , to find my head being cradled by my friends , some of whom were doing their best to keep the police thugs at bay while the volunteer ambulance - men attended to me .
I was picked up and dusted me off .
I could not remember where I had left my telephone , which had been in my hand at the time when I was assaulted .
I rather fuzzily asked where it was , and one of the police goons shouted , “ He alleges he had a mobile phone . ”
In fact , the phone was in my coat pocket , where my hand had been at the time of the assault .
The ambulance crew led me away and laid me down under a blanket for 20 minutes to get warm , plying me with water and keeping me amused with some colorfully colloquial English that they had learned .
I thanked them for their kindness , left them a donation for their splendid service , and rejoined my friends .
A very senior police officer then came up and asked if I was all right .
Yes , I said , but no thanks to one of his officers , who had pushed me hard from behind when my back was turned and had sent me flying .
The police chief said that none of his officers would have done such a thing .
I said that several witnesses had seen the incident , which I intended to report .
I said I had hoped to receive an apology but had not received one , and would include that in my report .
The policeman went off looking glum , and with good reason .
To assault an accredited representative of a conference your nation is hosting , and to do it while your own police cameramen are filming from above , and to do it without any provocation except my polite , non-threatening request that I should not be manhandled , is not a career - enhancing move , as that police chief is about to discover to his cost .
Nor does this incident , and far too many like it , reflect the slightest credit on Denmark .
We must make reasonable allowance for the fact that the unspeakable security service of the UN , which is universally detested by those at this conference , was ordering the Danish police about .
The tension between the alien force and the indigenous men on the ground had grown throughout the conference .
However , the Danish police were far too free with their hands when pushing us around , and that is not acceptable in a free society .
But then , Europe is no longer a free society .
It is , in effect , a tyranny ruled by the unelected Kommissars of the European Union .
That is perhaps one reason why police forces throughout Europe , including that in the UK , have become far more brutal than was once acceptable in their treatment of the citizens they are sworn to serve .
It is exactly this species of tyranny that the UN would like to impose upon the entire planet , in the name of saving us from ourselves – or , as Ugo Chavez would put it , saving us from Western capitalist democracy .
A few weeks ago , at a major conference in New York , I spoke about this tendency towards tyranny with Dr. Vaclav Klaus , the distinguished economist and doughty fighter for freedom and democracy who is President of the Czech Republic .
While we still have one or two statesmen of his caliber , there is hope for Europe and the world .
Unfortunately , he refused to come to Copenhagen , telling me that there was no point , now that the lunatics were firmly in control of the asylum .
However , I asked him whether the draft Copenhagen Treaty ’s proposal for what amounted to a communistic world government reminded him of the Communism under which he and his country had suffered for so long .
He thought for a moment – as statesmen always do before answering an unusual question – and said , “ Maybe it is not brutal .
But in all other respects , what it proposes is far too close to Communism for comfort . ”
Today , as I lay in the snow with a cut knee , a bruised back , a banged head , a ruined suit , and a written - off coat , I wondered whether the brutality of the New World Order was moving closer than President Klaus – or any of us – had realized .

The stakes were high for President Evo Morales going into presidential and legislative elections on December 6 .
“ We have gained the government but still do n’t have power , ” he said .
That worry is over .
Morales , Vice President Alvaro García Linera , and the Movement toward Socialism Party ( MAS ) swept up 62 percent of the ballots cast by 5.1 million voters to win a second four year term .
Trailing by up to 40 points in pre-election polls , lead opponent Manfred Reyes of the Progressive Plan for Bolivia party took 23 percent of the votes .
He was already ticketed for a December 8 American Airlines departure for Miami .
The former Cochabamba prefect , a School of the Americas graduate , faces corruption charges .
Morales became president in January 2006 following an unprecedented 53.7 percent win .
On August 14 , 2008 , Morales and his vice president gained a 67 percent majority in a recall vote .
The main question before the vote this week was whether MAS could secure the two thirds senate majority – 24 of 36 senators – necessary for approving constitutional changes , key legislation , and appointments .
Lacking that , the Morales government has been unable to name judges and high treasury officials , or pass universal health insurance and anti-corruption legislation .
MAS candidates took 25 senate seats to remedy that situation .
At issue , suggested political scientist Franklin Pareja , was implementation of the new constitution approved last January by a 59 percent MAS majority .
That victory capped two years of tumultuous , violence - ridden struggle fomented by a European descended , wealthy elite who control agricultural and hydrocarbon - endowed regions in eastern Bolivia .
The new constitution introduces “ important transformations , ” suggested election official Antonio Costas , especially broadened political participation by women , youth , and indigenous peoples .
The three are forms of advanced democracy : direct and participatory democracy , representative democracy , and a communitarian variety promoting autonomy for indigenous peoples .
Some 60 percent of Bolivians are indigenous .
Morales is Bolivia ’s first indigenous head of state since the Europeans ’ arrival .
Voters approved a referendum granting autonomy to 12 indigenous municipalities .
The new constitution contains autonomy provisions affecting five departments .
They also passed .
Four departments in eastern Bolivia had voted approval earlier .
Overall results were shaped in large part by weakening of opposition groups in Bolivia ’s east , due largely to the discovery last April in Santa Cruz , the opposition epicenter , of a potentially violent anti-Morales plot .
National police made arrests and killed three armed suspects originating from Romania , Ireland , and Hungary .
A legislative commission last week released the names of likely accomplices .
Topping the list are Santa Cruz political chieftains Rubén Costas and Branco Marinkovic , each a vociferous Morales antagonist .
Some 170,000 Bolivians living abroad voted absentee for the first time .
Election officials introduced biometric voter identification technology .
Election observers were ubiquitous , especially from the Organization of American States and European Union .
Before the election , some suggested that the first Morales term was remarkable less for accomplishments than for turning Morales into an international and domestic icon .
Morales supporters , however , cite achievements over four years contributing to the victory .
The minimum wage increased 47 percent , currency reserves are up from $ 1 billion to $ 8.7 billion ; and the GDP grew three percent last year .
Electricity costs are down 25 percent , natural gas 50 percent .
Extreme poverty has fallen from 37 to 31 percent .
Peasant communities have received 1,400 free tractors , and $ 237 million have been spent on 2,810 public works , sanitation , and drinking water projects .
Agrarian reform has delivered 10 million acres to poor farmers with another 25 million acres ready for transfer .
Nationalization of hydrocarbons led to $ 5 billion being transferred to local governments and universities .
That funding has provided pregnant women and babies with $ 257 each , 700,000 seniors with $ 342 annually , and two million young students with annual grants for school supplies .
Bolivia is one of seven countries with the sharpest drop recently in infant mortality .
Illiteracy has been eradicated , and 450,000 free eye operations have been performed .
Free health care is available .
Bolivia is now a “ plurinational ” state representing 36 nationalities .
Three indigenous universities have been founded .
Unemployment , however , rose from 10.2 percent to 11 percent over the past year .
“ The results will mark another milestone for the country , ” Morales commented , “ because the so - called half moon area ( the contentious eastern departments ) will no longer exist , being converted into a full moon of unity among all Bolivians . ”

Divorce may be one of the most damaging financial events in the lives of those who go through it , but that is n’t always immediately clear to a couple about to split up .
In fact , the first response is probably emotional  whether exhaustion and sadness at having failed to save the relationship after years of struggle or shock when your spouse walks out .
Then , perhaps , comes the resolve to shield the children .
It seems almost tone - deaf at that point to suggest that you write a new budget .
But as you get swept up in the rage , the disappointment and the worries , money will intrude whether you like it or not .
You should expect that choices with huge financial implications will come at you with intense speed during a divorce , and they ’re probably not the sort of decisions you ’re used to making .
One of the first will affect how much you spend on legal fees .
Should you try mediation , which can be relatively low - cost , or a newer process known as collaborative divorce ?
Or should you just go for the bare - knuckles approach ?
More than anything else in Barack Obama 's presidency so far , health reform has exposed a get - a - deal - at - any - cost side of Obama that infuriates his party ’s progressives .

Liberals :
Why did n't Obama fight ?
More than anything else in Barack Obama ’s presidency so far , health reform has exposed a get - a - deal - at - any - cost side of Obama that infuriates his party ’s progressives .
And as Democrats tried to salvage health reform Tuesday , some liberals could barely hide their sense of betrayal that the White House and congressional Democrats have been willing to cut deals and water down what they consider the ideal vision of reform .

“ The Senate version is not worth passing , ” former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean told POLITICO , referring to plans to strip the latest compromise from the bill , a Medicare buy - in .
“ I think in this particular iteration , this is the end of the road for reform . ”
Dean said there are some good elements in the bill , but lawmakers should pull the plug and revisit the issue in Obama ’s second term , unless Democrats are willing to shortcut a GOP filibuster .
“ No one will think this is health care reform .
This is not even insurance reform , ” he said .
The White House pushed back hard at liberals ’ complaints Tuesday , with Obama talking up what ’s in the plan but not saying a word about what ’s been left out :
A single - payer plan , a public option , a state “ opt - out ” of the public option , a trigger and a Medicare buy - in — all ideas pushed by Democrats and blessed by Obama at various times but now gone from the bill .
But it ’s not just the liberal base that ’s feeling unsettled .
Obama has also proved frustrating to moderates , who simply wanted to know where Obama ’s core principles on health care stood , all the better to cut a deal to the president ’s liking .
Time and again , he rebuffed Democrats ’ requests to speak up more forcefully about what he wanted — a strategy that allowed Obama to preserve maximum flexibility to declare victory at the end of the process , no matter what the final bill looked like .
He began that process in earnest Tuesday after a meeting with Senate Democrats , who are resigned to dropping a Medicare buy - in compromise to win the vote of Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and get the 60 votes needed to pass a bill .
Obama hinted at the Democratic retreat on the plan — saying not every senator ’s favorite ideas can be included in any bill — while staunchly defending what Senate Democrats can accomplish in a bill , including making coverage more affordable for 30 million uninsured Americans , cutting insurance premiums and reducing the budget deficit .
“ These are n’t small changes .
These are big changes .
They represent the most significant reform of our health care system since the passage of Medicare .
They will save money .
They will save families money .
They will save businesses money , and they will save government money .
And they ’re going to save lives , ” Obama said .
In the White House meeting , there were signs of tension within the Democratic Caucus .
Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) , a proponent of the public option , challenged Lieberman ’s arguments that allowing people ages 55 to 64 to buy in to Medicare would add to the deficit and hurt the program .
“ I made a direct appeal to him ... and answered the arguments I ’ve heard him make , ” Brown said .
“ We ’re not giving up .
It ’s going to conference . ”
But in the end , Brown said he would vote for the bill .
“ I ca n’t imagine I would n’t .
There is just too much at stake , ” he said .
Obama ’s need to pass a reform bill ahead of the 2010 elections drove the political calculus as the calendar turned to December , when the days grew short and the pressure to sign something , anything , began to take precedence .
Otherwise , Democrats risked facing voters next fall with little to show for a full year of twin congressional majorities .
It ’s what drove White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel to urge Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to cut a deal with Lieberman .
The final bill is n’t even close to a bill then - U.S. Senate candidate Obama spoke of in 2003 , when he said , “ I happen to be a proponent of a single - payer , universal health care plan , ” using the terms that commonly refer to a government - run health insurance system .
But whatever Democrats can pass now — if they can pass anything at all — also will fall short of ideas Obama discussed during the year to create a public health insurance plan to provide competition to private insurance companies and keep them honest .
Yet perhaps what angers liberals the most is that Obama himself never seemed willing to push hard enough for the public option — and , in fact , all but took it off the table in August when he said he could sign a bill that did n’t include it .
Once Obama said he did n’t need a public option , these progressives argue , there was no cost or penalty to be paid by a Lieberman or a Sen. Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) or a Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) for taking to the Senate floor and opposing it , too .
Progressives feel betrayed , but are not surprised , by the Senate ’s move to drop the Medicare buy - in and the public option .
They blame Reid and Obama for not exercising their power to fight for the provisions .
Obama ’s failure to demand a public option and Reid ’s decision to take reconciliation off the table emboldened moderates who might have thought twice about challenging a popular president or a Democratic majority comfortable with using Senate procedure to pass a bill with 51 votes .
“ They were very good at making it look like they wanted a public option in the final bill without actually doing anything to make it happen , ” said Jane Hamsher , publisher of the liberal blog Firedoglake .
“ It ’s hard to believe that the two most powerful people in the country — arguably the world — could not do more to achieve their desired objective than to hand the keys over to Joe Lieberman .
They would not be where they are if they are that bad at negotiation . ”
Press secretary Robert Gibbs defended Obama against charges that he was caving in to moderates to get a final bill passed , even if it risked angering liberals who wanted more government involvement in the health care system .
“ There ’s very little legislation that ’s passed that has each and every idea that each and every member of the Senate or the House wants to have in it , ” Gibbs told reporters Tuesday .
“ On balance , does this legislation make a big difference in the lives of everyday working men and women ?
It ’s not even a close call on that . ”
If Obama was hoping for a triumphant announcement out of a rare White House meeting with the entire Senate Democratic Caucus Tuesday , his measured tone and acknowledgment that differences remain showed how much work is still ahead for Democrats eager to wrap up by Christmas .
Reid was still awaiting a price tag on his bill from congressional scorekeepers , and Nelson said he still ca n’t support the current version of the bill , which lacks the tough anti-abortion language he seeks .
But after leaving the White House meeting , even some of the staunchest public option advocates seemed resigned to passing a bill without it or the Medicare buy - in , a sort of public option for people ages 55 to 64 — a sign of a split between liberal elected officials and the activist base .
Obama ’s argument that Democrats should n’t pass up a once - in - a - generation chance to achieve reform appeared to be sinking in .
Brown , who has said several times throughout this process — including two weekends ago — that the president needed to get more involved , brushed aside any introspection about what the loss of the public option says about Democrats or the president .
“ It says something about the math here , ” Brown said .
“ You ’ve got to get all 60 Democrats and independents , and it is hard to do .
I want to continue to talk to people .
... I like the bill .
I just think we could make it better . ”
Sen . John Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) , also a major advocate of the public option a few months ago , is a convert to the bill .
He has a perspective that many of his colleagues lack :
He was around 15 years ago when President Bill Clinton rejected compromises that fell short of his goal of providing universal coverage .
“ If you think of what I do n’t get , and you think of what we do get , that ’s a pretty long list , ” Rockefeller said .

Tomorrow morning Lord Mandelson will present the Digital Economy Bill to the public , which among other things is aimed at reducing illicit file - sharing .
According to parts of the bill that leaked today , the legislation could lead to jail terms for file - sharers and unprecedented power for the entertainment industries .
Over the past months the UK government has tried to tackle the issue of online piracy .
This has resulted in a proposal from Lord Mandelson , who plans to disconnect alleged file sharers without any judicial process .
Tomorrow the exact text of the bill is expected to be made public , but according to early reports , the legislation will open all doors for a digital police state where alleged pirates will be crucified by private companies .
Judging from some of the plans that leaked earlier today , the endless lobbying efforts of the entertainment industry by anti-piracy outfits including IFPI and the BPI have definitely paid off .
Cory Doctorow has the scoop on BoingBoing and he told TorrentFreak that the information comes from someone “ very close to the Labour government ” who he trusts implicitly .
If accurate , the new legislation will be a disaster for the privacy of all Internet users while giving unprecedented powers to the entertainment industry .
Under the new bill the Secretary of State would be able to pass secondary legislation without Parliamentary oversight in order to protect rights holders .
Three reasons are given :
1. The Secretary of State would get the power to create new remedies for online infringements .
( for example , he could authorize jail terms for file - sharing , or create a “ three - strikes ” plan that costs entire families their Internet access if any member stands accused of infringement )
2 . The Secretary of State would get the power to create procedures to “ confer rights ” for the purposes of protecting rightsholders from online infringement .
( for example , record labels and movie studios can be given investigative and enforcement powers that allow them to compel ISPs , libraries , companies and schools to turn over personal information about Internet users , and to order those companies to disconnect users , remove websites , block URLs , etc )
3 . The Secretary of State would get the power to “ impose such duties , powers or functions on any person as may be specified in connection with facilitating online infringement ” ( for example , ISPs could be forced to spy on their users , or to have copyright lawyers examine every piece of user - generated content before it goes live ; also , copyright “ militias ” can be formed with the power to police copyright on the web )
The leaked information mainly shows that the Secretary of State will have the power to introduce all kinds of draconian measures without Parliamentary oversight .
More details on concrete policy dealing with alleged file - sharers and the proposed three - strikes system have yet to be announced .
Call it the great Chihuahua migration of 2009 .
Dozens of the itsy - bitsy hounds have been flying out of California , where their popularity and pop culture status has translated into a crisis for animal shelters , and are headed for new homes – or handbags – in other states .
Fifteen Chihuahuas with tickets to New York City Tuesday had their flight plans nixed due to the recent snow storm .
But 40 tiny dogs departed Monterey County on Monday to Denver and about 60 have jetted off from Los Angeles to shelters in New Hampshire , thanks to a little help from a celebrity animal lover and sympathetic airlines .
The age of instant communication has been something of a blessing for shelter dogs .
In the aftermath of Katrina , animal lovers took to the Internet to find homes for hundreds of abandoned dogs .
Now the plight of the California Chihuahua is being spread on Twitter and Facebook .
When a group of Bay Area animal shelters held a press conference earlier this month to call attention to their Chihuahua problem , lovers of the purse - size pooches mobilized .
Actress Katherine Heigl , of TV’s “ Grey ’s Anatomy , ” helped fund their trip to New Hampshire and Project Flying Chihuahuas was soon launched to find other homes for the dogs , which are now the most common breed in California shelters .
Animal advocates blame proliferation of the little dogs on pop culture – think Taco Bell , “ Legally Blonde , ” and Paris Hilton .
Chihuahuas became something of a Hollywood accessory after Ms. Hilton was regularly seen carrying her dog Tinkerbell .
Some have even called this the " Paris Hilton syndrome . "
Breeders certainly did their part to keep up with the growing demand , too .
But when many new dog owners realized the big commitment that accompanied this little dog , they unloaded the pooches at the nearest shelter .
In the past year , according to the Los Angeles Times , the L.A. area 's animal shelters accepted 4,700 Chihuahuas .
But the California ’s Chihuahua boom has been a boon for dog lovers in other parts of the country .
In New Hampshire , a shelter worker told reporters a local ABC affiliate that while there ’s a demand for the dogs there , Chihuahuas are hard to come by locally .
And in New York , a representative of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told the San Francisco Chronicle : " If you want to pack up a box of Chihuahuas and ship them here , I 'd be thrilled . "

Permits rose in all but a handful of very small towns , and appeared to increase more or less evenly across the state - in small towns and larger cities and in wealthy areas as well as poorer ones .
Towns including Andover , Beverly , and Newton saw increases at or slightly above the state average , as did Medford , Weymouth , and Woburn .
Boston was up 18 percent , Cambridge 25 percent , Somerville 26 percent , Brockton 13 percent .
Chris Haynes acquired a license last year after moving to the quiet town of Ashby .
He was worried about crime , a fear that seemed to be confirmed recently when someone stole the tires off his car .
“ I thought it would be a good thing to have around the house , ’’ he said .
“ We grew up with the mentality that only criminals own guns , ’’ said Fairbanks .
“ I brought my gun to mom ’s house to show her the safety features , and it was n’t the end of the world to have a gun . ’’
Among those who recently got a permit was Ryan Fairbanks , a 23 - year - old National Guardsman from Haverhill .
Guns were anathema in his childhood home , he said , but a few weeks ago he got a permit and bought a gun to protect himself .
The number had previously been dropping , from about 239,000 in 2001 to 192,000 in 2007 .
Class A permits , commonly called “ a license to carry , ’’ are the only permits that allow individuals to carry concealed guns and own all types of legal firearms .
The increase in Class A permits - the largest and broadest category of gun license - amounted to a jump of more than 28,000 statewide to about 224,000 as of last month , according to data provided by the state Executive Office of Public Safety and Security .
“ I think it ’s a sign of the times , ’’ said Mike Burchman , who teaches gun courses in Hop kinton , where the number of permits rose 25 percent .
“ There ’s a general insecurity , and people are looking for personal protection .
In the past two years , I ’ve seen a real shift . ’’
Some saw it as an echo of similar spikes across the country after President Obama ’s election , when heavy gun sales were attributed to fears that he would impose strict new gun laws .
But with more women and elderly residents signing up for gun classes in Massachusetts , many said the increase here has also been driven by worries about crime and a growing sense of vulnerability in the wake of the financial collapse and lingering fallout of the damaged economy .
The magnitude of the rise , evident in nearly every corner of the state , surprised law enforcement officials , and gun advocates and opponents alike .
The number of gun permits issued in Massachusetts surged by more than 15 percent over the past two years , reversing nearly a decade of steady declines and marking a pronounced departure for a state known for its antigun sentiment .
In some cases , the increases were striking .
Permits climbed 31 percent in Falmouth , 30 percent in Duxbury .
Massachusetts gun ownership laws are among the strictest in the country .
Local police departments grant licenses and have broad leeway to deny applications .
To receive a permit , applicants must complete a certified firearms safety course and cannot have a record of a felony or misdemeanor conviction with a sentence longer than two years .
Law enforcement officials said that , while the sharp increase in permits is unexpected , it does not portend any increase in gun violence .
“ We ’re concerned about criminals with guns , not law - abiding citizens , ’’ said John A. Grossman , undersecretary of forensic science and technology for the state Office of Public Safety and Security .
“ It ’s the illegal gun trafficking we ’re really focused on . ’’
Police chiefs and district attorneys echoed that , saying they see few crimes committed with legally licensed firearms .
Many people apply for Class A licenses because it allows them to own any legal firearm , but the vast majority do not regularly carry firearms in public , they said .
Still , antigun groups worry that any growth in gun ownership will mean more bloodshed .
They point to incidents such as the increasing number of road rage shootings .
“ I think the more guns , the more gun violence , ’’ said John Rosenthal , founder of Stop Handgun Violence , which led the push for the state ’s groundbreaking Gun Control Act of 1998 , widely seen as the nation ’s most comprehensive gun legislation .
Gun sales increased across the country last year when the National Rifle Association ran an aggressive campaign warning that Obama would tighten gun restrictions .
In May , the administration of Governor Deval Patrick proposed limiting Massachusetts residents to one handgun purchase per month to reduce gun trafficking by “ straw purchasers ’ ’ who buy in bulk to sell to people who ca n’t legally buy guns .
The bill is now before the state ’s joint judiciary committee .
Such proposals have fed beliefs that more regulation could be on the way .
“ People feel new gun laws may come down the pike , ’’ said Steve Hathaway , owner of Mass Firearms School in Framingham , where permits rose 20 percent .
“ They want to get into the system before the system closes . ’’
Many are also purchasing weapons for home defense , frightened by high - profile crimes such as a fatal home invasion in New Hamsphire this fall .
A growing number have lost faith in the government ’s ability to protect them , gun rights advocates said .
“ Katrina changed a lot of minds , ’’ said James L. Wallace , who directs the Gun Owners ’ Action League , the state ’s largest gun-rights group , referring to crime and looting in New Orleans after the hurricane .
Gun clubs and firing ranges that offer instruction say that an increasing number of women and the elderly are enrolling in classes .
In June , the Nenameseck Sportsmen ’s Club in Palmer held a class in June for 30 women .
The Mass Firearms School also has seen enrollment increases among women and older men .
“ Two years ago , the demographic was mostly young men , often off - duty or former military , ’’ Hathaway said .
“ Now it ’s a complete cross section .
There ’s no stereotype . ’’
Nationwide , public support for gun restrictions has declined , and nearly half of states have relaxed handgun restrictions amid aggressive lobbying from gun-rights groups , according to a recent review .
More than 30 states allow a person to openly carry a loaded handgun without a permit , according to the Legal Community Against Violence , a public interest law center focused on gun control issues .
In a recent report , the center argued against expanded concealed - carry laws , saying that “ much of what is claimed to be self - defense is actually criminal gun use that creates or exacerbates interpersonal conflicts . ’’
Kristen Rand , legislative director at the Violence Policy Center in Washington , pointed to troad - rage shootings as cautionary tales .
“ People may feel safer with a handgun , but all the evidence points to the opposite , ’’ she said .
“ We see it happen across the country .
They are not enhancing public safety ; they are a public safety problem . ’’
But others said the gun violence that ravages cities usually stems from the illegal market .
“ How many gun deaths are really attributable to law - abiding citizens ? ’’ asked Nancy Robinson , of Citizens for Safety , a Boston coalition fighting gun trafficking .
“ The problem is the guns that wind up in the hands of young kids , gang leaders , and criminals . ’’

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Food and Drug Administration has allowed drugs for cancer and other diseases to stay on the market even when follow - up studies showed they did n't extend patients ' lives , say congressional investigators .
A report due out Monday from the Government Accountability Office also shows that the FDA has never pulled a drug off the market due to a lack of required follow - up about its actual benefits — even when such information is more than a decade overdue .
When pressed about that policy , agency officials said they have no plans to get more aggressive .
The GAO says the FDA should do more to track whether drugs approved based on preliminary results actually have lived up to their promise .
The FDA responded that the report paints an overly negative picture of its so - called " accelerated approval " program , which is only used to approve drugs for the most serious diseases .
" Millions of patients with serious or life - threatening illnesses have had earlier access to new safe and effective treatments , " thanks to the program , the FDA said in its response to the report .
In 1992 , the FDA began speeding up the approval of novel drugs based on so - called surrogate endpoints , or laboratory measures that suggest the drug will make real improvements in patient health .
HIV drugs , for example , are cleared based on their virus - lowering power , a predictor of increased survival .
Drugmakers favor the program because it helps them get products to market sooner , without conducting long - term patient studies that can take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars .
A condition of quicker approvals is that drugmakers conduct follow - up studies to show the drug 's benefits actually panned out .
But the GAO report , a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press , identified several drugs still on the market that never lived up to their initial promise .
And in the 16 years that the FDA has used accelerated approval , it has never once pulled a drug off the market due to missing or unimpressive follow - up data .
" FDA has fallen far short of where it should be for patient safety , " said Sen .
Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , who requested the investigation .
Of the 144 studies the FDA has required under the program since 1992 , 64 % have been completed and more than one - third are still pending , according to the GAO .
Investigators said the FDA does not rigorously track whether companies are making progress on their required studies , although the agency is improving .
FDA officials say they have overhauled their tracking system since the GAO completed its report .
And an outside analysis by contractor Booz Allen Hamilton concluded last month that most companies are meeting their study requirements on time .
But in the case of Shire Laboratories ' low blood pressure treatment ProAmatine , the required study has gone incomplete for more than 13 years .
The GAO found that ProAmatine has generated more than $ 257 million in sales , even though " the clinical benefit of the drug has never been established . "
Shire did not respond to a request for comment Friday .
In other cases , the FDA has failed to act even when company studies show drugs did not improve patient outcomes .
The FDA approved AstraZeneca 's lung cancer drug Iressa in 2003 based on early results showing it reduced the size of tumors .
But later studies showed the drug did not significantly extend patient lives .
The FDA has left the drug on the market , despite hundreds of reports of a sometimes fatal pneumonia .
FDA officials explain that access to Iressa has been restricted to a small number of patients who have shown benefit .
The agency recommends all other patients try two alternative drugs .
Iressa " is not available to new patients , " Astrazeneca confirmed in a statement .
The GAO concluded that the FDA has no policy for pulling drugs off the market that were approved using surrogate endpoints .
When GAO investigators confronted FDA officials about this lack of enforcement , they reportedly said it would be " difficult , if not impossible , " to draft a standard policy for withdrawals , given the unique circumstances of individual drugs .
In certain cases , FDA officials say withdrawing a drug would mean eliminating the only available treatment for a condition .
" FDA should explain the principles it uses to make decisions such as drug withdrawals , " said Principal Deputy Commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein , in an interview with the AP .
" But we do n't want to lock ourselves into a specific set of criteria that takes away the flexibility to do what 's right for the public health . "
Sharfstein added that the agency has a task force assigned to look at policies like drug withdrawals .
Some consumers advocates say that 's not good enough .
" The FDA has talked a lot about doing more enforcement , but this is an area where they 're basically defending not enforcing the law , " said Dr. Sidney Wolf , of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen .
Wolfe said the lax policy sends a message to companies that there is no penalty for failing to complete studies .
The GAO recommends the FDA clarify when it will pull drugs off the market .
" As the scientific experts charged with overseeing the use of drugs it approves , FDA should be in a position to implement this recommendation , " the report states .

I remember the boys dressed in army surplus , the girls in hessian , silhouettes framed in beach shanties , staring across an abyss .
You were not meant to talk about them .
They were not counted in the census , unlike the sheep , and anyway were dirty and feckless and dying off .
You were not meant to disturb the surface of our great southern idyll , sun-kissed and God- blessed , in circumstances that might raise questions of race .
At high school , I studied a celebrated historian , Russel Ward , who wrote : " We are civilised and they are not . "
They were the first Australians .
At least he mentioned them .
Other textbooks simply left them out .
Today , almost everything has changed and has not changed .
For many Aboriginal people , who value healing , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 's apology last year was important .
They and their white allies had worked tirelessly for the mere word to be uttered .
The resistance was formidable ; white supremacist politicians , journalists and academics damned the " black armband version of our history " .
And when Rudd finally said it , the Sydney Morning Herald described the apology as " a piece of political wreckage " that the " government has moved quickly to clear away . . . in a way that responds to some of its supporters ' emotional needs " .
Australia 's apartheid
There is to be no compensation for those thousands of Aborigines wrenched from their families as children , known as the stolen generation .
And the previous , openly racist government 's " intervention " into Aboriginal lands in the Northern Territory is being consolidated .
In 2007 , on the pretext that Aboriginal children were being sexually abused in " unthinkable numbers " , the government of John Howard suspended the Racial Discrimination Act and sent the army and " business managers " to take over black communities .
Within a year , barely reported statistics proved how bogus it all was .
Out of 7,433 children examined by doctors , at most four possible cases of sexual abuse were identified .
The Australian Crimes Commission found no evidence of paedophile rings .
What it found , it already knew : poverty and sickness on the scale of Africa and India .
Since Rudd's apology , Aboriginal poverty indicators have gone backwards .
His " Closing the Gap " programme is a grim joke , having produced not a single new housing project .
An undeclared agenda comes straight from Australia 's colonial past : a land - grab combined with an almost prurient need to control , harass and blame a people who have refused to die off , whose genius is their understanding of an ancient land that still perplexes and threatens white authority .
Whenever Canberra 's politicians want to look " tough " , they give the Aborigines a good kicking : it is a ritual as sacred as Don Bradman worship or Anzac Day .
The indigenous affairs minister , Jenny Macklin , has decreed that unless certain communities hand over their precious freehold leases , they will be denied basic services .
The Northern Territory contains abundant mineral wealth , such as uranium , and has long been eyed by multinationals as a lucrative radioactive waste dump .
The blacks are in the way , yet again : so it is time for the usual feigned innocence .
Rudd has said his government " does n't have a clear idea of what 's happening on the ground " in Aboriginal Australia .
What ?
The learned studies pour forth as if the sorcerer 's apprentice is loose .
One example : the rate of incarceration of black Australians is five times that of black South Africans during apartheid .
Western Australia imprisons Aboriginal men at eight times the apartheid figure , an Aussie world record .
On 16 November , a 12 - year - old Aboriginal boy appeared in court charged with receiving a Freddo Frog chocolate bar from a friend who had allegedly taken it from a supermarket .
Only the international headlines forced the police to drop the case .
Two - thirds of Aboriginal children who have contact with the police are jailed ; two - thirds of white children are cautioned .
A young Aboriginal man was jailed for a year for stealing £ 12 worth of biscuits and soft drink .
A mattress in the desert
In my lifetime , Australia has become one of the most culturally diverse places on earth , and it has happened peacefully , by and large .
This proud achievement fades when you drive into a country town and pass the funerals of native people , many of them young , who take their own lives .
The whispering in Antipodean hearts is race .
The navy is sent against leaking boats filled with refugees , Tamils and Afghans , and if they cannot be dumped behind razor wire somewhere in Indonesia , they are isolated on Christmas Island , which , for the purpose , has been " excised " from the Australian map by a legal sleight of hand .
How clever .
While I have been in Australia , Irene Khan , Amnesty 's secretary general , has been travelling through the vast outback region known as Utopia .
The roads are dirt ; water often trickles from a single standpipe .
She saw children , their eyes streaming and coughs hacking .
She met Elsie , who sleeps on a mattress in the desert , yet pays rent to the government .
Shocking , she says .
There is currently a liberal clarion call for a bill of rights , and the republican movement is stirring again .
These debates are meaningless until white Australia summons the moral and political imagination to offer its first people a genuine treaty , as well as universal land rights and a proper share of resources .
And respect .
Only then will this fortunate society earn the respect it so often craves by other means .

The quad - core iMac may among the fastest Mac models .
But the 27 - inch all - in - one desktop might be at risk for a feature that Mac users will not find as impressive — a cracked display .
On Monday , I received an e-mail from a reader informing me that his 27 - inch i7 - based iMac had arrived with a cracked screen .
He sent along a photo of the damaged iMac and asked whether I ’d seen this before .
The answer is yes — I saw the problem for myself last week in the Macworld Lab .
The Core i7 27 - inch iMac we used in benchmark testing arrived in our offices earlier this month with a cracked monitor .
This iMac was a loaner from Apple , which routinely checks out these types of systems before shipping them to the press .
So I ’m confident that the damage to the screen occurred when the iMac was shipped from Cupertino to our San Francisco office .
A replacement unit arrived via courier with no damage .
I chalked up Macworld ’s experience to an isolated incident ; however , reports are beginning to surface on the Web in which disappointed customers complain of receiving cracked - screen iMacs .
Though none of the 93 comments in our i5 iMac review mentions any problems with cracked screens , Apple ’s own support discussion boards are abuzz with nine pages of posts about cracked iMac screens .
A second screen issue that ’s also widely reported involves screen flickering , tearing ( in which the image on the screen looks like a sheet of torn or ripped paper ) , and shutoff problems with the 27 - inch iMac .
A thread on Apple ’s support site has 785 replies that fill 53 pages .
We have not seen this problem on the iMacs we ’ve tested , but we ’ll keep our eyes peeled .
We contacted Apple to see if the company was aware of some of the issues involving the 27 - inch iMac and its screen .
“ The new iMac is a big hit with customers , ” a spokesman told Macworld .
“ If any customer has an issue with their Mac , they should contact AppleCare for support . ”
Have you had problems with your 27 - inch iMac ?
Let us know in the comments below .
The demise of the dollar !
The bust of the buck !
There 's a lot of commentary on the possibility that the world would drop the dollar as the world reserve currency .
But what would it actually cost us ?
The McKinsey Global Institute , in a new paper , says the answer is ... not as much as you 'd think .
Real Time Economics breaks down the costs :
1 ) When people in other countries hold dollars , they are effectively giving the U.S. zero-interest loans -- a benefit economists call " seigniorage . "
Annual benefit : about $ 10 billion .
When people in other countries hold dollars , they are effectively giving the U.S. zero-interest loans -- a benefit economists call " seigniorage . "
Annual benefit : about $ 10 billion .
2 ) When foreign governments and central banks park their dollars in US Treasury bonds , they push down those bonds ' yields .
That , in turn , pushes down borrowing rates for U.S. consumer and companies .
Annual benefit : about 0.50 to 0.60 percentage point , or about $ 90 billion .

3 ) The dollar 's global allure , though , also tends to push up its exchange rate against other currencies .
That makes it harder for U.S. exporters to compete abroad , and for domestic companies to compete against imports .
Annual cost : $ 30 billion to $ 60 billion .
To be clear , I do n't consider it likely that dollar will be dumped any time soon .
Greenbacks are still extremely liquid , interest rates are low and the market for dollars is still very strong -- and it's not like we 're hiding the news about our 2009 deficit and long - term debt crisis .
Washington endorses gunpoint election in Honduras
By Bill Van Auken
27 November 2009
The Obama administration has declared its support for elections being held this Sunday in Honduras , under conditions in which the regime that came to power in a coup last June has refused to cede power and is preparing intense repression against those who oppose it .
The action has placed Washington at odds with virtually all of Latin America , whose governments have refused to recognize the elections as legitimate .
The US endorsement of the elections represents the culmination of a policy that has lent political support to the coup regime headed by the Liberal Party leader of the national legislature , Roberto Micheletti , and the Honduran military , even as Washington has given lip service to the principle of restoring the country ’s elected president , Manuel Zelaya , to power .
Zelaya was dragged from the presidential palace by hooded and heavily armed soldiers in the early morning hours of June 28 , bundled onto an airplane and flown into exile .
Since his clandestine return to the country two months ago , he has been forced to remain holed up in the Brazilian embassy .
In advance of a meeting of the Organization of American States in Washington Monday , the US assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs , Arturo Valenzuela , sent a letter defending Washington ’s position , insisting that Sunday ’s elections “ are not something invented by the de facto government as a way out or to whitewash the coup . ”
The holding of the vote , Valenzuela said , is “ consistent with the constitutional mandate to elect the president and congress . ”
Valenzuela was only recently confirmed to his position as the senior State Department official responsible for Latin America .
Senate Republicans , led by Jim DeMint of South Carolina , had held up his nomination over the Obama administration ’s stated support for the return of Zelaya to office .
After the administration made it clear it would back the election whether the ousted president was reinstated or not , DeMint and his fellow Republicans dropped their opposition .
Backing the Republicans ’ support for the coup regime was a team of high - powered political lobbyists funded by Honduran business interests .
This effort was led by President Bill Clinton ’s White House counsel , Lanny Davis , a close political associate of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , whom he served as a chief political fundraiser during her 2008 presidential bid .
Valenzuela also announced that the US will send observers to monitor the election .
Organizing this mission for Washington will be the International Republican Institute ( IRI ) , and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs ( NDI ) , organizations set up by the two major US political parties .
Both are funded by the National Endowment for Democracy , an agency established in 1983 to carry out the kind of political operations that previously had been staged by the Central Intelligence Agency .
The NED was a leading backer of the Venezuelan coup of 2002 and has been involved in the so - called “ color revolutions ” carried out in several former Soviet republics .
Sitting on the board of the NDI are a number of veteran Democratic politicians as well as the president of the American Federation of Teachers , Randi Weingarten .
The OAS , from which Honduras has been suspended since the coup , Spain and various Latin American governments have refused to send observer teams on the grounds that it is impossible to hold democratic elections under an unelected dictatorship .
The only government in Latin America to openly back the elections is that of Panama .
In Honduras , a significant number of candidates have announced their withdrawal from the election .
In all , 55 candidates for deputy and 110 for mayor have said they will not participate .
Those refusing to run include a candidate for vice president in the Liberal Party , in which both Zelaya and Micheletti are leading members , and the party ’s candidate for mayor in San Pedro Sula , the country ’s second largest city .
Washington ’s backing of the election is the culmination of a protracted process that began with the coup itself .
Given the overwhelming US domination of the Honduran economy as well as the political life of the country , it is difficult to believe that the overthrow of the country ’s president would have taken place without a green light from US officials .
The Honduran military that executed the coup is largely trained and armed by the Pentagon , and the American military maintains its largest military facility in the region on Honduran soil .
This is the Soto Cano Air Base , where the plane carrying the ousted and abducted Zelaya landed before continuing to transport him to Costa Rica and exile .
Following the coup , the Obama administration issued a tepid condemnation of the action and a call for the restoration of constitutional order , while the State Department refused in the initial months to explicitly demand Zelaya ’s return to the presidency .
Washington promoted a mediation effort by its longtime ally in the region , Costa Rican President Oscar Aria , which led to the so - called San Jose Accord , calling for Zelaya to be restored to office , but only as a figurehead president in a so - called “ government of national unity and reconciliation ” controlled by the military and civilian officials who overthrew him .
The deal also included a renunciation on Zelaya ’s part of any bid to amend the country ’s reactionary constitution , a document dictated by the outgoing Honduran military dictatorship and the US Embassy in 1983 .
It was Zelaya ’s attempt to hold a consultative plebiscite asking Hondurans whether they favored a vote on calling a constituent assembly to consider constitutional revisions that provoked his ouster .
Afterwards , his right - wing opponents , parroted by the bulk of the US media , floated the charge that this was an attempt on Zelaya ’s part to grab another , illegitimate term in office .
As the vote on whether to hold a constituent assembly , which theoretically could overturn the constitution ’s term limits , would be held concurrently with the presidential ballot choosing Zelaya ’s successor , this charge was patently absurd .
Zelaya and his backers accepted the San Jose Accord , while Micheletti’s so - called de facto government rejected it , raising repeated objections and managing to drag out the process for months , even as it unleashed a wave of violent repression against the mass protests against the coup regime .
Opposition sources say that this repression has claimed the lives of 27 people , while thousands more have been illegally detained , many of them suffering beatings and torture .
Finally , at the end of October , a US delegation headed by Thomas Shannon , Valenzuela ’s predecessor at the State Department , brokered an agreement signed by both parties , the so - called Guaymuras accord .
The terms of this deal were even more reactionary than those drawn up by Arias .
In addition to the government of “ national unity ” and the renunciation of any attempt to alter the 1983 constitution , it conditioned Zelaya ’s return to office on a vote by the same Honduran congress that had endorsed his overthrow .
Moreover , as subsequently became clear , it included no timetable for the coup regime to step down .
In the wake of the signing , Micheletti announced the formation of a “ national unity ” government with himself at its head and including not a single Zelaya supporter .
Meanwhile , the Congress announced that it would not even meet to consider Zelaya ’s restoration until December 2 , three days after the election .
First Shannon and then the number - two State Department official on Latin America , Craig Kelly , made it clear that Washington would not condition its support for the election on Zelaya ’s return to office , essentially handing the organizers of the coup everything they had sought .
Speaking in Tegucigalpa last week , Kelly declared , “ Nobody has the right to take from the Honduran people the right to vote , to elect their leaders . ”
In a transparent threat to the mass movement that has opposed the coup regime and has called for a boycott of any election held under its rule , Kelly admonished all Hondurans to “ avoid provocations , calls to violence . ”
Zelaya has facilitated this entire process , seeking to subordinate the movement of the Honduran workers , peasants and students against the regime to these negotiations .
From the beginning , he has placed his faith in the Obama administration to rescue him .
As late as last Friday , he issued a letter to other Latin American heads of state warning against the “ ambiguous and imprecise ” positions of the Obama administration and expressing his surprise at Washington ’s support for the election .
This process degenerated further into farce last week with the announcement by Micheletti that he would take a “ leave of absence ” from the presidency from November 25 until December 2 in order to “ concentrate all the attention of the Honduran people on the electoral process and not on the political crisis . ”
The State Department “ welcomed ” the move , proclaiming that it would give the Honduran people “ breathing space ” and allow them to “ focus on the election . ”
Micheletti named no one to succeed him , and the State Department ’s spokesman acknowledged that he did not know who was running the country .
The obvious answer is the same people who have run it since the June coup , the military command and the ruling oligarchy .
Micheletti added that faced with any disruption of “ order and security that threatens the peace of the nation and the tranquility of the Honduran people , ” he would return to the presidency and organize “ with vigor and firmness the measures that are necessary to guarantee order . ”
Opponents of the regime point out that such measures are already being implemented in preparation for the disputed elections .
The regime has imposed a state of emergency and ordered Honduran troops to impose a “ general disarmament ” beginning this week , with the search for and seizure of weapons .
Roadblocks have been set up in various parts of the capital and on national highways , with people subjected to searches and detentions .
In addition to 16,000 troops and 14,000 police agents , the regime has mobilized 5,000 members of the military reserves to be deployed for the election .
The country ’s mayors have reportedly been ordered by the armed forces to draw up lists of people considered to be opponents of the elections for possible detention .
Micheletti has threatened that the government will criminally prosecute anyone in the media who advocates a boycott of the November 29 vote .
And last Friday , the regime once again forced Canal 36 , the sole television outlet that has opposed the coup , off the air .
The Committee of Relatives of Disappeared Detainees in Honduras ( COFADEH ) , one of the country ’s principal human rights organizations , issued a warning Sunday that in the run-up to the election , the coup regime is launching a “ new wave of death threats , political persecution , illegal detentions , torture [ and ] militarization of some sectors in the main cities . ”
It pointed to “ the incursion of cars bearing no license plates and with tinted windows , driven by heavily armed subjects , with their faces covered in ski masks in the neighborhoods identified with resistance to the coup . ”
The group also called attention to an order issued by the Ministry of Public Health , instructing health facilities to prepare for mass casualties , postpone elective surgeries and to remain open 24 hours a day during the election period .
In 1954 , the tobacco industry realized it had a serious problem .
Thirteen scientific studies had been published over the preceding five years linking smoking to lung cancer .
With the public growing increasingly alarmed about the health effects of smoking , the tobacco industry had to move quickly to protect profits and stem the tide of increasingly worrisome scientific news .
Big Tobacco turned to one the world 's five largest public relations firms , Hill and Knowlton , to help out .
Hill and Knowlton designed a brilliant Public Relations ( PR ) campaign to convince the public that smoking is not dangerous .
They encouraged the tobacco industry to set up their own research organization , the Council for Tobacco Research ( CTR ) , which would produce science favorable to the industry , emphasize doubt in all the science linking smoking to lung cancer , and question all independent research unfavorable to the tobacco industry .
The CTR did a masterful job at this for decades , significantly delaying and reducing regulation of tobacco products .
George Washington University epidemiologist David Michaels , who is President Obama 's nominee to head the Occupational Health and Safety Administration ( OSHA ) , wrote a meticulously researched 2008 book called , Doubt is Their Product : How Industry 's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health .
In the book , he wrote : " the industry understood that the public is in no position to distinguish good science from bad .
Create doubt , uncertainty , and confusion .
Throw mud at the anti-smoking research under the assumption that some of it is bound to stick .
And buy time , lots of it , in the bargain " .
The title of Michaels ' book comes from a 1969 memo from a tobacco company executive : " Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the ' body of fact ' that exists in the minds of the general public .
It is also the means of establishing a controversy " .
Hill and Knowlton , on behalf of the tobacco industry , had founded the " Manufactured Doubt " industry .
The Manufactured Doubt industry grows up
As the success of Hill and Knowlton 's brilliant Manufactured Doubt campaign became apparent , other industries manufacturing dangerous products hired the firm to design similar PR campaigns .
In 1967 , Hill and Knowlton helped asbestos industry giant Johns - Manville set up the Asbestos Information Association ( AIA ) .
The official - sounding AIA produced " sound science " that questioned the link between asbestos and lung diseases ( asbestos currently kills 90,000 people per year , according to the World Health Organization ) .
Manufacturers of lead , vinyl chloride , beryllium , and dioxin products also hired Hill and Knowlton to devise product defense strategies to combat the numerous scientific studies showing that their products were harmful to human health .
By the 1980s , the Manufactured Doubt industry gradually began to be dominated by more specialized " product defense " firms and free enterprise " think tanks " .
Michaels wrote in Doubt is Their Product about the specialized " product defense " firms : " Having cut their teeth manufacturing uncertainty for Big Tobacco , scientists at ChemRisk , the Weinberg Group , Exponent , Inc. , and other consulting firms now battle the regulatory agencies on behalf of the manufacturers of benzene , beryllium , chromium , MTBE , perchlorates , phthalates , and virtually every other toxic chemical in the news today .... Public health interests are beside the point .
This is science for hire , period , and it is extremely lucrative " .
Joining the specialized " product defense " firms were the so - called " think tanks " .
These front groups received funding from manufacturers of dangerous products and produced " sound science " in support of their funders ' products , in the name of free enterprise and free markets .
Think tanks such as the George C. Marshall Institute , Competitive Enterprise Institute , Heartland Institute , and Dr. Fred Singer 's SEPP ( Science and Environmental Policy Project ) have all been active for decades in the Manufactured Doubt business , generating misleading science and false controversy to protect the profits of their clients who manufacture dangerous products .
The ozone hole battle
In 1975 , the chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) industry realized it had a serious problem .
The previous year , Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina , chemists at the University of California , Irvine , had published a scientific paper warning that human - generated CFCs could cause serious harm to Earth 's protective ozone layer .
They warned that the loss of ozone would significantly increase the amount of skin- damaging ultraviolet UV - B light reaching the surface , greatly increasing skin cancer and cataracts .
The loss of stratospheric ozone could also significantly cool the stratosphere , potentially causing destructive climate change .
Although no stratospheric ozone loss had been observed yet , CFCs should be banned , they said .
The CFC industry hired Hill and Knowlton to fight back .
As is essential in any Manufactured Doubt campaign , Hill and Knowlton found a respected scientist to lead the effort -- noted British scientist Richard Scorer , a former editor of the International Journal of Air Pollution and author of several books on pollution .
In 1975 , Scorer went on a month - long PR tour , blasting Molina and Rowland , calling them " doomsayers " , and remarking , " The only thing that has been accumulated so far is a number of theories . "
To complement Scorer 's efforts , Hill and Knowlton unleashed their standard package of tricks learned from decades of serving the tobacco industry :
Launch a public relations campaign disputing the evidence .
Predict dire economic consequences , and ignore the cost benefits .
Use non-peer reviewed scientific publications or industry - funded scientists who do n't publish original peer - reviewed scientific work to support your point of view .
Trumpet discredited scientific studies and myths supporting your point of view as scientific fact .
Point to the substantial scientific uncertainty , and the certainty of economic loss if immediate action is taken .
Use data from a local area to support your views , and ignore the global evidence .
Disparage scientists , saying they are playing up uncertain predictions of doom in order to get research funding .
Disparage environmentalists , claiming they are hyping environmental problems in order to further their ideological goals .
Complain that it is unfair to require regulatory action in the U.S. , as it would put the nation at an economic disadvantage compared to the rest of the world .
Claim that more research is needed before action should be taken .
Argue that it is less expensive to live with the effects .
The campaign worked , and CFC regulations were delayed many years , as Hill and Knowlton boasted in internal documents .
The PR firm also took credit for keeping public opinion against buying CFC aerosols to a minimum , and helping change the editorial positions of many newspapers .
In the end , Hill and Knowlton 's PR campaign casting doubt on the science of ozone depletion by CFCs turned out to have no merit .
Molina and Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1995 .
The citation from the Nobel committee credited them with helping to deliver the Earth from a potential environmental disaster .
The battle over global warming
In 1988 , the fossil fuel industry realized it had a serious problem .
The summer of 1988 had shattered century - old records for heat and drought in the U.S. , and NASA 's Dr. James Hansen , one of the foremost climate scientists in the world , testified before Congress that human - caused global warming was partially to blame .
A swelling number of scientific studies were warning of the threat posed by human - cause climate change , and that consumption of fossil fuels needed to slow down .
Naturally , the fossil fuel industry fought back .
They launched a massive PR campaign that continues to this day , led by the same think tanks that worked to discredit the ozone depletion theory .
The George C. Marshall Institute , the Competitive Enterprise Institute , Heartland Institute , and Dr. Fred Singer 's SEPP ( Science and Environmental Policy Project ) have all been key players in both fights , and there are numerous other think tanks involved .
Many of the same experts who had worked hard to discredit the science of the well - established link between cigarette smoke and cancer , the danger the CFCs posed to the ozone layer , and the dangers to health posed by a whole host of toxic chemicals , were now hard at work to discredit the peer - reviewed science supporting human - caused climate change .
As is the case with any Manufactured Doubt campaign , a respected scientist was needed to lead the battle .
One such scientist was Dr. Frederick Seitz , a physicist who in the 1960s chaired the organization many feel to be the most prestigious science organization in the world -- the National Academy of Sciences .
Seitz took a position as a paid consultant for R.J. Reynolds tobacco company beginning in 1978 , so was well - versed in the art of Manufactured Doubt .
According to the excellent new book , Climate Cover - up , written by desmogblog.com co-founder James Hoggan and Richard Littlemore , over a 10 - year period Seitz was responsible for handing out $ 45 million in tobacco company money to researchers who overwhelmingly failed to link tobacco to anything the least bit negative .
Seitz received over $ 900,000 in compensation for his efforts .
He later became a founder of the George C. Marshall Institute , and used his old National Academy of Sciences affiliation to lend credibility to his attacks on global warming science until his death in 2008 at the age of ninety - six .
It was Seitz who launched the " Oregon Petition " , which contains the signatures of more than 34,000 scientists saying global warming is probably natural and not a crisis .
The petition is a regular feature of the Manufactured Doubt campaign against human - caused global warming .
The petition lists the " Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine " as its parent organization .
According to Climate Cover-up , the Institute is a farm shed situated a couple of miles outside of Cave Junction , OR ( population 17,000 ) .
The Institute lists seven faculty members , two of whom are dead , and has no ongoing research and no students .
It publishes creationist - friendly homeschooler curriculums books on surviving nuclear war .
The petition was sent to scientists and was accompanied by a 12 - page review printed in exactly the same style used for the prestigious journal , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
A letter from Seitz , who is prominently identified as a former National Academy of Sciences president , accompanied the petition and review .
Naturally , many recipients took this to be an official National Academy of Sciences communication , and signed the petition as a result .
The National Academy issued a statement in April 2008 , clarifying that it had not issued the petition , and that its position on global warming was the opposite .
The petition contains no contact information for the signers , making it impossible to verify .
In its August 2006 issue , Scientific American presented its attempt to verify the petition .
They found that the scientists were almost all people with undergraduate degrees , with no record of research and no expertise in climatology .
Scientific American contacted a random sample of 26 of the 1,400 signatories claiming to have a Ph.D. in a climate related science .
Eleven said they agreed with the petition , six said they would not sign the petition today , three did not remember the petition , one had died , and five did not respond .
I could say much more about the Manufactured Doubt campaign being waged against the science of climate change and global warming , but it would fill an entire book .
In fact , it has , and I recommend reading Climate Cover - up to learn more .
The main author , James Hoggan , owns a Canadian public relations firm , and is intimately familiar with how public relations campaigns work .
Suffice to say , the Manufactured Doubt campaign against global warming -- funded by the richest corporations in world history -- is probably the most extensive and expensive such effort ever .
We do n't really know how much money the fossil fuel industry has pumped into its Manufactured Doubt campaign , since they do n't have to tell us .
The website exxonsecrets.org estimates that ExxonMobil alone spent $ 20 million between 1998 - 2007 on the effort .
An analysis done by Desmogblog 's Kevin Grandia done in January 2009 found that skeptical global warming content on the web had doubled over the past year .
Someone is paying for all that content .
Lobbyists , not skeptical scientists
The history of the Manufactured Doubt industry provides clear lessons in evaluating the validity of their attacks on the published peer - reviewed climate change science .
One should trust that the think tanks and allied " skeptic " bloggers such as Steve McIntyre of Climate Audit and Anthony Watts of Watts Up With That will give information designed to protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry .
Yes , there are respected scientists with impressive credentials that these think tanks use to voice their views , but these scientists have given up their objectivity and are now working as lobbyists .
I do n't like to call them skeptics , because all good scientists should be skeptics .
Rather , the think tanks scientists are contrarians , bent on discrediting an accepted body of published scientific research for the benefit of the richest and most powerful corporations in history .
Virtually none of the " sound science " they are pushing would ever get published in a serious peer - reviewed scientific journal , and indeed the contrarians are not scientific researchers .
They are lobbyists .
Many of them seem to believe their tactics are justified , since they are fighting a righteous war against eco-freaks determined to trash the economy .
I will give a small amount of credit to some of their work , however .
I have at times picked up some useful information from the contrarians , and have used it to temper my blogs to make them more balanced .
For example , I no longer rely just on the National Climatic Data Center for my monthly climate summaries , but instead look at data from NASA and the UK HADCRU source as well .
When the Hurricane Season of 2005 brought unfounded claims that global warming was to blame for Hurricane Katrina , and a rather flawed paper by researchers at Georgia Tech showing a large increase in global Category 4 and 5 hurricanes , I found myself agreeing with the contrarians ' analysis of the matter , and my blogs at the time reflected this .
The contrarians and the hacked CRU emails
A hacker broke into an email server at the Climate Research Unit of the UK's University of East Anglia last week and posted ten years worth of private email exchanges between leading scientists who 've published research linking humans to climate change .
Naturally , the contrarians have seized upon this golden opportunity , and are working hard to discredit several of these scientists .
You 'll hear claims by some contrarians that the emails discovered invalidate the whole theory of human - caused global warming .
Well , all I can say is , consider the source .
We can trust the contrarians to say whatever is in the best interests of the fossil fuel industry .
What I see when I read the various stolen emails and explanations posted at Realclimate.org is scientists acting as scientists -- pursuing the truth .
I can see no clear evidence that calls into question the scientific validity of the research done by the scientists victimized by the stolen emails .
There is no sign of a conspiracy to alter data to fit a pre-conceived ideological view .
Rather , I see dedicated scientists attempting to make the truth known in face of what is probably the world 's most pervasive and best - funded disinformation campaign against science in history .
Even if every bit of mud slung at these scientists were true , the body of scientific work supporting the theory of human - caused climate change -- which spans hundreds of thousands of scientific papers written by tens of thousands of scientists in dozens of different scientific disciplines -- is too vast to be budged by the flaws in the works of the three or four scientists being subject to the fiercest attacks .
Exaggerated claims by environmentalists
Climate change contrarians regularly complain about false and misleading claims made by ideologically - driven environmental groups regarding climate change , and the heavy lobbying these groups do to influence public opinion .
Such efforts confuse the real science and make climate change seem more dangerous than it really is , the contrarians argue .
To some extent , these concerns are valid .
In particular , environmentalists are too quick to blame any perceived increase in hurricane activity on climate change , when such a link has yet to be proven .
While Al Gore 's movie mostly had good science , I thought he botched the treatment of hurricanes as well , and the movie looked too much like a campaign ad .
In general , environmental groups present better science than the think tanks do , but you 're still better off getting your climate information directly from the scientists doing the research , via the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report .
Another good source is Bob Henson 's Rough Guide to Climate Change , aimed at people with high - school level science backgrounds .
Let 's look at the amount of money being spent on lobbying efforts by the fossil fuel industry compared to environmental groups to see their relative influence .
According to Center for Public Integrity , there are currently 2,663 climate change lobbyists working on Capitol Hill .
That 's five lobbyists for every member of Congress .
Climate lobbyists working for major industries outnumber those working for environmental , health , and alternative energy groups by more than seven to one .
For the second quarter of 2009 , here is a list compiled by the Center for Public Integrity of all the oil , gas , and coal mining groups that spent more than $ 100,000 on lobbying ( this includes all lobbying , not just climate change lobbying ) :
Chevron $ 6,485,000
Exxon Mobil $ 4,657,000
BP America $ 4,270,000
ConocoPhillips $ 3,300,000
American Petroleum Institute $ 2,120,000
Marathon Oil Corporation $ 2,110,000
Peabody Investments Corp $ 1,110,000
Bituminous Coal Operators Association $ 980,000
Shell Oil Company $ 950,000
Arch Coal , Inc $ 940,000
Williams Companies $ 920,000
Flint Hills Resources $ 820,000
Occidental Petroleum Corporation $ 794,000
National Mining Association $ 770,000
American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity $ 714,000
Devon Energy $ 695,000 Sunoco $ 585,000
Independent Petroleum Association of America $ 434,000
Murphy Oil USA , Inc $ 430,000
Peabody Energy $ 420,000
Rio Tinto Services , Inc $ 394,000
America 's Natural Gas Alliance $ 300,000
Interstate Natural Gas Association of America $ 290,000
El Paso Corporation $ 261,000 Spectra Energy $ 279,000
National Propane Gas Association $ 242,000
National Petrochemical & Refiners Association $ 240,000
Nexen , Inc $ 230,000
Denbury Resources $ 200,000
Nisource , Inc $ 180,000
Petroleum Marketers Association of America $ 170,000
Valero Energy Corporation $ 160,000
Bituminous Coal Operators Association $ 131,000
Natural Gas Supply Association $ 114,000
Tesoro Companies $ 119,000
Here are the environmental groups that spent more than $ 100,000 :
Environmental Defense Action Fund $ 937,500
Nature Conservancy $ 650,000
Natural Resources Defense Council $ 277,000
Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund $ 243,000
National Parks and Conservation Association $ 175,000
Sierra Club $ 120,000
Defenders of Wildlife $ 120,000
Environmental Defense Fund $ 100,000
If you add it all up , the fossil fuel industry outspent the environmental groups by $ 36.8 million to $ 2.6 million in the second quarter , a factor of 14 to 1 .
To be fair , not all of that lobbying is climate change lobbying , but that affects both sets of numbers .
The numbers do n't even include lobbying money from other industries lobbying against climate change , such as the auto industry , U.S. Chamber of Commerce , etc .
Corporate profits vs. corporate social responsibility
I 'm sure I 've left the impression that I disapprove of what the Manufactured Doubt industry is doing .
On the contrary , I believe that for the most part , the corporations involved have little choice under the law but to protect their profits by pursuing Manufactured Doubt campaigns , as long as they are legal .
The law in all 50 U.S. states has a provision similar to Maine 's section 716 , " The directors and officers of a corporation shall exercise their powers and discharge their duties with a view to the interest of the corporation and of the shareholders " .
There is no clause at the end that adds , " ... but not at the expense of the environment , human rights , the public safety , the communities in which the corporation operates , or the dignity of employees " .
The law makes a company 's board of directors legally liable for " breach of fiduciary responsibility " if they knowingly manage a company in a way that reduces profits .
Shareholders can and have sued companies for being overly socially responsible , and not paying enough attention to the bottom line .
We can reward corporations that are managed in a socially responsible way with our business and give them incentives to act thusly , but there are limits to how far Corporate Socially Responsibility ( CSR ) can go .
For example , car manufacturer Henry Ford was successfully sued by stockholders in 1919 for raising the minimum wage of his workers to $ 5 per day .
The courts declared that , while Ford 's humanitarian sentiments about his employees were nice , his business existed to make profits for its stockholders .
So , what is needed is a fundamental change to the laws regarding the purpose of a corporation , or new regulations forcing corporations to limit Manufactured Doubt campaigns .
Legislation has been introduced in Minnesota to create a new section of law for an alternative kind of corporation , the SR ( Socially Responsible ) corporation , but it would be a long uphill battle to get such legislation passed in all 50 states .
Increased regulation limiting Manufactured Doubt campaigns is possible to do for drugs and hazardous chemicals -- Doubt is Their Product has some excellent suggestions on that , with the first principle being , " use the best science available ; do not demand certainty where it does not and cannot exist " .
However , I think such legislation would be difficult to implement for environmental crises such as global warming .
In the end , we 're stuck with the current system , forced to make critical decisions affecting all of humanity in the face of the Frankenstein monster our corporate system of law has created -- the most vigorous and well - funded disinformation campaign against science ever conducted .
by Brett Stevens on December 15 , 2009
In the annals of human bungling over our wholesale destruction of our environment , the follies will be recorded as first hinging on a strawman ( global warming ) until people noted that , at the root of all problems , was one we have denied for its social unpopularity for too long :
Overpopulation .
It used to be my litmus test .
When someone started bloviating about how “ green ” they were , I ’d ask what their view on overpopulation was .
Suddenly they ’d change from bold activist to meek suggestion box volunteer .
Education was the answer , they invariably said , and suggested that we educate people to have fewer children .
When I asked how well that had worked for the last 40 years , there was silence .
The unpopular truth is that education only works if the educatee has the congenital intelligence to appreciate what ’s being taught .
We can train anyone to do just about anything , if there ’s an immediate reward for it , like on the job training .
But we ca n’t convince them it ’s a good idea unless they have the brains for it .
Every idea matches an intelligence level and above ; if someone is below that level , the idea seems to them like magic , silliness or witchcraft and they ignore it when at home .
This means that people are going to have kids as becomes convenient to their mindset , and we cannot count on them to be rational , because if they were rational , they would n’t be in this fix already .
For this reason , education is not the solution to overpopulation .
But after the Chinese introduced this idea at the Copenhagen talks , more media focus has come to bear on the simple thought : what if we had a one - child policy for all couples ?
The “ inconvenient truth ” overhanging the UN ’s Copenhagen conference is not that the climate is warming or cooling , but that humans are overpopulating the world .
A planetary law , such as China ’s one - child policy , is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birthrate currently , which is one million births every four days .
The world ’s other species , vegetation , resources , oceans , arable land , water supplies and atmosphere are being destroyed and pushed out of existence as a result of humanity ’s soaring reproduction rate .
Financial Post
Humans are not rational creatures .
We are social creatures , and fashion our rationality to look good to others .
At least , unless we have a clear hierarchy , goal and culture to back us up so it ’s not us , personally , against someone else , with no support for what we ’re doing except “ I personally thought it was a good idea . ”
Individual fear of conflict rules us and given our history , that ’s understandable .
I support the one - child rule .
The left will tell me that it ’s fascist because I have imposed the will of the State on the individual .
The right will tell me that it ’s Communist ( and / or Nazi ) because I have imposed the needs of the collective on the individual .
I have news for these idiots : we are inherently collective , because we are a civilization .
That ’s collectivism .
We are inherently serving the State , because the state is how centralized authority works , and without it we have anarchy — not the fun kind , but the L.A. riots kind where after you ’ve been robbed and raped someone burns your home down .
Wake up call — smell the coffee ! — this is life , not your advanced literary meta - theory about the theory of theory , theoretically , class .
Life is combat .
Life is struggle .
Life is individuals trying to get ahead of other individuals … unless , of course , they ’re on the same team and share the same struggle .
Although it ’s hard for most voters to grasp , we ’re on many teams at once .
One team is the “ Residents of Planet Earth ” team .
We need to not destroy this place , and that means not crippling the ecosystems that replenish air , water , plants and animals .
( That ’s not the primary reason to be green , but my thoughts on that are so controversial that none of you will support me . )
I support the one - child rule , with one caveat :
Let those who are more productive , more intelligent , of better character or just nicer breed more .
The world needs more Jim and Michelle Duggar , who are raising 19 or so healthy youngsters of above - average intelligence , strong moral background and responsible lifestyle .
It needs fewer broken , neurotic , narcissistic , hedonistic , beliefless , soulless , resentful and below - average people breeding .
These people contribute nothing but the ability to do most of a task if pointed out to them in detail , which means that when they ’re not watched , they do stupid and destructive things like litter , buy junk products , vote for morons , and so on .
The one - child policy is a great idea if we pair it with a policy that rewards good people by allowing them to have more children .
Let ’s not cut humanity back equally .
Let ’s cut back on everything but the areas where we are succeeding .
Because that ’s how history will measure us , and how we ’ll find a way to survive in the future .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – The Obama administration announced today that it will purchase the Thomson Correctional Center in Illinois for the purpose of holding some of the detainees currently remaining at Guantánamo .
Though the administration is leaving unsaid which detainees will be moved there and for what purposes , the information it has provided indicates that some detainees might be held for military commission proceedings in Illinois while others might be held at Thomson indefinitely without charge or trial .
The administration has stated that " any detainees at Guantánamo who continue to be held , and for whom no prosecution is planned , will be held only under authority granted by Congress in 2001 under the Authorization for Use of Military Force , as informed by the law of war . "
However , the so - called war on terrorism is not a traditional war , having no temporal or geographical boundaries .
The following can be attributed to Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU :
" The creation of a ' Gitmo North ' in Illinois is hardly a meaningful step forward .
Shutting down Guantánamo will be nothing more than a symbolic gesture if we continue its lawless policies onshore .
" Alarmingly , all indications are that the administration plans to continue its predecessor 's policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial for some detainees , with only a change of location .
Such a policy is completely at odds with our democratic commitment to due process and human rights whether it 's occurring in Cuba or in Illinois .
In fact , while the Obama administration inherited the Guantánamo debacle , this current move is its own affirmative adoption of those policies .
It is unimaginable that the Obama administration is using the same justification as the Bush administration used to undercut centuries of legal jurisprudence and the principle of innocent until proven guilty and the right to confront one 's accusers .
" It is also greatly disturbing that the administration will continue the use of military commissions , which are no more acceptable in Illinois or any other U.S. state than in Guantánamo .
Despite some improvements , the commissions still fall far short of the legal standards necessary to comply with constitutional and international standards , allowing , for example , the use of coerced and hearsay evidence that would not be allowed in federal court .
The proceedings will achieve neither reliable justice nor a restoration of America 's credibility around the world .
" The administration must also make very clear what category of detainee will be transferred to Thomson in the future and what kind of prison conditions will apply .
Detainees not charged with a crime should not be subject to punitive conditions meant for sentenced prisoners who have been found guilty in a court of law , and all conditions must comply with the Geneva Conventions .
" The administration will no doubt be looking to Congress for legislative buy - in for this facility , and as both branches work together , we strongly urge lawmakers to legislate responsibly and not set any policies or precedents for indefinite detention on U.S. soil , or create any violation of the Geneva Conventions .
" The Obama administration 's announcement today contradicts everything the president has said about the need for America to return to leading with its values .
American values do not contemplate disregarding our Constitution and skirting the criminal justice system .
After detaining hundreds of individuals without the basic due process rights that define our justice system for almost eight years , it is time to charge suspects where evidence exists and repatriate and transfer the rest to countries where they wo n't be tortured . "
Getting started
When I saw that Dr. Jekyll 's Pub in Oslo was arranging a tasting with Brewdog , featuring their Tactical Nuclear Penguin beer , the world 's strongest at 32 % , I knew I had to go .
Unsurprisingly , so did Knut Albert ( his blog posting is here ) and Geir Ove .
The tasting was given by James Watt , who is responsible for Brewdog 's marketing .
They had a line - up of six beers for us to try , of which I 'd already tried the first four .
These were :
77 Lager ( 4.7 % ) : an interesting lager , very bitter , and dominated by crisp citric US hops .
Zeitgeist ( 4.9 % ) : a Schwarzbier which mixes the usual burnt roastiness with resiny hops .
Highly drinkable .
Punk IPA ( 6.1 % ) : a relatively thin - bodied IPA , also dominated by crisp citric US and New Zealand hops .
Riptide Imperial Stout ( 8 % ) : strong , rich , full - bodied dark roasty stout , fairly sweet .
All of these are very good beers that I 'd be happy to drink any time .
My favourite would probably have to be the Riptide , although at that strength it 's obviously not a session beer , but more of a sipper .
I was really curious about the fifth , Nanny State , as it was their weakest ever beer at 1 % , and yet also the most bitter ( theoretically at 200 IBU ) .
It 's really a stunt beer , done to make a point , after Tokyo* ( at 18 % ) was banned by the Portman Group .
James said they 'd put in no less than 7 kinds of dark malts in order to fill out the body as much as possible at 1 % , but even so it 's a thin , dry beer totally dominated by hop aroma and bitterness .
James described it as " hop tea " and that really summarizes it fairly well .
The malt presence is barely detectable , making for an interesting experience , but this is really even less of a session beer than Riptide .
( And much less enjoyable , I 'd argue . )
Finally , we were ready to tackle the Penguin .
Each bottle comes in a brown paper wrapping ( highly appropriate ! ) with a hand - drawn penguin on it .
Inside the bottle has the normal Brewdog look , with a label similar to those in the Paradox series .
James
Watt speaking
The beer is really just a 10 % imperial stout , stored for 8 months in Isle of Arran whisky casks , and then another 8 months in Islay whisky casks .
At this point it was a beer ready to fit right into the Paradox series of whisky - cask stored beers .
However , instead , they drove some of it to a local ice cream factory where it was frozen several times over three weeks .
Each time , the frozen water was removed , leaving behind sugar , alcohol , hop oils , and all the taste .
So each freezing simply concentrates the remaining beer more .
Beer is normally defined as an undistilled alcoholic drink made from fermented grain , but this method of distillation has historically been common with a type of strong German bocks called Eisbocks ( ice bocks ) .
Because these generally get no stronger than about 10 % , because of the historical tradition , and because so much of the beer is left behind when you remove the ice , beers distilled by freezing tend to still be regarded as beer .
The normal method of distillation , used to produce whisky , cognac and so on , is through heating , where the alcoholic vapour is captured through condensation .
The Germans actually distill beer in this way , too , and call the result bierbrand .
Bierbrand generally is about 40 % alcohol .
This method of distillation really changes the nature of the drink fundamentally , and so bierbrand tends not to be regarded as beer , but more akin to liqueur or whisky .
So is the Penguin really the world 's strongest beer ?
I can't say I really care that much , but personally I do n't think so .
Once you 've distilled the beer then it's no longer beer in my book .
And even if you consider it beer , it still should n't be compared for strength with undistilled beers .
If you do allow freeze distillation , then , yes , it is the strongest , for now .
But what does it taste like ?
Well , the comparison with whisky is really quite apt .
For one thing , it 's dominated by the same intense alcohol bite and aroma .
For another , the smoky peatiness of the whisky casks comes through as well .
The freezing really has concentrated it , giving it a dense syrupy mouthfeel .
But underneath all that one can still make out the flavour of the original Imperial Stout : salty , roasty , earthy , and chocolatey .
The aftertaste is surprisingly bitter and smoky .
Overall , I thought it was quite good , but too dominated by the alcohol to really be a beer in the conventional sense of the term .
I 'm not too fond of strong alcohol , and so while I could certainly drink this again I would n't do so very often .
It is a quite good drink , but something I 'd only try on rare occasions .
Even so , I 'm happy to have tried this , and glad that Brewdog made this " beer " , as it's an interesting experiment and definitely worth trying .
For those of you intrigued by this posting , however , I have bad news .
They made only 500 bottles , and they are only sold in two off - licenses .
One is in London ( and I do n't know where ) , while the other is in Edinburgh ( and I think it 's fair to guess that it must be Cornelius ) .
why you ’re probably intuitively wrong
Some engineers are convinced that neurons work the same way as circuits .
Neuroscience begs to differ .
Back in May , I wrote a post about the myriad of problems with the concept of mind uploading and contrasting the differences between human brains and computers .
As you can probably imagine , Singularitarians were n’t very happy with the argument and the president of the Singularity Institute , Michael Vassar , tried to prove me wrong during one of our public debates .
And recently , Singularity blogger and developer Jake Cannell threw in his thoughts about mind uploading with a thought experiment he says proves that mind uploading really is possible and your brain could be either turned into a machine , or transferred over to one in the eventual future .
Believe it or not , I ’m still not swayed , especially when considering that his thought experiment involves some pretty radical assumptions that would keep most designers and engineers up at night all by themselves .
We ’ll start with his premise and work our way down to the details , so settle in for a little computer nerd fight …
The gradual neuron replacement scenario is a thought experiment which intuitively shows why the functionalist - materialistic view of mind is correct .
The scenario in question is of course the idea of replacing every neuron in one ’s brain with a nanobot which is designed to function just like normal , everyday , natural neurons .
Aside from the fact that this would require an incredible level of understanding of how our brain works and what every single neuron in it does , can anyone spot the problem with this statement ?
That ’s right , it ’s the intuitive part .
Your intuition is a terrible judge of how correct a certain concept is .
In fact , many things in science shown to be correct over centuries of experiments , observations and data are actually quite counterintuitive .
Do you feel like you ’re on a sphere spinning around its axis at over a thousand miles per hour ?
Does your intuition tell you that you ’re hurdling through a mostly empty , vast cosmos ?
Probably not .
Which is why you should n’t rely on it in science or technology .
If you really truly believe mind uploading is not possible …
Stop right there .
I do n’t “ believe ” that it ’s not possible but instead , I ’m well aware of the challenges involved as well as where our current technological achievements stand .
This is not something I just randomly woke up and decided , but deduced from my experience and education .
The nanotech neurons are functionally equivalent .
They [ will ] connect to the same synapses of the original neuron , and they perform the same functional roles .
Replace one neuron with a nanotech equivalent , and nothing changes — the rest of the brain does n’t notice .
Replaced one by one , your entire brain could be replaced with nanotech , but you would have the same information content , you would think the same thoughts , etc .
How do we know that ?
Has there ever been an experiment like this when we ’ve been able to conclusively look and decide that replacing your entire brain with nanobots would n’t change a thing ?
Since we ’re imagining a brand new type of technology , it ’s pretty safe to say that no , there ’s has n’t .
And since we ’re in imagination land , we can make our technology do anything we want and however we want it to .
It ’ll work perfectly in our mind but what happens when those designs are put on paper and turned into tangible machinery ?
So we can imagine all we want , but that ’s not the challenge .
The challenge is making this dream tech work in the real world .
Now imagine if these nanotech devices allowed you to interface with computing systems , transfer all of their internal state , and so on .
Your body could die , but the nanotech devices could continue functioning , even be removed from the skull , reform your brain in some other device , and connect you to a virtual reality environment — ala the matrix .
Again , yes , that all sounds plausible .
But this is sort of like saying that when we build warp drives we ’ll be free to roam the universe .
The technology does n’t exist yet , building it is a problematic endeavor and even if we do build it , there are major operational challenges to overcome and the whole thing could collapse into a black hole on us when there ’s a snag .
We ’re still in the dream world , not the reality we inhabit .
If [ materialistic ] functionalism is wrong , one of the following must be true : 1 . at some point during the neuron replacement you lose [ your conscious mind ] ( as stated this is impossible because the successful neuron replacement would n’t change brain function — so for this to be wrong you must choose a worthless definition of consciousness )
So wait , it ’s impossible for the designers to make a mistake , or for defective cyber neurons to wreak chaos on the organic parts of your brain ?
It ’s not like bugs or design flaws never happen .
If they did n’t , IT would be a far , far smaller field that it is today .
The imminent success of the replacement is hinged on our dream world of perfect technology and the argument is doubly rigged by telling us that any problems would be caused by new and “ worthless ” definitions of consciousness .
So I ’m talking about bugs and gaps in the required knowledge to make this all work and Mr. Cannell is wafting in the clouds of theoretical views of consciousness .
But such is almost always the case with Singularitarians .
2. you become a different , new conscious person ( again impossible unless you use a worthless definition of consciousness and identity )
And yet again , for him to be wrong , we need to choose some stupid , worthless , meaningless way to define an amorphous and hotly debated concept of consciousness .
What about neuron replacement mistakes acting a lot like the kind of brain damage that changes the personality of some brain trauma victims ?
That ’s not worth any merit from either a medical or technical standpoint ?
3. the gradual neuron replacement is somehow not allowed by the laws of physics ( not true from current theory ) .
All 3 are untenable , and so functionalism is correct .
Thus uploading is possible .
The last point is correct .
We can replace neurons and there ’s no law of physics or biology that will stop us .
But the statement that the two events above are untenable verge on the ridiculous since the justification for them is a nonexistent technology we have to imagine , and imagine that it works perfectly .
On top of that , we have to be completely resigned to the absolute statement that when we replace all the neurons in a human mind , we will get the same exact human mind at the end .
In the real world , this simply does n’t pass the smell test .
Nothing here proves that mind uploading is physically possible and will really work when we try to do it via replacing all the neurons in our brain .
Not only that , but this argument has the zeal of a religious proclamation in which faith in technology trumps the very real dangers and concerns of human error when putting it together and renders his main point virtually impossible to prove by an experiment .
Last month , I received a letter from American Airlines ’ Rewards Processing Center saying that I have 4735 miles that are about to expire and asking whether I ’d be interested in redeeming them for some magazine subscriptions .
These were the choices :
Magazine Issues Miles Needed Afar 6 600 Architectural Digest 12 800 Barron ’s 26 1700 Business Week 50 1600 Cat Fancy 12 500 Cigar Aficionado 6 400 Daily Variety 252 5500 Diabetes Forecast 12 500 ESPN the Magazine 26 500 Ebony and Jet 38 800 Elle 12 400 Entertainment Weekly 55 1300 Essence 12 500 Essence 2yrs 24 800 Fortune 25 1400 Golf Digest 12 700 Golf Magazine 12 700 Golfweek 45 1300 Martha Stewart Living 24 1400 Money 12 800 New York Magazine 46 700 Sports Illustrated 56 1400 SI and Golf Mag 68 1500 Sports Illustrated KIDS 12 1000 The Economist 51 3200 The Wall Street Journal 190 2800 US News & World Report 12 700 Variety 50 5500 Wine Spectator 15 900 Wired 12 400
Wow ! 30 different magazines !
How could I possibly decide…oh , wait !
Maybe I can use some analytical techniques to help me make a better decision … what ’s that thing called again … O.R .!!!
First , what do I want to accomplish ?
a) Get as many issues of whatever magazine as possible : this is what a dentist ’s office or any place with a waiting room might want to do .
Note that the WSJ subscription provides 190 issues , but let ’s say I only want to consider actual magazines .
One possible answer is to subscribe to ESPN the Magazine , Ebony and Jet , Entertainment Weekly , New York Magazine , and Sports Illustrated .
That will buy me 221 issues and use 4700 of my 4735 miles .
Just out of curiosity , I could have gotten 286 issues if I had n’t excluded the WSJ .
b ) Get as many different subscriptions as possible :
This one is easy .
Just pick the magazines that require the least number of miles .
One solution is Afar , Cat Fancy , Cigar Aficionado , Diabetes Forecast , ESPN the Magazine , Elle , Essence , US News & World Report , and Wired .
That ’s a total of 9 subscriptions , using 4500 of my 4735 miles ( a waste of 235 miles ) .
c ) Get the “ best ” 9 magazines you can afford : Since I know I can get 9 subscriptions , what are the 9 that make me use the most out of my 4735 miles ?
Maybe they ’ll constitute a better set of 9 than those I found in item ( b ) above ( positive correlation between quality and miles needed ? ) .
In this case the answer is to substitute New York Magazine for Essence in the set of 9 found in item ( b ) .
This alternative totals 144 issues and wastes only 35 miles .
d ) Get the 9 magazines that provide the largest total number of issues :
In that case I ’d want to go with Cat Fancy , Cigar Aficionado , Diabetes Forecast , ESPN the Magazine , Ebony and Jet , Elle , Essence , New York Magazine and Wired .
That ’s a total of 176 issues and a waste of 35 miles as well .
For those of you who are thinking “ who cares ? ” , do n’t let appearances fool you .
Say that I am United Way and 4735 is my budget ( in thousands of US $ ) .
There are 30 charities ( “ magazines ” ) asking me for money ( the “ miles needed ” ) and telling me that they will help a certain number of people ( the “ issues ” , in thousands ) .
If I fund the charities in rows 9 , 10 , 12 , 21 and 22 of the above table , I ’ll spend US $ 4,700,000 and help 221 thousand people .
That ’s the best I can do !
( if I am not allowed to fund the charity in row 26 ) .
Lots of other problems can be cast into this framework .
Another example : NASA is sending a spaceship to Mars .
My available miles are the spaceship ’s cargo capacity , the magazines are scientific experiments to be conducted in space ( each requiring equipment to be loaded into the spaceship ( the “ miles needed ” ) and promising a certain ( quantifiable ) scientific benefit ( the “ issues ” ) .
This a generic resource allocation problem and the mathematical model we have used here is called The 0 - 1 Knapsack Problem .
Technical Details :
Want to solve your own budget allocation problem ?
Here ’s how you can do it .
We have projects that require funding and a budget .
For each project , let be how much money it needs and let be its payoff ( e.g. lives saved ) .
Let the binary variable be equal to 1 if we decide to allocate money to project , and equal to zero otherwise .
The objective is to maximize the payoff .
The constraint is to respect the budget : .
This model also allows you to include some useful side constraints .
For example : “ if I fund project , then I must also fund project ” would be written as .
And “ if I fund project , then I cannot fund project “ , would become .
I ’ve talked about these kinds of logical conditions in another post .
Here ’s the AMPL file I used to solve the magazine problem and its variations .
Enjoy !
P.S. : Being an Economics major and an amazing cook , my wife requested The Economist and Martha Stewart Living ; that ’s what her objective function told her to do , I guess .

I take it , then , that you believe every name on the voter rolls is valid .
Every fraudulent vote disenfranchises a valid vote .
There is little doubt that there are more fraudulent votes than there are registered voters who were n't allowed to vote due to lack of ID .

Nope .
There 's a lot of dead wood , as everyone agrees , which is ( one of the reasons ) why there have been so many purges in those roles since the state computer database registration has been required by HAVA .
How many of those deadwood registrants " vote " ?
Almost none , as all legitimate experts , as well as DoJ reports , tend to agree .
Every fraudulent vote disenfranchises a valid vote .
Yup .
And every voter disenfranchised by overly draconian restrictions disenfranchises a valid vote and robs an American of their rights .
There is little doubt that there are more fraudulent votes than there are registered voters who were n't allowed to vote due to lack of ID .
" Little doubt " by who ?
Fox " News " viewers who 've been lied to about it ?
Perhaps , but nobody else who actually knows what they 're talking about .
FAR more voters are disenfranchised by suppressing legal votes than by non-existant voters voting .
It 's not even close .
Unless , of course , you 're a Fox " News " viewer and believe in John Fund and Glenn Beck more than actual SCIENCE and stuff .
But you are welcome to continue your delusions as you like .
Sadly , the result is Americans denied of their democratic rights .
All throughout history , people use different means of gestures to insult others – fingers , tongues , etc . but none of those have been considered illegal till recently when the highest court in Italy ruled sticking out your tongue as illegal .
The case brought before the Cassation Court involved a farmer whose tongue gesture was captured by a cellphone camera held by the neighbor with whom he was arguing .
The farmer , Carlo O. , had been convicted by a justice of the peace of insulting the neighbor , the Italian news agency ANSA reported .
The Cassation Court let stand the conviction and ordered Carlo O. to pay his neighbor ’s court costs of $ 1,863.81 .
He will also have to pay damages , which will be set in a different trial , the news agency said Friday .

Say the words “ gay cowboy ” and chances are the conversation will turn to “ Brokeback Mountain , ” the 2005 film starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal , and based on the Annie Proulx short story .
The Oscar - winning drama , which is set in the 1960s to ‘ 80s , highlighted a long - submerged facet of frontier culture .
But as a new series at the Autry National Center shows , the presence of homosexuals and transgender individuals in the American West is much older than the movie might lead you to think .
It is , in fact , almost as old as the West itself .
Take for instance the tale of One - Eyed Charlie .
A stagecoach driver known for his hard drinking and itchy trigger finger , Charlie worked for the California Stage Co. , where he earned his reputation as one of the best drivers in the wild West .
He traveled between Oregon and California and , the story goes , got his nickname when he lost an eye while attempting to shoe a horse .
Advertisement
But Charlie kept a secret that was revealed only after his death in 1879 .
When his body was being prepared , a coroner discovered that One - Eyed Charlie was actually a woman .
It turns out that Charlie , nee Charlotte Darkey Parkhurst , had passed much of her adult life as a man .
The discovery of her true gender became a local sensation .
And her story still fascinates U.S. historians , some of whom believe that she was the first woman to have voted in a presidential election , long before the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920 .
Stories like One - Eyed Charlie ’s will be part of the Autry series titled “ Out West , ” looking at the roles of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people in frontier history .
“ It does n’t just start with ‘ Brokeback Mountain . ’
In a way , the movie is an exclamation point to that history , ” said Stephen Aron , an executive director at the Autry .
Advertisement
The series is the first of its kind hosted by a Western - heritage museum , say people associated with the Autry .
It consists of a gallery tour , panel discussions , lectures and performances to be rolled out in four installments over the course of 12 months .
Dates for future events are being finalized .
Gregory Hinton , an independent historian who conceived and organized “ Out West ” for the museum , said the Autry was getting into potentially risky territory with the program .
“ They have conservative trustees they have to deal with , ” he said .
“ It has not been done without a lot of thought . ”
One aspect of “ Out West ” that the Autry handled with special care was the title .
An early suggestion was “ Gay and the West ” but the team at the museum rejected it partly because it was too “ hard - hitting , ” according to Hinton .
Officials at the museum said they disliked that title because it did n’t include bisexuals and transgender people .
Advertisement
Another title , “ Equality and the West , ” was rejected because it sounded too political .
So far , the Autry has n’t received any complaints about the series either from the public or internally , according to museum leaders .
One trustee they would n’t name voiced concern that the program might portray conservatives as bigots in the vein of the character played by Randy Quaid in “ Brokeback Mountain . ”
The first installment , which took place Sunday at the Autry , was a discussion titled “ What Ever Happened to Ennis Del Mar ? ”
The title refers to the Ledger character from “ Brokeback ” who lived a closeted life in rural Wyoming .
Sunday ’s panel , which included Times film critic Kenneth Turan , was inspired by an exhibition of two shirts worn by Ledger and Gyllenhaal in the film that went on display at the museum in the summer .
Advertisement
Public interest in the shirts was one of the main motivations for producing “ Out West , ” according to those involved with the project .
If “ Brokeback Mountain ” helped to open the frontier ’s closet door , the Autry is taking the next step by rummaging through the closet ’s contents and sharing what it finds with the public .
One of those findings is a pair of wooden “ buffalo ” chairs from 1841 that was commissioned by Scotsman William Drummond Stewart .
The Autry acquired the chairs in the early ‘ 90s but the museum has only recently learned about the history behind the artifacts .
Stewart , who hailed from a wealthy Scottish family , traveled the American West in the 1830s .
During his journeys , he met a French Canadian man named Antoine Clement , who eventually became his lover .
The two moved back to Stewart ’s castle but arranged for Clement to live as the butler so as not to raise questions .
“ It was a strange arrangement , that ’s for sure .
But in many ways , it was a necessary one , ” said Jim Wilke , the historian who brought the story to the Autry ’s attention .
Advertisement
He said the “ buffalo ” chairs were commissioned by Stewart to commemorate his days in the U.S.
The objects are made out of wood and feature carved buffalo heads with glass eyes .
The chairs will be part of “ Hidden Histories , ” the second installment of “ Out West ” scheduled for May that will include a gallery tour .
Patricia Nell Warren , a historian and author , said that same - sex relationships between cowboys were often tolerated in the early days of the West largely because manpower was scarce , thus making it impractical for landowners to be choosy about whom they hired .
But attitudes changed with the introduction of mechanized agriculture , which rendered human labor more expendable .
“ Tolerance went away after that , ” she said .
Today , the presence of gay men and women in rural America is not exactly embraced by the mainstream but people ’s perceptions have evolved .
James Pluth , a San Diego man who attended Sunday ’s panel , is a retiree who is actively involved in gay rodeo organizations .
He said his sexuality is a “ nonissue ” when it comes to working with straight rodeo associates .
Advertisement
But , he said that straight rodeo groups sometimes engage in Christian activities , such as group prayer and Bible study , that may make some gay participants feel uncomfortable .
“ Out West , ” which is budgeted at $ 25,000 -- modest for a museum program of this nature -- is still in the fundraising stage , though it has already attracted some big name contributors like HBO .
The series is expected to feature a segment on homosexuality and Native American cultures .
Organizers are planning to return to “ Brokeback Mountain ” with a performance of fiction and other literature written by “ Brokies ” -- an informal group of fans who strongly identify with the film .
Advertisement
Eric Hooper , who lives in San Jose , is a Brokie who said he has seen the movie 56 times in theaters , flying across the country to catch screenings at various festivals and events .
The movie came as a revelation , he said , after living in a city for most of his adult life .
“ That ’s what really struck me about ‘ Brokeback ’ -- it presented the possibility of being gay and living in rural America . ”

A former IT director for the Higley Unified School District suspected of downloading an alien - searching program is accused of installing its computer equipment at another school district and should face charges , Gilbert police said in a report obtained by The Arizona Republic .
After a nearly four - month investigation that encompassed Higley and Globe unified school districts , Gilbert police recommended prosecutors seek felony charges against former Higley Unified IT director Bradley Niesluchowski , including the spending of public money for personal use , computer tampering and the possession of lost or stolen items .
Niesluchowski , 38 , of Mesa , resigned in October days after Higley Unified officials confronted him with a list of policy violations detailed in a notice of termination with cause .
He also is accused of possessing thousands of dollars ' worth of Higley Unified equipment without permission .
The notice by Superintendent Denise Birdwell accused Niesluchowski of downloading pornography , stealing equipment to support his business and installing on thousands of Higley computers without authorization a University of California - Berkeley research program , BOINC , for the SETI@home project - the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence .
The SETI project involves millions of volunteers worldwide who have downloaded the program to search telescope - collected radio signals for signs of intelligent life .
The program runs like a screensaver , turning on whenever a computer is idle .
District officials allege Niesluchowski began installing the SETI program on district computers without administrators ' knowledge a month after he was hired in January 2000 .
They also said he disabled the shut - down mode on all of Higley Unified 's 4,900 computers so they would run 24 / 7 .
They blame the SETI program for interruptions in teacher lessons on electronic white boards and for excessive utility use , costing the district more than $ 1 million .
Niesluchowski denied all accusations in a recent lengthy e-mail to reporters and board members , saying he is the victim of a personal vendetta by Birdwell , in her first year as superintendent .
He also defended the SETI project .
Niesluchowski has not responded to calls or e-mails seeking comment .
Administrators demoted him in May from IT director to network - systems manager , cutting his annual salary 20 percent to about $ 70,000 .
As IT director , Niesluchowski had been in charge of purchasing decisions for technology districtwide .
No reason for demotion was mentioned in Higley Unified personnel documents obtained by The Republic .
District officials said it was because of districtwide budget reductions for state funding cuts .
However , they also wanted to make widespread improvements in Higley Unified technology and ended up hiring five contractors to do an audit .
Gilbert police report that through SETI network administrators , they learned Niesluchowski has been involved with the SETI project for nine years under the name " Nez . "
The account was linked to more than 9,500 IP addresses traced to computers at Higley and Globe unified school districts .
Nez is listed as the top project participant in online SETI statistics .
Police said Globe Unified officials told them Niesluchowski had worked as a consultant for their district on a $ 100,000 contract .
Globe Unified 's chief administrative officer , Ron Nelson , has not returned phone calls seeking comment .
During a warranted search of Niesluchowski's Mesa home Sept. 25 , police seized about 40 pieces of Higley - owned computer equipment and a BlackBerry that district officials said he had taken without authorization , a police report stated .

The NYPD shot and killed a CD vendor in Times Square this morning who was not only scamming tourists , but also packing a Mac - 10 , for chrissake .
The reaction of tourists : Awesome !
The 25 year - old victim was hanging around Times Square , who " would approach the tourists , ask them their names , write their names on the CDs and then demand payment of $ 10 . "
( Tourists : " Fuck are you fucking kidding me ?
Fuck away from me with that " is the proper response in this situation ) .
Cops chased the guy , and whoa , he whipped out a god damn Mac - 10 and started shooting , and then got shot to death .
Emer Rooney , 33 , a visitor from Ireland on the last day of a trip to New York , walked with a friend from a nearby hotel to take pictures of the scene ...
She cited the shooting , in fact , as one of the more exciting moments of her trip , including recovering lost luggage at the Port Authority Bus Terminal and getting tickets to the musical " Wicked . "
So all things considered here , most people in New York City still favor robbing tourists .
Give em the memory of a lifetime !
Converting sunlight to electricity might no longer mean large panels of photovoltaic cells atop flat surfaces like roofs .
Using zinc oxide nanostructures grown on optical fibers and coated with dye - sensitized solar cell materials , researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a new type of three - dimensional photovoltaic system .
The approach could allow PV systems to be hidden from view and located away from traditional locations such as rooftops .
“ Using this technology , we can make photovoltaic generators that are foldable , concealed and mobile , ” said Zhong Lin Wang , a Regents professor in the Georgia Tech School of Materials Science and Engineering .
“ Optical fiber could conduct sunlight into a building ’s walls where the nanostructures would convert it to electricity .
This is truly a three dimensional solar cell . ”
Details of the research were published in the early view of the journal Angewandte Chemie International on October 22 .
The work was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the KAUST Global Research Partnership and the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
Dye - sensitized solar cells use a photochemical system to generate electricity .
They are inexpensive to manufacture , flexible and mechanically robust , but their tradeoff for lower cost is conversion efficiency lower than that of silicon - based cells .
But using nanostructure arrays to increase the surface area available to convert light could help reduce the efficiency disadvantage , while giving architects and designers new options for incorporating PV into buildings , vehicles and even military equipment .
Fabrication of the new Georgia Tech PV system begins with optical fiber of the type used by the telecommunications industry to transport data .
First , the researchers remove the cladding layer , then apply a conductive coating to the surface of the fiber before seeding the surface with zinc oxide .
Next , they use established solution - based techniques to grow aligned zinc oxide nanowires around the fiber much like the bristles of a bottle brush .
The nanowires are then coated with the dye - sensitized materials that convert light to electricity .
Sunlight entering the optical fiber passes into the nanowires , where it interacts with the dye molecules to produce electrical current .
A liquid electrolyte between the nanowires collects the electrical charges .
The result is a hybrid nanowire / optical fiber system that can be up to six times as efficient as planar zinc oxide cells with the same surface area .
“ In each reflection within the fiber , the light has the opportunity to interact with the nanostructures that are coated with the dye molecules , ” Wang ( left ) explained .
“ You have multiple light reflections within the fiber , and multiple reflections within the nanostructures .
These interactions increase the likelihood that the light will interact with the dye molecules , and that increases the efficiency . ”
Wang and his research team have reached an efficiency of 3.3 percent and hope to reach 7 to 8 percent after surface modification .
While lower than silicon solar cells , this efficiency would be useful for practical energy harvesting .
If they can do that , the potentially lower cost of their approach could make it attractive for many applications .
By providing a larger area for gathering light , the technique would maximize the amount of energy produced from strong sunlight , as well as generate respectable power levels even in weak light .
The amount of light entering the optical fiber could be increased by using lenses to focus the incoming light , and the fiber - based solar cell has a very high saturation intensity , Wang said .
Wang believes this new structure will offer architects and product designers an alternative PV format for incorporating into other applications .
“ This will really provide some new options for photovoltaic systems , ” Wang said .
“ We could eliminate the aesthetic issues of PV arrays on building .
We can also envision PV systems for providing energy to parked vehicles , and for charging mobile military equipment where traditional arrays are n’t practical or you would n’t want to use them . ”
Wang and his research team , which includes Benjamin Weintraub and Yaguang Wei , have produced generators on optical fiber up to 20 centimeters in length .
“ The longer the better , ” said Wang , “ because longer the light can travel along the fiber , the more bounces it will make and more it will be absorbed . ”
Traditional quartz optical fiber has been used so far , but Wang would like to use less expensive polymer fiber to reduce the cost .
He is also considering other improvements , such as a better method for collecting the charges and a titanium oxide surface coating that could further boost efficiency .
Though it could be used for large PV systems , Wang does n’t expect his solar cells to replace silicon devices any time soon .
But he does believe they will broaden the potential applications for photovoltaic energy .
“ This is a different way to gather power from the sun , ” Wang said .
“ To meet our energy needs , we need all the approaches we can get . ”

Thanks for visiting !
Since August , I 've been on a quest to reduce the clutter in my life .
Back when I was a spendthrift , I bought a lot of Stuff .
Stuff comforted me .
When I was buying things ( even on credit ) , I felt wealthy .
Stuff does n't make me feel wealthy anymore — it makes me feel cramped .
With time , Stuff simply becomes clutter .
Slowly but surely , I 'm banishing excess belongings from my household .
I still sometimes buy more than I ought , but mostly I 've been guarding the borders of my life against the invasion of Stuff .
Here are some of the defenses I 've been employing :
I ignore the proverbial Joneses .
One of the most dangerous paths to clutter ( and to overspending ) is the urge to own the same things your friends do .
Peer pressure can be powerful .
I 've come to realize that lifestyles are not a competition .
What does it matter what others buy ?
I 'm content with what I have — more Stuff is not going to make me more happy .

What does it matter what others buy ?
I 'm content with what I have — more Stuff is not going to make me more happy .
If I do n't need it , I do n't buy it .
As I 've purged my Stuff over the past year , I 've been shocked by how many things I bought but never used .
I would see something in a store — a voice recorder , for example — and convince myself that I needed it .
Or I would tell myself , “ I might as well buy a jig saw — we 'll need one in the new house . ”
But I used the jig saw only once in four years ( on the day we moved in ) .
I never used the voice recorder at all !
These items are clutter , and were a waste of money .
I 've learned not to buy something unless I know I 'll use it .

I try to value experiences instead of things .
Make no mistake — experiences still cost money .
But a trip to England or the entrance fee to a marathon or a nice dinner with friends all share a common characteristic : they do n't take up space in my home .
I get value for my money , and there 's no residual Stuff .

I 'm trying to practice the one - in , one - out rule .
I 'll admit up front that I 'm not good at this , but Kris is trying to teach me .
I 'm attempting to keep a steady state of Stuff .
If I have , for example , twelve pairs of socks , and then buy another , I must get rid of one pair .
Practicing this rule prevents a build - up of Stuff .

I focus on quality .
It 's been difficult for me to realize that sometimes it makes sense to pay more for the things I buy .
My instinct is to buy whatever 's cheapest .
( And sometimes that is the best choice . )
But I 'm learning to base my purchase decisions on the value an item will give me .
Often it makes more sense to have one excellent expensive item than to have several lousy cheap ones .
The lousy items just become clutter .

I borrow and lend .
Shakespeare might have advised against it , but I 've found that by borrowing and lending things among friends , there 's less we each need to own .
I 've loaned out a drill , a rototiller , some golf clubs .
I 've borrowed books , a video camera , a lamp .
By sharing these items , we 're each able to have less Stuff in our lives .

I 've reduced my exposure to advertising .
Since I stopped watching television a few years ago , I buy much less Stuff .
But it 's not just television .
I used to enjoy reading the ads in magazines .
Now I try to ignore them .
The less I pay attention to advertising , the less I buy .
I do n't want to pretend like I have Stuff licked .
I do n't .
I 'm still especially susceptible to free and cheap things .
In the past year , for example , I 've dragged home :
A carload of scrap lumber I picked up for free .
( Admittedly , this did get used as a border to our garden . )
Several pieces of free exercise equipment that have remained unused in our garage .
A box of free books — books that I now realize I will never read .
Just because something is free or cheap does n't mean it 's a bargain .
If I do n't need it , I should n't bring it home .
Despite this weakness in my defenses , the tide of the battle has turned .
I 'm winning the war against Stuff .
There 's nothing wrong with owning Stuff that you use and value .
But when you accumulate Stuff that you never use , that 's a problem .
Guard your borders .
In his excellent The Joy of Simple Living , Jeff Davidson writes , “ By keeping watch over what enters your personal kingdom , you end having to initiate possession - purging exercises . ”
The best way to cope with Stuff is to never let it into your house .

President Barack Obama ’s top economic aide Christina Romer said Sunday the US jobless rate could rise further and that the improving US economy is not yet out of recession .
Asked if the 10 percent unemployment rate could go higher , Romer , who heads up the White House Council of Economic Advisers , told NBC : “ It could well . ”
“ These things certainly do bounce around .
I would anticipate some bumps in the road as we go ahead , ” she told the network ’s “ Meet the Press ” program , noting that jobs were a key element of the economic recovery .

“ The president has always said , and what I firmly believe , is you ’re not recovered until all of those people that want to work are back to work , ” said Romer .
“ For the people on Main Street and throughout this country , they are still suffering , the unemployment rate is still 10 percent .
“ I ’m not going to say the recession is over until the unemployment rate is down to normal levels … where we were before the recession — certainly in the five percent ” range , Romer said .
Her comments came with the US Congress poised later this week to take up a new jobs bill to confront the soaring US unemployment rate .
Obama and his Democratic allies , facing deep US public worry over unemployment running at a quarter - century high , have redoubled their efforts to tackle the problem ahead of the November 2010 mid-term elections .

Earlier this month , official figures showed the unemployment rate fell in November to 10.0 percent from 10.2 percent , suggesting that problems in the job market had peaked .
Speaking to CNN television Sunday , Lawrence Summers , director of the White House Economic Council , said jobs creation and the recovery were inextricably linked .
“ Look at the economic debate today .
People are talking about how much job creation there will be , and talking about the pace of the recovery from recession , ” said Summers , adding that measures undertaken by the administration so far have helped , although much more remains to be done .

“ We have a long way to go , ” Summer said .
“ We are starting to see the basic mechanism of recovery — people spend and that creates income for other people , and they spend , and that creates more income , and that creates more income and they spend .

“ That process of recovery is starting to engage , ” he told CNN .
It started with spam .
On a quiet August day in 2002 , a physics professor named George Gollin was working in his office at the University of Illinois when an ad popped up on his computer screen .
The product on offer : college degrees .
In a nearby computer lab , the ads leaped from one monitor to another , seeming to spread like a contagion .
The spam barrage was raging across the Urbana - Champaign campus .
" They were sending bazillions of them , for weeks , " Gollin recalls .
" It was like a telemarketer calling over and over . "
He decided to dial the phone number listed in the ad to find out who was behind the electronic assault .
Credentials Granted , by type .
Saint Regis and affiliated fake institutions sold more than 10,000 diplomas in about five years .
No one answered , so Gollin left a polite message .
A few days later he received a call from a man , speaking with what sounded like an Eastern European accent , who delivered a pitch for various degree options from Parkwood University .
Gollin , who is 56 and has a BA from Harvard and a PhD from Princeton , listened in amazement as the man cheerfully explained how , for about $ 4,400 , he could supply a PhD in systems engineering .
Or if that was n't to Gollin 's liking , he could offer a doctorate in Germanic languages .
Gollin chuckled and shook his head .
It was all rather amusing , the academic equivalent of a bad toupee — anyone who looked closely could see that it was a fake .
Still , Gollin 's curiosity was piqued , so he decided to look up Parkwood University online .
At first glance , the Web site resembled that of any liberal arts college , complete with links for information on student services , academics , and faculty .
But with some Googling , Gollin discovered that the course catalog for Parkwood had been copied wholesale from the University of Central Florida 's Web site .
He also found that the greeting from Parkwood 's supposed president appeared on the sites of five other schools , all of them apparent shams .
Gollin was still just poking around , more intrigued than outraged .
That changed when he stumbled upon news of a forensic psychologist who had purchased her degree .
" Here 's this person who 's untrained doing therapeutic interventions , " he says .
" I thought , ' Jesus , this is really bad . ' "
Soon he was Googling various fake university names and finding them on the rèsumès of people in education , business , and other respected professions .
He was venturing far afield from his life as a particle physicist , but Gollin just could n't stop digging .
Bogus degrees are nothing new .
Black markets in fake diplomas are known to have existed as far back as 14th - century Europe .
Today , so - called diploma mills based in the US sell roughly 200,000 degrees a year to customers around the globe .
By some estimates , they sell as many PhDs as are awarded by legitimate American universities .
( Heck , if you 're going to get a degree without doing any work , why not make it a doctorate ? )
Worldwide , the industry is thought to generate as much as $ 1 billion annually .
And the buyers are everywhere — the Pentagon , NASA , fire departments , hospitals — all of them quintessential frauds using fake degrees to pad rèsumès or score pay raises .
In 2003 and 2004 , the Government Accountability Office surveyed just a handful of agencies and found 463 federal employees with fraudulent degrees .
The diploma operations thrive in part because of a lack of centralized oversight of higher education in the US .
The Department of Education leaves the job of accreditation to a group of nongovernmental agencies , which in turn grant institutions the authority to award degrees .
All other rules , as well as penalties for fraud , are up to the individual states — which are often lax about enforcement .
( And no , the domain suffix .edu does n't guarantee authenticity . )
Fake institutions that pretend to be based abroad have an even easier time bringing in business and avoiding scrutiny .
Governments generally do n't challenge the legitimacy of universities accredited overseas , which is why many bogus degree mongers create the appearance that their schools are foreign entities offering classes on the Web .
And of course , the growing acceptance of online education has only provided more cover for this kind of scheme .
Modern diploma mills are also becoming increasingly industrious and sophisticated .
They might send spam to a million people at a time and provide detailed transcripts and verification services .
One of the latest tricks is establishing a fake accrediting agency to legitimize fake schools .
But one phony institution — a front called Saint Regis University — had something even better : the Liberian connection .
When the plane finally came to a stop at the end of the pockmarked airstrip outside Liberia 's capital , Monrovia , Richard Novak sighed with relief .
It was 2002 , and Liberia was still in the midst of civil war .
During the hour - long taxi ride into the city , the former car salesman marveled at the lush forest along the edge of the road .
" It was beautiful , " he says .
" I mean , this was the African jungle , man . "
Monrovia , however , was less lovely .
The filthy city was thick with automobile carcasses and smashed buildings .
He could hear gunfire at night .
Novak , now 61 , has a small head , closely cropped gray hair , and a rodentlike smile .
Posing as a camera - toting tourist , he spent his free time wandering around town , eating little but rice and shrimp — by his estimation the least hazardous meal — and drinking Ghanaian beer .
His mission in Liberia was to bribe government officials to accredit a string of " universities " created by his employer , a woman named Dixie Randock .
The Liberian connection had been made earlier that year , when Novak — on instructions from Randock — traveled to Washington , DC , for a meeting at the Liberian embassy .
There , Novak sat down with Abdulah Dunbar , the deputy chief of mission .
For the right price , Dunbar said , he could arrange credentials for Saint Regis and other fake schools .
Over a period of months , Novak commuted to DC from his home near Phoenix to meet with the diplomat .
Novak would buy dinner at La Tomate , an upscale Italian restaurant in Dupont Circle , and the two men would map out arrangements for the degree scheme .
Physics professor George Gollin helped the Secret Service nab a multimillion - dollar diploma mill .
But Randock decided she needed more official - looking documents , so she dispatched Novak to Liberia to nail down the government connection .
Before long , they were in cahoots with a minister of justice , a foreign minister , the director of the National Commission for Higher Education , and the country 's deputy chief of mission at the embassy in Ghana , among others .
They also got the Liberians to bless an entity called the National Board of Education , which would offer accreditation to other diploma mills for $ 50,000 a pop .
Novak reveled in his new role as a jet - setting higher - ed consultant .
He was even invited to the Liberian presidential mansion for the inauguration of an interim leader produced by the civil war .
Meanwhile , his boss was making millions and looking for new opportunities in Italy and India .
Who knows what other international adventures Novak might have had if not for one nosy quark - jockey in Illinois ?
Following his early encounters with Parkwood University , Gollin began spending a few hours here and there hunting down information on fake schools .
He posted the findings on his faculty Web site , including obviously pilfered course catalogs , stock photos that appeared on the sites of multiple sham universities , copies of emails sent to suspected perpetrators , and links to media stories about bogus degrees .
He collected telephone numbers shared by different universities and documented mail addresses ( usually just post office boxes ) that contradicted both the addresses of domain name registrants and the advertised locations of university campuses .
Piece by piece , Gollin was charting the murky world of diploma mills .
His Web site , which once featured only the usual CV , course syllabi , and office hours , became an exhaustive repository of investigative data on phony schools and their operators .
As his fascination grew , Gollin began running experiments .
He wrote to one university asking whether his PhD thesis in physics would qualify him for a PhD in aerospace engineering .
( Answer : Yes , for just $ 1,235 . )
For a Saint Regis degree , he completed a multiple - choice test that included stumpers like identifying the building where the US president resides .
Gollin intentionally answered 79 of the 100 questions incorrectly .
Not to worry , wrote " Advisor Pat " in a chipper email from Saint Regis .
His test score translated to an improbable 2.7 grade point average , qualifying him for an associate of arts degree .
As Gollin continued amassing his online information bank , he also rattled the cages of education watchdogs and began nurturing relationships with journalists who might take an interest in the topic .
Officials in Germany , Sweden , Australia , and other countries began seeking his help to learn more about diploma mills .
What was once a sideline had morphed into a full - fledged obsession .
On September 2 , 2003 , a number of administrators at the University of Illinois received an email with the subject line " Inaccurate Statements and Unauthorized Copying of Content . "
It alleged that Gollin was using his university - hosted Web site to make erroneous claims about three Liberian schools ( including Saint Regis ) and the National Board of Education .
The correspondence came from what might be taken for an official Liberian government address — gov@liberiaembassy.com — and was also sent to the university 's legal office .
Two weeks later , Gollin was summoned to a meeting with the school 's lawyer and top administrators .
They quickly got down to business :
The email may have been garbage and the institutions it mentioned shams —
Gollin said they were and insisted he could prove it — but the situation called for prudence .
They ordered him to take down the contentious postings immediately .
The message : Stick to teaching physics , George .
Gollin was livid .
No one had openly said his job was in jeopardy , but he was shaken by the administrators ' stance .
He believed that collecting data about bogus colleges and universities fell well within the scope of faculty public service .
After the meeting , Gollin joined the American Association of University Professors , which aids academics in disputes over free speech .
He also went to the press .
A few weeks later , a story in The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that the University of Illinois had muzzled a tenured professor .
Embarrassed , the administration reversed its decision .
The skirmish was over , but for Gollin it had ignited a new battle .
Not against his employer but against the hustlers selling degrees online — especially the ones who had so brazenly come after him , the people behind Saint Regis University .
He still had his life teaching physics in the heartland , but by September 2003 , Gollin had transformed from an academic into a defender of academic integrity .
" My anger about all this just stuck , " he says , as did his thirst for revenge .
" I was going to fuck them . "
In Post Falls , Idaho , just across the border from Washington , suite 8B of a blue - trimmed office building was humming .
A few employees surrounded by stacks of fraudulent documents busily corresponded with customers , processed credit cards , copied transcripts , answered calls , and mailed degrees to " graduates " all over the globe .
The office was stocked with gold seals bearing the imprints of Saint Regis and James Monroe Universities , embossing devices , rubber stamps carrying the imprimatur of an " Official Transcript Verification Center , " and unsigned diplomas for degrees in construction management , clinical hypnotherapy , biomedical laboratory science , and other fields .
( The staff was instructed never to send degrees to the few states where officials might be on the lookout for diploma mills — and , because of Gollin , never to send anything to Illinois . )
At its peak , Dixie Randock 's empire consisted of dozens of online aliases , more than 100 domain names , at least 21 supposed degree - granting entities , and a diploma - counterfeiting operation .
She even had offshore bank accounts in the Caribbean .
Altogether , authorities believe , the operation took in more than $ 7 million from sales of bogus credentials to some 9,600 customers in 131 countries .
Randock rarely spent time in the Idaho office suite .
She and her husband , Steve , lived about 30 miles away , near Spokane , Washington , in a white single - story home with a gabled roof .
At one point , Dixie had been a real estate broker and Steve sold manufactured homes .
But for years , the couple had been dabbling in Web - based enterprises .
They tried selling registry certificates to people who wanted to name celestial bodies ; they ran a site where , for $ 50 , you could register sightings of " mysterious , unexplained phenomena " like Bigfoot and UFOs .
How Dixie , a high school dropout , became the brains behind a multimillion - dollar fake - diploma syndicate is unclear .
But she excelled at it , adroitly deploying the people around her to carry out her intricate schemes .
Steve handled the books , and Novak , Dixie 's high school sweetheart , was the bribe man .
A local printer helped with the counterfeit degrees , an IT guy managed the Web sites , and Dixie 's daughter and two other women answered phones , mailed documents , signed diplomas , and ran the photocopiers .
But it was Dixie who truly understood the market for academic bona fides and how to exploit the flimsy accreditation system .
In January 2004 , Gollin completed a report on diploma mills — nearly 100 pages of documentation backed by more than 400 archived files — and sent it to the Federal Trade Commission , imploring the agency to open investigations .
The FTC passed , saying Saint Regis was n't a big enough fish to warrant federal resources .
But that spring , a newspaper in Georgia reported that 10 local schoolteachers and a school principal had been outed for purchasing fake degrees from Saint Regis University .
A few months later , Regis University , a legitimate school in Denver , filed a lawsuit against the Randocks for violating its trademark .
For the first time , Gollin began to believe that Saint Regis was headed for a fall .
He just needed to give it a little push .
A few months later , his chance came .
An Indianapolis television station ran a story about dozens of United Auto Workers members who were " enrolled " at Saint Regis University .
( A local foundry was facing layoffs , and Chrysler , with the help of the UAW , was offering tuition aid to assist workers in training for new careers . )
In one segment of the story , Jeff Weber of Indiana 's Commission on Proprietary Education told a TV reporter that he could n't go after Saint Regis itself because the operation was based overseas .
Seeing an opportunity to tighten the noose around the Randocks , Gollin got on the phone to Weber .
" They 're not in Africa , " he explained .
" They 're in Spokane .
You should ask the attorney general of Washington to prosecute . "
Weber did just that .
When the attorney general , Christine Gregoire , did n't follow up on the request , Gollin sent Weber 's letter to a reporter at Spokane 's Spokesman - Review .
The paper published a story describing the Indiana incident , Washington 's homegrown criminal organization , and the government 's inaction .
Soon afterward , the attorney general 's office ordered an investigation .
The probe was dubbed Operation Gold Seal .
Because it was likely to span state and national boundaries , Washington state officials urged the Secret Service to join the investigation .
Prosecutors provided a massively tangled , almost fractal chart prepared by Gollin that depicted a vast network of players , university names , mailing addresses , domain names , and ISPs — all linked back to the Randocks .
The federal agents were stunned by the extent of it .
They signed on to the case .
To go after the Randocks , the Secret Service used online aliases to purchase degrees and then followed up as fictitious employers ostensibly verifying credentials .
The most valuable evidence for investigators came in response to inquiries from an invented character named Mohammed Syed , who sounded like a terrorist plucked from a Hollywood script .
The supposed former Syrian army chemical engineer successfully purchased three degrees for a total of $ 1,277 .
The finale was a sting operation at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington , DC .
An agent pretending to be a shady entrepreneur interested in working a deal with the Randocks arranged the meeting .
Dixie sent Novak .
At various times during his missions for Saint Regis , Novak had been identified as an international consultant , a chief provost , a professor , a doctor of gerontology , and a registrar .
But in suite 230 on the afternoon of July 7 , 2005 , Dixie Randock 's high school sweetheart was once again the chatty salesman .
He boasted about how he had secured an office in Monrovia to give the Saint Regis schools an aura of legitimacy and how he himself had once made upwards of $ 10,000 a month .
He said the only difference between a real university and a diploma mill was accreditation , and he explained how doing business in Africa was all about getting money into the right pockets .
Novak mentioned that Saint Regis had grown " huge " — until the efforts of a meddlesome physics professor had put a damper on the operation .
But that hiccup was easily remedied by switching to other school names , Novak assured his potential partner .
And for the right fee , he would gladly head back to Liberia to help get his new associate 's venture off the ground .
Novak never returned to Africa .
A few weeks later , just after sunrise , federal agents in Arizona banged on his front door .
Others descended on the Randocks ' home in Washington and the office suite in Idaho .
They seized computers , files , documents , printing and embossing equipment , and Dixie 's new Jaguar XK8 .
Facing serious prison time for bribing foreign officials , Novak agreed to cooperate as a government witness .
To help the investigators wade through the huge volume of data buried in the seized computers , Gollin , in a caffeine - fueled four - day blitz , wrote a program to comb files for letter strings like c - o - s - t , b - a - c - h - e - l - o-r , and a - m - o - u - n - t .
He also coded software that grouped relevant information about buyers — dates of purchase , amounts paid , degrees obtained .
The Secret Service agents in Spokane ran that program on the computers with Gollin on the phone for guidance and debugging help .
The final list of buyers , published by The Spokesman - Review , included a Bush White House staffer , a CIA employee , a US Department of Health oncology expert , a former US marshal , and a nuclear power company employee .
In February 2008 , the former marshal pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor , and some other cheats have been fired from their jobs .
But by and large , no one knows what happened to most of the buyers .
It 's up to employers to deal with their lying employees as they see fit .
The Randocks , meanwhile , pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud .
In the summer of 2008 , Dixie and Steve were each sentenced to three years in federal prison , where they reside today .
On the door to his university office , Gollin has taped the Randocks ' prison inmate numbers .
Inside , he erases equations from a blackboard and scribbles a spider 's web of names , notes , and online sites all relating to an outfit called St. Luke School of Medicine , which he believes sells bogus medical degrees .
" You get a real rise out of people when you talk about fake MDs , " he says .
Gollin made good on his vow to take down the Randocks and Saint Regis .
But in the process , he found a greater mission .
His aim now is to convince lawmakers that tougher criminal penalties are necessary to fight diploma mills .
In 2006 he was elected to the board of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation , and he recently teamed up with a congressperson from Minnesota to help draft a federal bill that would tighten the definition of an accredited institution .
He 's now on sabbatical from teaching and is writing a book about the rise and fall of Saint Regis .
But this morning , it 's back to the hunt .
Zeroing in on his latest target , George Gollin — particle physicist and diploma mill nemesis — picks up the telephone to chase down a new lead .
Contributing editor David Wolman ( david@david-wolman.com ) wrote about killing cash in issue 17.06 .
A lot of the effort involved in establishing a secure computing environment focuses on technological solutions , from providing warnings about phishing attacks to blocking the propagation of botnets .
But , as previous research has shown , security involves a significant human component .
Nowhere is that more true than the item at the heart of basic security : the humble password .
Here , our best practices — something that 's not in the dictionary or written down , differs for every account , etc. — ignores basic research , which shows that humans have a limited capacity to associate random text with , well , just about anything .
A new survey of institutional IT users provides a glimpse into just how bad the password situation is , with less than five percent of users managing to use best practices .
What is perhaps most striking about the new study , which is being published in the Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society , is its background section , which details just how long we 've been aware of the password problem .
It cites a study of Unix passwords from 1979 , which showed that about 30 percent of the passwords were four characters or less , and about 15 percent being words that appear in the dictionary .
Fast forward to 2006 , when a separate survey of 34,000 MySpace passwords revealed that the most common were " password1 " , " abc123 " , " myspace1 " , and " password " .
But it 's not simply that we have empirical evidence suggesting that passwords are easy to crack ; neuroscience has indicated that the human brain simply does n't perform well at free - associating text that , on its own , has little inherent meaning .
As one of the papers cited puts it , " the multiple - password management crisis [ can be viewed as ] a search and retrieval problem involving human beings ' long - term memory . "
And , although our long - term memory for images and words that we 've assigned meanings to is quite good , we do n't do as well with passwords , which ( ideally , at least ) should look like a near - random string of characters .
It 's another challenge entirely to remember which password to associate with a specific account .
So , there 's an obvious tension between what we know what we should do , and what actually can be done when it comes to passwords .
The authors of the new study conducted several focus groups with network administrators to identify likely sources of problems for users .
They used this information to craft a survey of password habits , which they administered to 836 employees of an organization that handled sensitive private data and provided all employees with computer security training .
Obviously , a more diverse survey population would have been nice , but the single employer at least allowed a degree of consistency in terms of the security training .
The authors condensed the results into a measure of how many deviations from ideal password practices a given user committed , such as using a short password , not mixing characters and symbols , writing the password down or reusing it , etc .
All told , only 4.4 percent avoided any deviations from the rules , and the majority violated three or more .
" In reality , " the authors note , " the results are probably worse , because respondents do not like to admit that they deviate from the rules . "
Experience made a difference , as expert and advanced computer users tended to outperform the novices .
But there were limits ; actual network administrators , for example , did n't behave in a manner that was significantly different from an average user .
One possibly disturbing development was noted : about seven percent of the respondents had become cynical about computer security , having decided that no amount of adherence to best practices would protect them from hackers .
Fortunately , this group seemed to be just as good ( or just as bad ) about using best practices as the rest of the population .
In a lot of ways , the results should n't surprise anyone , given what we know about the operation of human memory : if you give users a task that 's nearly impossible , they wo n't do it .
The fact that the organization involved handles sensitive data and trains its users on how to protect it does n't change that reality .
What the study may accomplish is to help drive home the need to stop expecting the impossible .
The authors suggest a variety of alternative authentication systems , from biometrics and hardware - based certification to systems that rely on aspects of memory that humans handle more easily , such as image - based systems .
Until IT administrators get over old habits , however , the availability of alternatives will have a limited impact .

PLUS : The lone Republican vote in favor ...

With the U.S. House having passed its version of a health care insurance bill ( H.R. 3962 [ PDF ] ) last night by a vote of 220 to 215 , it may be instructive to take a very quick look at a couple of the outlier votes from each party .
The bill passed with just two votes to spare , leading one to wonder if Republicans are having any regrets about having hosed their own party 's candidate in the NY - 23 special election last Tuesday when the two Congressional seats up for election --- the one in NY and another in CA --- both went to Democrats , but that 's another issue entirely .
Let 's take a look at the reasons offered by two candidates who bucked their own party 's in the historic
House vote last night , as each seem quite instructive on a number of levels ...
Republican Rep. Anh Cao Votes Yea
There was , of course , just 1 Republican vote in favor of the bill , out of 177 GOP House members .
That vote came from first - term Rep .
Anh " Joseph " Cao of Louisiana 's traditionally Democratic 2nd district .
Cao unseated scandal - plagued Democratic Rep. William Jefferson last November .
The district includes Orleans and Jefferson Parishes , both hit hard by Katrina nearly five years ago and still hurting .
Cao's vote in favor came after both the promise that Government would come between patients and their doctors in the form of the Republican - supported Stupak Amendment --- also supported and pushed by a number of anti-choice Democrats --- and some deal - making with the White House sealed , reportedly , by a personal call from Obama to Cao a few hours prior to the vote .
The Stupak Amendment re-stated the existing federal ban on tax - payer provided funding for abortion , and went further by banning abortion coverage , in all but cases of rape , incest and health of the mother , from the private insurance " exchange " that would be created via the bill .
This instance of legislating Big Government interference in decisions better left to patients and doctors was supported by all but one House Republican who voted " Present " instead .
While 64 Dems also voted in favor of the amendment , it 's fair to presume that a number of them likely did so with the realization that passage of the amendment would be crucial to overall passage of the bill , at least in the House .
" I felt last night 's decision was the proper decision for my district even though it was not the popular decision for my party , " Cao was quoted by CNN .
" A lot of my constituents are uninsured , a lot of them are poor ...
It was the right decision for the people of my district . "
In exchange for his vote , Cao asked Obama for , and presumably received assurances that " the administration would do more to help with ongoing disaster relief efforts in his New Orleans district , specifically by forgiving millions in disaster loans to the region , " according to CNN .
Cao 's full official statement explaining his vote attempts to step gingerly through several different potential mine fields .
What the White House or Democrats received in exchange for Cao 's vote is less clear , since the bill would have passed , with one vote to spare , instead of two , even without it --- particularly given the Republicans ' dual losses at the polls last Tuesday .
Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich Votes Nay
More of note , I suspect , at least in the years to come , is Ohio Democrat Rep.
Dennis Kucinich 's reasons for bucking his own party leadership to vote against the bill .
In a statement issued following passage of the bill ( full statement posted below ) , the progressive Democrat describes it as " a bailout under a blue cross " , given that it " would put the government in the role of accelerating the privatization of health care [ by ] requiring at least 21 million Americans to buy private health insurance from the very industry that causes costs to be so high , which will result in at least $ 70 billion in new annual revenue , much of which is coming from taxpayers . "
He also notes that the " ' robust public option ' which would have offered a modicum of competition to a monopolistic industry was whittled down from an initial potential enrollment of 129 million Americans to 6 million . "
Also , as Ernie Canning reported at The BRAD BLOG the week before last , the final house bill stripped Kucinich 's amendment --- passed in committee by a 27 to 19 vote , including 13 Republicans --- which would have allowed states to create their own single - payer health care plan if they had wished .
There was nary a peep about dropping that important attempt at state 's rights from any of the Republicans as far as I know , and Kucinich says it was done " at the request of the Administration . "
With all of the Tea Baggery and other idiotic , misinformed complaints about this bill , legitimate criticism of it that Republicans might have actually found common ground with Democrats on --- and , in the bargain , brought some actual conservative ideals to the bill , had actual conservatism played any role in their many pitiable months spent on street theater and sore - losery --- was all but thrown out the window vis a vis pathetic Fox " News " - fueled party politicking .
" This health care bill continues the redistribution of wealth to Wall Street at the expense of America 's manufacturing and service economies which suffer from costs other countries do not have to bear , " Kucinich notes in his statement , " especially the cost of health care .
America continues to stand out among all industrialized nations for its privatized health care system .
As a result , we are less competitive in steel , automotive , aerospace and shipping while other countries subsidize their exports in these areas through socializing the cost of health care . "
One almost entirely overlooked and completely misunderstood point amidst all the sturm und drang over the mandate for citizens to purchase health insurance , as included in both the House and Senate versions of the bill , is that it 's impossible to do away with private healthcare companies ' " pre-existing conditions " rules unless everyone buy into the system .
If not , only those who actually need health care would bother to buy insurance .
If " pre-existing conditions " cannot be used to keep you out of a private healthcare plan , then why would one waste money on insurance until the point that one actually needed medical care ?
Thus , the mandate requiring all to buy insurance .
Otherwise , only the sick would have insurance in large part , and there would be no way to afford it .
That is , of course , only the case when there is no single - payer plan , such as the one Kucinich and other Progressive Democrats have been fighting for for months , only to be completely shut out of the debate by both House and Senate leaders , as well as the White House .
Nonetheless , while that fight is largely lost for now , it will , almost assuredly , return in the future , as the failings of the private health insurance industry become more and more obvious and more and more costly on virtually every front .
" Notwithstanding the fate of H.R. 3962 , America will someday come to recognize the broad social and economic benefits of a not - for - profit , single - payer health care system , which is good for the American people and good for America 's businesses , with of course the notable exceptions being insurance and pharmaceuticals , " Kucinich avers in conclusion before linking folks again to his petition calling for the recognition of health care as a basic civil right in support of the House Progressive Caucus ' ignored - H.R. 676 " Medicare for All Act " , which is universal , single - payer health care legislation .
That petition notes several important points which may be appreciated either now or later , but at some point will all be understood by all but the most helplessly dis-informed Americans .
Therefore , we include them here , along with Kucinich 's statement today in full below them , largely for the historic record which , as noted , we 'll no doubt be returning to at some point in the future ...
Whereas , Universal Health Care was proposed by President Teddy Roosevelt in 1912 ; and Whereas today , nearly 100 years later , 47 million Americans are uninsured and another 50 million are underinsured bringing great social and economic harm to the American family ; and Whereas , HR 676 , authored by Congressmen John Conyers and Dennis Kucinich provides for Medicare for All , a universal , single payer , not - for - profit health care system which means the end of premiums , copays and deductibles ; and Whereas we are already paying for a universal standard of care but are not getting it because one of every three dollars in the health care system goes to the activities of the for - profit insurance system ; and Whereas HR676 firmly establishes health care as a Civil Right , consistent with the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States and Article 1 , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution which defines a purpose of government " to promote the General Welfare , "
You may sign that petition expressing your " STRONG SUPPORT FOR HR676 , SINGLE PAYER HEALTH CARE , AND THE PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR WHICH IT STANDS " , right here .
Kucinich 's full statement , explaining his vote last night against the Democratic House Health Care Insurance bill follows below ...
Congressman Kucinich addresses vote on H.R. 3962 ( November 7 , 2009 ) Congressman Dennis Kucinich after voting against H.R. 3962 addresses why he voted NO , stating : " We have been led to believe that we must make our health care choices only within the current structure of a predatory , for - profit insurance system which makes money not providing health care .
We cannot fault the insurance companies for being what they are .
But we can fault legislation in which the government incentivizes the perpetuation , indeed the strengthening , of the for - profit health insurance industry , the very source of the problem .
When health insurance companies deny care or raise premiums , co-pays and deductibles they are simply trying to make a profit .
That is our system . "
" Clearly , the insurance companies are the problem , not the solution .
They are driving up the cost of health care .
Because their massive bureaucracy avoids paying bills so effectively , they force hospitals and doctors to hire their own bureaucracy to fight the insurance companies to avoid getting stuck with an unfair share of the bills .
The result is that since 1970 , the number of physicians has increased by less than 200 % while the number of administrators has increased by 3000 % .
It is no wonder that 31 cents of every health care dollar goes to administrative costs , not toward providing care .
Even those with insurance are at risk .
The single biggest cause of bankruptcies in the U.S. is health insurance policies that do not cover you when you get sick . "
" But instead of working toward the elimination of for - profit insurance , H.R. 3962 would put the government in the role of accelerating the privatization of health care .
In H.R. 3962 , the government is requiring at least 21 million Americans to buy private health insurance from the very industry that causes costs to be so high , which will result in at least $ 70 billion in new annual revenue , much of which is coming from taxpayers .
This inevitably will lead to even more costs , more subsidies , and higher profits for insurance companies - a bailout under a blue cross . "
" By incurring only a new requirement to cover pre-existing conditions , a weakened public option , and a few other important but limited concessions , the health insurance companies are getting quite a deal .
The Center for American Progress ' blog , Think Progress , states , ' since the President signaled that he is backing away from the public option , health insurance stocks have been on the rise . '
Similarly , healthcare stocks rallied when Senator Max Baucus introduced a bill without a public option .
Bloomberg reports that Curtis Lane , a prominent health industry investor , predicted a few weeks ago that ' money will start flowing in again ' to health insurance stocks after passage of the legislation .
Investors.com last month reported that pharmacy benefit managers share prices are hitting all - time highs , with the only industry worry that the Administration would reverse its decision not to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices , leaving in place a Bush Administration policy . "
" During the debate , when the interests of insurance companies would have been effectively challenged , that challenge was turned back .
The ' robust public option ' which would have offered a modicum of competition to a monopolistic industry was whittled down from an initial potential enrollment of 129 million Americans to 6 million .
An amendment which would have protected the rights of states to pursue single - payer health care was stripped from the bill at the request of the Administration .
Looking ahead , we cringe at the prospect of even greater favors for insurance companies . "
" Recent rises in unemployment indicate a widening separation between the finance economy and the real economy .
The finance economy considers the health of Wall Street , rising corporate profits , and banks ' hoarding of cash , much of it from taxpayers , as sign of an economic recovery .
However in the real economy - in which most Americans live - the recession is not over .
Rising unemployment , business failures , bankruptcies and foreclosures are still hammering Main Street . "
" This health care bill continues the redistribution of wealth to Wall Street at the expense of America 's manufacturing and service economies which suffer from costs other countries do not have to bear , especially the cost of health care .
America continues to stand out among all industrialized nations for its privatized health care system .
As a result , we are less competitive in steel , automotive , aerospace and shipping while other countries subsidize their exports in these areas through socializing the cost of health care . "
" Notwithstanding the fate of H.R. 3962 , America will someday come to recognize the broad social and economic benefits of a not - for - profit , single - payer health care system , which is good for the American people and good for America 's businesses , with of course the notable exceptions being insurance and pharmaceuticals . "
In previous posts on Gossip Girl promotions and the New Beverly Hills 90210 , we ’ve argued that daily life is becoming increasingly pornified .
That is , features of the genre of pornography are being mainstreamed and porn is now , more than ever in modern history , everywhere .
I could n’t help but this of this concept of pornification when I investigated the Burger King Shower Cam website , sent in by Catrina C .
Text : “ Watch our shower babe shake her bits to the hits every morning . ”
Um , yeah , so everyday you can go to the website and watch a girl in a bikini sing a song in the shower ( do n’t miss the burger boobs ) .
You can also vote on the song and bikini for the next day , as well as enter into a contest for a date with the girl .
If you do n’t win the date , you may still be a lucky runner up and win Burger King “ proper man toiletries ” :
Yep , Burger King hygiene products .
Word on the street is that the products are a joke ; they actually smell like meat .
Has
Axe been so successful in using misogyny to pitch its products that Burger King feels that it must sell toiletries to fully get on the pornification bandwagon ?
I just do n’t know .
In any case , as A Sarah points out at the Shapely Prose , this is insulting to women and men both .
Apparently Burger King presumes men are stupid or shallow enough to be impressed by BKs facilitation of bit - shaking and , therefore , that the campaign will actually translate into a desire to consume their product ( as opposed to a desire to avoid it ) .
The fact that it ’s supposed to be funny does n’t make it better , it makes it worse .
Because , really , this is the kind of humor they think men respond to ?
“ Hahaha .
She ’s wearing a bikini and it looks like there are fried eggs on her boobs !
Hahaha ! ” “ Hahaha !
I smell like meat ! ” Dudes , Burger King thinks you ’re stupid .
Update : Munster has issued a new Black Friday report that includes e-commerce information .
It looks like Apple 's Web business was huge : Sales were up 39 % year - over - year on Black Friday , according to comScore , versus 11 % year - over - year growth for e-commerce in general .
Apple 's
Web traffic in general was only up 2 % year - over - year in November , so the Black Friday uptick is impressive .
Earlier : Apple 's Mac sales at Apple retail stores on Black Friday were down this year versus last year , according to research by Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster .
But in a note today , Munster says he still expects Apple to meet Street expectations for Dec. quarter Mac sales .
And anyway , December is much more important .
Munster 's staff visited 3 Apple retail stores on Black Friday .
On average , the stores were selling 8.3 Macs per hour , down from 13 Macs per hour last year .
Munster calls this " down slightly . "
But his statistics suggest a 36 % year - over - year drop -- more than slight .
Obviously some of this drop could be made up from there being more Apple stores now than a year ago .
Or online shopping , or more Mac sales early in November , or whatever .
But it still suggests a rather sharp drop for an otherwise consistent situation .
The good news for Apple is that Black Friday , while a headline shopping day , wo n't make or break its Dec. quarter numbers .
Nearly half of its quarterly sales come in December , Munster estimates .
Munster still thinks Apple will ship 2.8 million Macs this quarter , roughly in line with Street consensus .
He also thinks that estimate may " prove conservative . "
We 'd note that Apple still can't keep up with demand on its new high - end , quad - core , 27 - inch iMacs -- which suggests stronger - than - expected demand that could push many November sales into December .
Meanwhile , in a separate note , Morgan Stanley analyst Kathryn Huberty said Apple store foot traffic on Black Friday was " strong " and " similar to the last few years . "
She adds , " Anecdotally , Apple resellers , such as Best Buy , also saw solid Apple demand and some resellers offered slightly better discounts than the Apple stores . "
A Kentucky census worker found naked , bound with duct tape and hanging from a tree with " fed " scrawled on his chest killed himself but staged his death to make it look like a homicide , authorities said Tuesday .

in this undated photo .
FRANKFORT , Ky. ( AP )  A Kentucky census worker found naked , bound with duct tape and hanging from a tree with " fed " scrawled on his chest killed himself but staged his death to make it look like a homicide , authorities said Tuesday .
Bill Sparkman , 51 , was found strangled Sept. 12 with a rope around his neck near a cemetery in a heavily wooded area of the Daniel Boone National Forest in southeastern Kentucky .
Authorities said his wrists were loosely bound , his glasses were taped to his head and he was gagged .
Kentucky State Police Capt .
Lisa Rudzinski said an analysis found that " fed " was written " from the bottom up . "
He was touching the ground , and to survive " all Mr. Sparkman had to do at any time was stand up , " she said .
SEPTEMBER : Census surveys halted in rural Ky. county FRIENDS : Hanged Census worker loved children Authorities said Sparkman was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol at the time of his death .
His clothes were found in the bed of his nearby pickup .
" Our investigation , based on evidence and witness testimony , has concluded that Mr. Sparkman died during an intentional , self - inflicted act that was staged to appear as a homicide , " Rudzinski said .
Sparkman 's mother , Henrie Sparkman of Inverness , Fla. , bristled at the conclusion : " I disagree ! " she wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press .
Authorities said Sparkman alone manipulated the suicide scene , which was so elaborate that a man who discovered the body was convinced Sparkman was murdered .
Rudzinski said Sparkman " told a credible witness that he planned to commit suicide and provided details on how and when . "
Authorities would n't say who Sparkman told of his plan , but said Sparkman talked about it a week before his suicide and the person did not take him seriously .
He told the person he believed his lymphoma , which he had previously been treated for , had recurred , police said .
Sparkman also had recently taken out two accidental life insurance policies totaling $ 600,000 that would not pay out for suicide , authorities said .
One policy was taken out in late 2008 ; the other in May .
If Sparkman had been killed on the job , his family also would have been be eligible for up to $ 10,000 in death gratuity payments from the government .
Sparkman 's son , Josh , previously told AP that his father had named him as his life insurance beneficiary .
Josh Sparkman said earlier this month he found paperwork for the private life insurance policy among his father 's personal files but was n't sure of the amount .
Police would n't say who the beneficiary was .
The Census Bureau suspended door - to - door interviews in the rural area after Sparkman 's body was found , but a spokesman said normal operations would resume in Clay County next month .
Anti-government sentiment was initially one possibility in the death .
Authorities said Sparkman had discussed perceived negative views of the federal government in the county .
A friend of Sparkman's , Gilbert Acciardo , previously told AP that he warned Sparkman to be careful when he did his census work .
Acciardo , a retired Kentucky state trooper , said he told Sparkman people in the area would view him differently because he worked for the federal government .
" The death of our co-worker , William Sparkman , was a tragedy and remains a loss for the Census Bureau family .
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends , " said census spokesman Stephen Buckner .
Sparkman 's mother has said her son was an Eagle scout who moved to the area to be a local director for the Boy Scouts of America .
He later became a substitute teacher in Laurel County and supplemented that income as a census worker .
Friends and co-workers have said that even while undergoing chemotherapy for cancer , Sparkman would show up for work smiling with a toboggan cap to cover his balding head .
They said he was punctual and dependable .

By Eugene Robinson - December 31 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
It 's pathetic to break a New Year 's resolution before we even get to New Year 's Day , but here I go .
I had promised myself that I would do a better job of ignoring Dick Cheney 's corrosive and nonsensical outbursts -- that I would treat them , more or less , like the pearls of wisdom one hears from homeless people sitting in bus shelters .
But he is a former vice president , which gives him a big stage for his histrionic Rottweiler - in - Winter act .
It is never a good idea to let widely disseminated lies and distortions go unchallenged .
And the shrill screed that Cheney unloosed Wednesday is so full of outright mendacity that , well , my resolution will have to wait .
In a statement he gave to Politico , Cheney seemed to be trying to provide talking points for opponents of the Obama administration who -- incredibly -- would exploit the Christmas Day terrorist attack for political gain .
Cheney 's broadside opens with a big lie , which he then repeats throughout .
It is as if he believes that saying something over and over again , in a loud enough voice , magically makes it so .
" As I 've watched the events of the last few days it is clear once again that President Obama is trying to pretend we are not at war , " Cheney begins .
Flat - out untrue .
The fact is that Obama has said many times that we are at war against terrorists .
He said it as a candidate .
He said it in his inaugural address : " Our nation is at war against a far - reaching network of violence and hatred . "
He has said it since .
As Cheney well knows , unless he has lost even the most tenuous grip on reality , Obama 's commitment to warfare as an instrument in the fight against terrorism has won the president nothing but grief from the liberal wing of his party , with more certainly to come .
Has n't anyone told Cheney that Obama is sharply boosting troop levels in Afghanistan in an attempt to avoid losing a war that the Bush administration started but then practically abandoned ?
Cheney knows this .
But he goes on to use the big lie -- that Obama is " trying to pretend we are not at war " -- to bludgeon the new administration on a host of specific issues .
Here is the one that jumps out at me :
The president , Cheney claims , " seems to think that if he closes Guantanamo and releases the hard - core al - Qaeda - trained terrorists still there , we wo n't be at war . "
Interesting that Cheney should bring that up , because it now seems clear that the man accused of trying to blow up Northwest Flight 253 , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , was given training -- and probably the bomb itself , which involved plastic explosives sewn into his underwear -- by al - Qaeda operatives in Yemen .
It happens that at least two men who were released from Guantanamo appear to have gone on to play major roles as al - Qaeda lieutenants in Yemen .
Who let these dangerous people out of our custody ?
They were set free by the administration of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
The former vice president expresses his anger that the Obama administration is bringing Khalid Sheik Mohammed , the architect of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , to trial in New York .
Cheney is also angry that Obama does not use the phrase " war on terror " all the time , the way the Bush administration used to .
But Obama just specifies that we 're at war against a network of terrorists , on the sensible theory that it 's impossible to wage war against a tactic .
Toward the end of his two - paragraph statement , Cheney goes completely off the rails and starts fulminating about how Obama is seeking " social transformation -- the restructuring of American society . "
Somehow , this is supposed to be related to the president 's alleged disavowal of war -- which , of course , is n't real anyway .
It makes you wonder whether Cheney is just feeding the fantasies of the paranoid right or has actually joined the tea -party fringe .
I can find reasons to criticize the administration 's response to the Christmas Day attack .
Obama and his team were slow off the mark .
Their initial statements were weak .
Obama should n't have waited three days to speak publicly , and when he did he should have shown some emotion .
But using a terrorist attack to seek political gain ?
I have a New Year 's resolution to suggest for Cheney : Ahead of your quest for personal vindication , put country first .
Spending most of my childhood and adult life in landlocked Kansas , I confess to never having visited the Great White North that is Canada .
It 's not that I do n't want to , it 's just my summers are usually chock full of travel and winters ... well , I 've heard less than awesome things about Canadian winters .
Now that I 've beheld the glory that is Captain Newfoundland , however , I 'm struck with uncontrollable passport - obtaining urges .
I do n't know much about CN aside from what his trippy , disco- infused ' 70s NTV - created intro tells me .
Newfoundland is what 's left of Atlantis and he's the lone survivor ( from the stars ) , watching over the island with a power set similar to Doctor Strange meets Doctor Who 's " The Doctor " meets Marvel 's Celestials meet the Spectre .
Yeah , I know !
Dude is a bad mofo and apparently has ties to Captain Canada ( who I must admit I know even less about ) .
Tell you what , this is all so eye - opening to me that I 'm going to spend a few days reading up on this ish and trying to track down some comics .
I 'll get back to you .
For now , consider me a fan .
And every fan of Captain Newfoundland knows the Captain 's code :
This above all :
To thine own self be true !
[ Via @ StevenSanders via Conor O'Dea ]
I have never wanted anything the way I want Captain Newfoundland to be real right now .
Missouri Sex Abuse Case Gets Even More Grotesque Police documents indicate children were forced to kidnap and stab a man .
Nov. 20 , 2009  --
Bizarre new allegations are emerging from a sex abuse case that has already shocked Missouri with charges that six men subjected the family 's children to assaults ranging from rape to bestiality .
Court documents released to ABCNews.com this week claim that at one point , several children belonging to Burrell Edward Mohler Jr. were forced to help kidnap a man , and were then given knives and ordered to kill him .
The children have also told investigators that they remembered a girl held captive in the family 's Bates City , Mo. , basement .
Police state in the documents that a woman has come forward to say she was kept in the Mohlers ' basement where she gave birth to two children .
Court papers allege that Mohler Jr. and his father , Burrell Edward Mohler Sr. buried the first of the infants in the basement 's dirt floor and quickly covered the space with cement .
The newest accusations are in addition to charges that Mohler Sr. and Jr. along with four other adult male members of their family subjected six young children to years of abuse .
The grotesque nature of the allegations along with investigators ' unwillingness to make hardly any of the physical evidence public has some questioning whether the charges could be true .
Some of the Mohler 's relatives have described the suspects as God-fearing , hardworking folks .
" These fellas have all had respectable jobs , and for this to come up so many years later , " Ron Gamble , a relative of the accused family members , said , according to the Associated Press .
" In this country , you 're innocent until proven guilty .
Have they found any evidence ?
I have n't heard of any . "
Police would not say if a search of the house and surrounding property had turned up any evidence of the infant in the basement or the box the child was reportedly buried .
Police also have not indicated they found any evidence of the man the children claimed was killed , even though they told investigators they helped dig a grave for him .
So far , no one has been charged with murder .
Police Confident in Charges Agaisnt Missouri Family Accused of Sex Abuse
The children , who are now adults , have previously said they recorded their abuse ordeals on paper stuffed in jars buried on the property , but there is no indication those jars have been found .
Nevertheless , authorities who searched the expansive , rural property where the Mohlers lived for decades say they are confident their evidence will stand up in court .
" If we were n't sure of our investigation , we would n't be putting forth this much effort , " Missouri State Highway Patrol Corporal Bill Lowe told ABCNews.com .
" In the scope of a trial , yes I believe we have good evidence . "
Search warrant returns indicate that police took pieces of bone of undetermined origin , containers of soil , glass fragments and a broken glass jar , among other items .
Authorities also seized computer evidence and pornographic books and magazines , some of them promoting incest , from Mohler Sr. 's Independence , Mo. , home , the Associated Press reported while citing court documents .
" Anything as far as evidentiary value cannot be discussed , " Lowe said , but added that investigators have confidence in the validity victims ' testimonies .
" If we did n't feel the charges were warranted , then they would n't have been applied for , " he said .
Police said early on that they were looking for not only possible bodies , but other people who may have been sexually abused .
It was the press coverage of the initial charges against the Mohlers that prompted a woman to call the police hotline and say that she had been held in the Mohlers ' basement .
Police would not say whether she was the same female that the Mohler children remembered being held in the basement .
Lowe told ABCNews.com that a separate investigation has been opened into the woman 's claims of captivity .
They are also investigating the possible murder of a man .
The children told police they were used to help lure the victim , described by one ofthe children as 6 ' 2 " and 300 pounds and " in poor health , " into Mohler Jr. 's car by claiming their father was having a heart attack .
One of the sisters , now 29 , told police that once the victim was in the car , the girls and the man were taken back to the Mohler property .
" Mr. Mohler gave his daughtes knives to stab the victim with , " the affidavit alleged .
" When their father let the victim go , Mr. Mohler counted to three and then all of his daughters were required to attac [ k ] the victim . "
The sister said she jumped onto the man 's back and stabbed him , but it was her father 's stabs to the man 's front that allegedly killed him , the court documents state .
" Once the victim was dead , their father propped the victim 's body up against a possible tree ... Burrell Mohler Jr. had [ the now 29 - year - old woman ] stab the victim in his face after had had already died , " the affidavit claimed .
Missouri Sex Abuse Charges : Devoted Family Men or Child Predators ?
Bill Bruch , a former in - law of Mohler Sr. , was in court this week to support his family , even though , he admitted , they might be guilty .
" I think that 's possible , " Bruch told ABCNews.com .
" It 's certainly a contrast to what I knew about him years ago when he was married to my cousin .
It seems really out of character . "
Charged in the case are Mohler Sr. , 77 , his brother Darrell Mohler , 72 , and his Mohler Sr. 's four sons , Mohler Jr. 53 , David Mohler , 52 , Jared Mohler , 48 , and Roland Mohler , 47 .
The six alleged victims are Mohler Jr. 's children .
Their charges include multiple counts of forcible rape of a child under the age of 14 , two counts of use of a child in a sexual performance and forcible sodomy .
The other four men face charges of sexual abuse to varying degrees .
Bruch said that Mohler Sr. and his boys " were just a normal healthy family . "
" I felt he was a devoted family man , " Bruch said of the family patriarch .
" He was active in his church activities and responsibilities . "
The Community of Christ Church , where three of the Mohler men were lay ministers , have since cut their ties with the suspects .
Bruch said he and other members of the family would continue to attend the men's court hearing , simply to support their own .
" If I were in that position , I would certainly appreciate support from friends and family , even if I were guilty , " he said .
The suspects , most of whom do not yet have lawyers , according to authorities , are next due in court in early December .
Shocking Claims of Abuse in Missouri
Among the more shocking claims from the children :
One of the sisters , now 26 , claims her father , grandfather and two uncles forced her to partake in bestiality on the property .
She also claimed she had an abortion at age 11 .
Several of the sisters claimed the grandfather would line them up in a row to sodomize them .
Several of the girls claimed they were forced to partake in ceremonies where they would be " married " to one of their uncles , who would then rape them afterward in a trailer or chicken coop to consumate the marriage .
" People will sell their soul to get off paying for a parking ticket . "
Invercargill City Council compliance manager Debbie McCallum has heard every excuse in the book , some of which are impressively imaginative , others totally bizarre .
One woman went to her local council , visibly upset at having to pay for a ticket when she said it was impossible for her to have been in the area when the ticket was issued .
" I was not parked there on this day .
I was at home having sex .
See , I have it in my diary ... and I have two witnesses , " she was reported to have said .
The ticket was checked and found to have been issued on a day other than the one in her diary .
It was common for people to play the sympathy card , Ms McCallum said .
One man 's letter was particularly moving : " Any concession you are able to extend to an ageing and very apologetic parking criminal would be gratefully received .
Sincerely , Al Zimers , " it says .
Another man tried to win some pity by claiming to be colour blind after parking on broken yellow lines .
Someone thought flattering the powers - that - be might get the fine waived : " Thank you for your freshly written parking ticket alleging non-payment of parking fee .
In fact , the fee was paid , ( as it always is ) , but in my haste to get three children to school , chase the cat out from under the bed , hang out the washing , get to work and ' look calm ' , I left the stupid thing in my handbag .
Please extend mercy , O Mighty Ones , and do not have me hanged just yet ! "
One man was outraged after being ticketed for being parked in a disabled stop , when he was clearly displaying one of his crutches on the dash .
Another , upon returning to his vehicle and finding a ticket , started kicking and punching the car and pulled the wipers off .
There were also some odd perceptions of how the parking enforcement staff went about their work , Ms McCallum said .
One woman thought when she put her coin in a meter it went down the pole and was sucked back to the council building .
Another thought the staff had been issued with Tazers when electronic handheld ticketing devices were introduced .
And then there were the notes left on badly parked cars : " Dear blue BMW , You look rich , you should buy yourself some parking lessons , " one note says .
Debbie McCallum said such incidents added a bit of flavour to the job : " I think if you can find something funny in the course of your working day it helps lighten the load , especially when you work in a regulatory environment . "

Washington ( CNN ) --
The U.S. and Yemen are now looking at fresh targets in Yemen for a potential retaliation strike , two senior U.S. officials told CNN Tuesday , in the aftermath of the botched Christmas Day attack on an airliner that al Qaeda in Yemen claims it organized .
The officials asked not to be not be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information .
They both stressed the effort is aimed at being ready with options for the White House if President Obama orders a retaliatory strike .
The effort is to see whether targets can be specifically linked to the airliner incident and its planning .
U.S. special operations forces and intelligence agencies , and their Yemeni counterparts , are working to identify potential al Qaeda targets in Yemen , one of the officials said .
This is part of a new classified agreement with the Yemeni government that the two countries will work together and that the U.S. will remain publicly silent on its role in providing intelligence and weapons to conduct strikes .
Officially the U.S. has not said it conducted previous airstrikes in Yemen , but officials are privately saying the Yemeni military could not have carried out the strikes on its own .
By all accounts , the agreement would allow the U.S. to fly cruise missiles , fighter jets or unmanned armed drones against targets in Yemen with the consent of that government .
One of the officials said Yemen has not yet consented to the type of special forces helicopter - borne air assault that would put U.S. commandos on the ground with the mission of capturing suspects for further interrogation .
That is also a capability the U.S. would like the Yemenis to eventually develop the official said .
At this point , the U.S. believes there may be a few hundred al Qaeda fighters in Yemen centered around a group of key network leaders .
U.S. intelligence believes some key leaders were killed in recent airstrikes but is still working to confirm details .
U.S. military and intelligence officials describe to CNN an al Qaeda network with organized command and control that has evolved and grown over the past year .
U.S. intelligence concludes there are several training camps similar to those established in other countries where one or two dozen fighters at a time train .
The U.S. and Yemenis are also looking into the possibility the Nigerian suspect in the airliner incident trained at one of the camps .
One of the camps was among the targets in each set of airstrikes earlier this month .
On the afternoon of Tuesday 22 September , a devastating explosion was seen and heard in the south of Lebanon , according to local sources .
According to an initial report , there was only damage to the structures and minor injuries but no deaths .

Orion Launch Abort System Attitude Control Motor Test - fired
On Tuesday , Dec. 15 , NASA , Alliant Techsystems ( ATK ) and Lockheed Martin celebrated a major milestone with a ground test of a full - scale attitude control motor ( ACM ) for the Orion crew exploration vehicle ’s launch abort system ( LAS ) .
" The completion of the Demonstration Motor 1 hot - fire test is a substantial advancement in developing the ACM , " said LAS Manager Kevin Rivers , of NASA ’s Langley Research Center in Hampton , Va .
" With an elaborate eight - valve control system that relies on advanced ceramic composites for several key components , the ACM is among the most complex solid rocket systems ever built .
"
The test performed at ATK ’s facility in Elkton , Md. , was the sixth in a series of ground tests of Orion ’s attitude control motor system .
The ACM is charged with keeping the crew module on a controlled flight path after it jettisons , steering it away from the Ares 1 crew launch vehicle in the event of an emergency , and then reorienting the module for parachute deployment .
Having reached this milestone brings Constellation another step closer to flight - ready status and demonstrates progress toward improved flight safety for astronauts , which is at the core of Constellation Program success .
The launch abort system , mounted on top of the Orion crew module , centers around three solid propellant rocket motors : an abort motor , an attitude control motor ; and a jettison motor .
Successful tests of both the abort and jettison motors were completed in 2008 .
The attitude control motor consists of a solid propellant gas generator , with eight proportional valves equally spaced around the outside of the 32 - inch diameter motor .
Together , the valves can exert up to 7,000 pounds of steering force to the vehicle in any direction upon command from the crew module .
" Controllable solid rockets have only recently begun seeing application in spacecraft , and the ACM delivers an order of magnitude greater thrust than any of those systems , " said Rivers .
" It represents a significant technical advancement in controllable solid propulsion .
" Testing would n’t be possible without the support and hard work from the ATK , Lockheed Martin and NASA LAS teams .
" There are many dedicated people from across the nation who have worked diligently to overcome technical challenges to make the test happen , ” said Rivers .
“ I am proud of each of them .
" The entire launch abort system will be demonstrated during a Pad Abort 1 flight test at the U.S. Army ’s White Sands Missile Range ( WSMR ) in New Mexico in the spring of 2010 .
The attitude control motor for the flight test is scheduled to be delivered to WSMR in January , followed by the stacking of the launch abort system .
Langley manages the launch abort system design and development effort with partners and team members from NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala .
Langley ’s Launch Abort System Office performs this function as part of the Orion Project Office located at NASA ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston .
ATK is under contract with Lockheed Martin , NASA ’s prime contractor for Orion , to develop and test the attitude control motor .

Churches were among 500 entries to the competition Mother and toddler groups , youth clubs and unemployment centres are among the winners of a competition offering free wi-fi to remote areas .
From the Orkney Islands to southern Cornwall , 46 communities have been chosen to receive free wi-fi for a minimum of three years .
The competition was launched by wi-fi hotspot firm Freerunner .
The firm uses a combination of broadband , satellite and 3G to connect remote communities .
The connections will be paid for by a combination of advertisements and corporate sponsorship .
Rural town Stromness in Orkney is a typical winner .
The pier is a gathering point for both tourists and locals and having wi-fi installed will benefit a range of groups including local artists , the Ladies Lifeboat Guild and the Fisherman 's Co-operative .
Other winners include a church in the Midlands which is working with refugees and asylum seekers , a community centre in Stirling running a group for mothers and toddlers and a youth club in Devon .
" The Freerunner mission is to give everyone free access to fast wi- fi whether you are in a coffee shop in the West End of London or a community centre in the suburbs of Newcastle , " said chief executive Owen Geddes .
" It is incredible to think that a small piece of relatively low cost technology is going to fundamentally change nearly 50 communities across the UK , " he said .
Broadband supplier BE is the first sponsor to the scheme and will roll out free broadband to those with no connection .
" We agree that wi - fi should be more widely available , " said Tom Williams , head of operations at BE Broadband .
Ian Johnson is a project leader for the Black Country Learning Academy which is among the winners .
" Many people in our area have never been online and know little about IT .
Wi - fi means we can set up new internet - enabled computers allowing us to run more ... courses , improving the employment prospects of people across the region . "
The UK government has pledged to provide broadband running at a minimum speed of 2 M bps ( megabits per second ) to all homes by 2012 .

Spectacular footage of an Ilyushin 62 making a ( very bumpy ) landing on a grassy meadow , 23 October 1989 .
The Ilyushin Il - 62 ( NATO reporting name Classic ) is a Soviet long range jet airliner .
Conceived in 1960 by Ilyushin , it first flew in 1963 and entered Aeroflot service on 15 September 1967 with an inaugural passenger flight from Moscow to Montreal .
The Il - 62 was the Soviet Union 's first lon More ..g - range jet airliner , and the first to be put into service by several other countries .
It was also the first Russian pressurised plane to have a fuselage with non-circular cross-section ( 3.8 x 4.1 m width X height ) and ergonomic passenger doors , and the first Russian jet with six - abreast seating ( the earlier turbo - prop Tu-114 also had this arrangement ) and international - standard navigation lights .
The Il - 62 was the first long - range jet airliner to be put into service by several nations , and some retired examples have been converted into museums and other uses in countries such as the Czech Republic , Germany , Austria , Cuba and China ( Thiel , 2001 ) .
The best known example was the Il - 62 " DDR - SEG " from the former East German airline Interflug .
On 23 October 1989 , DDR - SEG was intentionally landed on a 900 m short grass airfield of a hilltop Stölln / Rhinow in a potentially dangerous and dusty maneuver .
Fire trucks and ambulance crews were positioned on hand for the landing but were not needed .
The jet is used to commemorate the site of the fatal crash of Otto Lilienthal ( 1848 –1896 ) at the Gollenberg hill .
Nick - named " Lady Agnes " after Lilienthal 's wife , it is now a museum with the fuselage divided between the Lilienthal collection and a popular wedding registry .
Round - robin Django setup with nginx .
An nginx trick I did n’t know : a low proxy_connect_timeout value ( e.g. 2 seconds ) combined with the proxy_next_upstream setting means that if one of your backends breaks a user wo n’t even see an error , they ’ll just have a short delay before getting a response from a working server .
In a drastic move to tighten regulations of the Internet , individuals can no longer register domain names in China , and those who already have personal websites could lose them .
According to a statement on The China Internet Network Information Centre , as of this week , the only people who can register new domains will be businessmen or organizations , and all those new registrants will need to have both written application materials as well as copies of their enterprise ’s business license or organization code certificate .
The China Internet Network Information Centre , which supervises domain name registration , says that the measure stemmed from concern over widespread pornographic content on personal websites .
Existing individual domains could also be in trouble .
Website owners in Jiangsu , Shanghai , Henan , Zhejiang and Jiangxi said their sites were no longer accessible .

SEATTLE , Nov. 17 ( UPI ) --
Police in Seattle said an intoxicated man overestimated his own ninja skills and impaled himself on a fence post .
Investigators said an officer heard screams at about 11:15 p.m. Monday and found the man impaled on a spike atop a 4 - to 5 - foot - tall fence , Seattlepi.com reported Tuesday .

Fire Department responders freed the man from the spike and he was taken to Harborview Medical Center for treatment .
" The male claimed he was not being chased , but rather he thought he was a ninja and would be able to successfully leap over the 4 to 5 - foot fence , " a police spokesman said .
" Clearly he was overconfident in his abilities , no doubt bolstered by alcohol . "
BUFFOON WATCH ….
Some have wondered this year if , in the case of a deadly terrorist attack , Republicans could bring themselves to put patriotism over party , and rally behind a president they disagree with .
I think we ’re getting a sense of the answer .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - Mich . ) said Sunday that it is fair to blame the Obama administration for the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight bound for Detroit on Christmas Day .
Hoekstra , the top Republican on the House Select Intelligence Committee said that the administration has not taken the threat of terrorist threats on the U.S. seriously .
Asked by Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace if it is fair to blame the Obama administration for the attacks , the Michigan Republican replied “ Yeah , I think it really is . ”
Not quite 48 hours after a Nigerian man — who got a visa to enter the United States from the Bush administration — unsuccessfully tried to kill Americans , Pete Hoekstra , one of Congress ’ more offensive buffoons , is going on national television to blame the Obama administration .
I know I should n’t be surprised , but this is nauseating .
To rationalize his insane criticism , Hoekstra said he felt comfortable blaming the administration for an attack that did n’t occur because , “ The Obama administration came in and said we ’re not going to use the word terrorism anymore , we ’re going to call it man -made disasters , trying to , I think , downplay the threat from terrorism . ”
By any reasonable measure , this is breathtakingly stupid .
Putting aside the fact that Hoekstra , as a factual matter , is n’t even close to reality — the White House uses the word “ terrorism ” all the time , whether Hoekstra keeps up on current events or not — the argument itself is ludicrous .
Abdul Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow up an airplane based on Obama administration rhetoric ?
Is that really the line the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee wants to share with a national television audience ?
Let ’s be clear .
First , the Obama administration ’s record on counter - terrorism is very impressive .
Second , Pete Hoekstra ’s record on national security issues is so ridiculous , it ’s hard not to point and laugh .
And third , Hoekstra ’s attempts to exploit an attack that failed is almost certainly motivated by an effort to impress right - wing primary voters in advance of his gubernatorial campaign , making his attacks against the president cheap and disgusting .
What an embarrassment .
Stainless Steel Vaginal Dumbbell for Pelvic Floor Strengthening and Trigger Point Massage
The Kegel8 ® Barbell Pelvic Floor Exerciser is a superior quality , medical - grade stainless steel vaginal dumbbell , recommended for pelvic floor strengthening , trigger point massage and myofascial release massage .
A strong and healthy pelvic floor is the answer to a fulfilling sex life , better orgasms , bladder control , and great vaginal health .
It might not be something you ’ve thought about until something has changed down there , perhaps following the birth of your child or after menopause .
Whatever has brought you here , at whatever stage of life , the Kegel8 ® Barbell Pelvic Floor Exerciser can help you .
This pelvic floor restoring device can be sterilised in boiling water or using a suitable spray like the Kegel8 ® Clean .
Made from superior grade stainless steel , cleaners and lubricants will not compromise its surface and it will last forever ; it is also an environmentally friendly option as it is 100 % recyclable .
The non-porous surface ensures bacteria and germs do not penetrate the surface , nor will it harbour such germs , this makes it a completely safe and body - friendly device .
How Do You Use a Vaginal Dumbbell for Pelvic Floor Strengthening ?
The pubococcygeus muscle is one of several pelvic floor muscles and is particularly important as it is the muscle responsible for bladder control and intimate sensation .
The pubococcygeus attaches to the front of the pubic bone and connects all the way under your groin around to the anus .
This muscle is also responsible for holding your pelvic organs in place .
Should it weaken severely , pelvic organ prolapse is a very real possibility .
When you contract the pubococcygeus muscle it should be felt in the clitoris , vagina , and anus .
To strengthen your pelvic floor using a vaginal barbell you simply insert the device as deep as is comfortable and engage the intimate muscles to hold it in place .
The weight of the Kegel8 ® Barbell Pelvic Floor Exerciser means your pubococcygeus muscle has to work harder to keep it secure in the vagina , thus the muscle is strengthened ; it is just like a gym workout for your vaginal muscles .
The top half is hourglass - shaped to provide some help in keeping it in place , with the other half being straight with just a small bulb at the end , ideal for trigger point massage OR for a more challenging workout .
Using the Vaginal Barbell for a Tight Pelvic Floor
If you suffer from pelvic floor pain , you may well have a tight pelvic floor .
A tight pelvic floor – also known as a hypertonic pelvic floor – can manifest itself for many reasons .
It could be following pelvic surgery , an accident , treatment for pelvic cancers or over - exercising the pelvic floor muscles .
With the Kegel8 ® Barbell Pelvic Floor Exerciser , you can easily locate tension points and release the muscles by way of myofascial release .
By releasing the fascia ( the tissues around the muscles ) your range of movement in the muscles is returned and pelvic pain disappears , without the need for drugs or expensive treatments ; you can do all this yourself , in the comfort of your own home .
The vaginal barbell is 16.5 cm in length which means it is long enough to reach trigger points both inside and outside the vagina - on the perineum , for example .
Its solid structure means it will never bend or flex , once you have found the trigger point you need to massage it will work with you to help you find relief .
For trigger point massage , clinicians often use a massage wand and many also like to use vaginal dumbbells or barbells such as this .
It can be warmed or cooled .
Warmth helps to relax the pelvic floor muscles and improve circulation and cooling can help with discomfort caused by piles or vaginal atrophy .
Pelvic pain massage points are just inside the vagina , and easily reached by the Kegel8 ® Barbell Pelvic Floor Exerciser .

Things I am Not… and Neither are You
I am not a consumer
I am not a client
I am not a vote
I am not a liberal
I am not a democrat
I am not a republican
I am not a libertarian
I am not a conservative
I am not a socialist
I am not a communist
I am not a marxist
I am not right wing
I am not left wing
I am not a student
I am not an employee
I am not an employer
I am not a loan recipient
I am not a credit card holder
I am not a stockholder
I am not a potential buyer
I am not a home - owner
I am not a taxpayer
I am not a resident
I am not an advocate
I am not a member of this community
I am not defined by the places the past few generations of my family were born on this planet
I am not a pawn or a key word to drop in your speech .
I am not a useless , soulless number whose only purpose of existing is to have currency extracted .
I have more to offer this world then you and your narrow definitions could ever realize .
Imagine if you spent only a fraction of the money you do on advertising and branding , trying so hard to convince me you see me as more than a number … imagine if you spent that working on getting your people to treat me like a human being .
Imagine if they did n’t need training , and they could figure that out on their own .
That ’s all we can do is imagine it , because it will never happen .
What right , exactly , do your robot minions have to call me and harass me and talk down to me and tell me I am worthless ?
Ask me why I do n’t make more money , why I ca n’t make my interest payment ?
Demand I set up appointments and meetings during the middle of the day on the work week , the only time you are open .
Well , you know what , I ’m kind of busy working .
Working very hard , every day , and it ’s still not enough for you people .
There is no difference between this life I lead and slavery .
What freedom do I really have ?
I am forced to work a job I hate , made to feel inadequate and useless there , just a bag of flesh on the end of a shovel .
I come home caked in mud from head to toe .
In exchange , every two weeks I get a pay cheque .
Not only do I not get to keep a dime of it , I actually do n’t even make enough to just exist .
After rent , loan payment , food ( real food , not restaurants ) and maybe enough for public transit to and from work every day ( often not even enough for that ) that is the extent of my income .
But wait , there ’s still bills to pay !
Things that were once luxuries are now necessities .
I have to have a cell phone for work , I have to have internet access to submit my pay sheet and the latest software for the occasional contract writing or editing gig I might be able to get .
You know , what I actually went to school for .
A laundry card that gobbles up $ 20 bills like the cookie monster .
Hydro , heat , phone , you ca n’t exist without these things and the price on all of them keeps going up and up and up .
But there is no understanding , or compassion , or humanity on the end of that phone .
I ’m a deadbeat right ?
Get a better job , you tell me .
I sure do love getting career advice and condescending life lessons from someone whose job consists of phoning people and following a step by step sheet telling them what to say .
I also love that the people responsible for ruining the economy and there being no good jobs left … are the ones telling me I ’m the problem .
Do n’t worry , you ’ll soon be replaced by an automated voice system , then you can be on the wrong end of the phone call .
Or , more than likely , you already are .
I ca n’t imagine you ’re getting paid all that well to sit at that desk and make those calls .
I do n’t think that was your dream in life , or what you are truly capable of .
You do it for the same reason I do … to exist .
You probably hang up the phone and receive a call from the person two cubicles down , telling you to get a better job and make more money so you can pay your bills .
Then you make that same call to client # 14832 .
But hey , I deserve it .
It ’s my fault that you put through a $ 10 service charge one day before the payment went through , when I had exactly the amount of money for the payment in the account .
I could n’t afford it , had to borrow it , and you know I have trouble making the payments every month .
You do n’t care though .
I mean who the fuck do I think I am ?
Going to school ?!
Trying to actually do what I love !??!?
Trying to pursue something meaningful and fulfilling with my life .
What an asshole I am !
My parents are n’t wealthy , so I should n’t have borrowed the money .
I should n’t have tried to make something of myself .
I should have accepted that I am lower class and stayed in my fucking place .
Do n’t worry , I hear you readers .
I know what that voice in your head is telling you , what you ’re on your way to post in the comment section .
You ’re absolutely 100 % right !
I deserve this life I lead .
I am a worthless , non-contributing piece of garbage .
I should feel this way , every day .
“ Get off your ass and get a better job you fucking loser ! ”
Go ahead and say it , I know that ’s what you ’re thinking .
Trust me , I think it every day .
And believe it or not , I try and change it every day too .
So does my girlfriend .
So do all of our friends .
So do our parents and their friends .
As we all become more and more marginalized .
As scores of highly intelligent , useful individuals with life experience , qualifications , degrees , careers and mortgages fill the ranks at Wal Mart , Starbucks , Home Depot and McDonalds .
As we scrabble and claw and beg and plead for even the sniff of a chance to get a part - time position at minimum wage .
As the mills close , the unions die , the pay - cheques shrink , the industries crumble , the tuition increases , the degrees and diplomas become obsolete .
It ’s all we ’re good for right ?
It ’s all that ’s available , so it must mean that we ’re all just that useless .
We deserve to feel this way , and to live this way .
And when we ’re accepted for this lofty position , they hand us our schedule and their offer for what our life is worth :
Five days a week .
20 hours a week .
Minimum Wage .
Take it or leave it .
You ’ll get a ten cent raise in two years !
That ’s enough to survive on , right ?
Sure it is !
Do n’t you dare get another job either , we have to be your number one priority .
After all , we ’ve given you a job .
In this economy , that ’s better than most people can hope for .
Be happy you have one .
Sure it ’s not even remotely enough to feed yourself , or god forbid if you have children or a sick and injured family member to take care of .
Good luck with that !
But that ’s okay , I heard on the news that consumer confidence is on the rebound !
Did you hear that taxpayers ?
The stock market is starting to stabilize !
Woo hoo !
Thank god almighty , I thought the CEO was going to have to sell his second Jumbo Jet .
Oh how amazing , what terrific news .
I can do my part to keep that stock price stable .
I can look at that consumer confidence index with pride , knowing I did my part .
What a glorious contribution .
What a life to lead .
After all , I have no hopes and dreams and aspirations .
I have no desire or decent qualities .
I have no ideas , no intellect , nothing to offer this world .
I ’m just a liberal , socialist , democrat , marxist , republican , conservative , libertarian voter !
Who should I vote for , please tell me !?
The guy who wants to go to war , or the guy who wants to go to war ?
I ’ll vote for that guy , thanks for the choice !
Oh boy , what freedom !
I totally see why we want other countries to live like this .
Bombs away , let ’s bring freedom and democracy to those poor fools !
Sure , I ’m just a student , consumer , client , loan recipient , credit card holder , employee right now , but maybe one day I can climb the ladder and into management !
I can be an employer !
Heck , that ’s far better than anything I would have done with my life .
Thank you !
Thank you so much !
I ’ll shut up now and get back to work .
I see the wisdom now .
I see how wrong I ’ve been .
I see how fantastic this all is .
I see why people so violently defend this beautiful , perfect system we have going here .
I ’m gonna work hard so those taxpaying , stockholders can one day go from potential buyers into homeowners !
I am a resident of this community , and an advocate for this way of life !
Merry Christmas to All and to All a Good Night !

As reported by Wired.com , a new site called SoundWorks Collection puts a spotlight on the sound design & designers of J.J. Abrams 's " Star Trek " .
In this interesting Video profile we learn that J.J. originally did n't want to put sound in space .
In fact they originally looked at the the opening sequence with the Kelvin and Narada without any sound effects .
" There was so much interesting action and visual effects happening in space that we 've got to do something with sound " says supervising sound editor Mark Stoeckinger .
Check out the SoundWorks Collection video profile below
In this sound for film video profile we answer the question , “ Is there sound in outer space ? ” and “ If there is sound in space , what does it sound like ? ”
The “ Star Trek ” sound team including Supervising Sound Editor Mark Stoeckinger , Supervising Sound Editor Alan Rankin , Sound Designer Scott Gershin , Sound Designer Ann Scibelli , and Sound Designer Tim Walston talk about the approach and sound design behind the eleventh film based on the Star Trek franchise directed by J.J.

His mother has been jailed , and his protector is the state .
His home is a hospital , and his health is nearly as fragile as the day he landed in the ER at Memorial Hermann Children 's Hospital .
Weighing just 17 pounds , 3 - year - old Kayvon Lewis arrived in the emergency room last month extremely malnourished , dehydrated and at risk of heart failure and liver damage .
He can neither walk nor talk .
He is blind and suffers seizures , sometimes five a day .
His mother , authorities say , was starving him to death , a form of child abuse so rare that doctors almost never see it .
About 200 children each year die from abuse and neglect in Texas .
Kayvon escaped death by a thread .
And as is often the case , a lengthy list of people knew about the boy 's eroding condition , but failed to intervene .
“ The care Kayvon was given was pathetic , ” said Gary Polland , the attorney appointed to represent Kayvon at court after ER physicians had the boy taken into temporary custody by Texas Child Protective Services .
His mother , Marcia Holliday , 30 , has been charged with injury to a child causing serious bodily injury by omission , a first - degree felony .
For more than a month now , doctors slowly have introduced the boy to what 's been missing much of his short life : food .
On the night of Oct. 15 , according to records , Holliday brought Kayvon to Memorial Hermann Children 's Hospital , telling the staff that her son was not eating or drinking and had not wet his diaper all day .
She seemed not to mention , records show , that he was half the size of a normal toddler , or had the head of a boy and the body of an infant — or that he could do none of the things children of his age are supposed to do .
Underlying problems
“ He cannot walk , crawl , sit unsupported , pass objects between hands , reach , say ‘ mama ' or ‘ dada , ' wave ‘ bye - bye , ' does not orient to voice , ” reads a medical report after his ER exam .
Texas Child Protective Services caseworker Sandra
Moy stated the case in more startling clinical terms : “ Kayvon T. Lewis ' nutritional level was 9.2 when a normal level is 45 and a low level is 18 . ”
On the same day , pediatrician Dr. William Risser referred Kayvon 's case to the Child Abuse Resource and Education Center team , an inpatient consultation service for suspected child abuse and neglect cases .
University of Texas - Houston Medical School's Dr. Oscar G. Larrazolo performed Kayvon 's exam , and the findings were verified by CARE team director Dr. Rebecca Giradet , an associate professor at the medical school and staff physician at Memorial Hermann .
Kayvon , the doctors ' report noted , was first diagnosed at 9 months of age with “ failure to thrive ” — a catch - all phrase used to describe a child 's condition , not the underlying reason why a child cannot gain weight or develop .
Doctors found he had seizures , scoliosis and asthma , underlying health problems .
But they told CPS those conditions could not be responsible for his starved state .
“ The only reasonable explanation for his starvation is physical neglect , ” their report stated .
But as is all too often in the case of abused children , there was no shortage of people who knew about the boy 's eroding condition but for one reason or another failed to intervene .
Weight loss a ‘ red flag '
CPS investigated its first complaint about the boy 's care in January 2008 .
They found Kayvon 's mother was “ intoxicated on drugs ” and the child appeared to be a “ failure to thrive child . ”
Services were ordered , including sessions with a state dietitian and physical therapist .
Nothing about the boy 's small size or condition alerted workers that Kayvon was in enough danger that he should be removed from his home , according to court documents .
On March 27 , 2008 , while the investigation was still open , Holliday tested positive for marijuana .
Still , the boy was left in the home after Holliday promised to enroll in a series of early childhood intervention classes .
The case was closed on April 1 , 2008 .
The following month , he was taken to his pediatrician , Dr. Niala Siddiqi .
Kayvon , who was just shy of his second birthday , weighed 18 pounds , 6 ounces .
Sixteen months later , on Aug. 28 , 2009 , his weight had dropped by more than a pound .
Siddiqi did not return calls for comment to the Houston Chronicle .
Giradet , one of the team of doctors who examined Kayvon last month in the emergency room , would not comment specifically on Kayvon 's case .
However , she did say that any young child who maintained such a low weight over more than half his life was a “ red flag ” that starvation was occurring .
Children , particularly those in poorer circumstances , can be found to be malnourished .
But starvation abuse of a child is so rare that Giradet has seen it only three times , counting Kayvon , in her decades - long career .
In interviews , Kayvon 's relatives admitted to officials that they had told Holliday to take Kayvon to the hospital on other occasions .
But when she did n't , they did not call his doctors or CPS
“ Maternal grandmother and maternal aunt stated that they encouraged Kayvon 's mother , Marcia Holliday to take Kayvon to the hospital for his condition but that she failed to act , ” Moy wrote .
There was a second CPS investigation in November 2008 .
The agency was notified the boy may not have access to his anti-seizure medication .
The case , too , was closed quickly after a check found that he did have his medication .
Denies starving her son
Holliday , who was released from the Harris County Jail this past week , denies she systematically starved her son .
“ Everything they say ( CPS ) is a lie .
He was n't eating or drinking , ” she said during a recent interview at the jail .
“ He has a lot of problems going on . ”
Now , two months later , Kayvon 's intake of liquid formula is monitored constantly .
Too much food at this stage can overwhelm the underdeveloped organs of his tiny 17 - pound body .
A white mesh glove has been placed over his left hand to keep him from sucking it .
Kayvon was starved for so long , he had sucked his thumb raw and a sore developed .
“ Since their bodies have not been seeing normal quantities of fats and carbohydrates , their bodily functions kind of shut down , ” explained Giradet .
“ It 's very dangerous to suddenly feed a starved child normal food .
They can go into liver failure , heart arrhythmia .
Their pancreas does not make insulin anymore .
All of those functions are not working . ”
Explanation elusive
Why Kayvon was starved is hard to say .
“ Typically these children come from very stressed families , ” Giradet said .
“ It may be one child is singled out and the other ones are getting adequately fed . ”
Neither Kayvon 's 6 - year - old brother nor his 5 - year - old sister showed signs of starvation or other abuse .
Until recently , the children lived with their mother in the Forest Pointe apartments , one of a string of low - income complexes that snake along Northborough Drive in the Greenspoint area of Houston .
Both siblings are in foster care .
While Kayvon is out of intensive care , he has yet to try solid food , not even Cheerios or crackers , according to CPS .
Giradet could not say how long it will take a child like Kayvon to recover .

6.50 : The accumulated total in FIFA rankings of England 's World Cup group is 84 , only Group H ( 74 ) & Group E ( 83 ) are tougher on this basis .
6.45 : A great draw for brand Beckham who will get to strut his stuff against USA and , interestingly , Thierry Henry received his only red card for France against Uruguay , one of their Group A opponents
6.35 : England have yet to face Algeria in a senior international , we only recently faced Slovenia in a friendly at Wembley which we cruised 2 - 1 and our record against USA is pretty decent , too .
The Three Lions have faced America nine times , won seven , no draws and two defeats .
Now is a good time to mention that defeat at the World Cup Finals in 1950 .
And we 'll leave it there !
6.30 : So England draw USA , Algeria and Slovenia in the group stage of the World Cup - and Fabio Capello 's men will have to fancy their chances of making their way through to the second round .
Dream draw : England will be grateful for a favourable group
5.54 : Some incredibly stilted ' banter ' between Valcke and Theron .
Please start the draw .
Please .
5.50 : Running bang on time - Charlize Theron is joined on stage by the Fifa General Secretary Jerome Valcke who will conduct the draw .
5.45 : And so the preamble continues !
Much singing and dancing that is the norm now at these events .
Great .
Do the draw , will you !
Sorry - I 'm very impatient .
5.35 : Right , we 're just a few second away from the start of the draw we 'll know England 's fate in the next 30 minutes .
5.20 : Two teams are making their World Cup debuts as independent countries - Serbia and Slovakia .
5.10 : The preamble is getting underway in South Africa but our man on the scene Matt Lawton is n't pleased with what he 's seeing - Please tell me that is n't the official World Cup song they 've just opened with .
Johnny Clegg is a ' famous ' South African rock star but Nelly Furtado he ain't .
Give me Forca ( Euro 2004 ) anytime .
5.05 : If you 're unsure as to where the games are to be played , take a look at Sportmail 's guide to all of the 2010 venues .
5.00 : We 're an hour away from the draw starting , some Sportmail staff are on the verge of self - combusting with excitement .
Bless .
Guest of honour : Nelson Mandela addresses the audience at the draw
4.55 : An email arrives from A US Base in Afghanistan , no less .
American Joe Gates tells me ...
My ideal USA draw would of course be South Africa , USA , Paraguay and Slovakia .
My expected draw is going to be Germany , USA , Ivory Coast and Serbia .
Do n't see anyway around the US getting a strong European power and a major African nation .
I 'm not real optimistic on getting out of the group .
My dream England draw , England , Australia , Algeria and France .
Brilliant !
France and Australia , Joe ?
I reckon we might squeeze an easier draw than that ?
4.45 : All the dignitaries have arrived and are beginning to settle down at the Cape Town International Convention Centre - Chief Football Correspondent Matt Lawton is there watching events unfold - Music fills the streets around the International Covention Centre but on the rooftops above you see only South African army snipers .
Clearly , they 're concerned for the safety of Sir Trev .
No sign of Charlize yet but the crowds are gathering to see the beautiful people .
Theron , Beckham , Beardsley .
Actually , Peter Beardsley 's not here but another Newcastle great is - Ruud Gullit no less .
4.30 : I have a winner for your favourite World Cup moment - I 'll post it up here in a few minutes ... and here it is .
No surprises as to the winner .
VIDEO :
They think they 've seen this one before - they have now .
4.25 : Random fact -
After the abandonment of the fifth one - dayer , England have become only the second side to win a one day series in South Africa .
On just three occasions has the football World Cup been won by a team outside of it 's continental zone .
Straws being clutched as we speak .
4.20 : As if further proof was needed that we are now living in the future , Fifa and Sony have announced that they will be broadcasting 25 of the tournaments matches in 3D .
4.10 : Playing catch - up on details of the finals ?
Here 's Sportsmail 's team - by - team guide to the 32 sides who will be appearing at the Finals .
Winning team ?
Capello with Franco Baldini and Lord Triesman arrive at the draw
4.00 : Last couple of minutes to get your favourite England World Cup moment in to me .
I can tell you there 's a clear leader at the moment - get your vote in quick to tom.bellwood@dailymail.co.uk
3.50 : Much has been made of the fan 's experience at this tournament and our Chief Football Correspondent Matt Lawton has news of a development ahead of the draw -
The big news to emerge here concerns the World Cup merchandise shop , where all the vuvuzelas - the stadium horns synonymous with South African football - have been removed .
They do n't want to ruin the draw apparently .
Personally I think it 's a pity .
While we all want to hear what the lovely Charlize has to say , the vuvuzelas might have given it all a bit more of a carnival atmosphere .
After a few days here this week you get the distinct feeling that the South Africans are really going to embrace this World Cup .
The safety of the supporters remains a concern but the people here are going to do everything they can to make the tournament a huge amount of fun .
On a roll : It 's David Beckham again - this time launching the official match ball
3.40 : The news from the final dress rehearsal which has just taken place reaches us ... England drew Australia , Nigeria and France .
Sunderland boss Steve Bruce is absolutely convinced England will face France in tonight 's draw for the World Cup finals .
' We have got to have the French , have n't we ?
The French have got to be in our group .
' The French will obviously be in our group , I have got a feeling on that , and then for me , you want to try to avoid one of the big African nations because the African nations in Africa will be a handful too . '
Incisive stuff .
3.30 : Right then - quick straw poll - what 's your favourite England World Cup moment of all time ?
Hurst 's third against West Germany ?
Platt 's volley against Belgium in 1990 ?
Michael Owen 's run and goal against Argentina in 1998 ?
Let me know and I 'll post the most popular up here in a video ( If I can find it ! ) after 4 pm .
Email me - tom.bellwood@dailymail.co.uk
Magic : Platt 's volley against Belgium was great but is it your favourite moment
3.25 : Here 's a random fact to fill a gap - None of the previous 18 host nations of the World Cup have been eliminated in the first round .
3.20 : Some news from earlier this afternoon - there was a bomb - scare of sorts in the building adjacent to where the draw is taking place - some men in huge protective suits marched in but soon returned - panic over .
3.05 : Our man in South Africa , Chief Football Correspondent Matt Lawton has dropped me line -
It 's more like the Oscars than the World Cup draw here , such is the effort FIFA have gone to in putting on a show .
It 's a no-expense spared production with all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood , not least inside the 2,000 seater main hall at Cape Town 's International Covention Centre .
Right now a stage that will be graced by the beautiful Charlize Theron - among a load of famous footballers - is being mopped one more time .
Well they had to find something for Sir Trevor Brooking to do .
2.55 : England have got Australia , Slovakia and Cameroon !
Oh , hang on , that was the practice draw earlier .
Still , we'd be happy with that , would n't we ?
The Aussies , our arch - sporting nemesis and Cameroon , the team ranked 11 in the world .
Crumbs .
Party time :
Fans get in the mood in the build up to the fan fest event
2.40 : Let 's get some of the nuts and bolts out of today 's ceremony out of the way .
Venue :
The ceremony at the Cape Town International Convention Centre will last around 90 minutes in front of 2,000 invited guests and around 800 media representatives .
The draw procedure :
There are four pots -
Pot 1 - The seeded teams
South Africa , Germany , Brazil , Italy , Spain , England , Holland , Argentina .
Pot 2 - Asia , Oceania and North / Central America .
Japan , South Korea , North Korea , Australia , New Zealand , USA , Mexico , Honduras .
Pot 3 - Africa and South America .
Ivory Coast , Ghana , Cameroon , Nigeria , Algeria , Paraguay , Chile , Uruguay .
Pot 4 - Europe .
France , Portugal , Slovenia , Switzerland , Greece , Serbia , Denmark , Slovakia .
The pots are emptied one by one , beginning with Pot One -
The seeded teams will be assigned to a group , A - H .
The remaining three positions in each group will then be filled from the remaining three pots .
No two teams from the same confederation will face each other in the same group , except Europe who will have two teams in five of the groups .
Got all that ?
Becks effect : England 's famous face at a coaching session for kids in Cape Town
TV Audience : 3,254 people are working in Cape Town to bring the draw to an estimated audience of 200m , with the pictures beamed to 200 countries worldwide .
People :
The great and the good of the football world will be in attendance - David Beckham , Eusebio , Franz Beckenbauer , Michel Platini and Roger Milla would form a great five - a- side team - they 'll be there .
As will Ethiopian distance runner Haile Gebrselassie , Archbishop Desmond Tutu , former President FW De Klerk and the South Africa rugby union Captain John Smit .
Charlize Theron is ( very ) special guest .
Money : World Cup prize - money available to 32 teams is £ 380 million , up £ 145 m from 2006 .
The winner gets £ 27 m .
Nicely done .
2.15 pm : The waiting is over , the time is - almost - upon us ... welcome to Sportsmail 's coverage of the World Cup 2010 draw .
The qualification process for the tournament started way back in August 2007 and was completed just a couple of weeks ago with the last of the play - offs .
And by 6.30 pm this evening all 32 teams will know who their opponents are for the group stage in South Africa .
So what fate lies in store for Fabio Capello 's England ?
Being seeded was bonus as we avoid some of the better teams but we 'll still have to beat the likes of Spain and Brazil at some stage if we are to become world champions .
Will it be a Group of Death - England , USA , France and Ivory Coast ?
A Group of Life - England , New Zealand , Slovenia , Algeria
Or a Group of Needle ( my favourite ! ) - England , Ivory Coast , Portugal , Australia .
I 'll keep you up - to - date with all the action from the draw as we 're treated to the delights of singing , dancing , a video message from Nelson Mandela and , of course , Charlize Theron .
Tony Blair “ profoundly wrong ” to imagine religion as a peacemaking tool
Tony Blair ’s claim that religion can bring peace and prosperity to the world has been challenged as “ profoundly wrong and counterproductive ” this week by the President of the National Secular Society .
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has said in a speech that religions must learn to respect each other in order to make the world a safer and fairer place for all .
Speaking at the Royal Society for the Arts in London , Blair admitted that religion has a dark side and in recent years many had fallen under the influence of extremism .
“ Even a short stay in Israel and Palestine , where I now spend a lot of my time , would show you that , all too graphically , ” he told the seminar which was attended by the usual gaggle of “ faith leaders ” and some development workers .
“ But this , in a sense , is the dark side of strong belief , ” he said .
“ People who hold deep convictions about life and its purpose necessarily can be prone to holding those views to excess or the point of prejudice .
That danger is inherent in faith . ”
He also said it was not enough any more to speak of tolerating other religions .
“ Though we may disagree with those of another faith , though we hold true to our own faith , we should not have the arrogance merely to tolerate a person whose faith is different ; but instead respect them as equals . ”
Terry Sanderson , President of the National Secular Society , said : “ Tony Blair is on entirely the wrong path if he truly wants the world to progress to peace and prosperity .
This obsession with ‘ faith ’ has clouded his judgment and brought his reputation to its knees – as well as bringing death and destruction on a major scale to the people of Iraq .
This idea that religion — if it can settle its differences — has the capacity to save the world is an utter fantasy and completely contradicted by history .
Religions have never been able to settle their differences and they never will .
For every small truce declared by well - meaning people promoting ‘ interfaith dialogue ’ there are a dozen lethal religious conflagrations burning .
The very nature of religion means that those that fundamentally disagree about what constitutes ‘ the truth ’ must always be at war .
By constantly promoting the possibility of religion being a force for positive change , Blair stands in the way of the very progress he so obviously desires .
It is only by looking at other ways to live together that do n’t involve religion that we are likely to able to stop this crazy conflict over ‘ faith ’ .
Tony Blair should be using his influence to promote a secular solution , not encouraging people to put even more emphasis on the religion that causes them to hate each other so intensely . ”
Tony Blair put his ideas in the Guardian ’s Comment is Free blog .
Note the response he gets .

I am asking for a BIG favor from all of you .
Please reblog , forward to a friend , repost on websites , and tell a friend .
Above all , pledge to my project !
If you are not already aware , there is a huge controversy in New York City surrounding performance artists and character performers in Times Square ( particularly body painted women known as Des Nudas ) , and it is a battle the mayor of New York , Bill de Blasio has pushed to the front pages of every New York newspaper .
You may have visited New York and seen them for yourself .
It is easy to watch the news locally here and not see past the facade these entertainers put up for the amusement of tourists and passer - bys .
My goal in my project is to present the people who make up the small community of performance artists in Times Square in a neutral setting in - studio , in and out of character .
I am asking for all your help to make this project a reality !

When you are on the bleeding edge of scale like Facebook is , you run into some interesting problems .
As of 2008 Facebook had over 800 memcached servers supplying over 28 terabytes of cache .
With those staggering numbers it 's a fair bet to think they 've seen their share of Dr. House worthy memcached problems .
Jeff Rothschild , Vice President of Technology at Facebook , describes one such problem they 've dubbed the Multiget Hole .
You fall into the multiget hole when memcached servers are CPU bound , adding more memcached servers seems like the right way to add more capacity so more requests can be served , but against all logic adding servers does n't help serve more requests .
This puts you in a hole that simply adding more servers can't dig you out of .
What 's the treatment ?
Dr. House would immediately notice the hidden clue , we are talking requests not memory .
We are n't running out of memory to store stuff , we are running out of CPU power to process requests .
What happens when you add more servers is that the number of requests is not reduced , only the number of keys in each request is reduced .
The number keys returned in a request only matters if you are bandwidth limited .
The server is still on the hook for processing the same number of requests .
Adding more machines does n't change the number of request a server has to process and since these servers are already CPU bound they simply can't handle more load .
So adding more servers does n't help you handle more requests .
Not what we usually expect .
This is another example of why architecture matters .
Understanding Multiget
To understand why we are serving the same number of requests we have to understand memcached 's multiget request .
The multiget request allows the multiple keys to be retrieved in one request .
If a user has 100 friends , for example , the changes for each of those friends can be retrieved by making one request .
This if far more efficient than making 100 individual requests .
Multiget allows library makers to transparently use two classic scalability tactics : batching and parallelization .
Let 's say there 's a memcached pool containing two servers and 50 friends are stored on each server .
What a smart library implementation can do is batch up the requests destined for each memcached server and run those requests in parallel .
Memcached works by mapping keys to memcached servers , in practice there 's no reason keys would be distributed 50 to each server , but this is just an example .
Instead of sending a request per friend we are just sending one request per server .
The power of batching is to radically reduce request latency by reducing the number of requests .
Now let 's say we make 50 requests for all 100 hundred friends of our moderately popular user .
Each server will see 50 requests because half the friends are on each server .
If we see that the pool servers are running out of CPU our most likely reaction is to add another server to the pool .
What does adding another server to the pool accomplish ?
It means 33ish friends will be stored on each server .
When we send out 50 requests to gather info for the 100 friends each server is still seeing 50 requests because to collect all 100 friends we have to hit each server .
We 've done absolutely nothing to reduce the usage of our scarce resource which is CPU .
True , we 'll use less bandwidth per server , but that does n't matter because we have enough bandwidth .
The astounding result of this exercise is that adding more machines does not add more capacity .
Mr. Rothschild said this is n't a problem they sat down and reasoned through from first principles .
This is a problem they saw in the field and learned about from experience .
They saw that adding more machines to increase capacity and had to work out what the heck was happening .
How do you solve the multiget hole problem ?
One solution to the multiget hole problem is replication .
Since the problem is a lack of CPU power more CPU needs to be applied .
One classic technique to allow more CPU to churn on data is to replicate the data and load balance requests between the replicas .
In our example we would create two pools of two servers each .
Each pool would get half the requests so they do half the work and they would no longer CPU bound .
Now you 've doubled the capacity of your system and avoided stepping into the hole .

Verse King James Version Proposed Conservative Translation Analysis
1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt , saying , The L ORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt .
He said :
2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
" This month will be for you the beginning of months , the first of all the months of the year . "
The month is Abib , or the modern Nisan , or " barley harvest . "
Most Jewish / Hebrew calendars in the modern day begin with Tishrei , the seventh month , since that is when the Jewish " New Year " of Rosh Hashanah falls .
Confusingly , Rosh Hashanah is one of several " Jewish New Years " , each in a different context .
Rosh Hashanah was considered the First Day of Creation ( or by other interpretations , the day Man was created ) .
By contrast , the first day of Nisan in Biblical times would be the equivalent of January 1 in America today .
3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house : " Now speak to the entire congregation of Israel , and tell them this : ' In the tenth day of this month , each man is to take a lamb for the house of their fathers , one lamb per household . ' "
4 And if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
" ' If the household has too few members for one lamb , then let the householder and his nearest neighbor take it , according to the count of household members ; every man , according to his food budget , is to make an assessment for a lamb . ' "
5 Your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats : " ' The lamb will be a flawless male yearling ; it can be either an actual lamb or a goat kid . ' "
6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
" ' You will take it in charge until the fourteenth day of this month .
Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will kill it between evenings . ' "
7 And they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
" ' They must take some of the blood , and paint it onto the two jambs and the lintel of the houses that they eat the lamb in . "
The " jamb " is the upright or side member ; the " lintel " is the cross member of the doorway .
8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
" ' They must eat the flesh in one night , roasted by fire , and served with matzoh and bitter herbs . ' "
Matzoh is bread made without yeast , the " bread of haste . "
9 Eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
" ' You must not eat any of it either underdone or cooked with water ; it must be roasted with fire , the head with the shanks and the inner parts . ' "
10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
" ' Do not reserve any of it for the morning .
Anything left over until morning you must burn thoroughly . ' "
Literally , " burn with fire , " another Hebrew idiomatic emphatic repetition .
11 And thus shall ye eat it ; with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it is the LORD 's passover .
" ' You must eat it with this attitude : with your waist girded , your sandals on your feet , and your walking stick in hand .
You must eat it in haste .
This is the L ORD 's Passover . ' "
Literally , " nervous haste , " and Pesach , from which comes the word " Paschal . "
12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the LORD .
" ' Because I am going to pass through the land of Egypt tonight , and will strike down every firstborn individual in the land of Egypt , both man and beast .
I will execute judgment against all the " gods " of Egypt .
I am the L ORD . ' "
13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I smite the land of Egypt .
" ' The blood will be a recognition sign for you on the houses where you are .
When I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the stroke will not fall on you to kill you , when I strike the land of Egypt . ' "
14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
" ' You will keep this day as a memorial , and you will make this a lasting celebration to the L ORD throughout your generations .
You will celebrate this by statute forever . ' "
Literally , " in eon , " or " into the ages , " as the Greeks would also say .
15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
" ' For seven days you will eat matzoh .
In fact , on the first day you will eradicate any yeast from your houses .
Whoever eats any leavened bread , from the first day to the seventh , that person will be cut off from Israel . ' "
16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
" ' In the first day there will be a meeting of holiness , and in the seventh day another meeting of holiness .
No form of work shall be done in those meeting days , except the work of eating itself , since every man must eat . ' "
17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
" ' You will observe this feast of unleavened bread .
On this very day I brought all your armies out of the land of Egypt .
Therefore you will observe this day for generations by statute forever . ' "
18 In the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , ye shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the month at even .
" ' In the first month , on the fourteenth day , in the evening , you will eat unleavened bread , until the twenty - first day in the evening . ' "
19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
" ' For those seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses .
Anyone who easts anything with yeast in it , that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he is a foreigner or a native of the land . ' "
20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened ; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread .
" ' You will eat nothing leavened .
In all your dwelling places you will eat unleavened bread . ' "
21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said unto them , Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the passover .
Now Moses called for all the elders of Israel .
He told them , " Draw out and select a lamb for your families , and slay the Passover . "
22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
" Take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it into the blood in the basin , and touch the lintel and the two jambs with the blood in the basin .
And none of you is to go out through the portal of his house until morning . "
23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side posts , the LORD will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you .
" The L ORD is going to pass through to strike the Egyptians .
When
He sees the blood on the lintel and the two jambs , the L ORD will pass over the portal , and will not allow the Destroyer to come into your houses to strike you . "
The " Destroyer " is a very special Messenger or angel .
24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
" You are to observe this word by statute for you and your sons forever . "
25 And it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
" And it will happen that when you enter the land that the L ORD is giving to you , the land that He spoke about , you will observe this service . "
26 And it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , What mean ye by this service ?
" And when your children happen to ask you , ' What does this service mean to you ?... ' "
27 That ye shall say ,
It is the sacrifice of the LORD 's passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smote the Egyptians , and delivered our houses .
And the people bowed the head and worshipped .
" ... you are to tell them , ' This is the passover sacrifice of the L ORD , Who passed over the houses of the Sons of Israel in Egypt , when He struck the Egyptians , and rescued our households . ' "
The people bowed their heads and bowed themselves down .
28 And the children of Israel went away , and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
The Sons of Israel went away , and did everything that the L ORD had instructed Moses and Aaron to tell them .
29 And it came to pass , that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
And this is what happened : at midnight the L ORD struck every firstborn individual in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of the regnant Pharaoh to the firstborn of the lowliest prisoner in the House of the Pit , and every firstborn beast .
" The Pit " or " The Hole " is the most common name that any inmate has ever given his prison .
30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
Pharaoh got up in the middle of the night , both he and everyone on his staff , and all the Egyptians .
A great outcry rang out in Egypt , because there was not a household to be found that did not have a dead person in it .
Some have vainly speculated that the firstborn , lying as they did on beds spread on the floor , were subject to acute carbon dioxide poisoning from a volcanic vent .
This explanation , of course , begs the question of why blood painted on jamb and lintel should neutralize carbon dioxide in this manner .
31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , Rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve the LORD , as ye have said .
He called Moses and Aaron during the night , saying , " Get up , and get out from among my people , you and the Sons of Israel , and go and serve the L ORD , as you said ! "
32 Also take your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and bless me also .
" And take your flocks and your herds , as you said , and go !
But bless me , too . "
33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
The Egyptians in fact insisted on dismissing the people from the land in haste , and they all said , " We are all dying men . "
34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
The people carried their dough before it was leavened , because their kneading troughs were bundled up in their clothes on their shoulders .
35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment :
The Sons of Israel did everything that Moses had told them to do : they borrowed articles of silver and gold , and clothing , from the Egyptians .
36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent unto them such things as they required .
And they spoiled the Egyptians .
The L ORD gave the people a good impression in the eyes of the Egyptians , so that they lent them everything they asked .
Thus they despoiled the Egyptians .
Later , the reader will see what became of all this silver , gold , and cloth .
37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
The Sons of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth .
They numbered six hundred thousand infantrymen , together with children .
38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks , and herds , even very much cattle .
Furthermore , a mixed crowd went up with them , with flocks and herds , an exceedingly great herd of cattle .
39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
They baked ember cakes with the dough that they were bringing out of Egypt , because it had not been leavened .
They were practically thrown out of Egypt , and were not allowed to dally , and had not even prepared any victuals for themselves .
40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel , who dwelt in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
The span of the sojourning of the Sons of Israel , who had lived in Egypt , was 430 years .
See Galatians 3:17 .
41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt .
And it happened that at the end of the 430 years , on the very day that it came to pass , all the armies of the L ORD went out of the land of Egypt .
42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
This is a night of observance to the L ORD for bringing them out of the land of Egypt : this was the night of the L ORD for observances for all the Sons of Israel for all their generations .
43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron , This is the ordinance of the passover :
There shall no stranger eat thereof :
The L ORD said to Moses and Aaron , " This is the statute of the Passover : no foreigner is to eat any of it . "
44 But every man 's servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
" But if any man among you buys a slave for silver , and has him circumcised , he , too , will eat some of it . "
45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof .
" A foreigner or a hired hand is not to eat of it . "
46 In one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
" It is to be eaten in one house .
You are not to bring any of the flesh out of the house , or break any of its bones . "
47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it .
" The whole congregation of Israel is to do this . "
48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee , and will keep the passover to the LORD , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that is born in the land : for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
" When any stranger sojourns with you , if he wants to keep the passover of the L ORD , then every male in his household must be circumcised .
Then he can draw near and keep it , and he will be regarded as a native .
No uncircumcised person will eat any of it . "
49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
" One law will be for the native , and another to the stranger sojourning in your midst . "
50 Thus did all the children of Israel ; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
All the Sons of Israel were doing as the L ORD had instructed Moses and Aaron .
Britain and the US were considering measures to bring about " regime change " in Iraq two years before military action was taken to remove Saddam Hussein , the head of MI6 has said .
Sir John Sawers , who acted as Tony Blair 's private secretary for foreign affairs in the run-up to the Iraq invasion in March 2003 , said that discussions about " political " measures that could be taken against Saddam were taking place as early as 2001 .
He also said that the US ignored warnings over the removal of tens of thousands of members of Saddam 's Baath party from their administrative posts .
Sir John told the Iraq inquiry that there was no talk of military action in 2001 , but that the country was one of several in which the British Government would have liked to have seen regime change .
He said that the preferred tactics were similar to those used to oust the former Serbian leader , Slobodan Milosevic .

Officials in Whitehall considered plans including the bolstering of a number of opposition groups within Iraq .
There was even talk of having Saddam indicted as a war criminal as a result of his invasion of Kuwait in 1990 .
" I think there are a lot of countries around the world where we would like to see a change of regime .
That does n't mean one pursues active policies in that direction , " Sir John told the inquiry .
Discussions took place as early as January 2001 with Dick Cheney , the former US Vice President , and National Security Adviser , Condoleeza Rice , as President Bush prepared to enter the White House .
" We talked about whether there was a way Saddam Hussein could be indicted for war crimes , whether there was a vision that could be created for the Iraqi people of what life would be like after Saddam Hussein , " he said .
" There was no discussion of military invasion or anything like that . "
He added that during his time as a senior diplomat in Baghdad , he had urged US post - war planners to limit the scale of the de-Baathification programme , a policy which many believe left Iraq unable to function and contributed to an insurgency .
Moves to remove 30,000 Baathist members from their jobs and the disbanding of the Iraqi army were decided by the US without meaningful consultations with Britain , Sir John said .
While Britain had supported plans to cut out the three most senior levels of the Baathist regime built up under Saddam , it did not support the removal of even lower officials , which included teachers .
The US administration 's insistence meant that an extra 25,000 Iraqis lost their jobs .
" In retrospect it seemed that the decisions were taken in advance in Washington , " he said .
However , Sir John disputed that the extent of the removals and the loss of the Iraqi army was to blame for the major breakdown in law and order that took place in Iraq after the invasion and the rise of an insurgency .
" The reconstruction of the Iraq Government would have been impossible without it , " he said .
" The public mood was virulently and vitriolically anti-Saddam . "
Could the universe be Pringle shaped ?
( Image : NASA / JPL - Caltech / vages / flickr )
It ’s one of the biggest questions of science : what shape is the universe ?
From Ptolemy onwards , physicists thought of the cosmos as a sphere , but this may not be correct .
Many alternative shapes have been proposed .
And they have something in common : all can be described with reference to popular snack foods .
So prise open a bag of your favourite munchie , and join us on a journey through food - based theoretical physics .
Ring doughnut
The idea that the universe might be shaped like a torus – or ring doughnut – has been around for many decades in various forms .
Advertisement
One variation proposes that the doughnut has a single twist – like a Möbius strip that has been inflated .
Our universe may even be floating around inside a torus - shaped space .
In one interpretation of string theory , our universe is a three - dimensional region of space called a “ brane ” floating in higher - dimensional space .
One model suggests that the cosmos once included various branes with up to eight dimensions , floating about in a nine - dimensional space with each dimension circling back on itself like a doughnut .
The high - dimension branes may have smashed together and evaporated , whereas our universe survived .
Pringle
Is space flat ?
If it is , then light beams that set off parallel to each other should keep travelling in parallel forever .
If it is curved , then the beams will either drift apart or come together .
One possibility is that space is curved like a Pringle .
At the centre of a Pringle , the surface curves up and down at the same time ( see diagram ) .
In theory , every point in our universe could be like that – in mathematical language , space could be negatively curved .
If this is true , it could explain why time only moves forwards , and possibly why the universe is expanding so fast .
So far , the evidence suggests that the universe really is flat , and not Pringle - shaped , but the question is not settled .
Peanut
Around 14 billion years ago , the universe formed in the big bang .
Starting from an infinitely tiny speck , it exploded in all directions , gradually cooling as it did so .
Yet it may not have spread out evenly .
Magnetic fields spanning the early universe could have caused the universe to expand more in one direction than others .
If so , this would mean that our universe is an ellipsoid like a peanut or olive ( Physical Review Letters , vol 97 , p 131302 ) .
Bugle
Apologies to our non-American readers : Bugles are a popular corn snack in the US , and are cone - shaped like the horns of trumpets or bugles .
A universe shaped like a Bugle may sound odd , but it could help explain some puzzling observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation : the relic radiation left over from the big bang .
The CMB radiation has many hot and cold spots in it , but none above a certain size .
On the face of it , there is no reason why this should be so .
But a Bugle - shaped universe offers a simple explanation : at the time the spots formed 380,000 years after the big bang , there would not have been enough room for large spots to grow within the Bugle shape .
Apple
Although apples are not a shape that could describe our universe as we see it , this healthier snack could help us understand our universe ’s hidden dimensions .
Several of the big theories in physics , like string theory , predict that our universe has more dimensions than humans are aware of .
We live in a four - dimensional universe , moving in length , breadth , height and time .
But there may be many other dimensions – each of them curled up so tightly they are too small for us to perceive them .
Some physicists have tentatively suggested that they should be apple - shaped , because that shape helps explain why the universe ’s fundamental particles come in threes .
For example , we observe three types of neutrino .
But it is possible that there is only one type of neutrino , and the three varieties we see are the result of neutrinos taking different routes through the hidden dimensions .
Because apple shapes are both concave and convex , there are three types of route the particles could take , potentially explaining the three observed types .
Jan Wöllert and Jörg Miedza , from Bremen , Germany , are the creators of these amazing light paintings .
Light painting , also known as light drawing or light graffiti is a photographic technique in which exposures are made usually at night or in a darkened room by moving a hand - held light source or by moving the camera ( wikipedia ) .

The molecular weight ( or molar mass ) of a substance is the mass of one mole of the substance , and can be calculated by summarizing the molar masses of all the atoms in the molecule .
Components in Dry Air
Air is a mixture of several gases , where the two most dominant components in dry air are 21 vol % oxygen and 78 vol % nitrogen .
Oxygen has a molar mass of 15.9994 g/mol and nitrogen has a molar mass of 14.0067 g/mol .
Since both of these elements are diatomic in air - O 2 and N 2 , the molar mass of oxygen gas is aprox .
32 g/mol and the molar mass of nitrogen gas is aprox .
28 g/mol .
The average molar mass is equal to the sum of the mole fractions of each gas multiplied by the molar mass of that particular gas :
M mixture = ( x 1 *M 1 + ......+ x n *M n ) ( 1 ) where x i = mole fractions of each gas
M i = the molar mass of each gas
The molar mass of dry air with oxygen , nitrogen and the other components as indicated below is 28.9647 g/mol .
Composition and content of each gas in air is given in the figures and the table below .

Air Density
The density of dry air can be calculated with the Ideal Gas Law
ρ = P / ( R T ) ( 1 ) where P = pressure ( Pa ) R air = 287.05 = individual gas constant [ J/kg K ] T = absolute temperature [ K ]
Example :
The density of dry air at atmospheric pressure 101.325 kPa ( 101325 Pa ) and 0 oC ( = 273.15 K ) can be calculated as
ρ = 101325 [ Pa ] / ( 287.05 [ J/kg K ] *273.15 [ K ] ) = 1.292 [ kg/m3 ]
Water Vapor
Water vapor is almost always present in air .
The content may vary and the maximum amount possible of water vapor in dry air depends on the temperature of the air .
Water vapor - H 2 O - is composed of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms .
Hydrogen is the lightest element with a molar mass of 1 g/mol , while oxygen has 16 g/mol .
Thus , the water vapor atom has an molar mass of 18 g/mol , and water vapor is lighter than O 2 with 32 g/mol and N 2 with 28 g/mol .
Note !
Water vapor in air will dilute the other gases and reduce the total density of the mixture .
Dry air is more dense than humid air !
The vapor in air may saturate to droplets when temperature is decreased or pressure is increased .
Humid air containing water molecules as liquid - droplets - may be more dense than dry air or humid air containing water only as vapor .

The A Softer World : Second Best is n't so Bad launch is in Montreal tonight ( Monday ! ) .

This time ?
WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN
It 's an ordinary small town in England , but its residents claim they 've discovered the secret that could save the planet .
And with world leaders preparing to gather in Copenhagen in just over a week 's time to debate how to do just that , the people of Todmorden in the Pennines this week issued an invitation : come to our town and see what we 've done .
In under two years , Todmorden has transformed the way it produces its food and the way residents think about the environment .
Compared with 18 months ago , a third more townspeople now grow their own veg ; almost seven in 10 now buy local produce regularly , and 15 times as many people are keeping chickens .
The town centre is dotted with " help yourself " vegetable gardens ; the market groans with local meat and vegetables , and at all eight of the town 's schools the pupils eat locally produced meat and vegetables every lunchtime .

" It 's a complete turnaround , " said Pam Warhurst , a former leader of Calderdale Council , board member of Natural England and the person who masterminded the project – called Incredible Edible – and motivated her friends and neighbours to join in .
" Our aim is to make our town entirely self - sufficient in food production by 2018 – and if we can carry on at the same rate as we 've done over the past 18 months since we had our first meeting and set this initiative up , we 're going to make it . "
And the scheme 's leaders are now hoping to export their idea : two weeks ago the town held a conference on how to make Incredible Edible - style initiatives work elsewhere , and more than 200 people from across Britain attended .
They heard the story of Todmorden 's transformation , starting with what Ms Warhurst calls the " propaganda planting " of vegetables around the town centre 18 months ago .
Nick Green , who runs a converted mill that provides workspace for local artists , took on the job of doing the planting .
He said he chose the first venue – a disused health centre – because it was in the middle of the town and would attract plenty of attention .
" We wanted everyone to see what we were doing , so they could ask questions and ultimately join in , " he said .
" The old health centre has plenty of land in front , so it was ideal .
I did n't ask anyone 's permission : I just went there with my spade and my seeds and I planted cabbages and rhubarb . "
Incredible Edible was originally funded out of the participants ' own pockets .
" We were very clear that we did n't want to look at what grants were available and mould our projects to suit them , " said Mr Green .
" We felt that what would work was to start with the town and what it needed .
We 'd look for money later on . "
What the project leaders found was that a lot could be achieved with small amounts of cash .
And awards and grants have followed – the latest is the Kerrygold Farmers ' Co-operatives Awards last week , when Incredible Edible won the " most inspirational community project " and £ 1,000 .
One of the founding principles of the movement has been to make it as inclusive as possible ; in this it differs from transition towns , said Ms Warhurst .
" We are working with people who would find transition towns hard to identify with .
Our project is all about finding the lowest common denominator , which is food , and then speaking in a language that everyone can understand .
Plus we do n't have strategies ; we do n't have visiting speakers ; we do n't have charters and documents .
We just get on with things : this is all about action . "
The project has been moulded to fit with where people in Todmorden are and the lives they lead .
Many live in homes without gardens , and the local social housing landlord , Pennine Housing , has given out more than 1,000 starter packs of seeds and growing troughs , and invited tenants to cooking and gardening classes .
" There are people here who do n't own a recipe book and who do n't have a garden , but we want to show them that they can still cook and grow vegetables , " said Val Morris , the tenant involvement officer for Pennine Housing .
Other town - wide initiatives include a foraging course , on which participants learn how to find food for free , and then how to make preserves , jams and chutneys with their findings – and , more controversially , a workshop on how to kill and pluck your own chickens .
" It 's not for the faint hearted , but there 's something entirely honest and right about killing the chickens you 're going to eat , " said Lynne Midwinter , a physiotherapist in the town who took her eight - year - old daughter along .
" For my daughter , it 's entirely normal to see chickens being killed and to help pluck them .
" Some parents might think you can't let your kids see that , but what I 'd say is , what kind of a life did the chickens your child usually eats have ?
Our chickens have a good life ; they die a quick death , and seeing all that teaches the connection between rearing animals and eating them , which has been lost in much of the Western world today . "
Ms Midwinter has also helped persuade local businesses to support Incredible Edible .
" One of our early initiatives was to give all the stalls in the covered market a blackboard on which they could advertise any local food they were selling , to encourage them to sell more local food and to shout about it when they did , " she said .
" And it 's definitely worked .
You now see most of the stalls advertising the fact that they 're selling local beef and lamb , pork and bread , vegetables and even cheese – the first - ever Todmorden cheese , which is called East Lee , is now produced by the Pextenement Cheese Company at a farm on a hillside above the town . "
Another venture has been the planting of apple , pear and plum trees at the town 's newly built health centre .
" The PCT was all set to grow the usual prickly bushes around it , and we said – hold on a second , why not food ? " said Ms Warhurst .
" They agreed , and we 're going to encourage people to pick their fruit whenever they 're passing the doctor's .
Apart from giving them fresh fruit , maybe putting the trees there will help people make the connection between healthy eating , and being healthy . "
Other projects in the pipeline include a 50 m - long polytunnel being set up to grow bigger amounts of food and vegetables on a site just outside the town , a drop - in jam - making centre , a woodwork shop to supply chicken huts and greenhouses , and a vegetable garden at elderly people 's care homes in the area which will be designed so that residents will be able to garden and pick vegetables from their wheelchairs .
There are also two herb gardens , one beside the main road and one at the new health centre .
" Anyone can pick the herbs .
They 're a great way to get people enthused about cooking , " said Helena Cook , who looks after the gardens .
She is also involved in trying to infect other local communities with the Incredible Edible spirit .
" I 'm a primary school teacher in a neighbouring town , Littleborough , and I 've set up an Incredible Edible growing project with my pupils , " she said .
" The great thing is that it pulls the parents in as well , and I know some of them have already started growing their own vegetables at home .
All of us who are involved in the Todmorden project try to export it to other neighbourhoods we have contact with . "
The next project on the horizon is a fish farm that 's being set up on land adjacent to the high school .
Incredible Edible has applied for a lottery grant of £ 750,000 to set the farm up , and Ms Warhurst says she 's confident their bid will be confirmed soon .
There are also plans to offer a diploma in environmental and land - based studies to 14 to 19 - year - olds , using local growing and food production initiatives as a resource .
" That 's fantastic because it 's making our school a centre of excellence at teaching this vital skill – and it's kids who go into this kind of work who are going to be most useful to the world of tomorrow , " said Ms Warhurst .
" The vital thing about Incredible Edible , and the thing that sets it apart , is that it involves everyone in the town and it 's genuinely a grass - roots project .
I honestly believe it's a blueprint for every neighbourhood .
What we 're doing here could easily be rolled out anywhere .
It 's all about involving people , giving them ownership , letting them realise it can be fun and interesting and that the food is delicious , and giving them space to set up their own ideas and run with them . "
Ms Warhurst and the rest of the Incredible Edible team are now looking forward to their Christmas treat – a home - cooked dinner of turkey and all the trimmings in a local church centre , with every ingredient sourced locally .
" We 're growing the potatoes and sprouts on a special piece of land we call the Christmas dinner patch , " said Helena Cook .
" All the food , including the turkey , will be from Todmorden .
" There are even crumbs from locally baked bread , and local fruit , in my secret recipe Christmas pudding ! "

Smallholder
" Three years ago I gave up my job as a designer in London and moved to a converted barn above Todmorden to run a smallholding .
So I was already here and keeping my own pigs , sheep , chicken and goats , but Incredible Edible has given a huge boost to what I do because it 's made people in the town so much more aware of issues around locally produced food .
The eggs I sell , for example , are n't watery like a lot of supermarket eggs : they 've got big , orange yolks .
And , perhaps most surprising of all , they 're cheaper . "
Pauline Mullarkey , 39
Mother of three
" I 'd never grown a vegetable in my life and I had absolutely no idea how to do it , but when I heard about Incredible Edible from another mum in the school playground I knew it made sense .
I started in my own garden by growing vegetables .
It was far easier than I 'd expected it to be .
This year we 've had potatoes , leeks , carrots , cabbage , strawberries , onions , garlic , peas , parsnips and sprouts , and I do n't spend more than two hours a week in the garden .
" I also keep chickens .
I 've now got 15 , and I 'm currently putting together a map of everyone in the town who has them .
The eventual aim is for every egg consumed in Todmorden to be a local one .
We 're working towards producing 30,000 eggs a week , and it 's entirely possible that by 2018 our egg production will be at those levels .
And people catch on quick – you often hear people in shops asking for Todmorden eggs . "
Tony Mulgrew , 46
Catering manager at Todmorden High School
" There was some wasteland beside the school and one day I looked out at it and thought , we could grow the vegetables for the school dinners on that !
I asked the governors , they agreed , and we started growing in February 2009 .
Year 8 and Year 10 pupils helped , and by the summer term we were able to serve tomato soup made from our tomatoes , as well as potatoes , courgettes , runner beans , lettuce , endive and chard .
" The fruit was amazing – we had blueberries , gooseberries – and the strawberries went on for ages .
What was really good was the pride the pupils took in seeing the food they 'd helped produce on the menu in the school dining room .
I also source all our meat from local farms .
I 'd say that all the meat we serve here is produced within a half - hour 's walk from the door .
Plenty of top restaurants can't make that boast . "

Sculptor and owner of local mill that provides workspace for other artists
" In April 2008 they told me : you 're our guerrilla gardener !
So off I went and started planting vegetables .
I started with rhubarb because the great thing about it is that people recognise it , so they know when it 's ready to pick .
At that stage I put up a sign inviting people to pick whatever they wanted to take home .
And people did .
We wanted to show that it 's a project for anyone , that it 's about ownership for the whole community .
" I 've now got lots of food growing all over Todmorden – chard and kale as well as rhubarb – and we 've recruited people from the mental health inclusion scheme to help with the planting .
That 's been a good move because people with mental health problems appreciate the chance to do meaningful work , and what could be more meaningful than growing food for the whole community ? "

Countdown covered Brian Williams interview with Bush last night .
Download - WMV Download - QT
For someone who does not like how the public perceives him , Bush does not help his case any in this interview .
Take this little exchange :
WILLIAMS : When you take a tour of the world , a lot of Americans e-mail me with their fears that , some days they just wake up and it just feels like the end of the world is near .
And you go from North Korea to Iran , to Iraq , to Afghanistan , and you look at how things have changed , how Americans are viewed overseas , if that is important to you .
Do you have any moments of doubt that we fought a wrong war ?
Or that there 's something wrong with the perception of America overseas ?
BUSH : Well those are two different questions , did we fight the wrong war , and absolutely -- I have no doubt -- the war came to our shores , remember that .
We had a foreign policy that basically said , let 's hope calm works .
And we were attacked .
Last week Bush said that he never implied any connection between Iraq and 9/11 , yet both Iraq and the War on Terror have again been lumped together and Bush says that the war " came to our shores " .
Sure the war with terrorism did , but the war with Iraq did not come to our shores .
Is it any wonder why people say the White House has tried to link Saddam and 9/11 ?
Throughout the interview , Bush tries to keep up his " good ole ' boy " appearance , which comes off more as the incompetence appearance .
The best part comes at the end :
WILLIAMS : How have you been read wrong ?
BUSH : I do n’t know .
I frankly do n't pay that much attention .
I do n’t want to hurt people ’s feelings , but …
WILLIAMS : Still not watching television , huh ?
BUSH : I watched a good baseball game .
If Bush would have decided to watch television last August and turn it to any of the news channels out there ( including FOX ) , then perhaps aide would have gotten to the Gulf Coast quicker .
Remember the report that White House aides had to make a DVD of the coverage and were arguing over who had to give it to Bush and ultimately break the news to him that America had just lost an entire city ?
I would still love to see that DVD and how hacked the coverage of Katrina actually was .
