Ms. Jekel worries about exposing inherently naïve students , who are as sexual as the next college student , to the complexities of dating .
Women on the spectrum are especially vulnerable sexually and emotionally , since they have problems deciphering intentions .
Men are at risk , too , misreading clear signals of rejection ( “ I ’m busy ” ) ; instead , they might pursue a romance until a confrontation results .
Some assume conventional learning - disability programs will do for such students .
But that ’s a mistake , experts say .
Students on the spectrum need help chopping course loads into manageable bites .
They need to learn how to act appropriately in class — correcting professors or asking too many questions are common gaffes .
They also need support with ticklish social issues like roommates who complain they are too messy or who lock them out when a date stays overnight .
“ That ’s a little bit different from what administrators normally do , ” says Richard Allegra , director of professional development for the Association on Higher Education and Disability .
“ If a blind student needs books in Braille , they know how to do that . ”
Most advisers just do n’t have the training or the time to shepherd students with cognitive disabilities .
One student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tells of being assigned , because of a family connection , to a freshman adviser whose son had Asperger ’s .
“ He met with me weekly , ” says the student , Richard , who describes his Asperger ’s as mild and asked that his last name be omitted for fear of being stigmatized .
“ It helped keep me on track , ” he says .
“ He would just light a fire under you once in a while . ”
Sophomore year he had a different adviser , one who was not personally invested .
Meetings dwindled to monthly or less .
Richard ’s grades dropped as he stayed up late into the night roaming the Internet and procrastinating .
“ I was just not getting the work done , ” he says .
Colleges are devising programs that try to integrate students on the spectrum into the academic and social fabric of the campus .
The Essex campus of the Community College of Baltimore County , in a joint program with a state agency and a local school , has hired a special - education teacher to help students organize their time and assignments and improve the skills that are second nature to most , like how much space goes between two people in a conversation or how to make gentle eye contact .
At Keene State College , in New Hampshire , fellow students act as “ social navigators . ”
Their assignment : change their charges ’ “ outsider ” status by introducing them to their friends .
The mentors get $ 10 an hour ( and sometimes course credit in psychology ) by helping students on the spectrum make small talk , date and get consent at every level of romantic advancement .
For example , says Larry Welkowitz , who helped create the program : “ Would it be O.K. if I asked you out on a date ? ” “ Would it be O.K. if I kissed you ? ”
Some 50 undergraduates have participated in the program , which Professor Welkowitz calls “ the single best intervention _ I just know it because of how I have seen their lives change . ”
In turn , he says , the mentors develop new understanding .
“ We ’re learning about ourselves , ” Professor Welkowitz says .
“ A lot of us have a dash of autism . ”
At Marshall University , the West Virginia Autism Training Center operates a program in which graduate students work daily with students with Asperger ’s , reviewing assignments , helping with time management and teaching classroom etiquette .
They take the students on field trips to Wal - Mart , to restaurants and to the movie theater to let them practice social skills .
Bottom line for parents : $ 6,200 a year .
Mr Rove denies any part in the leak
Robert Luskin said he had heard the news from the special prosecutor in the case , Patrick Fitzgerald , on Monday .
Another official , Lewis Libby , has been charged with perjury and obstructing justice .
He has resigned pending trial .
Covert CIA operative Valerie Plame 's name appeared in the media in 2003 after her husband criticised the Bush government over the invasion of Iraq .
Ms Plame 's husband , former US Ambassador Joseph Wilson , said the administration had twisted intelligence to justify going to war .
' Elated '
Correspondents say the announcement lifts a legal and political cloud from the White House , which has had to face a stream of bad news in the run-up to November 's mid-term Congressional elections .
We believe the special counsel 's decision should put an end to the baseless speculation about Mr Rove 's conduct
Robert Luskin ,
Karl Rove 's lawyer
Q&A : CIA leak case
Both Mr Libby and Mr Rove deny having played any part in the leak .
Mr Libby is accused of lying to FBI investigators and a grand jury about how and when he learned that Ms Plame was a CIA officer and of lying about disclosing classified information to reporters .
But Mr Luskin said he hoped Mr Rove would now be left in peace .
" Special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald formally advised us that he does not anticipate seeking charges against Karl Rove , " Mr Luskin said .
" We believe the special counsel 's decision should put an end to the baseless speculation about Mr Rove 's conduct . "
A spokesman for Mr Rove told the Associated Press news agency he was " elated " by the news .
Bush ' stronger '
Republican politicians reacted with relief .
Former House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich told Reuters news agency the president was looking " a little better , a little stronger " .
But Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean told the NBC network : " I think this is probably good news for the White House , but it 's not very good news for America . "
Mr Rove has testified several times before a grand jury in the case and is expected to face further questioning about his conversations with reporters at the time of the leak .
US Vice - President Dick Cheney , for whom Mr Libby worked as chief of staff at the time of the scandal , could also be called to testify in the case .

The types of bacteria are determined according to their shape , structure , and feeding mechanisms .
Shapes vary from rod-shaped , spiral or spherical ones which are called cocci bacteria .
Bacteria found in plants are different from those found in animals .
Some are heterotrophic , meaning they feed on organic carbon .
Otherwise , they are parasites that either kill or help their host .
Humans were not able to catch sight of them until 1674 .
While studying pond water and human mouth scrapings under the newly - invented microscope , Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek detected the tiny floating “ animacules ” .
Life on Earth could not last without bacteria .
The cycle starts with the release of nitrates from bacteria found in soil .
Every single plant needs that substance to be able to produce essential elements called amino acids .
From there , the rest follows and the cycle repeats .
A single human cell contains 10 cells of bacteria .
With that 1:10 ratio and the fact that your intestine has more bacteria than the earth has people , therefore , your body is full of bacteria .
Apart from the 99 % of good bacteria , the 1 % bad bacteria are called “ pathogens ” .
This type is harmful to the human body and could cause diseases like tuberculosis , pneumonia , cholera , rickets , and plague .
Escherichia coli ( E.coli ) , for instance , is a common gastrointestinal tract bacteria and is very much part of the normal bacterial flora .
However , some of its strains could produce toxins that could cause serious infections .
In the 1920s , Alexander Fleming warned about the possible resistance of bacteria to antibiotics .
Many doctors and healthcare professionals have been warning us for years now about over use of antibiotics to treat conditions that would be better left alone .
The misuse of these drugs leads to the creation of bacteria which become resistant to treatment .
We call them superbugs , and cases of them are on the increase .
However , the Scottish biologist made the marvelous discovery of penicillin in the 20th century and has served the warning which could be caused by improper overuse .
Bacteria do not cause colds or sore throats ; viruses do .
Hence , taking antibiotics could not cure these conditions and could actually cause real harm to your health .
Aside from having individual fingerprints , every single human also has a unique belly button ecosystem .
Different bacteria combinations dwell in each person , as scientists discovered at least 1,458 new bacteria species by only using belly button material .
A volunteer was even found to carry Japanese soil bacteria in its belly button despite never being to Japan prior to the experiment .
The bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis is responsible for the body odor associated with sweating .
Human sweat is originally odorless .
However , this bacteria which resides on human skin combine with other microorganisms and produce essences from sweat , thus , the smell .
These bacteria inhabit mainly sweaty parts like armpits , but they could also be in your nostrils and your back .
A gene could prevent the production of sweat , therefore the absence of the body odor bacteria .
If you live in the Far East , particularly in East Asia , you may have a particular gene mutation called ABCC11 which will mean that you do not sweat , or produce sweat that attracts bacteria .
Therefore you wo n’t suffer from body odour .
Other people across the world have this gene too , but it is most prevalent in East Asia .
Gonorrhea bacteria is a type of bacteria that could lift up to 100,000 times their own weight .
For comparison , ants are considered as the strongest creatures for their ability to carry things that are 100 times greater than their own body weight .
Chocolate is an antibacterial food .
Contrary to popular belief that this sweet stuff ruins your teeth , chocolate protects your teeth and helps fight against germs that make tooth decay .
Australian physician Barry Marshall proved that bacteria is the cause of stomach ulcers .
For his experiment , he downed a beakerful of bacterial culture to show that stress is not the culprit for stomach ulcers .
This research won him the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2005 after developing stomach ulcers from the deliberate culture consumption .
Bacterial strains have a role in a lesser - known treatment method for cancer .
It is a given that chemotherapy is the most famous method , but there are also other alternatives .
One is where depleted bacterial strains of bovine tuberculosis undergo urethral delivery and eradicate cancer cells , thanks to the immune response as a result .
The method is also known to be safer than that of chemo .
Bacteria from worms have healing benefits .
Wounded soldiers during the civil war were exposed to infection by worms .
Bioluminescent bacteria springs from these worms .
They could not only glow in the dark , but they could also eliminate pathogens .
Therefore , soldiers gain an increase in life expectancy .
Adults are immune to C. botulinum , a bacteria that produces toxic poison .
However , the immune system of infants is yet to be resistant to the bacteria .
These bacteria , which flourishes in honey , are the cause for botulism and could annihilate the entire population of the United States with as little as a properly - distributed spoonful .
Those morning mouth chunks are bacteria .
No , those white bits of foul smells that you find in your mouth in the morning are not pieces of any food .
They are formed by bacteria and sweat from the tonsils which have hardened overnight .
Bacteria are also used in the creation of many foods .
Research promotes the benefits of having good bacteria in foods and how their presence aids digestion .
Examples of bacteria - rich common snacks are selected cheeses , yogurt , sourdough bread , and pickles .
Other foods that are just rising into fame are tempeh , miso , kimchi , sauerkraut , and kefir .
Bacteria could enter and grow inside an egg .
A thin organic layer protects eggs that have not yet been washed .
This cover allows for a safe shelf - storage for them .
However , washing the eggs removes the protective layer .
The egg is then exposed to bacteria that could enter through the surface ’s tiny pores .
A particular bacteria species travels in its environment through magnetic fields .
Called the magnetospirillum magneticum , this species embodies the free iron radicals present in its surroundings .
It then converts the elements into active magnetite , aligning it in its body like a spine that could be used in traveling .
Bacteria found in our guts aid in food digestion .
Moreover , further research shows that such microbial diversity has the ability to either cause or prevent obesity .
Hopes are up that science could one day solve how bacteria could keep bodies slim through studies of human bacteria in mice guts .
Store - bought mayonnaise was once suspected of causing food poisoning .
This claim was later proven false , given the fact that mayo prevents bacteria from growing in food .
Other ingredients for the picnic could be the real cause , though , like meat .
One of the most numerous living organisms on Earth is the eubacteria , or " true " bacteria .
These unicellular species belong to the domain bacteria and exist at 40 million per single soil gram .
All over the world , 4,000 different species of bacteria exist even in the extremities of volcanoes , radioactive waste , and deep layers of the Earth ’s crust .
A certain type of bacteria is responsible for the scent that you smell when it rains .
It is called actinomycetes , and it could be found on the soil .
As much as it causes the smell that emanates after the rain , it is also the cause behind the earthy taste in water .
Using a paper towel is safer than using a hand dryer , in contrast to what many believe .
The hand dryer - over - paper towel thought follows the idea that there is no contact involved with the machine .
The truth is that paper towels could help decrease the number of bacteria by 45 - 60 % .
On the other hand , the hand dryer procreates moist and warm environments that are perfect growing places for bacteria .
Hence , bacteria count rises up to 255 % with the hand dryer .
Kangeroo bacteria might hold the key to stop greenhouse gas emissions .
Kangaroos do n’t break wind !
In fact they do n’t produce any methane at all in their stomachs .
Scientists are intrigued by this and are now trying to harvest the bacteria they have in their colons to see if there is anything in there that could potentially help with reducing greenhouse gases .
The worst offenders for producing methane in the animal world are cows – and researchers are hopeful that whatever they discover in the tummies of kangaroos can somehow be transferred into cows to reduce the emissions they produce .
Scientists have used bacteria from cows to treat bladder cancer .
Cattle which suffer from bovine tuberculosis have samples taken from them , which are then cultured and weakened in a laboratory .
The resultant bacteria is then injected into the urethra of people who have bladder cancer .
This treatment has shown itself to be very effective and has even outperformed chemotherapy in terms of its ability to manage the disease .
Bacteria could survive without food .
In cases where they ran out of resources , they deliberately stop meddling with the mechanisms inside them .
This action is in confidence that beneficial changes could equip their survival under such conditions , and is a classic example of something called active evolution .
Scientists have found 8 - million - year - old bacteria in ice .
This ice was found in a glacier in Antarctica about 16 feet below ground in 2007 .
Scientists isolated and resuscitated some of the bacteria and organisms in it , and found they were up to 8 million years old .
Some of these are now being grown in laboratories , but would cause little to no harm to humans now .
When ice melts because of global warming , these bacterial colonies will come back to life , so scientists are keen to find out what they are and how they will develop .
Bacteria may be able to clean up serious oil spills in the future .
Over the last few years we have seen some terrible and destructive oil spills – one of the worst in memory was the spill caused by BP in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 .
The damage to plant and marine life is incalculable .
Scientists in the USA are working on developing strains of bacteria that want to eat oil .
In the future , if such disasters occur again , they can release colonies of these organisms into the water and earth , destroying the oil without detriment to the environment .
The US Navy once undertook a mission involving bacteria .
Operation Seaspray took place during the 1950s in San Francisco .
The US Navy took balloons and filled them with various pathogens .
These were then released and burst into the air over the city .
A short while after this occurred , doctors in the city reported that there was a sharp increase in the number of people reporting to them with pneumonia and urinary infections .
The experiment was set up to see how , if the USA underwent a biological attack with nuclear weapons , the wind would carry the released particles , and how they might possibly affect people ’s health .
Listening to music can create bacteria .
Strange but true : you might not think about this , but every time you put your headphones on to listen to your favourite tunes , you ’re exposing yourself to millions of bacteria that mutate .
Listening to music through earphones or headphones for just one hour a day can multiply the amount of bacteria in your ears 700 times over !

Hey , today 's the iPod 's fifth birthday , born October 23 , 2001 .
We 'd sing Happy Birthday , but copyright law prevents us from doing so unless we pay the owner of that song .
So instead of crooning that hackneyed ditty , we 're going to spread the haterage about the iPod .

The iPod gets so much adoring and worshipful press — we ink-stained ( pixel - stained ? ) wretches are fawning over it 24/7 — so we figured it was high time somebody took it down a notch or two .
As my Gizmodo colleagues hide in the closet , they 've shoved me out into the limelight to take the heat , offering my Top 10 Reasons Why I Hate You , iPod .
So get your flamethrowers ready .
Here goes :
There 's no FM : we have some great FM stations around these parts , one jazz station in particular that I listen to all the time in the car .
I can't do that with the iPod .
How much more would it cost to put FM in that thing , maybe two bucks ?
Get over it , put the damn receiver and there and be done with it .

More haterage , after the jump .
Scratches :
Yes , the new aluminum iPod nano is allegedly scratch - resistant , but it 's retro , looking kinda like the old mini .
We do n't like going backwards .
Our first - gen iPod nano looked like a skating rink on day two , and we were coddling it in microfiber most of the time .
What , does it have a wax coating ?
What good is a beautiful design that gets all scratched up if you touch it ?
Meh .
Battery life :
We still have n't forgotten about the first - generation iPod whose battery wore out quicker than a prematurely - ejaculating teen .
Plus , it was nigh on impossible to replace there for a while .
Now , the batteries still wo n't last long enough , even in the newest models .
There are cheap Taiwan knockoffs that last twice as long .
Fix that .
DRM : Digital rights management is shit , no matter how you slice it .
Sure , Apple 's DRM , called FairPlay , gives you a little more leeway , but we 'd rather not have anyone telling us what we can do with music we 've purchased .
Makes us want to steal it .

i Tunes is janky : iTunes is weird , and although we have no trouble using it , we 're getting tired of teaching our grandparents all of its intricacies .
We thought this was Apple , where everyone could use it and it would be easy .
iTunes is not easy enough , and does n't follow Windows conventions closely enough .
No Bluetooth : How hard can it be to put Bluetooth in the iPod ?
Then we could get rid of all those wires with their auto - tangle feature , seemingly wrapping around themselves while you 're not looking , requiring an untangling session a few times a day .
Bring on the Bluetooth .

Thief magnet :
This is not really the iPod 's fault , but the damn things are so popular , if you 're wearing white earphones , you might as well have just painted a big target on your back .
At least release some official black Apple iPod earbuds , or various colors ...?
Maybe that 'll throw the muggers off for a little while .
My kid wants a new one every six months : Steve Jobs himself talked about how iPods must often be replaced .
Sure , any consumer electronics device that 's cutting edge will be obsolete quickly , but at least you can make them less appealing to my kid , whose nagging me for a new one on a regular basis .

No widescreen :
You 're making the mistake of the Microsoft Zune , sticking with that old - fashioned 4x3 aspect ratio .
We want wide screen ; that 's the way of the future .
While you 're at it , give us better than 640x480 video on iTunes .
No WiFi : speaking of Zune , you could 've put WiFi on the iPod a long time ago , and not crippled it seven ways to Sunday , too , as Microsoft is about to do .
Another missed opportunity .

" A lot of our evangelists are evangelists because they simply love the product , " said Laurie Weisberg , a senior vice president of Informative , a word - of - mouth marketing firm .
" They do n't need to be rewarded with discounts or anything like that . "
Loosely borrowing from Malcolm Gladwell 's best - selling book " The Tipping Point , " Ms. Weisberg lectured on the importance of using " influencers , " or people who have large social networks and are good communicators , and " promoters , " people who talk positively about a brand .
Word - of - mouth marketing makes it easier for people to do something they already do : share knowledge about new products so they can feel more important , said George Silverman , the author of " The Secrets of Word - of - Mouth Marketing . "
" People engage in word of mouth because they want to look good , " Mr. Silverman said .
" Word of mouth is the most honest advertising medium there is .
People do n't want to hurt their friends and family and colleagues with bad information . "
The importance of ethics and full disclosure was also a recurrent theme at the conference , as speakers repeatedly warned attendees not to misrepresent themselves when , for instance , pitching a product on an online message board .
In other words , do not try to be stealthy , said Robert Ricci , the director of Web relations for Weber Shandwick , a public relations firm that is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies .
" If you 're working on a video game , and you go onto a video gamer 's blog , let your contacts know that you are an employee of said company , " Mr. Ricci said while leading a session titled " How to Work with Bloggers and Communities , the Ethical Way . "
" Always let them know what your intentions are up front . "
But replacing traditional advertising with word - of - mouth and viral marketing is an outlandish notion for most companies .
A session devoted to integrating word - of - mouth marketing with traditional advertising drew a crowd , but the main lesson seemed to be how to persuade a C - list celebrity to market your product free .

Last Monday ’s post How to Become an Early Riser obviously struck a chord with many people .
That post has generated more links than I can count , sending more new traffic to this site than any other post or article I ’ve written .
And the traffic logs indicate that the surge was decentralized ( not attributable to a mention in any one major source ) .
You can get an idea of what that post did for StevePavlina.com ’s traffic at Alexa ( note the big spike at the end of May 2005 ) .
Alexa is n’t very accurate , but it ’s good enough for noting general trends .
Last Monday
I did a Google search on “ how to become an early riser ” ( in quotes ) .
It returned zero results .
Now look at how many results it returns .
OK , so this was an instalanche .
But why ?
Getting up early is a relatively benign topic , is n’t it ?
At least I thought it was at the time I posted it .
Since this appears to be a topic of interest , even though I do n’t fully understand why , I figured I ’d do a follow up post to add some more detail .
First , on the subject of going to bed when you ’re sleepy … to do this correctly requires a mixture of awareness and common sense .
If you ’re doing stimulating activities before bed , you ’ll be able to stay up later and stave off sleepiness for a while .
In college I used to participate in poker games that went until dawn , and then we ’d often go out to breakfast afterwards .
I can easily stay up later than my normal range of bed times if I work , go out with friends , or do other stimulating activities .
But this is n’t what I meant by noticing when you ’re sleepy .
I mentioned the test of not being able to read more than a couple pages of text without losing concentration .
This does n’t mean waiting until you ’re about to drop from exhaustion .
The onset of sleepiness I ’m referring to is when your brain starts releasing hormones to knock you out .
This is different from just being tired .
You actually feel yourself getting drowsy .
But in order for this to happen , you need to create the right conditions for it to occur .
This means giving yourself some downtime before bedtime .
I find that reading is a great way to wind down before bed .
Some people say reading in bed is a bad idea … that you should only sleep in bed .
I ’ve never had a problem with it though , since when I ’m too sleepy to keep reading , I can just put the book down and go to sleep .
But read in a chair if you prefer .
Another test you can use is this .
Ask yourself , “ If I were to go to bed now , how quickly could I fall asleep ? ”
If you think it would take more than 15 minutes to fall asleep , I say go ahead and stay up .
Once you set a fixed awakening time , it may take a bit of practice to hone in on the right range of bedtimes for you .
In the beginning you may see some huge oscillations , staying awake too late one night and going to bed too early another night .
But eventually you ’ll get a feel for when you can go to bed and fall asleep right away while allowing yourself to wake up refreshed the next day .
As a failsafe to keep yourself from staying up too late , give yourself a bedtime deadline , and even if you are n’t totally sleepy , go to bed by that time no matter what .
I have a good idea of the minimum amount of sleep I need .
6.5 hours per night is sustainable for me , but I can do 5 hours in a pinch and be OK as long as I do n’t do it every night .
The maximum I ever sleep is 7.5 hours .
Before I started waking up at a fixed time each morning , I ’d often sleep 8 - 9 hours , sometimes even 10 hours if I was really tired .
If you consume caffeine during the day , it ’s likely to mess with your sleep cycles .
So the original post assumes you are n’t drugging yourself to stay awake .
If you ’re addicted to caffeine , then break the addiction first .
Do n’t expect natural sleepiness to occur at the right time if you ’re screwing with your brain chemistry .
The idea of the original post was to explain how to develop the habit of arising early .
So the advice is geared towards creating the habit .
Once the habit is established , it runs more subconsciously .
You can be doing stimulating activities like work or playing video games , and you ’ll just know when it ’s time for you to go to bed , even though it may be a different time each night .
The sleepiness test is important for developing the habit , but subtler signals will take over afterwards .
You can always sleep in late now and then if you need to .
If I stay up until 3 am , I ’m not going to get up at 5 am the next morning .
But I ’ll return to my usual routine the next day .
I recommend getting up at the same time for 30 days straight to lock in the habit , but after that you ’ll be so conditioned to waking up at the same time that it will be hard to sleep in .
I decided to sleep in late one Saturday morning and did n’t set my alarm , but I woke up automatically at 4:58 am .
Then I tried to sleep in , but I was wide awake and could n’t fall back asleep again .
Oh well .
Once the habit is established , it is n’t hard at all to get up , assuming you ’re going to bed at the onset of sleepiness .
If you have kids , adapt as needed .
My kids are ages 5 and 1 .
Sometimes they wake me up in the middle of the night — my daughter is in the habit of doing this lately , popping into the bedroom to tell my wife and me about her dreams or sometimes just to chat .
And I know what it ’s like when there ’s a baby waking up every few hours .
So if you ’re in that situation , I say that the rule is to sleep when you can .
Babies are n’t very good at sticking to schedules . 🙂
If you ca n’t get yourself out of bed when your alarm goes off , this is likely due to a lack of self - discipline .
If you have enough self - discipline , you ’ll get out of bed no matter what .
Motivation can also help , but motivation is short lived and may only last a few days .
Discipline is like a muscle .
The more you build it , the more you can rely on it .
Everyone has some discipline ( can you hold your breath ? ) , but not everyone develops it .
There are a lot of ways to build discipline — you can read the whole six - part series on self - discipline to learn how .
Basically it comes down to taking on little challenges , conquering them , and gradually progressing to bigger ones .
It ’s like progressive weight training .
As your self - discipline gets stronger , a challenge like getting out of bed at a certain time will eventually become trivially easy .
But if your self - discipline has atrophied , it can seem an almost insurmountable hurdle .
Why get up early ?
I ’d say the main reason is that you ’ll have a lot more time to do things that are more interesting than sleeping .
Again , I ’ve gained about 10 - 15 hours per week doing this .
That extra time is very noticeable .
By 6:30 am , I ’ve already exercised , showered , had breakfast , and I ’m at my desk ready to go to work .
I can put in a lot of hours each day of productive work , and I ’m usually done with work by 5:00 pm ( and that includes personal “ work ” like email , paying bills , picking up my daughter from preschool , etc ) .
This gives me 5 - 6 hours of discretionary time every evening for family , leisure activities , Toastmasters , reading , journaling , etc .
And best of all , I still have energy during this time .
Having time for everything that ’s important to me makes me feel very balanced , relaxed , and optimistic .
Think about what you could do with that extra time .
Even an extra 30 minutes per day is enough to exercise daily , read a book or two each month , maintain a blog , meditate daily , cook healthy food , learn a musical instrument , etc .
A small amount of extra time each day adds up to significant amounts over the course of a year .
30 minutes a day is 182.5 hours in a year .
That ’s more than a month of working full - time ( 40 hours per week ) .
Double it if you save 60 minutes a day , and triple it if you save 90 minutes a day .
For me the savings was about 90 minutes / day .
That ’s like getting a free bonus year every decade .
I ’m using this time to do things that I previously did n’t have the time and energy to do .
It ’s wonderful . 🙂

Changes in RC2
The official release of Firefox 2.0 is right around the corner and the second release candidate ( RC2 ) was made available last week .
Release candidates provide insight into the features and functionality that will be available in the final release .
Much has changed since the Firefox 2.0 alpha builds were made available to the public early this year .
A number of prominent features , including the innovative Places interface and revamped bookmark system have been removed and slated for resurrection in future versions .
The postponement of highly anticipated features generated a lot of controversy and led many to challenge the validity of the 2.0 designation .
Now that we are on the verge of the official 2.0 release , we can evaluate the changes and determine if the upcoming version lives up to the high standards set by its predecessors .
Numerous elements of the user interface have received a considerable stylistic overhaul .
Although these changes are primarily aesthetic in nature , several alterations also affect usability .
First present in the second beta release , the initial modifications suffered from several minor deficiencies that made the whole thing look rather awkward , particularly on Linux .
Most of the problems introduced by the visual changes were resolved in the first release candidate .
In RC1 and RC2 , the various elements of the URL bar finally have a consistent size and shape .
Unfortunately , the green arrow button is difficult to remove from URL bar , but it can be accomplished by hitting about : config and tweaking the browser.urlbar.hideGoButton , changing it to " true . "
The magnifying glass button in the search bar appears impossible to remove .
Toolbar progression from Beta 2 to RC2
These buttons are completely unnecessary for many users , and they needlessly waste toolbar space .
The icons have also been updated , and now feature more subdued colors .
I like the look of the new reload icon , but I prefer the lighter home icon from Beta 2 rather than the drab RC2 home icon .
GNOME users migh want to check out SooperDoode 's Tango skin for Firefox 2.0 , which is fully compatible with RC2 .
Tabs in Beta 2 and RC2
The appearance of tabs has also been altered .
In the second beta , the inactive tabs had a faded appearance , which made them difficult to read .
In RC1 , the fading was removed , and a gradient was added to the active tab .
The inactive tabs , which have a flat appearance , look as though they are in a row behind the active tab .
Although the new tab theme looks very attractive , it is n't consistent with the computer 's default system theme .
Visual integration is one of the factors that contributed to Firefox 's initial success over the original Mozilla browser suite .
Sacrificing visual consistency with the rest of the desktop for an elegant stylistic flourish could be counterproductive , particularly in light of the fact that many users who do n't care about visual consistency generally use specialized themes anyway .
Despite my preference for the unadulterated GTK look , I think that the new tab style is well done , and I 'm glad that they got rid of the faded effect used for inactive tabs in Beta 2 .
Tab management in IE7 and Firefox 2
Firefox 2.0 features improved tab management functionality inspired by concepts from Internet Explorer 7 .
In the 1.5.x series , Firefox perpetually decreases tab size in order to accommodate all presently open tabs .
In Firefox 2.0 , only a specific number of tabs will be displayed on the screen at any given time , and users can scroll through available tabs by using arrow buttons that appear on both ends of the tab bar ( or by using the mouse scroll wheel ) .
Additionally , a menu button provides a complete list of all available tabs , and enables the user to switch to a particular tab without any scrolling .
Note the similarities between IE 7 and Firefox 2.0 .
The latest iteration of Microsoft 's dominant web browser , which includes numerous features initially found in other browsers , has clearly generated some new features of its own , which in turn have been adopted by the open source upstart .
Although some may think poorly of feature - imitation , these signs of mutual influence are a positive reflection of the advantages of renewed competition in the browser market .
Although the tab scrolling feels a bit unnatural to me , it does increase usability .
The tab menu is a great idea , and it is relatively well implemented in Firefox 2.0 .
My only complaint is that one can't rearrange tabs by drag - and - drop reordering tab list items .
Dragging around the actual tabs can get cumbersome when a lot of scrolling is involved .

【お知らせ 】
OK , you 've all seen the story by now .
George W. Bush thinks he's got the right to peek through your mail without a warrant .
Now , nobody who reads this blog can possibly be a stranger to signing statements at this point .
We 've been reading about them for a long time .
We 've even debated a bit about what they really mean , legally and practically .
That is , legally speaking , they may not turn out to offer the Bush " administration " any protection if and when they do the things they are purporting to reserve the right to do .
But practically speaking , they give every indication that they may in fact be doing those things , and doing them unchallenged .
Which tends to take a bit of the shine off of the more optimistic legal view .
But as we 've sailed past the 800 mark in terms of how many of these signing statements
Bush has issued , and may well be on our way to 1,000 and beyond , they 're beginning to take on an additional meaning , beyond the legal and practical .
They 're taking on a symbolic meaning , although it might actually be true that they were meant to have this meaning all along .
And that symbolic meaning is that they demonstrate that Bush is reserving for himself the right to do anything .
He just keeps planting stakes further and further out , noting well that nobody 's really willing to set boundaries .
Do n't challenge me , he says , because I 'll make you prove you can make it stick .
That 's how I measure power .
If you can't physically restrain me from doing these things , you can't stop me .
It violates the law ?
Who cares ?
Have a signing statement .
The government 's being sued ?
Who cares ?
We 'll appeal forever .
Lose the appeals ?
Who cares ?
We 'll just change the terminology or continue in secret .
Investigated by Congress for it ?
Who cares ?
We 'll just flood them with irrelevant documents .
Subpoenaed to testify ?
Who cares ?
We just wo n't show .
Cited for Contempt ?
Who cares ?
We 'll appeal forever ( if we even permit the U.S. Attorney to prosecute in the first place ) .
It 's not just the sheer number of these signing statements anymore , but now , as this latest example illustrates so well , it 's also the sheer audacity of them that gives them their potency .
A declaration like this one , on top of similar declarations ( that received similarly poor receptions ) on warrantless surveillance of telephonic communications , is clearly a declaration that this president is frontally challenging basic privacy assumptions held by nearly everyone in America .
It is a declaration of his belief , however poorly founded , that he is " Commander in Chief " of everyone and everything , so long as he can claim that in the end , it was all for our own good .
It is also , I think , a declaration that Bush makes with one eye on our " table , " noting what 's not on it , and knowing full well what it is that Congressional Democrats do n't want to put there .
That 's something I think we can say with some confidence at this point , without even having to get into the wisdom of either side 's strategy .
He knows what Democrats are reluctant to do , and why .
By the same token , Democrats know ( to some extent , anyway ) what crazy things he 'll be willing to try as a result .
Things that , frankly , it 's hard to believe wo n't " wrongfoot " him with the great majority of the American people , to borrow a phrase .
And sure enough , he 's doing them .
Though I 'm not sure anyone fully anticipated a move this far out of step with American values .
But maybe we should have .
When you 're dealing with an " administration " that believes : 1 ) that the Constitution affords the president vast " inherent powers " that are unstated in the document , but extend to every facet of governance , and ; 2 ) that the current state of the law and legal precedent that says otherwise is simply wrongly decided , you 're gonna have problems .
And a lot of those problems are not dissimilar to the kind you'd have trying to dissuade a certifiably delusional mental patient of his affliction .
Except in this game , the suits are more expensive .
Have you ever seen The Madness of King George ?
There 's a great scene in which Dr. Willis , who eventually " cures " George III of his illness , muses aloud :
Do you know , Mr. Greville , the state of monarchy and the state of lunacy share a frontier ?
Some of my lunatics fancy themselves kings .
He ... is the king .
Where shall his fancy take refuge ?
How do you tell the difference between a " resolute " president , and one who 's just lost his mind ?
Everyone who can say no to him has said no to him , in the strongest ways that normal people recognize as being within bounds -- at least in the game of government .
And the president 's response ?
All I need is the support of my wife and my dog .
Who says something like that ?
Well , someone who lives in enough of a bubble that they can shut out the " noes . "
And who lives there ?
Dr. Willis knows :
Well , who 's to say what 's normal in a king ?
Hmm ?
Deferred to , agreed with , acquiesced in .
Who can flourish on such a daily diet of compliance ?
To be curbed ... stood up to ... in a word , thwarted , exercises the character , elasticates the spirit , makes it more pliant .
It 's the want of such exercise that makes rulers rigid .
Sounds familiar .
Little did I know that being a progressive liberal , and supporting the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples as legally recognized marriages , was supporting a societal shift that was planting the seeds of the end of my marriage .
Oh , I heard the far - right Dobsons and Falwells proclaiming that gay marriage would erode the institution of marriage , but I laughed at them .
" What narrow - minded bigotry , " I foolishly thought .
But indeed , it 's the far - right who got the last laugh as my marriage crumbled under the weight of society 's moral relativism in allowing committed , loving homosexual couples to enter into a legally recognized union .
I thought that when my wife and I found ourselves growing in different directions , when we tried to make things work out but we kept finding ourselves unable to live in harmony together , that it was because of our choices and our mistakes .
That getting married at the age of twenty was bound to cause problems down the road as people change so much in their twenties .
That we did n't give each other the extra commitment and work along the way to compensate for those changes .
That we had only ourselves to blame for our divorce .
But I was just making excuses for the encroachment of homosexuality into the institution of matrimony .
Gay marriage was just too much of a burden for our union to bear .
The weight of this basic civil liberty being extended to non-heterosexuals snapped our marriage in half like a two - by - four .
If only this society had held the line and stood firmer in its resolve to deny this basic freedom to those who fall in love with the same gendder , my children might still have happily married parents .
This has not been easy for me to admit .
How relieving it would be to once againsay that my ex and I take responsibility for the breakdown of our marriage , that the blame rests upon our shoulders .
How embarrassing and shameful it is , to be forced to acknowledge that forces beyond our control split us apart and ended our matrimonial bliss .
Moreover , how I feel such sympathy for such paragons of conservative virtue like Rush Limbaugh , or Newt Gingrich , who have known all along the destructive power that equal rights for gays and lesbians would wield over their marriages .
It 's practically as if the gay rights movement forced into Newt Gingrich 's hands the very divorce papers that he thrust into the hands of his cancer - ridden wife , or that the homosexual agenda stabbed the heart of Rush 's marriages , forcing him to be 0 for 3 .
And these clear - minded virtuous citizens never had the comfort that I had : that veneer of rationalization , the belief and acceptance that these divorces were , in fact , their own responsibility and their own fault .
They have always known the cold , humiliating truth about gay marriage being at the root of their marital dissolutions .
And those brave souls have my deepest sympathies - and now , empathy as well , as I too have been victimized by gay marriage .
There .
It was a burden to get off my chest , but I feel that somehow , I 've made the first step to recovery .
UPDATE :
The comments threads have shown that gay marriage has caused bee stings , flat tires , snowstorms ... my god , the menace promotion of this civil right has caused us .
We must get the word out of the irreparable harm promoting freedom causes !
Help spread the word , my fellow Kossacks !
— a fugitive since 2001 in a bizarre war that mixes free speech , copyright law , and the Church of Scientology .
Keith Henson 's journey began seven years ago while innocuously watching another critic mock the group on an internet newsgroup .
In a gonzo discussion about procuring a " Tom Cruise missile , " they 'd joked about working with " Secret Agent 99 , wearing a stunning black leather biker outfit . "
Other posters joined in the internet discussion , asking whether Tom Cruise missiles are affected by wind .
" No way , " Keith joked .
" Modern weapons are accurate to a matter of a few tens of yards .
" The police were informed of his " threatening " posts , and Henson was arrested The police tipsters were the Scientologists themselves , who had already been the targets of an annoying picketing campaign by Henson over the death of a woman near their complex .
Besides Henson 's inability to acquire long - range missiles , his wife notes bitterly that it would be impossible for any church members in the complex to feel threatened by the internet posts , since they are n't even allowed to access the internet .
Scientology officials have also claimed Henson followed their employees home — though Henson counters that " the same people who claimed to have been ' terrorized ' by the picketers offered to take them to lunch on June 25 , 2000 , evidently to distract them from the death scene being cleaned up .
" Though Henson was found innocent of long - range missile terrorism , for his activities he was convicted of interfering with a church — a California hate crime for which he received a six - month misdemeanor prison sentence .
But Henson said he feared his life would be in danger from Scientologists if he were imprisoned - and he fled to Canada in 2001 .
He was already bankrupt from an earlier ruling that he'd infringed on Scientology copyrights .
But Henson continued picketing Scientologists in Toronto , and they apparently retaliated by informing Canadian police of his presence .
( Henson believes the Scientologists told police he was a terrorist and bomb maker . ) reported two unmarked vans pulled up and " a handful of emergency - services task - force officers — Canada 's version of a police SWAT team — spilled out , wearing body armor and carrying submachine guns . "
Describing the event , the EFF reported Henson was " arrested in a shopping mall parking lot , by a heavily armed paramilitary unit .
" EFF Executive Director Shari Steele argued that Free speech was at stake in his case : " This trial seems intended to punish Mr. Henson for his opposition to a powerful organization using the barest thread of legal justification to do so .
" His wife added in an interview with a Canadian newsweekly that " It 's horrifying to me and to his friends how they 've managed to twist his words .
" Henson was ultimately released from a Canadian jail after filing an application for political asylum — reportedly the first ever accepted for review by the Canadian government , and for the next three years he lived as an expatriate in Canada , awaiting their decision .
When asked to describe life in Canada , he replied " colder . "
As the years rolled by , Henson explained his picketing strategy evolved out of a desire to have a real impact .
In a 2005 interview he argued that heavy - handed legal tactics intimidated police from acting against the organization , and " Starving Scientology of new members is perhaps the best we can do .
" But when Canadian officials reached a decision in 2005 , Henson was suddenly filled with concern .
The hearing could result in his deportation back to the prison where he feared for his life .
He reportedly said , " I 'm not going to be shoved across the border into the hands of Scientologists , " Henson slipped out of Canada , returning to fugitive status , and joked that he was hiding in the Mortmain Mountains — the treachorous range in Lemony Snicket books .
For 17 months he lived on the lam .
Yesterday , in the small town of Prescott , Arizona — the law finally caught up with him .
Henson had been driving his wife 's car , and when stopped by police , was soon informed of the outstanding warrant for his arrest .
He was taken into custody , and faces extradition back to the California prison he 's feared for the last six years .
Saturday morning Henson 's wife , identifying herself as a " soon to be widow , " issued a plea asking the public for legal help , publicity — " anything but the usual Scientology private eyes who have harassed her for years .
" Henson has a long history of activity within tech culture .
He was one of the founders and leaders of the L5 Space Colony movement in the 1970s .
( California 's new Attorney General , Jerry Brown , was also in the L5 orbit when he was Governor of that state . )
He was a close associate of K. Eric Drexler while Drexler was conceiving nanotechnology .
He has also been active in the digital encryption movement , and has been associated with the Transhumanist movement — particularly Extropy Institute .
Former Extropy Institute members and other well wishers have already created a legal defense fund .
There is also now a " Free Keith Henson " blog where people can keep track of new developments .
Henson has many friends and late Friday night one supporter even called the jail , according to a Usenet post , and spoke to a prison staffer .
" I asked if he'd tell Keith that Tory sent her love .
And I asked him to please watch after Keith .

The Trojan Room Coffee Pot
A ( non-technical ) biography
Several people have asked about the origins of the Trojan Room coffee pot .
It started back in the dark days of 1991 , when the World Wide Web was little more than a glint in CERN 's eye .
I was working on ATM networks in a part of the Computer Lab known as the Trojan Room , ( a name which , perhaps , causes some amusement to American readers ) .
There were about fifteen of us involved in related research and , being poor , impoverished academics , we only had one coffee filter machine between us , which lived in the corridor just outside the Trojan Room .
However , being highly dedicated and hard - working academics , we got through a lot of coffee , and when a fresh pot was brewed , it often did n't last long .
Some members of the ' coffee club ' lived in other parts of the building and had to navigate several flights of stairs to get to the coffee pot ; a trip which often proved fruitless if the all - night hackers of the Trojan Room had got there first .
This disruption to the progress of Computer Science research obviously caused us some distress , and so XCoffee was born .
In the Trojan Room there were several racks of simple computers used in the testing of our networks .
One of these had a video frame - grabber attached and was not being used at the time .
We fixed a camera to a retort stand , pointed it at the coffee machine in the corridor , and ran the wires under the floor to the frame - grabber in the Trojan Room .
Paul Jardetzky ( now working in California ) then wrote a ' server ' program , which ran on that machine and captured images of the pot every few seconds at various resolutions , and I wrote a ' client ' program which everybody could run , which connected to the server and displayed an icon-sized image of the pot in the corner of the screen .
The image was only updated about three times a minute , but that was fine because the pot filled rather slowly , and it was only greyscale , which was also fine , because so was the coffee .
This system only took us a day or so to construct but was rather more useful than anything else I wrote while working on networks .
It also made a better topic of conversation at dinner parties than ATM protocols .
The first published record of XCoffee came when Bob Metcalfe wrote about it in Comm Week on 27th January 1992 after visiting the lab , and inspired by this success , there was talk of other monitoring applications using low - frame - rate video .
Systems such as XSandwichVan and XPrinterOutputTray were mooted , but the elderly frame grabber eventually gave up the ghost , Paul and I moved on to other things , and the Trojan Room coffee pot would have sunk into obscurity had not Daniel Gordon and Martyn Johnson resurrected the system , treated it to a new frame grabber , and made the images available on the World Wide Web .
Since then , hundreds of thousands of people have looked at the coffee pot , making it undoubtedly the most famous in the world .
I do n't think the coffee 's any better , though .

Some 70 m devotees are expected over the 45 - day festival
Some holy men , or sadhus , had threatened to boycott bathing in waters they considered too polluted .
Five million devotees have already gathered on the banks of the river for the 45 - day Ardh Kumbh festival .
Sunday and Monday are considered auspicious bathing days as the sun enters the Tropic of Capricorn .
Hindus believe that bathing at Sangam , the confluence of three holy rivers - Ganges , Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati - can wash away their sins .
Pitcher battle
Water from canals and dams upstream was released to clean the river at the northern city of Allahabad to pacify the sadhus , some of whom had threatened to kill themselves .
Some Sadhus were angry at the pollution of the water
Local official RN Tripathi said : " We are trying to win them over .
There is enough fresh and clean water in the Ganges and it is fit for bathing . "
Offerings cast into the river and waste and sewage dumped into it have polluted the river over many years .
Astrologers are divided on the most auspicious time of alignment but millions of Hindu devotees are expected to bathe late on Sunday and early Monday .
The Ardh Kumbh Mela , which began on 3 January , is one of the largest gatherings on Earth , with more than 70 m
Hindus expected to attend over the 45 - day period .
It is a smaller version of the Kumbh Mela , or Pitcher Festival , which takes place every 12 years .
According to Hindu mythology , gods and demons fought a celestial war over a pitcher of divine nectar .
Allahabad is one of the four towns where drops of nectar fell during the battle .
When I give money to nonprofits , I look for ones that work like startups .
I recently found one that is like a startup not only in its smallness , but also in the use of cool new technology .
You 've probably read about all the horrible things happening in Darfur recently .
The American Sudanese Partnerships for Peace is going to try to repair some of the damage .
And they 're doing it in the most literal sense : they 're going to help the Sudanese rebuild their destroyed villages , using some innovative construction techniques developed by CalEarth .
CalEarth 's Eco-Dome can be built out of nothing more than dirt , barbed wire , and the same kind of polyethylene bags used to make sandbags to contain floods .
The house will probably last longer if you mix some cement with the dirt , but it 's not absolutely necessary .
The bags come in the form of a continuous tube , and the house is constructed of layers of dirt - filled " snakes , " with barbed wire laid between them to keep them from moving .
It 's 21st - century adobe : faster and easier than traditional adobe construction , because you do n't have to make and dry individual bricks .
This construction technique can be learned quickly by anyone , and is about the cheapest possible way to build lasting shelter .
But these are by no means temporary buildings ; they are so robust that they meet California building codes .
The ASP is taking the Eco -Dome to Darfur .
I learned about them because Y Combinator 's architect , Kate Courteau , is part of the group .
Kate is the reason our places in Cambridge and Mountain View look so cool .
She designed not only the spaces , but also the pair of identical 30 - foot tables we have in each .
If you were wondering about the blur in the background in the image on our front page , that 's Kate , rushing off to do the next thing on the to - do list in her hand .
I can't say for certain that this scheme is going to work , but it has as much as we ever ask for in a startup : good people and a good idea .

Which type of drinker are you ?
September 8 , 2006 at 1:31 am
Empirical research from the past 15 years have distinguished four different motives for drinking among youths .
Personality is the main influence for a person ’s motive for drinking .
Enhancement motives :
You drink to feel good , to get drunk , or just for its own sake .
You desire intense and novel experiences , and others might say that you ’re impulsive , extraverted , or aggressive .
You drink with same - sex friends , at friends ’ homes , and in bars .
Coping motives :
You drink to cope with bad feelings , to relieve stress , or to avoid social rejection .
You may be neurotic , disagreeable , or have negative views of yourself .
You generally drink at home , but not at parties or with your family .
Social motives :
You drink to be more sociable , or to help you enjoy a party .
You ’re a moderate drinker , and generally only drink in social contexts .
You drink more frequently at mixed - sex parties , but not at home , in bars , or together with family members .
The “ but not at home , in bars ” part is a bit strange .
One would think that social drinkers would be okay with drinking at bars .
Conformity motives :
You drink because of pressure from peers , or to be liked .
Specific personality or contextual traits were not found .
There are also differences in motives between genders as well as changes as a person ages .
… enhancement and coping motives , increase generally with age but are steeper among males than among females .
In adolescence and the college freshman years , indicating coping motives was found to be more strongly associated with excessive alcohol use among females than among males whereas after the freshman years and when entering the workplace in their mid-twenties men ’s heavy drinking tallied more with coping motives than women ’s heavy drinking .
The main targets for alcoholism prevention are people who drink for enhancement or coping motives because they often result in heavy drinking .
Due to the changes in motives for age and gender , the authors recommend focusing on boys who drink for enhancement motives and girls who drink for coping motives .

Senator calls report ' devastating condemnation ' of Office of Special Plans Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Thursday February 8 , 2007 Print This Email This Contrary to speculation and some earlier reports , the Department of Defense Inspector General 's office did not exonerate the controversial Office of Special Plans , which has been accused of cooking pre-war intelligence on Iraq , nor did it exonerate its - then chief overseer , former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith .
According to a statement released by Armed Services Committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) Thursday night to RAW STORY , the IG 's report is a " devastating condemnation of the activities of the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy . "
In a separate statement , Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence , states that whether the intelligence activities " were authorized or not , it appears that they were not in compliance with the law . "
Levin called the report " very damning " in a Friday AP review , saying it ' depicts a Pentagon that purposely manipulated intelligence in an effort to link Saddam Hussein to al - Qaeda in the runup to the U.S. invasion of Iraq . '
Citing excerpts from the IG 's unclassified executive summary of the classified report , Levin 's statement shows that Feith is not alone to share the blame for creating a parallel intelligence channel that the IG describes as " inappropriately performing Intelligence Activities of developing , producing , and disseminating that should be performed by the Intelligence Community . "
Pointing the finger higher up and directly at former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his then Deputy Secretary of Defense , Paul Wolfowitz , the IG concluded , according to Levin 's statement , that Feith 's " inappropriate activities were authorized by the Secretary of Defense or the Deputy Secretary of Defense . "
Although recently replaced by Robert Gates as Defense Secretary , Rumsfeld continues to occupy an office in the Pentagon .
Wolfowitz is now the head of the World Bank , while Feith is a visiting professor at Georgetown University .
A Glimpse : Specifically addressed in the IG 's executive summary and cited in Levin 's statement is the much - touted alleged connection between Iraq and al - Qaida that the Bush administration , and , in particular , Vice President Dick Cheney , used as one of the selling points to build their case for war against Iraq : " The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy developed , produced and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al - Qaida relationship , which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community , to senior decision - makers . "
In his statement , Levin has said that he will work to have the full report declassified and made available to the public .
An earlier report by RAW STORY , summarizing some of the issues regarding the Office of Special Plans and surrounding Feith , appears directly below , followed by Levin 's and Rockefeller 's full statements .
Pentagon Inspector General to release investigation into secretive pre-war Iraq intelligence group # Former Undersecretary
Feith says he hasnt seen report Update : A source close to Senate Intelligence Committee says the Committee will now be receiving the classified version of the Pentagon 's report on the Office of Special Plans Thursday evening , adding that the summary to be made public will be released Friday .
A long awaited Pentagon Inspector General 's report into the Office of Special Plans and its activities surrounding pre-war intelligence in the lead up to the Iraq war has been completed , RAW STORY has learned .
According to sources close to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , the classified version of the Pentagon IG 's report will be released to committee members Friday .
Two to three declassified pages may also be concurrently released to the public .
A Senate aide on the committee , while not commenting on particular questions regarding the IGs report , confirmed that a major focal point involves former Deputy Undersecretary for Defense Policy Douglas Feith  a keystone of the Administrations intelligence on Iraq and director of the notoriously secretive Pentagon Office of Special Plans from September 2002 to June 2003 .
Feith announced his resignation in January 2005 , a week after the New Yorkers Seymour Hersh accused him of working with Israeli officials to select potential targets for a preemptive Iran strike .
It remains unclear how objective the Inspector Generals report will be , given that the Pentagon was tasked with investigating itself .
It s also uncertain just how much light two to three declassified pages will shed on questions surrounding what many consider a rogue Pentagon intelligence unit created to feed the White House information favoring a case for war .
For his part , Feith says he has not been privy to the IG 's findings .
I have n't seen a copy of the IG report ,  Feith wrote in an email to RAW STORY in the early hours on Wednesday .
 I requested a copy but the IG 's office chose not to provide one .
Asked in a three point email about his thoughts on the Office of Special Plans , Feith  who now teaches at the Georgetown University Walsh School of Foreign Service  responded ,  I 'll save my thoughts on question three for another time . 
Repeated attempts to reach the IG 's office in time for publication proved fruitless .
In the past , the IG 's office responded to questions by saying the IG was conducting a review ,  not an investigation . 
Either way , the Pentagon has told the Senate Intelligence Committee to expect the report Friday .
Phase II of the Intelligence Committee 's own investigation will likely be completed sometime this spring or summer .
Investigating pre-war Iraq intelligence The Senate Intelligence Committees investigation into Iraq intelligence failures was to be done in two phases .
Phase I , which focused exclusively on the failures of the Central Intelligence Agency , was released in July 2004 .
However , Phase II , which looked into the Office of Special Plans , its members , and Bush Administration officials , remains largely incomplete .
The Phase II investigation was delayed in large part because the Pentagon specifically refused to address Feiths role and the Office 's activities , stonewalling the Senate 's efforts .
Even with a then - Republican Chairman , Sen. Pat Roberts ( R- KS ) , Defense Department attorneys were unwilling to cooperate .
Instead of issuing subpoenas , however , Roberts asked the Pentagon Inspector General to conduct his own investigation .
The Pentagon 's IG agreed to review the prewar intelligence activities relating to the Office of Special Plans , as well as Feiths particular role , in November 2005 .
One of two senators who requested the inquiry , Democratic Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , said the probe sought to ascertain whether Feith " provided a separate channel of intelligence , unbeknownst to the CIA , to the White House . "
The Office of Special Plans
The report on the secretive Office of Special Plans and its coterie of controversial players is perhaps the most awaited section of the Phase II report .
Led by Feith , the group 's members also included Larry Franklin , who pleaded guilty to leaking classified documents regarding Iran to a Washington - based Israeli lobby in 2005 ; prominent neoconservative and Iran - Contra intermediary Michael Ledeen ; and Middle East expert Harold Rhode , who purportedly sought to purge the Pentagon of anyone opposing the groups hawkish Iraq agenda .
Another prominent member was Ahmed Chalabi , who headed up the Iraqi National Congress  an Iraq opposition group created by the Rendon Group , a defense contractor for the U.S. military , after the first Gulf War .
Although he was wanted for embezzlement in Jordan and a suspected Iranian spy , the Administration presented Chalabi as a credible anti-Saddam leader .
Chalabi was later found to be a primary source of bogus intelligence provided to the Pentagon and U.S. reporters , including Judith Miller , then writing for The New York Times .
The Office of Special Plans was created by then -Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz .
On an organizational level , Feith ran the operation , which then purportedly cooked  and filtered intelligence that favored an Iraq invasion .
More specifically , the OSP was tasked with finding intelligence that fit the administration 's anti-Iraq policy and was treated as a favored and separate intelligence channel by the Office of the Vice President .
While the US intelligence community struggled to check a hawkish Executive Branch set on going to war , the OSP funneled questionable information directly to the White House , bypassing standard channels and operational procedures and deploying its own off book teams  into the region without notifying special forces already on the ground .
A history of espionage allegations Compounding concerns over a self - investigating Defense Department are a history of confessed and alleged espionage by members of the OSP .
A previous investigation by RAW STORY revealed an apparent revolving door policy  at the Pentagon which allowed officials whose clearances had been revoked to return to powerful positions in US government .
Feith 's access to classified information and any possible wrongdoing can likely be laid at the feet of more senior officials in the Bush Administration  namely former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  who would have been forced to overrule Pentagon background checks to reissue Feith 's clearances after he was booted from the National Security Council for espionage allegations in the mid-1980s .
According to the Washington Post , Feith faced questioning in 2004 on allegations that he or other officials may have passed classified information to an Iraqi politician or a pro-Israeli lobby group .
Asked if he was still under investigation by the FBI or if he was cleared , Feith responded ,  Still ?
There never was such an investigation .
Iran specialist Larry Franklin  who worked directly under Feith  pleaded guilty in 2005 to conspiracy to pass classified information to the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , a pro-Israeli lobby group , and illegal possession of national defense information .
Feith has not been charged or accused of wrongdoing in the case .
In 1978 , former Rumsfeld Deputy Paul Wolfowitz was investigated for allegedly passing a classified document on proposed US weapons sales to Israel through the same pro-Israeli lobby .
The inquiry was later dropped .
Wolfowitz now serves as president of the World Bank .
Wolfowitz , who at the time was working for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency , was brought into that position by conservative political adviser Richard Perle , who was also questioned in connection with the Franklin case .
A Bush appointee , Perle most recently served as chairman of the Pentagon Defense Policy Board but resigned his chairmanship after the Franklin case broke .
According to an FBI wiretap , Perle discussed classified information with the Israeli embassy when he was a foreign policy aide for Senator Henry M. Jackson in 1970 ; in 1978 , the New York Times reported that he inappropriately accepted classified data from a CIA official , again as Jacksons aide .

# Senator Levin 's statement : # The Department of Defense Inspector General has issued a devastating condemnation of the activities of the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy , which was led by Douglas Feith , and the Department of Defense .
Those activities supported the Bush administration 's misleading case for war againstIraq .
According to the Inspector General 's unclassified executive summary of the report : " The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy developed , produced and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al - Qaida relationship , which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community , to senior decision - makers . "
The Inspector General also stated that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy was inappropriately performing Intelligence Activities of developing , producing , and disseminating that should be performed by the Intelligence Community .
The Inspector General concluded that these inappropriate activities were authorized by the Secretary of Defense or the Deputy Secretary of Defense .
The conclusions of the Department of Defense Inspector General support the analysis and conclusions of a report I issued on October 21 , 2004 , entitled  Report of an Inquiry into the Alternative Analysis of the Issue of an Iraq - al Qaeda Relationship . 
My report documented a number of actions taken by the office of Under Secretary Feith to produce misleading alternative intelligence analyses of the alleged relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda in order to help make the case to go to war against Iraq .
Senior administration officials , including Vice President Cheney , made numerous public statements that reflected the views of the Feith alternative analysis , which were inconsistent with the analysis and judgments of the Intelligence Community .
Indeed , Vice President Cheney said the principal Feith office assessment was the best source of information on the alleged relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda .
I will work to have the entire report declassified , since it contains important information that the public is entitled to have .
# Senator Rockefeller 's statement : #  The Inspector Generals report makes it clear in plain language that the actions of the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy were inappropriate .
 Individuals in that office produced and disseminated intelligence products outside of the regular intelligence channels .
These intelligence products were inconsistent with the consensus judgments of the Intelligence Community .
This office did this without coordinating with the Intelligence Community and as a result policy makers received distorted intelligence .
 Section 502 of the National Security Act of 1947 requires the heads of all departments and agencies of the U.S. government involved in intelligence activities to keep the congressional oversight committees informed . 
 The IG has concluded that this office was engaged in intelligence activities .
The Senate Intelligence Committee was never informed of these activities .
Whether these actions were authorized or not , it appears that they were not in compliance with the law .
 In the coming days , I will carefully review all aspects of the report and will consult with Vice Chairman Bond to determine whether any additional action by the Senate Intelligence Committee is warranted . #

Dr Wickramasinghe thinks life could have originated in space
Locals believed that it foretold the end of the world , though the official explanation was that it was desert dust that had blown over from Arabia .
But one scientist in the area , Dr Godfrey Louis , was convinced there was something much more unusual going on .
Not only did Dr Louis discover that there were tiny biological cells present , but because they did not appear to contain DNA , the essential component of all life on Earth , he reasoned they must be alien lifeforms .
" This staggering claim is that this is possibly extraterrestrial .
That is a big claim I know , but all the experiments are supporting this claim , " said Dr Louis .
His remarkable work has set in motion a chain of events with scientists around the world debating the origin of these mysterious cells .
The main reason why Dr Louis 's ideas have not been immediately laughed out of court is because they tie in with a theory promoted by two UK scientists ever since the 1960s .
Space qualified
The late Sir Fred Hoyle and Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe have been the champions of " Panspermia " , the idea that life on Earth originated on another planet .
They speculate that life was first brought here on the back of a comet .
Over the last decade , Panspermia is being taken ever more seriously .
The US space agency ( Nasa ) is now increasingly interested in searching for extra-terrestrial life .
Bacteria seem to me to be born space travellers
Prof Chandra Wickramasinghe
Finding life elsewhere in the Solar System would be a vital bolster to the Panspermia theory .
Another section of Nasa is devoted to the study of bacteria found on Earth that can survive extreme conditions .
Finding these types of bacteria makes it more likely that micro-organism could survive the hardships of travelling through space on the back of a meteoroid .
Professor Wickramasinghe explained : " Bacteria have got to endure the extreme cold of space , the vacuum of space , ultraviolet radiation , cosmic rays , X - rays .
" That sounds like a tall order but bacteria do that .
From what we know survival out in space is more or less ensured .
Bacteria seem to me to be born space travellers . "
From another place
Last summer , Horizon had exclusive access to a trip taken by Professor Wickramasinghe to India to investigate at first hand the red rain phenomenon .
He met Dr Louis and together they visited the people who had witnessed the red rain .
He was able to see the recent work of Dr Louis which shows that the red rain can replicate at 300C , an essential attribute of a space micro-organism that might have to endure extreme temperatures .
Bacteria might survive the journey through space
" Before I came I had grave doubts as to whether the red rain was really an indication of life coming from space ; new life coming from space , " he said .
" But on reflection and after talking to Godfrey , I think I would now fairly firmly believe that it did represent an invasion of microbes from space . "
Many scientists remain highly sceptical , however , but if Wickramasinghe and Louis are correct it will be the strongest evidence so far that the theory of Panspermia might be true .
It also raises the intriguing possibility that if life first originated on another planet then it must mean all Earth organisms , including humans , evolved from alien life .

Newswise — Widespread use of the antiviral Tamiflu to fight pandemic avian flu in humans could actually lead to the development of what public health officials hope to avoid " " drug - resistant strains of the virus in wild birds .
British researchers at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Oxford have released findings in the January 2007 issue of Environmental Health Perspectives ( EHP ) that demonstrate how Tamiflu 's persistence in wastewater and river water could affect the waterfowl that drink from those water sources .
Since the World Health Organization 's first warning of an avian flu pandemic two years ago , nations worldwide have been stockpiling Tamiflu for treatment and outbreak prevention .
The drug , which minimizes flu symptoms and duration , inhibits the movement of the influenza virus from the cells it infects , and also helps uninfected people avoid contracting the flu .
However , Tamiflu 's active agent , the metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate ( OC ) would be excreted into sewers for several weeks during a pandemic and is expected to withstand biodegradation .
According to the researchers in the current study , once birds drink OC - laced water from catchments receiving treated wastewater , they could produce Tamiflu - resistant strains and pass them on to other birds who share the same waters .
The investigators analyzed 11 waterway catchments in the United States and 5 in England using a metabolic pathway prediction system to determine the potential biodegradability of OC .
They also measured wastewater discharges into the catchments .
They estimated the number of clinically infected people in each catchment area treated with a full 5 - day course of Tamiflu with 100 % compliance , assuming that 80 % of the ingested Tamiflu was released into sewer systems as OC and that all of the OC entering each catchment was flushed out in one day .
Their estimates showed a maximum concentration well above that required for development of resistance in vitro for 62 consecutive days in the arid Lower Colorado River catchment area .
Overall , the researchers say that because of the lower population density for many of the U.S. catchments , peak concentrations of OC in a pandemic would be approximately 10 times less than the concentrations in British rivers .
All but one of the American catchments studied are larger than those in Britain and , with the exception of the Lower Colorado River flow area , have more available dilution per person in each given population .
There were no specific ecotoxicological risks from Tamiflu identified at the time the drug was submitted for approval to the European Medicines Agency .
The authors , however , suggest that the ecotoxicological risk associated with Tamiflu use needs to be reassessed in light of the hundreds of millions of courses that would be consumed globally during a pandemic .
The authors warn that , with the release of the uniquely structured , biochemically resistant OC antiviral into river water , " the range of OC concentrations predicted . . . will have uncharacterized ecotoxicological consequences . "
They call for more detailed water contamination modeling , especially in high - risk areas of the world such as Southeast Asian countries , where there is more frequent human - to - waterfowl contact and where future use of Tamiflu would be significant .
They also recommend development of methods to minimize the release of OC into wastewater systems , such as biological and chemical pretreatment in the toilet .
The lead author of the study was Andrew C. Singer .
Other authors included Miles A. Nunn , Ernest A. Gould , and Andrew C. Johnson .

What is UNICODE ?
Everything you see on your computer is represented by 0's and 1's .
Characters are also encoded in the form of 0's and 1's .
In this method each character is represented by a number .
A common method of encoding is called ASCII ( American Standard for Information Interchange ) .
In this method each character is represented by 8 bits .
Therefore 256 different characters can be represented using this method .
But 256 characters is not enough to mention all characters in all languages .
Here comes UNICODE , in which each character is represented by 16 bits .
Therefore in this method of encoding , 65536 characters can be represented .
For more information about UNICODE and its applictions visit Unicode.org
Whats interesting ?
Unicode is capable of representing many languages , including those written from left to right and those written from right to left .
There are special characters in UNICODE to achieve the RTL .
One such character is the Mirroring character .
The property of mirroring character is that it makes Left to Right Text , Right to Left just by pasting the character , all text after it becomes RTL .
So it can be used on sites which use UNICODE character encoding format ( like orkut ) .
The property of the mirroring character is that it reverses whatever you paste after it .
So " [ mirror char ] hello , how are you ? " becomes " ? ouy era woh , olleh " .
Mirror character has nothing to display , so you cant see a mirror character .
One thing to note that is the mirroring character is not rendered on all browsers .
It is supported on Firefox , Opera , IE7 ( partially ) .
If anyone has any info about other browsers please leave a comment .
Effect of using a mirroring character on orkut with the profile name is shown below :
Note that the word " scrapbook " is inversed .
There is more of it left for you to explore and find out ...
Mirroring character also works on some Instant Messengers like Google Talk and Yahoo !
Messenger , on which you can send reversed sentences very easily , making a feeling that you can type reversed .
See for yourself
If your are using a browser such as Firefox which renders the unicode mirroring character the following text ( in the gray box ) will appear reversed :
‮‮
The unicode mirroring character was used to
reverse this text .
If it still appears normal
then , your browser does not render mirroring
character or worse do not support UNICODE !
If you are seeing this normally then there
is no point in continuing .
Get a browser like firefox that
supports unicode .
Want the mirroring character ?
The mirroring character cannot be seen and I couldnot find the HEX or Numeric Code .
If anyone has found out leave a comment .
The mirroring character is within these braces
(‮‮(
Inorder to get the mirroring character , try copying the content between the braces and paste it somewhere to see the magic ! ...
What can it be used for ?
‮ ‮http://www.mysite.com/fol/file.html?site/moc.elgoog.www://ptth
Suppose you paste a link like this and if someone clicks he / she goes to mysite.com instead of google.com .
This could be used on sites like orkut.com which does n't allow you to hide the url of the link you are giving .
So it could be potentially used for phishing !
Inorder to protect yourself from such methods always look at the url beofre you give away senstitive information about yourself .
Other potential uses are left for you to explore .
If you find anything interesting please let me know ..
Guess you can take care of it from here on ...
Thats all folks .

In light of contemporary efforts to intensify the collection of personal information , this article , as well as articles elsewhere on this web site dealing with the engineering of social control and computer matching and profiling , may be of more than academic interest .
Abstract : Eleven behavioral techniques of neutralization intended to subvert the collection of personal information are discussed : discovery moves , avoidance moves , piggy backing moves , switching moves , distorting moves , blocking moves , masking moves , breaking moves , refusal moves , cooperative moves and counter - surveillance moves .
In Western liberal democracies the advantages of technological and other strategic surveillance developments are often short - lived and contain ironic vulnerabilities .
The logistical and economic limits on total monitoring , the interpretive and contextual nature of many human situations , system complexity and interconnectedness , and the vulnerability of those engaged in surveillance to be compromised , provide ample room for resistance .
Neutralization is a dynamic adversarial social dance involving strategic moves and counter - moves and should be studied as a conflict interaction process .
It may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not , by proper application resolve .
-- Edgar Allen Poe , The Gold Bug
Efforts to protect information on the part of the actor have their logical counterpart in the discovery efforts of those engaged in surveillance .
That is , in resisting surveillance individuals are protecting their privacy , while those involved in surveillance seek to break through the personal borders which protect privacy .
We can view contexts of personal information discovery and protection behaviorally and make inferences about what the individuals are attempting to do .
We can also view these concepts in terms of cultural standards that judge whether behavior is appropriate , ethical and legal .
The study of privacy and secrecy overlaps the study deviance and social control .
In many settings privacy and surveillance are different sides of the same nickel .
Privacy can serve as a nullification mechanism for the power offered by surveillance ( Kelvin , 1973 ) .
Surveillance seeks to eliminate privacy in order to determine normative compliance or to influence the individual or for its own ends as with voyeurism ( Marx , 2002 b ) .
There are increasingly sophisticated technologies for collecting personal information , such as surveillance cameras and sensors , and for predicting behavior and assessing the truth , such as expert systems ( Brin , 1999 ; Froomkin , 2000 ; Garfinkle , 2000 ; Gutwirth , 2002 ; Staples , 2000 ) .
The increased prominence of these surveillance technologies is " pulled " by concerns over issues such as crime , terrorism , and economic competitiveness , and is pushed by newly perceived opportunities offered by technical developments in electronics , computerization , and artificial intelligence .
The scale , mobility and anonymity of mass society and , ironically , increased expectations of , and protections for , privacy have furthered reliance on both surveillance technologies and on data - base memories that locate , identify , record , register , classify , and validate or generate grounds for suspicion ( Agre & Rotenberg , 1997 ; Bennett & Grant , 1999 ; Gandy , 1993 ; Lyon , 2001 ; Regan , 1995 ) .
The fear of catastrophic risks in an interdependent world relying on complex technologies and the entrepreneurial efforts of the security industry and governments , such as the United States with its ’ war on drugs , have helped spread the technologies internationally ( Andreas , 2000 ; Ericson & Haggerty , 1997 ; Nadelmann , 1993 ) .
One noteworthy aspect is the extent to which individuals go along with requests for personal information .
This is likely related to beliefs about the advantages of , and need for , providing such information , and trust in authority -- factors which often override the ambivalence resulting from traditional privacy and autonomy concerns .
Moreover , a lack of resistance to intrusive surveillance may mask as acceptance because of a fear of being sanctioned or losing one 's job , position or privilege , or as a necessary condition for something desired such as employment , credit , apartment or car rental , air travel or government benefits .
There may also be fatalism and resignation , believing it is impossible to resist .
Many cultural beliefs support the legitimacy of surveillance .
Consider statements I heard such as , “ I have nothing to hide ” , " it ’s for my own good " , " I support the goals " , “ I ’m getting paid ” , “ it ’s just the way they do things here ” , “ they have to do it to … [ stay competitive , obtain insurance , stop crime , avoid risks ] ” , " the measure is valid " , and " they promise to protect confidentiality . "
Lack of awareness of the extent and nature of surveillance , or of the potential for abuse and misuse of personal information , may also support acquiescence .
Since completing a study of humans as covert information discoverers ( Marx , 1988 ) , I have been studying the social , cultural , ethical and policy implications of new technologies for the collection of personal information ( e.g. , Corbett & Marx , 1991 ; Marx 1995 , 1998 , 1999 , 2001 , 2002 a & b , forthcoming ) .
One aspect involves individual resistance to surveillance , the topic considered here .
My method involves observation , interviews , document collection and mining the literature in order to offer a conceptual framework , and eventually testable hypotheses , about personal information collection and protection .
Among those interviewed are subjects ( e.g. , employees subjected to work monitoring , drug tested athletes , political activists ) and practitioners of surveillance ( e.g. , police , private detectives , managers , technology providers ) .
The Sky Is n’t Falling -- At Least Not Yet
The identification of factors encouraging the spread of surveillance and the ready availability of newsworthy horror stories of privacy invasions such as the selling of information from AIDS tests or cameras hidden in dressing rooms ( e.g. , Smith , 1990 ) , too often lead to an unreflective " the sky is falling " view of contemporary surveillance , whether explicit or implicit .
The potential of a technology for harm needs to be kept distinct from its ’ realization .
Just because something negative could happen , does not mean that it must happen .
In short , little consideration is given to how the dystopia will actually be produced or to factors working against it , such as practicality , cost , laws and fear of lawsuits , organizational policies , morality , doubts about effectiveness or the ability to control the technology , and concern with public opinion .
Control systems are not usually as effective and efficient as their advocates claim and they often have a variety of unintended consequences ( Sieber , 1981 ; Marx , 1995 ; Tenner , 1996 ) .
There is frequently a gap between visible conforming behavior and less visible attitudes , emotions and fantasies .
Moreover new technologies rarely enter passive environments of total inequality .
Instead they become enmeshed in complex pre-existing systems .
They are as likely to be altered as to alter .
Professional associations , oversight organizations , and political and social movements are also factors .
In contrast to these collective responses , the focus in this article is on individual responses .
Individual and collective responses are often linked as when protest movements grow out of or encourage individual resistance and provide models , resources and legitimation ( McAdam & Snow , 1997 ) .
However , more spontaneous individual responses can be contrasted with those growing out of explicit organizational efforts .
The former may be collective in the sense that many persons respond the same way to the same stimulus , but they are not necessarily organizational .
The social and political implications of such individual forms are relatively unstudied .
Whether at work ( Gabriel , 1999 ) , in prison ( Sykes , 1971 ) , in the family , or in efforts to create a carceral society as with the former East Germany ( Pfaff , 2000 ) , surveillance targets often have space to maneuver and can use counter - technologies .
The individual is often something more than a passive and compliant reed buffeted about by the imposing winds of the more powerful , or dependent only on protest organizations for ideas about resistance .
Humans are wonderfully inventive at finding ways to beat control systems and to avoid observation .
Most surveillance systems have inherent contradictions , ambiguities , gaps , blind spots and limitations , whether structural or cultural , and , if they do not , they are likely to be connected to systems that do .
As Goffman ( 1961 ) notes in his study of the underlife of organizations , when individuals feel that surveillance is wrong , or that they are unfairly disadvantaged by it , it will often be challenged .
Systems also may be challenged for reasons of self - interest .
The scale , complexity and limitations of omnipresent and omnipotent surveillance offer room for this subversion .
Boyne ( 2002 ) discusses limits of panoptical control as applied to contemporary society .
Resistance is a central theme in much contemporary science fiction .
Wood ( 2002 )
Behavioral techniques of neutralization are a major form of such challenges .
These are one strand of what Scott ( 1985 ) calls everyday forms of resistance : “ … the ordinary weapons of relatively powerless groups : foot dragging , dissimulation , false compliance , pilfering , feigned ignorance , slander , arson , sabotage and so forth ” ( p. 29 ) .
However , powerless takes on a new meaning ( beyond its usual association with lower social class or minority status ) when we consider the demands of the modern organization ( whether private or governmental ) for personal information .
This article considers 11 generic techniques of neutralization that observation suggests can be weapons of the strong , as well as the weak .
They involve a strategic focus on directly resisting a particular privacy - invading information technology .
This strategic focus is in contrast to the sheer contrariness to authority that Foucault ( 1977 ) discusses and the non-instrumental forms noted by Scott ( 1985 ) .
The techniques may be accompanied by , or eventually lead to , other individual and collective responses expressing indignation , rejection and rebellion ( often with a symbolic element ) , apart from direct efforts in the immediate context of surveillance .
Our emphasis here , however , is on the former .
The behavioral techniques to be discussed have cultural support .
There are parallels to more general cultural beliefs supportive of rule breaking identified by Sykes and Matza ( 1957 ) as “ techniques of neutralization ” and Bandura ( 1999 ) as “ moral deniability . ”
People will break rules if they regard an organization or its surveillance procedures as unacceptable or illegitimate , untrustworthy or invalid , irrelevant , demeaning , unnecessary or irrelevant .
These approaches help answer the question : " How can the rules be broken when the culture is clear in defining this behavior as wrong ? ”
However , in this case , just who is breaking the rules may be disputed ( e.g. , is it the authorities seeking information to which they are not entitled , or is it those subject to legitimate surveillance seeking to avoid it ? ) .
General cultural counter - beliefs that neutralize the conventional beliefs include : " My rule breaking behavior does n’t hurt anyone " ; " it ’s not my fault " ; " they had it coming to them " ; and “ they ’ll never know ” .
More specific cultural beliefs that may accompany efforts to thwart surveillance encountered in my research include : “ They have no right to that information ” ; " it ’s none of their business " ; " the measure is not accurate " ; " it ’s unfair " ; " it ’s discriminatory -- they do n't monitor the communications of the managers and executives " ; " I do n't trust them to keep it confidential " ; " what if they use it for some other purpose ? " , " it 's irrelevant to how I do my job " ; " I did not consent to provide the information " ; " it ’s sneaky " ; " it means they do n't trust me " ; " it makes me feel like a child " ; " my personal information is my property and I am not being paid for its ’ use " ; " providing that information puts me at a strategic disadvantage . "
Such justifications serve to soften a culturally induced tendency toward deference to authority and are counters to the cultural beliefs that legitimate surveillance .
Consequently , they may free individuals to resist in the ways discussed below and , after the fact , alleviate guilt .
As with any normative system , there is a moral economy within which individuals may weigh the costs and benefits of compliance and violation and draw personal lines .
For example , Gilliom ( 2001 ) studied welfare recipients who justified evading a sophisticated surveillance system by the cost to their families of not seeking ways around it , given very stringent limits on the income they were permitted to legally have .
However , the inherent value conflicts involving surveillance and the self - interested reasons for evasion hardly require elaborate ideologies of resistance .
Moreover , because efforts to counter many of the kinds of surveillance considered here often occur on morally contested ground and are defensive , the need for such justifications may not be as strong as in more conventional crime and deviance settings .
The 11 forms of surveillance neutralization , in the next section , are inductively developed concepts that are the result of several decades of interviews and observations regarding social control .
As responses to social control they parallel prior work on strategies for the engineering of social control ( Marx , 1995 , 2002a ) .
These concepts suggest that human creativity seeking to thwart systems of surveillance is aided by logistical and economic limits on total monitoring , the vulnerability of those engaged in surveillance to be compromised , and by the interpretive and contextual nature of many human situations .

The 11 prominent types of response to privacy - invading surveillance are : 1 ) discovery moves , 2 ) avoidance moves , 3 ) piggy - backing moves , 4 ) switching moves , 5 ) distorting moves , 6 ) blocking moves , 7 ) masking ( identification ) moves , 8 ) breaking moves , 9 ) refusal moves , 10 ) cooperative moves , and 11 ) counter - surveillance moves .
At a general level these are forms of resistance or non-compliance .
The criteria reflect the point of view of the observer and emphasize visible behavior , although some inferences are made about goals .
As with most social science categorizations of complex and fluid behavior , this conceptualization is not exhaustive .
The categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive and many can be systematically related .
They may be temporally linked , as when discovery of surveillance leads to an effort to avoid it .
They may be simultaneously present as when a person wearing gloves to block his fingerprints also masks his true prints by leaving items containing another ’s fingerprints .
They may be logically linked .
Some broad dimensions can be seen to form an umbrella with others serving as ribs or nestled subtypes ( e.g. , refusal may involve literally saying “ no ” as when the surveillance is just ignored , or it may involve the refusal to fully cooperate on the grounds desired by surveillors ) .
In spite of some conceptual and operational haze , these responses are distinctive enough to warrant separate treatment and I have found them useful in capturing commonly occuring and analytically interesting forms .
As with any beginning effort , greater specification of the defining criteria and perhaps the addition of other forms are welcomed .
The strategic actions of both watchers and the watched can be thought of as moves in a game , although unlike traditional games , the rules may not be equally binding on all players .
There are likely common resistance moves shared by a citizen concerned with protecting personal privacy and a criminal seeking to avoid detection .
In spite of the obvious moral difference , I treat these two generic types as behaviorally equivalent in efforts to protect information and to neutralize other ’s discovery moves .
Unless otherwise noted , all examples are drawn from my observations and interviews .
1. Discovery Moves
Known as surveillance detection in the intelligence trade , the goal is to find out if surveillance is in operation and where it is .
One form involves self - regulation .
The subject ’s behavior varies depending on whether or not surveillance has been found to be in operation .
Drivers slow down when their anti-radar " fuzz buster " warns them that police radar is in use .
Here the surveillance " works , " at least as long as it is believed to be present .
What Goffman ( 1974 , pp. 97-99 ) calls “ vital tests ” may be applied .
For example , a criminal may test a would - be partner by requiring that an act of violence , theft , or drug use occur before a drug deal is completed .
The film Battle of Algiers offers a riveting example when a potential recruit to the Algerian independence movement is suddenly handed a gun on the street and told to kill a nearby policeman ( the recruit himself is a police infiltrator ) .
A similar incident occurs in Clint Eastwood ’s In the Line of Fire .
Establishing credibility by having a trusted person vouch for the individual or by using back channels into official records or publicly available data are further examples .
A major user of freedom of information acts are criminals seeking to determine the identity of informers .
In Britain , in the interest of defending their clients and perhaps more , criminal defense attorneys have even created a data base with the names of those known to be government informers .
Discovery is aided by a thriving private security industry that routinely sweeps offices , homes and vehicles for listening devices and that sells do - it - yourself anti-bugging and other devices -- e.g. , pocket bug and tape recorder detectors for ( as put by a character in the film The Conversation ) “ your catalogue suckers ” .
Consider , for example , a small flashlight like device that sells for several hundred dollars which permits finding hidden video cameras .
Every day objects may be examined to see if they are other than what they appear to be -- does a towel dispenser , book , or teddy bear hide a video lens ?
The appearance of a space between one ’s fingers and the glass on a mirror may suggest a two - way mirror .
Door handles , documents and drawers may be examined under ultra-violet light to see if they have been coated with fluorescent dust .
Access keypads to a safe or to a telecommunications device may be inspected to see if they have been coated with a waxy film that will reveal what keys were touched to gain access .
2. Avoidance Moves
These moves may follow the discovery that surveillance is present or it may be assumed that , because surveillance might be present , avoidance is a prudent response .
Avoidance moves are passive rather than active and involve withdrawal .
There is no effort to directly engage , or tamper with , the surveillance .
Rather , there is a temporal , geographical or methodological displacement to times , places and means in which the identified surveillance is presumed to be absent or irrelevant .
Displacement can be across settings ( e.g. , avoiding supermarkets with frequent shopper cards or making calls from a pay phone which cannot be traced to the location of a telephone subscriber ) .
Displacement may also occur within a given setting ( e.g. , shoplifters who operate within the interstitial area of surveillance camera blind spots or thieves who know that not all goods or library books are electronically tagged and apply the " five - finger discount " only to untagged items ) .
Because of concerns over leakage , security consultants advise clients with sensitive information to only use the unsecured telephone , fax or Internet for communications they would not mind seeing in the newspaper the next day and to never use cordless microphones for presentations in non-public meetings .
Caution is advised even in face - to - face conversations , unless the room has been recently swept for bugs and the person they are talking to can be checked for electronic signals suggesting transmission or recording .
Beyond the presumed security of face - to - face meetings and dealing only with those who are known or vouched for , physical or social locations presumed to be safe may be favored for secret conversations such as in an open field or boat .
Consider , for example , the film The Conversation , in which criminals mistakenly felt safe talking in a rowboat in the middle of a lake , or the Philadelphia organized crime figures who were arrested as a result of electronic surveillance of meetings they held in the offices of their doctor and lawyer .
They wrongly assumed that the doctor - patient and lawyer - client privilege precluded such places from police surveillance ( New York Times , March 17 , 1994 ) .
The introduction of Federally mandated computer record checks offers a nice example of displacement to means less available for surveillance .
Computer record matching has made it much more difficult for those on welfare to obtain extra income from a job , workmen ’s compensation , retirement or assistance in another state without being discovered .
This tightening has likely led to some increase in the use of fraudulent identities and under - the - table forms of payment for work ( cash , exchanges ) that are beyond the reach of the organizational dossier screen ( Gilliom , 2001 ) .
Another form of avoidance is not raising the red flag .
Thus , knowing that certain profiles or crossing certain thresholds will trigger surveillance or at least suspicion , individuals stop short of this or avoid triggering characteristics .
For example , bank deposits under $ 10,000 do not require a report to the federal government .
However there can be ironic vulnerabilities here as well .
It looks suspicious if 50 deposits are made on a given day that total $ 9,999 .
Drug smugglers , believing that a profile is in effect that targets younger men in late model cars driving on US 90 , may use as couriers older women in older cars taking back roads .
Another threshold involves repetition and familiarity .
Rotation is a device favored by some violators .
For example , prostitutes may move frequently to new cities making it more difficult for police to identify them .
Those interested in thwarting or avoiding surveillance share information such as where the hidden cameras and police radar traps are and how to identify unmarked police vehicles .
Cell phones and websites have made this easier .
Here discovery and avoidance are linked .
Being able to identify a police car does n’t necessarily prevent visual surveillance , but it does permit adjusting behavior so as not to call additional attention to oneself .
3. Piggy Back Moves
Here surveillance is directly faced rather than avoided .
A control is evaded or information protected by accompanying or being attached to a legitimate subject or object .
An important context for this form is entrance and exit controls .
For example , systems requiring an access card can sometimes be thwarted by walking or , in the case of a parking structure , driving quickly behind a person with legitimate access .
The fact that the door or gate must remain open long enough to permit the legitimate entry may offer a window for others .
This nicely illustrates the ironic vulnerability of control systems in which there is exchange across borders .
The need to open creates the possibility for illegitimate as well as legitimate entrance and egress .
Steganography , which permits hiding information in art , documents and other items in related form , is freely available and easy to use on the Internet .
It draws on conventionally communicated computer information to bootleg other information only available to someone with the appropriate software ( e.g. , hiding messages in digital pictures ) .
The viewer without the software sees only what is immediately visible and will have not reason to be suspicious .
4. Switching Moves .
In settings involving testing , certification and validation , an authentic result is transferred to someone or some thing to which it does not apply .
While accurate in what it purports to show , the accuracy is misplaced .
Consider test substitution , whether in the “ soft ” college environment of the large class room or the more controlled testing centers .
The Educational Testing Service is on guard for substitute test takers ( Newsweek Nov. 11 , 1996 ) .
Assuming the test was taken without cheating , the results are valid in assessing the score of the actual test taker , but not the person they purport to represent .
Insurance companies also seek to identify healthy substitutes who take medical exams for persons whose pre-existing conditions would exclude them from coverage .
A common form of switching involves certification transference : A ticket , entry card , license , entitlement or identity marker belonging to someone else is used .
South Africa provides an unusual example .
There , welfare payments can be obtained from ATM machines .
The recipient enters the correct information into the computer and offers a thumb print for verification .
A colleague reported one enterprising family that collected welfare payments long after an elderly relative had died .
They cut off her thumb and continued to use it .
In a urine drug test , " clean " urine , from an acquaintance or commercially purchased , may be substituted for one 's own .
In an extreme example , an Olympic competitor passed his drug test twice , but the tests also revealed that he was pregnant !
Using a catheter , the athlete had inserted urine from his pregnant , drug - free girl friend and then passed it back as the temporarily duped observers watched .
One response to late night roadblocks in search of drunk drivers is to have the driver who has been drinking switch places with someone who has n’t been drinking .
As a condition of sentencing , those arrested for drunk driving may agree to have a breathalyzer attached to their car 's ignition .
The alcohol ignition interlock prevents a car from starting until the driver blows into a funnel - like device that analyzes the alcohol content of the driver 's breath .
For the car to start the alcohol level must be below 0.05 % weight by volume .
Beyond avoidance ( e.g. , using a different car ) , the interlock initially could be tricked by having a friend breathe into the device , or through a temporal switch by using air from a balloon filled with air before drinking .
5. Distorting Moves
Distorting moves manipulate the surveillance collection process such that , while offering technically valid results , the inferences drawn from a test or inspection about performance , behavior or attribute are invalid .
The technical data do not mean what they appear to say .
This contrasts with switching in which the socially misleading inference involves identity .
Consider a tactic used by some data entry clerks who are judged by the number of keystrokes they enter .
At the end of the day some workers simply held down one key for a few minutes .
This generated the impression of greater productivity than was actually the case .
The actual number of keystrokes was accurately assessed but , given how they were produced , the result is not socially meaningful .
A way of beating the polygraph involves stepping on a tack hidden in one 's shoe in response to initial factual questions ( e.g. , regarding name and age ) .
These are used to create a presumed truthful baseline for comparison to answers to later incriminating questions .
Meditation and pills are other means intended to distort results .
Eating peanuts or sucking on a penny before taking a breath analyzer test are said to distort results .
Drug tests results may be distorted by having bleach on one ’s hand when generating a urine sample , by taking medication or by eating certain confounding foods .
A more subtle form involves conversational ploys in which a surveillance agent is duped into believing that a machine is invalid .
Consider the story told me by a Russian .
A family coming back from a picnic is stopped by police and the driver fails a breathalyzer test .
He protests , " That 's impossible , I have n't been drinking , your machine must be broken .
Please try it on my wife . "
She also fails the test .
The man gets even more insistent that the machine is broken and says , " Please try it on my young daughter . "
She is tested and also fails .
At which point the police officer , doubting his own machine , lets the man go .
The man later remarks to his wife , " That was really a good idea to let her drink with us . ”
6. Blocking Moves
Blocking and masking , the next two forms , call explicit attention to the communicative aspects of surveillance .
Surveillors desire to read the signals given off by their subjects .
With blocking , subjects seek to physically block access to the communication or , if unable or unwilling to do that , to render it ( or aspects of it such as the identity , appearance or location of the communicator ) unusable .
The Faraday cage , which encapsulates space in metal or a metallic net , blocks electronic transmissions .
( There is even a portable version available for travelers . )
Shoplifters may seek to block the sensors for electronically tagged consumer goods by using a metallic shield which prevents signal transmission ( e.g. , a large shopping bag with a familiar logo conceals within it a second bag lined with aluminum or duct tape ) .
A move reflecting the ironic vulnerability of locks requiring keys involves using a portable device to desensitize the sensor in the same fashion as the checkout stand does .
A means of stopping eavesdropping via the traditional telephone was to turn the dial and hold it in place by inserting a pencil , effectively blocking the microphone within the phone .
Playing loud music and whispering accomplishes the same goal .
Caller - ID in most states can now be stopped by line or per-call blocking .
Those making credit card phone calls in public places , such as airports , are advised to shield the numbers when they are entered to prevent theft of access codes by lurkers , some with binoculars who may not even be seen by the caller .
Commercially available technical means such as 900 numbers that forward calls , and then immediately erase the source of the call , are a way of avoiding telephone number identification systems .
Anonymous re-mailers who forward computer messages stripped of their sender 's address also stop identification .
Another form of blocking is wearing a veil or loose fitting , buttoned up clothes that reveal little about the physical appearance of the person within .
In response to the phenomena of covert “ upskirt and down blouse ” videotaping , one policewomen reports always wearing pants to the mall .
A woman who was secretly videotaped in her home reports , “ I sometimes take a shower with my clothes on . ”
Generic ski or Halloween masks worn by bank robbers and the helmets with visors or masks worn in some protest demonstrations , whether by police or demonstrators , are other examples .
Writing in invisible ink is a familiar children 's game and it has its ' adult counterparts , although these may rely on bad science .
Thus , a bank robber was identified and arrested in spite of rubbing lemon juice on his face because he had been told that it would prevent the surveillance camera from creating a clear picture .
Situations in which those watching are unaware that specific blocking has occurred can be contrasted with those where the fact of blocking is obvious .
In the latter situations , information is communicated but it is useless .
The encryption of communications is an example .
Encrypted communications are easy to intercept but meaningless absent decryption .
A “ photo flash deflector ” fluid which blocks the photographing of a license plate became available soon after systems for monitoring red light runners appeared .
Some “ fuzz busters ” sends white noise back to a police radar gun producing a blank reading .
In contrast to the real time protection of information is destruction of it after the fact .
An advertisement for “ Spy paper ” reports that it , “ looks and feels like high quality notepad paper yet dissolves completely in a matter of seconds when it comes into contact with water . ”
The delete command along with a “ wiper program ” are available for computer entries to be sure they can be eliminated , although as Oliver North discovered this does nothing for backup copies elsewhere in the system ( Tower , 1987 ) .
Those disposing of hard drives are advised to first purge them of their data .
“ Piano roll ” faxes have to be carefully destroyed as these contain records of what has been received .
7. Masking Moves
Masking involves blocking in that the original information is shielded , but it goes beyond it to involve deception with respect to the identity , status and / or location / locatability of the person or material of surveillance interest .
Specifically , masking shares with one form of blocking the goal of eliminating genuine identifying marks ( e.g. , by removing serial numbers or wearing gloves or a generic mask ) but it differs from them by replacing what is blocked with information intended to mislead , such as using a disguise or fake serial numbers .
It also differs because such blocking without masking may call attention to itself ( e.g. , a car with no license plate number , a weapon with the serial number removed , an anonymous email ) while masking does not ( e.g. , altered numbers , a pseudonymous email address ) .
As a result of masking , the surveillance mechanism operates as intended but the information collected is misleading and useless .
Surveillors may not even realize that this has happened .
Efforts to disguise identity , whether involving wigs , died hair , elevator shoes , padded clothing , plastic surgery or fake documents , fit here and again contrast with generic give - away forms such as a mask .
The film Personal Record , in which a woman wears a wig and uses fake documents to create a seemingly untraceable paper trail in committing a crime of revenge , is a nice example .
Masking can be seen in giving a false social security number or name .
There is a rock group called “ Gary Marx and the Sisters of Mercy ” .
The lead singer Marc Pairman uses the name Gary Marx .
Not wanting to be outdone , I sometimes use the name Marc Pairman when a website requests my name .
I also have supermarket cards with the names Karl Marx , Groucho Marx and Georg Simmel .
Remote computer entries , whether taking or sending information , by using another 's identification and password , are a nice example of masking .
Surveillance agents may not know there has been deception .
The computer security system accurately records transactions and the use of a particular entry code from a given machine , but it cannot determine whether the entrant is the person or organization it technically appears to be , absent additional means such as biometric identification and video recording .
Controllers concerned with identity verification / authentication must determine 1 ) is this a valid identity , authentication or access code and , if so , 2 ) is this the authorized user ?
8. Breaking Moves
The goal of breaking moves is to render the surveillance device inoperable .
However , as with blocking moves , surveillors are likely to discover this .
Breaking moves are the crudest form of neutralization .
Examples include disabling electrical and phone lines , spray painting a video monitor , and immobilizing a video monitor by aiming a laser pointer at it .
When radar location detection devices were first attached to police cars , so that supervisors would be able to know where officers were , some officers in Boston responded by simply smashing the device with their clubs .
More subtly , the system also was defeated by driving beyond city limits and entering at a different point .
Leaving the system in this way caused the monitor to lose track of the police car .
A male guard dog may be neutralized with a tranquilizer dart , mace , poisoned food or a female dog in heat .
Those under judicial supervision may remove electronic location monitors .
Ironically , the effort to interrupt a signal itself becomes a signal .
However , this must be noted and acted upon .
In a tragic case , an abusive spouse sentenced to home confinement simply took off the device , went to his former wife 's home , and killed her .
This was on a weekend .
Although a message about his removal of the device was sent , there was no one on duty until Monday to learn of his action .
9. Refusal Moves
The above strategies suggest that any move away from participation on the terms desired by those watching can be seen as a kind of refusal .
A more extreme form of refusal is to “ just say no ” and ignore the surveillance .
This surprisingly simple response is not as common as one might expect .
Partly this reflects deference to authority and fear of sanctioning or denial of service .
Politeness and the desire to avoid conflict , or be labeled a troublemaker , also may be factors .
It is now routine in some large retail chains to ask all customers for their phone numbers , whether they pay with cash or with a credit card .
In response , the individual can refuse to give any number or say , “ I do n’t have a phone . "
Beyond increasing consumer autonomy , this prevents surveillor access to the rich array of personal and census tract data that can be linked to phone numbers and then , using powerful " data dredging techniques , " analyzed in relation to the record of bar - coded purchases .
Refusal can be specific to certain kinds of information .
For example , while many persons do not realize this , the Privacy Act of 1974 restricts the collection of social security numbers to a limited number of governmental purposes and offers no mandate at all for unrelated private sector uses .
Yet that restriction hardly stops private organizations from requesting the number .
As part of the employment process at a large state university , I was asked to sign a form swearing that I was a loyal citizen and supported the laws of the state and country .
I also was asked if I had ever belonged to various political groups .
The latter question seemed inconsistent with the First Amendment protection of the former that I had just indicated I supported .
With more curiosity than trepidation , I ignored the second question and waited .
But as with so much on bureaucratic forms , this was overlooked and nothing happened .
The surveillance also might be ignored not on principle , but on the assumption that the risks of being identified are small and the risk worth the gain .
Drug smugglers flood borders with many couriers carrying small amounts knowing that most will get through .
Requests to participate in public opinion surveys , whether over the phone , in person , or by computer or mail , also may be refused .
Indeed , there is evidence that refusal rates have been increasing .
With respect to unwanted phone requests , whether for interviews or sales pitches , one response is to say , " This is n't a good time for me to talk , but if you give me your home phone number I will call you back late tonight " .
Refusal is a broad term which may mean literally ignoring a request for information .
But it may also involve feigned participation in which expectations about how one is to participate are violated .
Here masking can be seen as a subtype of refusal .
Consider , for example , offering false information .
This can involve checking the wrong column for income or indicating a preference for golf when one 's preference is really for cooking .
According to some research , 30 % or more of website visitors admit providing incorrect information .
Changing the spelling of one 's name or middle initial permits tracking the solicitation networks through which names are sold and also might impede database matching .
The above cases are ones in which providing the information is , in principle , optional .
There are other cases where it is required , but is refused as an act civil disobedience .
For example , two marines refused to give DNA samples because they did not trust the government to only use it for identification purposes in case of their death ( Los Angeles Times , Dec. 27 , 1995 ) .
Apart from organizational demands , individuals also may avoid certain medical tests or DNA analysis because they do not want this on their insurance and other records ( see Alpert , this issue ) .
10 . Cooperative Moves
One of the findings from research on white collar crime is the frequency of insider perpetration and cooperation with violators beyond the organization ( Rosoff , Pontell , & Tillman , 2002 ) .
Insiders often have access to , and knowledge of , control systems and this knowledge can be tempting .
Thus , it is not surprising that efforts to resist surveillance sometimes involve collusion with surveillors .
A market for information and its ’ distortion is created and controllers possessing the information have an illicit product to sell .
Or this may be done for personal reasons as in the early days of computerized records when a police chief simply erased the record of his son ’s drunk driving arrest .
Given the complexity of the social controller 's job ( e.g. , the often vast and dispersed activities subject to control ) and various restrictions and constraints on them ( e.g. , applicable laws and organizational policies ) , social controllers also might need the cooperation of those they are charged with controlling ( e.g. , Sykes , 1971 ) .
This can result in what Marx ( 1981 ) terms non-enforcement , that is , controllers exchange a resource they have for some form of cooperation from the controlled .
Cooperative moves seem particularly characteristic of control systems where agents are poorly motivated or indifferent , feel fatigued , and are under - rewarded .
They also may sympathize with those they are to surveil .
This can lead to the routinization of surveillance , lessened attention and taking action only when it can not be avoided .
Moreover , the agents may cooperate with those watched not to get involved .
Consider , for example , ( 1996 ) finding that more than one million persons managed to live illegally in Moscow in the mid-1980s because illegal residents of apartment complexes would routinely bribe superintendents or guards who might otherwise inform on them .
In short , trying to motivate and control first - line surveillance agents in low visibility field settings is a major issue for organizations .
Cooperative moves also may be ideologically motivated .
For example , given ideological disagreements with authority and sympathy for those controlled , some welfare workers bend rules and look the other way in the face of system rules and procedures seen to be unreasonable .
Gilliom ( 2001 ) finds a pattern of widespread , if unorganized , resistance on the part of welfare caseworkers in response to a new and very comprehensive computer monitoring program of those on assistance .
11 . Counter - surveillance Moves
These moves are of a different order than the moves discussed above .
They involve turning the tables and surveilling those who are doing the surveillance .
Knowing that targets of surveillance may respond in kind also can be a factor limiting or inhibiting the initial use of surveillance .
The extent to which there has been a " democratization of surveillance ” is an important topic .
Certainly there is greater equality in access to and use of surveillance technologies today than in much of recorded history .
However , we are certainly far from equivalence here .
The kind of technologies that are developed , apart from who has them , is also much affected by inequality in resources .
Yet many techniques are inexpensive , easy to use , and widely available .
If counter - measures uncover questionable practices , which are then publicized , it also may lead to their moderation or cessation .
This situation overlaps discovery moves .
It can lead to deceptive actions taken to ensnare surveillance agents and document discreditable surveillance .
A classic case , that certainly must have had ripple effects on police behavior , is that of a Jewish Defense League informant and later defendant , who tape - recorded highly incriminating conversations with his police handler .
This came out in court after the police officer committed perjury in denying that he threatened the informant and then to his great surprise , heard his tape - recorded threats played back ( Dershowitz , Silverglate , & Baker , 1976 ) .
The results of counter - surveillance , if incriminating , may be used to compromise
those doing the initial surveillance .
Those controlling surveillance systems may be seduced , blackmailed or otherwise coerced into cooperation in return for the silence of those they originally watched .
Implications for Future Research
I have suggested some concepts that can help organize responses to privacy invasions .
Yet as a Yiddish expression holds , “ for instance is n’t proof .
A number of questions involving the patterning and correlates of neutralization moves , differences between acceptable and questionable forms , the generalizability of the forms and understanding cycles of surveillance , neutralization and counter - neutralization can be identified for more systematic research .
Examples of Research Questions
How does neutralization relate to attitudes towards authority , politics and privacy ?
The pattern likely transcends conventional left - right distinctions .
How are these forms of resistance socially distributed ?
The social class implications appear distinctive .
Resistance to control and domination is usually approached as a response of the poor and powerless ( Scott , 1985 ) .
However , responses to new forms of organizational surveillance are more evenly distributed and much resistance appears positively ( rather than inversely ) associated with class position .
The privileged who participate most fully in conventional society ( e.g. , with respect to communications , computer uses , credit cards , and consumption ) are prominent in resistance .
Orwell ’s ( 1990 ) dystopia is prescient here , as those who were watched most closely were the more privileged .
Their greater exposure to organizational demands for personal information and greater resources enhances the likelihood and multiplicity of forms of resistance .
There is a spatial and relational geography to the protection and revelation of personal information that could be usefully explored ( Margulis , this issue ; Marx , 2001 ; Stinchcombe , 1963 ) .
There could be mapping of the ecology of places where information has greater protection , for either cultural reasons , as in the sanctuary offered by a church , or in no ( or fewer ) questions asked places , such as frontiers , ports , vice and skid row areas of cities and some isolated places ( e.g. , Key West ) .
Relationships also serve to contour the perceived need for information protection .
Notable examples include the legal protections of much medical , legal and religious communication and the confidentiality of spousal communication .
There may be “ natural ” limitations ( until a technology changes this ) such as those involving the senses ( e.g. , the traditional protection of darkness ) or environmental limitations such as dead spaces where radio transmission is poor or blocked .
This mapping also could have a temporal dimension , such as special periods ( e.g. , time - outs and times of holiday license ) , when there may be a greater tendency to look the other way .
How can legitimate and illegitimate forms of resistance be differentiated and how might they be connected ?
While there will be some common social forms and processes , the moral distinction is central .
We can contrast legitimate forms of resistance to unwarranted privacy invasions with actions that , although protecting personal information , are morally indefensible , as with the discovery , masking and blocking moves of serious crime .
There is an important distinction between neutralizing the unwarranted surveillance of legitimate activities in which symbolic protest motivations are important as ends in themselves , as against neutralizing legitimate surveillance as a means to other illegitimate ends .
Criteria are needed which would permit us to speak of “ good ” and “ bad , ” or appropriate and inappropriate , efforts to neutralize the collection of personal data .
Beyond the easy contrasts provided by extremes in actual behavioral patterns ( e.g. , a person who uses encryption as part of a serious crime or who seeks to destroy fingerprints to avoid prosecution vs. the dismantling of “ cookies ” implanted without consent on one ’s computer by a website ) , how should efforts to neutralize surveillance be judged ?
Elsewhere I have argued that the ethics of any given form of the new surveillance can be evaluated by differentiating the means of data collection , the context and conditions under which data are gathered , and uses or goals .
I suggest 29 questions embodying a cluster of values respecting the dignity and autonomy of the individual , trust and community ( Marx 1998 ) .
The more the questions can be answered in a way affirming the underlying values , the more justified surveillance is .
Conversely the more answers to these questions negatively reflect on these values , the more justified are neutralization efforts .
There are research questions about how generalizable this classification of moves is .
For example , does it apply to other contexts of information discovery and protection beyond the individual relative to organizations considered here , such as in the management of stigma ( Goffman , 1963 ) or the espionage and counter - espionage activities of organizations relative to each other ?
Can some of the same concepts ( e.g. , discovery , blocking ) be usefully applied to those engaged in surveillance , whether in the private sector , government or in interpersonal relations , as they in turn attempt to neutralize the efforts of those responding to surveillance , or do we need additional concepts ?
Can the categories be usefully applied to efforts to neutralize the imposition of information on persons , as well as taking it from them ?
I have focused primarily on the latter , but another component of privacy is crossing personal borders and invading personal space in order to impose something upon a person ( e.g. , loud music , cell phone conversations in public , cooking smells , subliminal messages , advertisements ) without their consent and sometimes even knowledge .
How do efforts to protect against these forms of privacy invasion relate to efforts to stop information from being taken from the person ?
Are the same categories useful or are additional ones required ?
What does the mute button on the TV remote have in common with encryption ?
There also are research questions about how neutralization moves , that expand zones of “ insulation from observability ” ( Coser 1961 ) , relate to other forms of resistance to organizational power ( Brook & Boal , 1995 ; Jermier , Knights , & Nord , 1995 ; Scott , 1985 , 1990 ) .
For example , what is the impact of individual responses ?
That is , under what conditions are they effective in meeting material needs and enhancing the individual ’s sense of dignity and autonomy ?
Under what conditions do such individual actions additively result in unplanned social change , apart from any formal political pressure or legal or policy changes ?
When do they serve as a kind of consciousness raising and pre-politicization in which individual resistance eventually leads to more organized political challenges , as against simply remaining individualistic responses that inhibit such organized challenges ( e.g. , compare the contrasting views in Gilliom , 2001 ; Martin , 1993 ; McCann & March , 1996 ; Scott , 1985 , 1990 ) .
Surprisingly , social researchers who generally rush to study protest groups have tended to ignore the social dynamics , impact , and strategies of organizations that seek to protect privacy and challenge surveillance ( e.g. , the Electronic Privacy Information Center , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the American Civil Liberties Union , The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and groups focusing on particular forms such as junk mail , telemarketing , medical , genetic , workplace and social security privacy ) .
Such groups seek to directly affect political processes , as well as offering information and resources to the public .
A mapping of the organizational forms of resistance to the indiscriminate collection and use of personal information could begin by analysis of the many privacy groups , privacy media , privacy - enhancing services and tools , and consumer and legal resources found on the “ Privacy links ” web page of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse ( http://www.privacyrights.org ) .
Of equal interest would be studies of how organizations involved in surveillance and personal data collection activities , and groups representing them such as the Direct Marketing Association , the American Association of Manufacturers , the American Chamber of Commerce and various banking , insurance and credit card companies , promote their activities and respond to challenges .
Under what conditions do individual forms of resistance , such as the reaction to the Lotus Marketplace and related controversies ( e.g. , the Intel Pentium III chip with its ’ unique identifier ) lead to retreat rather than intensified public relations and lobbying efforts ?
In the 1994 Lotus case , an effort to sell millions of names and address was met with a massive public outcry that ironically was mobilized by email messages ( Gurak , 1997 ) .
Gabriel ( 1999 ) , in noting the hubris , pathos ( and we might had bathos ) surrounding Foucault ’s combining the Catholic omnipresent eye of God with the Protestant will to sterile efficiency sought with modern control efforts , observes “ that our lives are controlled by diverse forces operating both on us and through us cannot be doubted .
That our lives can be reduced to these forces in a totalitarian gloom runs against what history has to tell us ” ( p. 193 ) .
Questions about Neutralization as a Dynamic Process
As the examples of neutralization suggest , the human spirit valiantly expresses itself in the face of the machine .
It frequently proves richer than the possibilities anticipated and built into the latter .
However , victory may be short lived .
While the present analysis is static , in reality the processes are fluid and dynamic .
That is , just as new means of information collection can lead to innovations in resistance , those in the surveillance business respond to neutralization efforts with their own innovations that are then responded to in a re-occurring pattern .
This is not to deny the greater power of employers , manufacturers , merchants , landlords , professionals , parents and state agents , such as welfare workers , teachers , police , and prison guards , over those subordinate to them .
Issues of power and control are central to the kinds of surveillance that become social issues .
Yet power is rarely a zero -sum game .
Beyond varying degrees of normative constraint on power holders , power is not unlimited because it is often rooted in interdependency and occurs on a broad and decentralized scale .
In informational - conflict settings in democratic societies , the advantage of technological and other strategic surveillance advances are often short - lived and contain ironic vulnerabilities .
Neutralization is a dynamic adversarial social dance involving strategic moves and counter - moves .
It has the quality of an endless chess game .
This emergent phenomenon is well worth studying as a conflict interaction process .
Of particular interest here is escalation and " the see - saw principle " of military technology in which new developments are balanced by counter - developments .
Consider for example the appearance of the “ unshredder , ” a computerized document reconstruction process that appeared in response to the initial strip - cut type of shredder .
This cat - and - mouse reciprocity raises questions such as : How are neutralization and counter - neutralization techniques discovered , chosen , combined and diffused ?
Useful in studying this would be the “ how to do it ” literature made possible by a free market and free press ( with an enormous boost from the Internet ) and communications of the surveillance industry .
What are the major “ career paths ” and “ life cycles ” of techniques of surveillance and neutralization ?
Does the lag time vary by the properties of the technique and characteristics of the players , by resource and skill factors , or by the perceived importance of success and cost of failure ?
Final Comments
In summary , I have noted factors encouraging compliance with and subverting the vast expansion in the collection of personal information .
I have identified 11 behavioral techniques of neutralization intended to subvert the collection of personal information and some issues for research .
In spite of doomsday scenarios with respect to the death of privacy , in societies with liberal democratic economic and political systems , the initial advantages offered by technological developments may be weakened by their own ironic vulnerabilities and , in Poe ’s ( 1967 , p. 153 ) term , “ human ingenuity . ”
This is certainly not to argue for complacency because power imbalances ( both legitimate and illegitimate ) are central to a majority of surveillance situations .
It is , however , to ask that our vigilance be informed by careful empirical research and analysis .

NEW DELHI , Nov. 27 — Wal - Mart moved closer to cracking open one of the last and potentially most lucrative frontiers for giant Western retailers today when it announced a joint venture to open stores in India .
Together with Bharti Enterprises , a leading Indian cellphone operator , the world ’s biggest retailer will open “ hundreds ” of Wal - Mart superstores across India in the next five years , said Bharti ’s chairman , Sunil Mittal .
The deal would be the first large - scale entry into the booming Indian market by a major foreign retailer .
Companies like Wal - Mart and Carrefour , the French retailer , have long been stymied by government rules that critics call protectionist .
“ It is the last and a very big frontier , ” Mr. Mittal said in an interview at a World Economic Forum conference in New Delhi .
“ Brazil is done .
China is done .
This is the last Shangri -la of retail .
Where will Tesco or Wal - Mart get their growth ?
Here . ”

As head of production at New Line Cinema , Toby Emmerich is not your typical moviegoer .
So when he wanted to see “ War of the Worlds ” the other night , his choice was between seeing the film in a theater with a tub of popcorn or watching it in a screening room at Jim Carrey ’s house , with a private chef handling the culinary options .
Despite this seemingly loaded deck , Emmerich opted for a real theater .
“ I love seeing a movie with a big crowd , ” he says .
“ But I had no idea how many obnoxious ads I ’d have to endure -- it really drove me crazy .
After sitting through about 15 minutes of ads , I turned to my wife and said , ‘ Maybe we should ’ve gone to Jim Carrey ’s house after all . ’ ”
When DreamWorks marketing chief Terry Press took her young twins to see “ Robots ” this year , she said , “ My own children turned to me and said , ‘ Mommy , there are too many commercials ! ’
Now , when the lights go halfway down , I ’m filled with dread .
The whole uniqueness of the moviegoing experience is being eroded by all the endless ads . ”
You do n’t have to be an industry insider to be aggravated .
Ads are one of the reasons why moviegoers , especially adults , are abandoning theaters this summer .
When my favorite music biz blogger , Bob Lefsetz , wrote recently about being bombarded with ads before seeing “ Crash ” at a local theater , he was deluged with supportive mail from incensed ad - loathing readers .
As Barry Ritholtz put it : “ The commercials just add insult to an already declining experience . ”
Advertisement
It ’s only going to get worse .
According to the Cinema Advertising Council , ads in theaters increased by 23 % last year alone .
The New York Times recently reported that Gillette aired its first in - theater ad , touting its new Pulsar toothbrush , convinced that a big - screen look at the toothbrush ’s new technology will “ have amazing visual impact . ”
I can testify to the impact , though I ’d call it more depressing than amazing .
I saw the ad last week during an afternoon of theater ad watching .
The Pulsar ad was just one of roughly two dozen ads , public - service spots and behind - the - scenes film and TV features that make up the 2wenty , a 20 - minute package of ads that plays on 5,700 screens in Regal theaters around the country .
Put together by National CineMedia , a joint venture between the Regal and AMC theater chains , the 2wenty represents , depending on your point of view , a new high or low in theater advertising .
Cliff Marks , National CineMedia ’s president of sales and chief marketing officer , says he is n’t presenting commercials but “ an entertaining content piece ” in which nearly half the ads are created for or seen first in theaters .
He ’s recruited four Big Media partners -- Universal Studios , Sony Pictures Entertainment , NBC and TBS -- that produce behind - the - scenes features for the package .
He insists moviegoers have no problems with well - presented ads .
“ Our research shows that the overwhelming majority of people like the 2wenty , ” he says .
“ Most importantly , we end our show at the designated show time -- we ’re doing it on our time , not on your time . ”
No one will say how much theater owners are making from ads , but it seems clear that annual revenues are sizable -- CineMedia ’s media partners alone are paying millions for their chunk of the Regal package .
If I viewed it simply as an investor , I ’d be impressed , especially by the shrewd foresight of real estate magnate Phil Anschutz , who has emerged as America ’s largest theater owner , combining his Regal chain with United Artists and Edwards Theaters .

Buying into the business when many chains were in bankruptcy , the reclusive billionaire has poured roughly $ 70 million into equipping Regal theaters with new digital video technology .
But that technology is n’t being used to show “ War of the Worlds ” on a hi-def digital video system .
Theater owners are content to wait for the studios to pony up most of the conversion costs for digital projection .
Anschutz put all that money into the theaters largely to sell more ads .
The $ 70 - million investment , which includes satellite delivery capability , allows Regal , via CineMedia , to play a new package of advertising each month , with custom - crafted versions of the 2wenty to run in front of PG , PG - 13 or R - rated movies .
My first look at the 2wenty came at the Grand Palace theater in Calabasas , a sleek replica of a 1940s movie house that has a six - screen multiplex .
The package is a big step up from the hodgepodge of slides and spots airing in most theaters .
There were even two clever ads : a Nike “ Friday Night Lights " - style look at high school football and a making - of feature on “ The 40 - Year - Old Virgin , ” a Universal comedy starring Steve Carell .
Instead of just showing tedious interviews with the filmmakers , the feature cannily sold Carell himself , showing clips of him in “ Bruce Almighty , ” “ The Office ” and on “ Late Night With Conan O’Brien . ”
But the rest of the 2wenty was given over to routine spots you could see on TV ; Fanta and Sony Ericsson ads I ’d seen in other theaters I went to ; a promo for a Regal MasterCard ; an L.A.
Times ad with bad techno music , and commercials for three TV shows , including NBC ’s “ The Biggest Loser . ”
I ’ve seen TV show ads in theaters before .
But somehow the sheer absurdity of the idea did n’t really register until watching the “ Loser ” spot .
Imagine being a studio executive sitting in a movie theater -- the once - sacred palace where we saw glorious dreams in the dark -- being exhorted to stay home next Tuesday night to watch “ The Biggest Loser . ”
Would n’t you fear for your future ?

The studios have only themselves to blame .
As ads began to creep into theaters years ago , virtually everyone turned a blind eye .
The only studio to take a stand was Disney .
In 1990 , the studio said it would n’t allow any ads in front of its films .
The studio lifted the ban on Touchstone films a few years ago , but it still refuses to allow ads before its Disney - brand films .
Says studio chief Dick Cook : “ We felt theaters were the last bastion of a commercial - free environment and that ads simply were n’t appropriate , especially in front of films playing to kids and families . ”
There are a few small theater chains that refuse ads .
The Pacific theater chain ’s ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood is commercial free , charging moviegoers $ 14 in return for a more pristine environment .
Jerry Pokorski , the chain ’s head film buyer , says ArcLight ’s strategy is a big success , but he ’s vague about how soon Pacific will extend its no-commercial policy to other theaters .
“ It ’s where we ’re going in the future , but we ’re still trying to understand the economics of the whole thing . ”
For the studios , the economics are simple .
They ’re conglomerates now , meaning that advertising a cellphone in a theater may help Sony ’s bottom line as much as the profits from a new film .
Even if an NBC ad sours a few people on seeing a Universal film , it evens out in the end .
Still , it ’s not hard to connect the dots between the growth of in - theater advertising and the continuing box - office slump .
At a time when virtually every technological innovation , from TiVo to the iPod to satellite radio , is geared to helping us escape advertising , movie theaters are subjecting us to more of it .
The studio marketers say they ’re caught between a rock and a hard place .
As more consumers tune out commercial TV and radio , marketers have to grab eyeballs where they find them .
“ I ’m just trying to keep our business alive , ” says Geoff Ammer , president of Sony worldwide marketing .
“ We get information every week about how many new [ digital video recorders ] there are .
Three years ago , it was 750,000 homes .
Now it ’s roughly 3 million .
The day when it ’s 50 million homes is not far away . ”

Universal Pictures Vice Chairman Marc Shmuger insists that Universal ’s making - of features for CineMedia respect moviegoer sensibilities .
“ We find that people have enjoyed them , ” he says .
“ As a marketer , our challenge is to make a connection with people .
If we ca n’t find the consumer as easily on TV , then we have to go to the one place where you know the moviegoer is -- in the theater . ”
The problem is that people who advertise in theaters -- especially movie studios -- have made a devil ’s bargain .
The more polished the ads , the more they dilute the potency of the ads we actually enjoy -- the coming attractions .
We need someone who loves movies to take a stand .
If Steven Spielberg had decreed that he ’d play “ War of the Worlds ” only in theaters that did n’t run ads , the commercials would ’ve vanished .
George Lucas reportedly forced theaters to limit the amount of trailers before “ Revenge of the Sith . ”
If only he ’d gone after the real villains -- the ad-mongers -- he would ’ve been viewed as a hero .
If someone does n’t step up to the plate soon , movie theaters will soon find themselves in a one - quadrant business , catering to restless teenagers .
The rest of us will happily watch DVDs on our giant plasma TVs , no longer able to remember the last time we felt the need to make that woeful trek to a multiplex that looks more like an ad- plastered NASCAR track with every passing day .

Cartesian closed categories and the λ-calculus
John Baez
September 28 , 2006
Categorical semantics was born in Lawvere 's celebrated 1963 thesis on algebraic theories :
F. William Lawvere , Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories .
The role of semantics enters when we consider " models " of an algebraic theory .
Loosely speaking , a model is just one of the things the theory seeks to describe .
For example , a " model " of Th( Grp ) is just a group .
Technically , an algebraic theory T is a category with finite products , and a model is a functor that preserves finite products :
Z : T → Set
from T to the category of sets .
The basic idea is simple : if for example T = Th( Grp ) , then Z maps the abstract concept of " group " to a specific set , the abstract concept of " multiplication " to a specific multiplication on the chosen set , and so on , thus picking out a specific group .
Dual to the concept of semantics is the concept of syntax , which deals with symbol manipulation .
Just as semantics deals with models , syntax deals with " proofs " .
For example , starting from Th( Grp ) we can prove consequences of the group axioms merely by juggling equations .
In the case of algebraic theories , the syntax often goes by the name of universal algebra :
Stanley Burris and H.P. Sankappanavar , A Course in Universal Algebra .
The relevance of all this to computer science becomes visible when we note that a proof in Th( Grp ) , or indeed in any algebraic theory , can be seen as a rudimentary form of computation .
The " input " of the computation is a set of assumptions , while the " output " is the equation to be proved .
Treating proofs as computations may seem strained , but it becomes less so when we move to richer formalisms which allow for more complex logical reasoning .
One of the most well - known is the lambda calculus , invented by Church and Kleene in the 1930s as a model of computation .
Any function computable by the lambda calculus is also computable by a Turing machine , and according to the Church - Turing thesis these are all the functions computable by any sort of systematic process .
Moreover , computations in the lambda calculus can actually be seen as proofs .
The aptness of this way of thinking was brought out in Landin 's classic paper :
P. Landin , A correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church 's lambda - notation , Comm .
ACM 8 ( 1965 ) , 89-101 , 158-165 .
Also available from the ACM site if you have a subscription .
H. Barendregt , The Lambda Calculus , its Syntax and Semantics , North - Holland , 1984 .
H. Abelson , G. J. Sussman and J. Sussman , Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs .
Joachim Lambek , From lambda calculus to Cartesian closed categories , in To H. B. Curry : Essays on Combinatory Logic , Lambda Calculus and Formalism , eds. J. P. Seldin and J. Hindley , Academic Press , 1980 , pp. 376-402 .
a |→ x × a
b |→ hom( x , b)
HOM ( x × a , b ) ≅ HOM ( a , hom( x , b ) )
If this is befuddling , take our category to be Set and take HOM = hom ; then the above equation says :
" a function from x × a to b is the same as a function from x to the set of functions from a to b . "
Lambek 's discovery introduced a semantics for the lambda calculus , since it lets us to speak of models of theories formulated in the lambda calculus :
Z : T → Set
just as we could for algebraic theories .
These are again just functors that preserve finite products .
In computer programming , the importance of a model is that it gives a picture of what a program actually accomplishes .
A model Z sends any program to an actual function between sets .
There 's no way to list all the interesting references to CCCs and the λ- calculus , but here are some great online places to get started , starting out easy and working up to the harder ones :
Joachim Lambek and Phil J. Scott , Introduction to Higher Order Categorical Logic , volume 7 of Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics , Cambridge U. Press , 1986 .
For more discussion of these concepts visit the n-Category Café and check out my course notes .
Slipstreaming behind the annual rituals of sorrow and reverence for 9/11 , George W Bush has decreed that , five days later , on the 16th , there is to be a further day of solemnities on which the nation will pray for the unnumbered victims of Hurricane Katrina .
Prayers ( like vacations ) are the default mode for this president who knows how to chuckle and bow the head in the midst of disaster but not , when it counts , how to govern or to command .
If you feel the prickly heat of politics , summon a hymn to make it go away ; make accountability seem a blasphemy .
Thus has George Bush become the Archbishop of Washington even as his aura as lord protector slides into the putrid black lagoon , bobbing with cadavers and slick with oil , that has swallowed New Orleans .
No doubt the born - again president is himself sincere about invoking the Almighty .
But you can hear the muttered advice in the White House : Mr President , we were in trouble after 9/11 ; the unfortunate episode of the schoolroom , My Little Goat and all that .
But do what you did then ; set yourself once more at the centre of the nation ; go to the epicentre of the horror and embrace its heroes ; make yourself the country 's patriotic invigorator and all may yet be well .
So this weekend it was predictable that the president would shamelessly invoke the spirit of 9/11 to cover his shamefully exposed rear end - " resolve of nation ... defend freedom ... rebuild wounded city ... care for our neighbours " .
But comparisons with 9/11 - the fourth anniversary of which was marked in New York yesterday - will only serve now to reinforce the differences between what the two calamities said about America , and especially about those entrusted with its government .
The carnage of 9/11 generated an intense surge of patriotic solidarity , even with America 's Babylon , a city scandalously and notoriously indifferent to Heartland values .
This was because the mass murders had been committed by people who defined foreignness : theocratic nihilists who equated pluralist democracy with depravity .
A hard - ass city supposedly abandoned to the most brutal forms of aggressive individualism ( a fiction it liked to cultivate ) showed instead the face of American mutualism as volunteers poured into the smouldering toxic crater .
Blood and food donations piled up and a mayor disregarded his personal safety to be where he had to be , in the thick of the inferno ; his daily press conferences astoundingly bullshit - free , unafraid of bearing bad news ; treating his fellow - citizens , mirabile dictu , like grown - ups .
The rest of the country looked at Zoo York and , astoundingly , saw images and heard stories that made themselves feel good about being American : the flag of defiance flown by firemen amid the Gothic ruins ; the countless tales of bravery and sacrifice among those trapped inside the towers .
For all the horror , this could be made into a good epic of the American character .
It was this redeeming sense of national community that protected the president from any kind of serious political scrutiny whenever he invoked 9/11 as the overwhelming reason for launching the invasion of Iraq .
As John Kerry found to his cost , unexamined passion triumphed over reasoned argument .
Bush won re-election simply by making debate a kind of treason ; an offence against the entombed .
Out of the genuinely noble response to 9/11 , then , came an unconscionable deceit .
Out of the ignoble response to Katrina will come a salutary truth .
For along with much of New Orleans , the hurricane has swept away , at last , the shameful American era of the fearfully buttoned lip .
Television networks that have self - censored themselves into abject deference have not flinched from their responsibility to show corpses drifting in the water ; lines of the forlorn and the abandoned sitting amid piles of garbage outside the Convention Centre ; patients from Charity Hospital waiting in the broiling sun in vain for water and medical supplies ; helicopters too frightened of armed looters to actually land , but throwing bottles of water down from their 20ft hover .
Embarrassed by their ignorance of the cesspool that was the Convention Centre , members of the government protested that it was hard to know what was really going on " on the ground " .
All they had to do was to turn on the TV to find out .
Millions of ordinary Americans did .
And what they saw , as so many of them have said , was the brutality , destitution , desperation and chaos of the Third World .
Instead of instinctive solidarity and compassion , they have witnessed a descent into a Hobbesian state of nature ; with Leviathan offering fly - by compassion , 30,000 ft up , and then , once returned to the White House , broadcasting a defensive laundry list of deliveries , few of which showed up when and where they were needed .
Instead of acts of mutual succour , there was the police force of Gretna , south of New Orleans , sealing off a bridge against incoming evacuees , and turning them back under threats of gunfire .
Instead of a ubiquitous mayor with his finger on the pulse , and the guts to tell the truth , enter Michael Brown , a pathetically inadequate director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , Fema , hounded from his 11 - year tenure as supervisor of commissioners and stewards of the International Arabian Horse Association by legal proceedings .
Instead of summarily firing " Brownie " , the president ostentatiously congratulated him on camera for doing " a heck of a job " .
Only on Friday , in an attempt at damage control , was the hapless Brown " recalled " to Washington , his position as Fema director intact .
And instead of an urban community of every conceivable race , religion and even class brought together by trauma , another kind of city , startlingly divided by race and fortune , has symbolised everything about America that makes its people uneasy , ashamed and , finally , perhaps lethally for the conservative ascendancy and its myths , angry .
A faint but detectable whiff of mortality is steaming up , not just from the Louisiana mire , but from this Republican administration .
Call me a cynic but is it entirely a coincidence that suddenly the great black hope of moderate Republicanism , Colin Powell , is everywhere , publicly repenting of his speech to the UN ( and by implication damning those who supplied him with unreliable intelligence ) , and offering , unbidden , his own lament for the institutional meltdown that followed the breach of the levee .
The administration is already thought of as a turkey and the turkey vultures are starting to wheel .
Historians ought not to be in the prophecy business but I 'll venture this one : Katrina will be seen as a watershed in the public and political life of the US , because it has put back into play the profound question of American government .
Ever since Ronald Reagan proclaimed that government was not the answer but the problem , conservatism has stigmatised public service as parasitically unpatriotic , an anomaly in the robust self - sufficiency of American life .
For the most part , Democrats have been too supine , too embarrassed and too inarticulate to fight back with a coherent defence of the legitimacy of democratic government .
Now , if ever , is their moment ; not to revive the New Deal or the Great Society ( though unapologetically preserving social security might be a start ) but to stake a claim to being the party that delivers competent , humane , responsive government , the party of public trust .
For the most shocking difference between 9/11 and Katrina was in what might have been expected in the aftermath of disaster .
For all the intelligence soundings , it was impossible to predict the ferocity , much less the timing , of the 9/11 attacks .
But Katrina was the most anticipated catastrophe in modern American history .
Perhaps the lowest point in Bush 's abject performance last week was when he claimed that no one could have predicted the breach in the New Orleans levees , when report after report commissioned by him , not to mention a simulation just last year , had done precisely that .
But he had cut the budget appropriation for maintaining flood defences by nearly 50 % , so that for the first time in 37 years Louisiana was unable to supply the protection it knew it would need in the event of catastrophe .
Likewise Fema , which under Bill Clinton had been a cabinet level agency reporting directly to the president , had under his successor been turned into a hiring opportunity for political hacks and cronies and disappeared into the lumbering behemoth of Homeland Security .
It was Fema that failed the Gulf ; Fema which failed to secure the delivery of food , water , ice and medical supplies desperately asked for by the Mayor of New Orleans ; and it was the president and his government - averse administration that had made Fema a bad joke .
In the last election campaign George W Bush asked Americans to vote for him as the man who would best fulfil the most essential obligation of government : the impartial and vigilant protection of its citizens .
Now the fraudulence of the claim has come back to haunt him , not in Baghdad but in the drowned counties of Louisiana .
In the recoil , disgust and fury felt by millions of Americans at this abdication of responsibility , the president - notwithstanding his comically self - serving promise to lead an inquiry into the fiasco - will assuredly reap the whirlwind .
I grew up in the 1980's , by which point it was common knowledge that American - made products were of inferior quality and higher price than foreign goods .
If you wanted the latest electronic equipment , it was made in Japan .
If you wanted to buy a fancy car , it was German .
If you wanted to buy the coolest clothes , they were made in someplace strange - sounding like Pakistan .
Given 2 decades of consuming experience , I 'm just not surprised that no matter how much the dollar falls , the trade deficit remains stubbornly high .
The theory is that if the value of the dollar is lower , then American - made products will be less expensive , and thus will gain in market share due to their lower price .
But this has n't happened .
The NY Times thinks it 's a mystery .
But to me it 's perfectly obvious .
It does n't matter how much the dollar falls if foreign workers are getting paid 1/10 as much as Americans ( are you going to cut 90 % of the dollar 's value ?
I did n't think so ) .
And it really does n't matter if no one wants to buy any of your crap .
Seriously , what can we sell to other countries that they would want ?
Our non-existent consumer electronics ?
Our crappy cars ?
Unless American companies stop killing themselves with incompetence & greed , and unless we start re-examining our trade and industrial policies , the next generation of Americans is going to grow up in a 3rd world country .
Because you see , that 's what happens to indebted nations who have nothing anybody else wants to buy - you become poor .
But hey , who cares ?
We 'll all be under water anyway .
The notice left on cars claims victims were seen using a mobile
All the car owners have found their tyres have been slashed and , in many cases , a note on their windscreens .
The sinister message , made from newspaper cuttings , says the driver was seen using a phone .
Hampshire Police are investigating the incidents in Gosport , Lee - on - the - Solent and Stubbington .
One victim was Rebecca Rendle , who was left with a £ 170 bill , when all four of her tyres were punctured outside her Gosport home .
Rebecca Rendle : " There 's a loony "
" I think it must be ( someone following me home ) as that 's the only way they would find out where you live .
" There 's a loony who thinks they are doing the world a favour . "
Police said they are investigating this incident and 20 similar cases that occurred in the area over the past several months .
Insp Kevin Cuffe , of Hampshire Police , said : " In most of the cases a note has been left at the scene and forensic specialists are in the process of examining these notes to gather potential evidence .
" These incidents are being taken very seriously as we appreciate that criminal damage has a very real and detrimental effect on the victims .
" Whoever is doing this may feel that he or she has some sort of justification but there is never any excuse to vandalise the property of others . "
WARNING : WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE IS PROFANE AND RACIAL
Michael Richards exploded in anger as he performed at a famous L.A. comedy club last Friday , hurling racial epithets that left the crowd gasping , and TMZ has obtained exclusive video of the ugly incident .
Play video content TMZ.com
Richards , who played the wacky Cosmo Kramer on the hit TV show " Seinfeld , " appeared onstage at the Laugh Factory in West Hollywood .
Kyle Doss , an African - American , told TMZ he and some friends were in the cheap seats and he was playfully heckling Richards when suddenly , the comedian lost it .
The camera started rolling just as Richards began his attack , screaming at one of the men , " Fifty years ago we'd have you upside down with a f*** ing fork up your ass . "
Richards continued , " You can talk , you can talk , you 're brave now motherf ** ker .
Throw his ass out .
He 's a nigger !
He 's a nigger !
He 's a nigger !
A nigger , look , there 's a nigger ! "
The crowd is visibly and audibly confused and upset .
Richards responds by saying , " They 're going to arrest me for calling a black man a nigger . "
One of the men who was the object of Richard 's tirade was outraged , shouting back " That 's un - f *** ing called for , ai n't necessary . "
After the three - minute tirade , it appears the majority of the audience members got up and left in disgust .

British scientists have developed a revolutionary pill that men could take as a one - off contraceptive just before a date .
The tablet would prevent a man from being able to impregnate a woman , but within a few hours his fertility would return to normal .
Read more ...
• Most parents unaware if their son or daughter is sexually active
• Teenagers who smoke 50 per cent more likely to develop drink problems
• Woman has first ' grow your own ' knee transplant
This would make it much more acceptable to men than other ' male pills ' under development , which alter hormone levels and have to be taken over the long term .
It is also more likely to be trusted by women as they are not relying on their man having to remember to take his pill every day for it to work .
The hormone - free ' male pill ' was inspired by two medicines already in use and so the scientists hope it could be on the market within as little as five years .
Experts believe it could transform family planning by allowing couples to share the responsibility for contraception - a role that traditionally falls to women .
The new contraceptive is likely to appeal to women who are uneasy about the female Pill 's ability to raise the risk of strokes , heart attacks and potentially - fatal blood clots .
Critics argue , that men lack women 's motivation to prevent pregnancy , making it hard for women to trust them to take a contraceptive pill .
Other male pills are under development but many of them are based on hormones that trick the brain into switching off sperm production .
These are typically being developed as injections , implants and patches .
However the new pill being researched by scientists at King 's College London , contains chemicals that prevent ejaculation and could be in tablet - form .
Men could take one daily , just like the female pill , or have one a few hours before sex as a one - off contraceptive .
Sexual satisfaction is not affected and the absence of hormones means that a man 's fertility should return to normal within hours of stopping the treatment .
Researcher Dr Nnaemeka Amobi said : " The non-hormonal male pill could be taken when and as needed . "
Fellow researcher Dr Christopher Smith said : " If the man was taking the pill over a period of several months and decided to come off it , we would expect his fertility to return just as quickly as if he had taken it on a one - off basis . "
The contraceptive was inspired by the observation that some drugs used to treat schizophrenia and high blood pressure also prevent ejaculation .
However , side - effects including dizziness and drowsiness mean these medicines could not be marketed as contraceptives .
After pinning down how the drugs stop ejaculation , the London researchers set about creating tablets that do the same thing but without the side - effects .
Already tested in the lab , it is hoped human trials will start shortly and the pill on the market within the next five years .
Currently , men who want to take responsibility for contraception have limited choice , with their options extending to condoms , a vasectomy , or simple abstinence .
Professor John Guillebaud , one of Britain 's leading experts on contraception , described the pill as " a brilliant discovery " .
He said its strength lay in its ability to prevent pregnancy without using hormones which could cause side - effects such as hot flushes and moodiness .
If the male pill is successful it could bring in huge amounts of money to King ’s College , which owns the rights to the discovery .
Annual world - wide sales of the female Pill are worth £ 21 billion a year .
Rebecca Findlay , of the Family Planning Association , said : " It gets really tiring for women to always be the one in charge of fertility .
" For women , it would be another form of liberation .
It 's great . "
WMAP 's full - sky map of the oldest light in the universe , the microwave background .
Colors indicate warmer ( red ) and cooler ( blue ) spots .
The oval shape is a projection to display the whole sky ; similar to the way the globe of the earth can be represented as an oval .
The shape does not represent the possible shape of the universe , which scientists have long thought to be nearly spherical .
Instead of being perfectly round like a globe , the universe might be a bit stretched in shape like a pill .
The newly proposed shape could be caused by a magnetic field that pervades the entire cosmos or defects in the fabric of space and time , researchers said .
Scientists in Italy base their proposal off data gathered by a NASA satellite known as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) .
This spacecraft is designed to scan the sky and measure the temperature of the heat left over from the Big Bang and now present throughout the universe in the form of microwaves .
So far data from this probe has helped nail down some of the most important details about the universe .
This includes the age of the universe since the Big Bang , at 13.7 billion years ; the time when the first atoms formed , at 380,000 years after the Big Bang ; and how much of the universe is made of either ordinary matter or the mysteries known as dark matter and dark energy , at roughly 5 , 25 and 70 percent , respectively .
The quadrupole anomaly
The satellite also revealed an oddity concerning the way in which portions of the sky contribute to the overall map of cosmic microwaves .
When it comes to the largest samples of the sky , the level of microwave radiation seems to be under - represented .
On the other hand , smaller samples seem to be contributing radiation at expected levels .
Now astrophysicist Leonardo Campanelli of the University of Ferrara and his colleagues Paolo Cea and Luigi Tedesco at the University of Bari , all in Italy , have found that a universe shaped a bit like an oval can explain this so - called " quadrupole anomaly . "
If the universe did not expand as a sphere after atoms first formed but instead as a slightly more elongated shape known as an ellipsoid , that would explain the odd cosmic microwave intensities seen at the largest scales , the researchers suggest .
Some parts of a nonspherical universe would be farther away than others , and thus appear slightly fainter , a minute difference mostly imperceptible when only looking at tiny slices of the sky .
According to Campanelli and his colleagues , the universe may be roughly 1 percent more eccentric , or nonspherical , than previously often believed .
An ellipsoid universe could be caused by a magnetic field pervading the cosmos that stretches space - time , he said , or by space - time defects such as cosmic strings , immensely dense structures just a proton or so wide stretched to intergalactic scales , whose gravity could distort space and time .
Bigger headache
While NASA astrophysicist Gary Hinshaw at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , felt it " fair to say that the data weakly favor the ellipsoidal model , " he told SPACE.com that invoking an ellipsoid shape for the universe to solve the quadrupole anomaly created a bigger headache involving why the universe might be ellipsoid to begin with .
" It is actually difficult to understand how an ellipsoidal model would arise ' naturally ' in cosmology , so the burden switches from explaining a very mild ' anomaly ' to explaining a fundamentally new feature of our universe , " Hinshaw said .
The scientists reported their findings in the Sept. 29 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters .
Future space missions that better see how cosmic microwaves are polarized could test the ellipsoidal model .

Prosecutors allege Mr Pickton is Canada 's worst serial killer
They say the pig farmer told an undercover police officer he wanted to kill one more to make it an " even 50 " .
Mr Pickton is accused of murdering 26 women - all of whom were prostitutes and drug addicts - who disappeared over a period of more than a decade .
The 57 - year - old is initially being tried for the murder of six of the women .
He has pleaded not guilty .
Mr Pickton will be tried in connection with the other 20 women later , because a judge decided that the volume of evidence could have overwhelmed the jury , and that the case ought to be split into two .
The heads of the individuals had been cut in two , vertically
Derrill Prevett , prosecutor
This trial is expected to last for at least a year .
Mr Pickton has been in jail since his arrest during an elaborate police investigation of dozens of missing women from Vancouver 's Downtown Eastside .
Police have identified more than 60 missing women in the area and are continuing their investigation .
Prosecutors have not ruled out further charges against Mr Pickton .
His lawyer , Peter Ritchie , has called on the jury to keep an open mind about the case .
Body parts
The judge presiding over the case has told jurors they must brace themselves for " shocking " testimony .
Already they have heard opening statements containing graphic allegations against Mr Pickton .
There has been huge anticipation in Canada ahead of the case
The prosecutor , Derrill Prevett , said the heads and other body parts of two of the victims were found in a freezer during a 2002 police search of Mr Pickton 's farm in Port Coquitlam , near Vancouver .
" The heads of the individuals had been cut in two , vertically , " he said .
" With the skulls were left and right hands and the front parts of the left and right feet . "
Mr Prevett added that both skulls had bullet wounds .
Investigators also found a gun at the farm , which had a sex toy attached to the barrel .
The sex toy had DNA of Mr Pickton and one of the alleged victims , the prosecutor said .
Mr Prevett also told the court Mr Pickton had described himself to the undercover officer as a serial killer .
None of the evidence had been revealed in the Canadian media until the trial began , after a court order ruled that its publication could prejudice the trial .
Therefore there has been huge anticipation in Canada ahead of the case .
If Mr Pickton is found guilty he faces life in prison .
Now Google , with its market valuation of more than $ 100 billion , has drawn the ire of the newspaper and book publishing industries , among others , which argue that its supposedly benevolent search robots have been usurping their intellectual property .
Purpose - driven media , by the way , are even more common in the software world .
The shining example is the Firefox browser that is available free for download and has emerged as a credible rival to Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
And , for icing on the cake , Firefox makes money for its not - for - profit owners because Google pays to be its search engine .
Another example of genius ideas from people who do n't seek Internet riches is Chowhound.com .
This nine - year - old site features community - generated restaurant review boards in various cities and steadfastly refuses to accept restaurant advertising .
Rather than continue to grovel for donations and make a few dollars selling Chowhound books , the founders sold the company last month to CNET Networks , a Web business known for its reviews of technology products , for an undisclosed amount .
Unlike Chowhound , whose independence and spirit it has vowed to maintain while helping to spiff up the site , CNET.com is chockablock with ads .
A fascinating new entrant in the field is LaLa.com , a music - swapping site introduced last month .
Depending on where you are sitting , the LaLa concept is either brilliant ( if you are a music fan with a lot of CD 's you do n't listen to , or if you are an artist ) or terrifying ( if you are a retailer of new or used music , or perhaps even a music label ) .
Here again , the founders are not in it just for profit .
Rather , their idea is that despite all the cool new digital music services , well over 90 percent of the music industry sales are still in the CD format ; most people still have CD 's and artists do n't gain any benefit from the sale of used discs .
Many music lovers , the founders contend , feel disenfranchised by the way music is sold .
So LaLa is essentially a CD - swapping site that matches people who want one another 's old CD's .
It charges them a mere $ 1 a disc and provides the postage - paid envelopes to send them in for 49 cents apiece .
Out of each dollar , the company voluntarily pays 20 cents to the performer on the recording ; there is no more a legal obligation to do so than there is to pay General Motors a cut every time a used Chevy changes hands .
Bill Nguyen , the man behind several Silicon Valley start - ups , who is one of LaLa 's founders , said that the service might work just as well at a cost of $ 4 a CD -- still a quite a bit cheaper than a typical used CD on eBay or in an East Village record shop -- but that making money was n't the point .

The Benefits Of Dianabol For Sale
Primarily made in the testicles , testosterone is typically a male hormone that ’s accountable for male sexual traits development and muscle mass maintenance , along with increased red blood cell ( RBC ) levels , and better bone strength and density .
Generally , a man ’s testosterone levels are at their peak during early adulthood and adolescence .
With age , testosterone production does n’t completely stop but it loses its momentum .
After 30 years of age , a man can expect his testosterone production levels to go down 1 - 2 percent every year .
Men who are aware of this decline usually resort to external testosterone stimulation methods such as anabolic steroids .
Human Body Composition
Increased testosterone could impact body composition .
The likely benefits are lean muscle mass gains , increased bone density and decreased body fat .
Testosterone prohibits triglyceride uptake and mobilizes lipids from the adipose tissue .
The decrease or increase of testosterone would usually inversely affect the body ’s fat deposits , thereby resulting in body fat reduction .
As per a 2007 study , lean mass increase and body fat reduction were found in HIV - positive fat men who were put through a testosterone therapy .
In another study done in 1989 , testosterone was found to increase the muscles ’ protein synthesis .
A 1999 study also demonstrated changes in body composition from higher testosterone .

Sexual Performance
Testosterone therapies can treat erectile dysfunction issues and libido loss in men who have low testosterone , either because of hypogonadism or advancing age .
Although the increased testosterone ’s effects are quite dramatic in hypogonadal males , normal gonadal function , which is also called eugonadal , could positively impact men ’s libido .
Emotional Health
Low testosterone amount can significantly affect an individual ’s emotional state .
Impaired cognition , depression , and heightened fatigue are low testosterone production symptoms – this hormonal state is called hypogonadism .
Testosterone therapies for hypogonadal males have been found to successfully decrease negative mental states that are related to depression and fatigue , while increasing self - esteem feelings simultaneously .
Eugonadal men with increasing testosterone have also exhibited emotional takeaways – for instance , increased self - esteem feelings and a decrease in fatigue .
These benefits ’ intensity is based on the dosage .
According to experts , higher testosterone dosage could make aggressive response and aggression more pronounced .
Conclusion
Testosterone influences an individual ’s emotional , sexual and physical well - being – higher amounts of testosterone typically have a positive impact on the person ’s performance and attitude .
Though higher testosterone levels could present some benefits , the alterations in testosterone population in the body could hurt the endocrine system ’s routine hormonal production mechanism .
Therefore , if you ’re considering increasing testosterone , talk to your doctor beforehand .

NOTHING comes to the wronged so easily as righteous anger .
After a vicious patent suit , the maker of the BlackBerry — the wireless e-mail gadget that chains the white - collar proletariat to its work — faces the threat of a court - ordered shutdown in America .
The service 's users ( widely known as CrackBerry addicts ) fret about coping without it ; shareholders of Research in Motion ( RIM ) , the Canadian company that makes the devices , are angry at their wilting share price ; and the wider technology industry , from Silicon Valley to Shenzen , watches nervously , wondering what it means for anyone who uses intellectual property — ie , just about everybody .
RIM is generally regarded as the victim of an injustice .
Founded 21 years ago by two engineering students who still help run it , the company is being held for ransom by a “ patent troll ” .
The monster emerging from under the bridge is an entity called NTP , which does n't actually make or sell anything — it does n't even have a website , for goodness sake .
But it has hired a handful of lawyers to enforce its patents and in settlement talks this week , it was demanding almost 6 % of RIM 's sales in America until 2012 when its patents expire — about $ 1 billion .
NTP 's threat of a legal injunction to shut down BlackBerry unless it pays up is viewed as little short of extortion .
The easy conclusion is that the patent system is being cynically used to wreck the livelihoods of honest folks who are the true innovators .
That 's wrong .
The chief lesson of the BlackBerry saga is that patents are there to be protected .
If the system is to have any meaning , its integrity must be upheld for the sake of the businesses that rely on it and the public that benefits from innovation .
For a start , RIM itself is the chief author if its own fate .
In 2000 , barely a year after the BlackBerry was introduced , NTP requested that RIM license its patents ( which are based on the work of an inventor who earned around 50 patents over many years ) .
In 2002 RIM suffered so devastating a legal defeat that it was ordered to pay NTP 's legal bills .
An appeals court largely upheld the judgment against the company this year .
During this time , BlackBerry users rocketed into the millions — yet at every turn , rather than license the patents , RIM resisted ; and , as it has resisted , the bills have mounted .
Distressed BlackBerry users argue that too many of the world 's workers rely on the device for the service to be shut down .
But many of their jobs depend on the principle at stake in this case — that the courts should protect intellectual property because it rewards inventors by conferring a real title to an intangible asset .
Business requires confidence that intellectual property will be respected and infringers brought to justice , regardless of whether the litigant is using the patent or not .
Only with that security will firms patent and license their inventions , thus allowing others to use their ideas .
Fixed - line reforming
This is not to say the intellectual - property system is perfect .
America 's patent office is re-examining NTP 's patents and has declared them invalid — not because they necessarily are , you understand , but for the baffling reason that when such disputes arise , the office wants the patent - holder to defend his title .
Moreover , injunctions are not always appropriate in infringement cases — a matter that the Supreme Court has recently agreed to consider .
So the system certainly needs reform , but it also needs defending .

Delving back into the type system for this post , I thought I would take on the strange and wonderful Binary Search Tree known as the treap .
For those that do n’t know , a treap is a binary search tree that has a “ priority ” element attached to the key .
It uses the random priority to ensure balancing of the tree .
It does this by ensuring the tree is in binary search tree form with respect to the keys , and in heap form with respect to the priorities .
We will create a simple type of string based treap in Qi and perhaps extend it to a more general version if I find the time to finish it .
* grin* The datatype for treap can be either list based or tuple based .
I ’ll begin with the tuple version as it shows off a bit more of the power of Qi pattern matching , but a list version would be more readable .
We can signify empty leaves with the null list in either case .
And now we will create the recursive type .
It takes a key and a priority and has a left branch and a right branch .
Using the tuple to define the leaves means we place the key and priority in their own tuple and use that as the first element .
Then we can put the left and right branches in their own tuple as the second element of our treap node .
We ’ll use the ever handy left / right sequent operator to ensure we can prove things about treaps using the datastructure only and typing the internal parts .
Now when we wish to insert a key into the treap , we must first make a random number to assign it for heap priority .
Now the fun begins .
The base case seems simple enough , just make a treap that looks like the above definition but has LeftTreap and RightTreap set to [ ] .
Now it could be that we are trying to insert an element that we already have .
If so , we simply return the treap we had to begin with .
Note that our pattern matched definition is well typed .
L is a treap and R is a treap .
K is a string and P is a number .
We match the new key and priority as K and P .
We match the treap node ’s priority as K * and P * and the branches as L and R .
If you mess up using them in your definition , the complier complains loudly .
Now we know the K is not equal to the current treap node , if it is less than the tree node we insert it somewhere on the left tree .
AFTER we do this , then we order the treap by heap priority , preserving the BST ordering as we move our way up the tree .
We ’ll use the same pattern as the element above .
So if our new priority is less than the old one , we move it up the treap .
That makes it reverse heap ordering , but we are not splitting hairs here .
* grin*So now we need to find out how to rotate a treap node up a treap .
Rotate right takes the L branch and finds its left and right treaps and their keys .
It then puts the left L treap as the current left , uses the left treap node ’s key / priority as the current key / priority and makes a new right treap with the original left nodes right hand treap paired with the old right hand side , placing the old key / priority there .
The code below serves as our heapify .
Pattern matching makes the change short and sweet .
Type checking ensures that we have a valid treap at the end .
Now we can finish our definition of treap_insert with the right hand insertWe can make a rotate_left along the lines of the rotate_right
All we need to do now is define a string less than function str-lt that compares strings .
And here we run into a problem .
We have no type safe way of comparing strings in Qi .
So we ’ll have to modify Qi to know about our version of the string compare function .
We ’ll build it from the ground up by giving CHAR - CODE a type .
In deference to Haskell , let us name the function “ ord ” .
You can patch it withBut it would help to simply search for the word “ difference ” as it is an internal function used only 3 times in the program outside its own definition and add the code yourself to learn how .
There you find the arity list that you must add the ord function too and the type list where you specify the type .
Then you can add the DEFUN for ord by the other system function defuns .
Run the installer and you will get a version of Qi that has our “ ord ” function .
Now we can define our string less than function , “ str-lt ” .
And now we have a working , input - only treap .
I think at this point I will take a break and perhaps return the program efficiency and changing of the syntax in another article .
Let me know of any questions or comments you have so far please !
Here is the full file .
I 'll create a place to download my code sometime soon .

I ’ve thereby provided you , my readers , with the unique opportunity to experience my lecture as Gus himself experienced it — as if you actually were Gus , sitting in a real Waterloo classroom taking notes .
For those of you who feel the need to prepare yourselves for this experience , here ’s a recap of all the lectures so far :
Update : Preparing these notes is a sh&tload of work for me .
So dude — if you want me to keep doing it , please let me know in the comments section if you ’re actually reading the notes and deriving any benefit therefrom .
Constructive criticism would also be fantastic .
Thanks very much !

Cancer cells keep dividing because the cell suicide process fails
Healthy cells have a built - in process which means they commit suicide if something is wrong , a process which fails in cancer cells .
The University of Illinois team created a synthetic molecule which caused cancer cells to self - destruct .
Cancer experts said the study , in Nature Chemical Biology , offered " exciting possibilities " for new ways of treating the disease .
These findings present an exciting new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of some cancers
Dr Michael Olsen , Cancer Research UK
One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is their resistance to the body 's cell suicide signals , which allow them to survive and develop into tumours .
All cells contain a protein called procaspase - 3 , which the body should be able to turn into caspase - 3 - an executioner enzyme .
But this transformation does not happen in cancer cells , even though certain types , such as colon cancer , leukaemia , skin and liver cancers paradoxically have very high levels of procaspase - 3 .
Healthy cells unaffected
The researchers examined more than 20,000 structurally different synthetic compounds to see if any could trigger procaspase - 3 to develop into caspase - 3 .
They found the molecule PAC - 1 did trigger the transformation , and cancer cells from mice and from human tumours could be prompted to self - destruct - a process called apoptosis .
The more procaspase - 3 a cancer cell had , the less of the molecule was needed .
Healthy cells , such as white blood cells , were found to be significantly less affected by the addition of PAC - 1 because they had much lower levels of procaspase - 3 , so cell - suicide could not be triggered .
When the scientists tested PAC - 1 on cancerous and non-cancerous tissue from the same person , the tumour cells were 2,000 - fold more sensitive to PAC - 1 .
Since different levels of procaspase - 3 were found in the cell lines studied , the researchers suggest some patients would be more responsive to this therapy than others , so the it might one day be possible to tailor treatments to individual patients .
' Exciting '
Professor Paul Hergenrother , who led the research , said : " This is the first in what could be a host of organic compounds with the ability to directly activate executioner enzymes .
" The potential effectiveness of compounds such as PAC - 1 could be predicted in advance , and patients could be selected for treatment based on the amount of procaspase - 3 found in their tumour cells . "
Cancer Research UK expert Dr Michael Olson , who is based at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in Glasgow , said : " These findings present an exciting new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of some cancers .
" It remains to be seen which , if any tumour types consistently express elevated procaspase - 3 .
That will tell us how many patients could potentially benefit from the drug . "
Dr Olson said further clinical trials would be needed to confirm the safety of the treatment .

Version 1.3.0 will be out soon with more of the requested features , this one was released to address the security issues that emerged recently .
' edit ' you say ????
Jul 01 , 2007 by Grof
There 's a new version of freeSSHd online ( 1.2.0 ) and it comes with a cool feature you 've all been waiting for : " graphical " application support .
See picture below to better understand what I mean .
Here 's a list of changes :
Irvine , Calif . --
Researchers at UC
Irvine have found that a new compound not only relieves the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease , but also reduces the two types of brain lesions that are hallmarks of this devastating disease , thereby blocking its progression .
In a study with genetically modified mice , a team of UCI researchers led by Frank LaFerla , professor of neurobiology and behavior , found that a compound known as AF267B , developed by paper co-author Abraham Fisher of the Israel Institute for Biological Research , reduced both plaque lesions and tangles in brain regions associated with learning and memory .
Although drugs exist on the market today to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer 's , AF267B represents the first disease - modifying compound , meaning it appears to affect the underlying cause and reduces the two signature lesions , plaques and tangles .
It ’s remarkably easy to hack LEDs into Lego minifigures to make awesome , creepy , and tiny decorations for Halloween .
In what seems like a miraculous coincidence , a standard LED fits exactly into the head of a Lego minifigure .
It ’s that easy : grab an LED and a head , slip it in , and it fits perfectly .
The modern Lego minifigure dates to 1975 - 8 . Since LEDs were already coming in 5 mm packages ( also called T 1 3/4 packages ) by the mid 1970 ’s , it ’s clear that Lego minifigures were made to fit LEDs in their heads .
It ’s a sign from above :
The little yellow guys are simply meant to have light - up noggins .
Who are we to argue with fate ?
It ’s a good idea to carve your head before putting the LED in .
( No , not your head , the head of your Lego minifigure . )
This is particularly important if you ’re starting with an older Lego head , since the suction can make it hard to remove the LED .
( Newer Lego minifigure heads have a vent in the top . )
If necessary , wipe the smile ( and eyes ) off of its face with some rubbing alcohol .
To carve the face , use a hobby knife with a sharp blade .
You will be tempted to work with the knife very close to your face , so that you can see what you ’re doing .
That ’s fine , but it ’s a very good idea to wear some eye protection .
Once you ’re done carving , use the knife to remove any burrs or chips on the inside , which could make it difficult to insert the LED .
In order to mount the modified head on the body , you ’ll need to cut off the neck and widen the hole to accept the base of the LED .
I actually trimmed the bottom of the LED down a bit so that I did n’t have to make the hole quite so big .
In any case , carving the body is quick and straightforward with the knife .
I did n’t have any batteries small enough to fit inside the body itself , so I also cut a little hole in the back to let the leads out .
To assemble the figure , take the legs off , put the LED in the head , put the head on the body , bend the leads out the back , and reattach the legs .
This works well because once it ’s assembled , you ca n’t see the leads from the front .
Here ’s the completed figure :
It needs a caption !
Please leave your suggestions as comments or on its flickr page !
The figure stands on its own .
The leads of the LED stick out the back , where they lightly touch the sides of a lithium coin cell .
The pumpkin head took several hours to carve .
The next day I had blisters on my thumb and index finger where I had been holding this little head ( tight ) while I carved .
While it is often difficult to get this level of detail in something so tiny , the hardest part in this particular case was making the three initial holes through the thick plastic .
If I had to make this one over again , I would start by drilling three tiny holes in the head .
I put a red - orange LED in the head and attached it to a lithium coin cell to try it out .
It looks a little bit like an LED throwie , but I guess that it ’s really a
“ Lego throwie . ”
The pumpkin head was attached to this minifigure body , which was modified in the same way as the other body .
The Lego horse provides a platform to rest the lithium battery , and the cape covers it all up .
The things fit together nicely on their own , and no tape or glue was necessary .
With the lights turned down a little bit , the Headless Horseman is ready to ride .

EFX 1.0 uses XHTML for page specification .
XHTML is too rigid .
You 've got to line the brackets up and stuff .
HTML is only a bit better ( for humans ) .
Maybe I should take a clue from AFT .
It is very forgiving of humans .
It does n't expect you to construct a document .
It expects you to write a document .
In the case of EFX , XHMTL is artificial complexity .
EFX 2.0 should have some natural complexity .

Although the end - user of a typical EFX distribution is not a layperson ( this ai n't a Gooey APP ) , I 'd like to see the distribution come with EFX , Storybot and a sample site template ( a weblog ! ) .
It would ideally look like this :
storybot.exe storybot.cfg efx_plugins / blog_template /
The user would edit storybot.cfg , modify blog_template / blog_settings.cfg to customize their site , and run " storybot.exe " .
This is n't what I have right now .
Now you have to install ActiveState Tcl ( 20 + MB ) , set a couple of environment variables ( OS dependent ! ) and invoke a batch / shell file that runs storybot.tcl .
This needs to change .

I really like this quote :
Schemer : " Buddha is small , clean , and serious . "
Lispnik : " Buddha is big , has hairy armpits , and laughs . "

I think about organic code as being the big Buddha .
Organic code is code that grows , evolves and is a bit hackish .
Architected code is like the small Buddha .
It has proper packaging , structures , a clear / clean API and design patterns that dictate extension .
EFX core is the small Buddha ; EFX Storybot is the big Buddha .

Text is the small Buddha ; my AFT program is the big Buddha .
In that same vein :
Vi ( editor ) is the small Buddha ; Emacs is the big Buddha .
Tcl strives to be the small Buddha , but it is really a medium - sized Buddha sucking in its stomach .

( LaTeX is the big Buddha forced to conform to some CMMI level 5 process . )
Bourne Shell + ( g ) awk is the small Buddha ; Korn Shell is the big Buddha .
Oddly , C is not the small Buddha and C++ is not the big Buddha .

I am a programmer .
There -- I need to say that sometimes to remember what I am .
No , I am not a Software Engineer ; not a Software Developer ; not a hacker ; not a craftsman ; not an artist ; not an explorer ; not an inventor .
I am all of these and more .
There is no vocation / avocation in the world quite like programming .
I wo n't let this joy be sucked out of me .

I 've been thinking that I do n't want EFX 2.0 to use XHTML .
I do n't want it to use HTML either ( nor any XML variant ) .
The more I look at ( X ) HTML / XML , the more my head hurts .
XML is really just a syntax .
I can ignore it for now .
Whether or not EFX 2.0 uses XML as the syntax or not , so as long as it can produce it ( XHTML ) and possibly read it , everything will be okay .
It 's probably HTML that bothers me the most .
When I think about laying out a web page , I think about much higher level abstractions than lists , tables ( as layout mechanisms ) , divs / spans with classes , etc .
I know I want a navigational menu here , some text here , pictures here and other stuff here and here .
My AFT does this for documents , but web pages are n't documents ( at least not the ones I 'm talking about here ) .
What would EFX 2.0 page markup look like ?

One thing I noticed as I started my EFX 1.0 codebase migration back to Tcl .
As I started to remember the syntax my fingers started moving quite rapidly over the keyboard .
The code flowed .
Now , this is n't a gush about Tcl .
In some ways I found it quite disconcerting .
With tcllib at hand ( through the ActiveState 20 MB distribution ) , I was able to lay down productive code much faster than the Unix-y approach of the past few months .
But , my Tcl code is n't as well thought out .
This is okay , because I have quicker turnaround with Tcl , but because of the limitations of awk and ksh , I found myself thinking deeper thoughts about my design .
How can I do this in awk ?
Is there a better representation of this data ?
How do you really write a mime parser ?
The past few months have given me a great deal of insight into the problem domain .
I do n't think I would have done this if I stuck with Tcl all the way through .
I think all of that experience is going to feed into making EFX 2.0 an even better release .
For now , I am hacking away in Tcl and making great progress .

Okay , back to EFX 1.x , otherwise known as The Monolith .
Its about 70 % done .
I 'm moving the codebase to 100 % Tcl ( ActiveState 's distribution -- at 20 MB it is quite a beast ) .
I started the Storybot rewrite in Tcl tonight .
I got about 127 lines written ( which is probably around 80 % current functionality ) .
Obviously , I am relying on tcllib ( pop3 , mime parsing , etc ) .
I have n't done much Tcl in the past 6 months .
It feels quite lisp -y compared to ksh and ( g ) awk .
This is an example of the kind of stuff I missed most :
file rename $f [ file join [ file dirname $ f ] .[ file tail $ f ] ]
It felt good .

I 'm having fun writing scripts in ksh at work .
Unlike , Perl , awk , Tcl , Scheme , etc I feel like I have direct access to system commands .
I do n't have to ask nicely , or adopt an unusual syntax -- its all there at my fingertips , perfectly integrated with the programming language .
Suddenly you find that you need to know find , dd and friends .
Unix is your library ( man is its documentation ) and all is well in the world .
Stick to POSIX or a small smattering of GNU and your stuff will be portable .

Photos seem to contradict Marine version of Haditha killings By Jamie McIntyre
CNN
SPECIAL REPORT
Interactive :
Who 's who in Iraq Interactive : Sectarian divide Timeline : Bloodiest days for civilians Coalition Casualties Special Report YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Marines Iraq or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Pentagon sources say some of the most incriminating evidence against Marines under investigation in the deaths of civilians at Haditha is a set of photographs taken by another group of Marines who came along afterward and helped clean up the scene .
CNN is the first news organization to examine those images .
They were snapped before an aspiring Iraq journalist videotaped the aftermath of the November 19 deaths .
That video convinced Time magazine to pursue the story earlier this year .
Pentagon sources say the 30 images of men , women and children are some of the strongest evidence that , in some cases , the victims were shot inside their homes and at close range -- not killed by shrapnel from a roadside bomb or by stray bullets from a distant firefight , as Marines had claimed .
( Watch what the new images show about the civilian deaths -- 2:51 ) Senior Pentagon officials have said a probe into the November deaths tends to support allegations that Marines carried out an unprovoked massacre after one of their comrades was killed by a roadside bomb .
The military is investigating both the deaths and a possible cover - up .
The Marines originally reported that Lance Cpl. Miguel Terrazas and 15 Iraqi civilians were killed by a roadside bomb in Haditha , a town on the Euphrates River in northwestern Iraq that was the scene of heavy fighting in 2005 .
They later added that eight insurgents were killed in an ensuing gun battle .
The Marine photographs are evidence in a criminal probe , and only investigators and a few very senior officials have access to them .
" I have seen the photographs , but they are part of the investigation and I 'm not going to talk about those photographs , " Marine commandant Gen. Michael Hagee told reporters Wednesday .
But a source allowed CNN to examine copies of the photographs , which a military official said match in both number and description the pictures in the possession of investigators .
The source would not allow CNN to have copies of the images out of concern over personal repercussions .
There are images of 24 bodies , each marked with red numbers .
Some of numbers are written on foreheads , others on the victim 's backs .
A senior military official told CNN that in some cases the numbers may denote the location of bullet wounds .
Among the images : A woman and child leaning against the wall , heads slumped forward .
Another woman and child shot in bed .
A man sprawled face down with his legs behind him .
An elderly woman slumped over , her neck possibly snapped by the force of gunfire .
All of the victims were wearing casual attire .
Some had been shot in the head .
Some were face down , others face up .
The pictures appear to show the locations of the bodies in the houses before a Marine unit loaded them into a truck and brought them to a morgue .
Pentagon officials said there are no plans to release the gruesome images , even after the criminal investigation is complete .
The Haditha photos , like the images of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison , would incite anti-American fervor and therefore constitute a threat to national security , they said .
In a separate incident , seven Marines and a Navy medical corpsman are being held in a brig at Camp Pendleton , California , to face possible murder charges in connection with the April killing of an Iraqi man in Hamandiya , a military officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said .
Briefing reporters Wednesday , Hagee was tight - lipped about the investigations but said Marines " absolutely know right from wrong . "
Hagee flew to Iraq two weeks ago on a trip the Marine Corps said was already scheduled .
But he used the time to lecture his Marines on what he called " the American way of war " amid the two probes .
Hagee said he is " gravely concerned " by the allegations and promised that the investigations now under way will be thorough and complete .
The U.S. command in Baghdad ordered an investigation into the Haditha killings in February , after Time magazine reporters presented video of the scene to American commanders .

I ’m standing on a steel barge in the center of Ootsa Lake , a 154 - square - mile reservoir in northwestern British Columbia .
A chafing wind blows from the west , where the snowy , nearly treeless slopes of the Kitimat Range vanish into overcast skies .
I jump as a voice booms over the outdoor PA system : “ Clear to cut ! ” A few seconds later , a massive spruce tree erupts from the murky water .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Two hundred feet below , a remotely operated vehicle dubbed the Sawfish is wielding a 54 - inch - long chain saw .
On the deck of the barge , an operator sits inside a cramped , dimly lit control room made from a shipping container .
He ’s maneuvering the Sawfish with a joystick , and his eyes are locked on a video feed of footage from eight underwater cameras embedded in the contraption .
A generator delivers power to the sub through a 720 - foot - long high - voltage cable that also encloses a set of fiber - optic lines to transmit guidance commands from the pilot .
If you ’re on the shoreline or live nearby , underwater timber harvesting is remarkably quiet : no screaming chain saws or smoke - belching heavy machinery .
In a steady , splashing procession , tree after tree bobs to the surface , where a small tugboat rigged with a pair of hydraulic claws grabs the trunks and tows them into something called a bunk , a partly submerged U - shaped cradle .
I can see three bunks from the barge .
Each stores up to 300 trees and can be raised onto a second transport barge that holds up to 1,000 logs .
The Sawfish and its four - person crew will fill it in just four days .
This unusual harvesting method is made possible by a submersible that can probe the deepest reservoirs for under - water trees to cut and deliver to the surface .
It was developed by Chris Godsall , the 38 - year - old founder and CEO of Triton Logging .
The company is based near Victoria , but the principal underwater logging operation is at Ootsa Lake , almost 750 miles to the north .
The lake was formed in 1954 , when Alcan , the world ’s second - largest aluminum producer , built a hydroelectric dam here to power its smelter .
The water behind the dam flooded millions of lodgepole pine , spruce , Douglas fir , and hemlock trees , leaving some $ 1.2 billion worth of timber preserved in a kind of suspended animation .
In the cold , dark , oxygen - poor water , tree wood wo n’t decay for thousands of years .
And Ootsa is one of 45,000 spots around the globe where dams have inundated valleys and submerged vast forests .
By some estimates , there is $ 50 billion worth of marketable timber at the bottom of these man-made lakes .
Godsall is quick to point out that he has the only technology able to retrieve it .
To gather up a few logs , it might seem like lunacy to deploy the same kind of sophisticated and pricey ROVs used to explore the Titanic or investigate 9,000 - foot - deep geothermal vents along the mid-Atlantic seafloor .
But do the math and Godsall ’s method starts to make good financial sense .
Operated by just one person , a so - called feller buncher — the fastest and cheapest way to harvest timber on land — can cut at least 500 trees a day .
But then it takes an additional three - member crew up to three weeks to trim and load the trees for transport .
A single Sawfish is more efficient .
It may clear only 250 trees in an eight - hour shift with four crew members , but there ’s no need to skid the logs down a hillside and truck them to a mill .
Instead , a barge delivers the trees to the mill faster and more cheaply , and because they ’ve been submerged they ’re generally already stripped of foliage and bark .
A Sawfish , including the control room , tool shop , and power generator , costs $ 800,000 to $ 1 million , depending on the gadgetry packed into the ROV .
That ’s significantly less than the onetime equipment cost of roughly $ 1.5 million needed to run a comparable feller buncher operation .
Add up all the numbers and , while conventional harvesting costs about $ 50 per cubic meter of wood , Peter Keyes , an executive at a global timber wholesaler and marketer , estimates Godsall ’s cost at closer to $ 40 .
“ Sure , there are big R&D costs to pay down , ” Keyes says .
“ But the technology has given Godsall access to all these trees as if they were on land .
It ’s like finding a new penny . ”
There are environmental advantages to the Sawfish method as well .
Conventional aboveground harvesting contributes to deforestation , a cause of global warming that ’s responsible for the release of 25 percent of the world ’s CO2 emissions .
But because underwater trees are already dead , cutting them down does n’t worsen the situation .
And with underwater logging , there are no unsightly clear - cuts and no spotted owls to worry about .
I first meet Godsall when he arrives at my motel in Burns Lake , a soggy , desolate logging outpost about a two - hour drive from Ootsa .
Tall and lean , with neatly combed brown hair , he ’s wearing tennis shoes , faded jeans , and a blue windbreaker .
Later , as we drive through dense forestlands in his rented sedan , Godsall tells me how he got interested in trees .
Nine years ago , while working as a marketing consultant in Toronto , he took on a client in the log salvage business .
Wet Wood Underwater Fibre Recovery employed loggers to search riverbeds and shallow lakes for sunken timber with potential market value .
Eventually , Godsall signed on with Wet Wood full - time as general manager .
He soon realized that hunting for a log here and there was n’t exactly the way to rake in the dough .
It was akin to collecting soda cans for the five cent return deposit — profit margins were slim , and the work was tedious and time - consuming .
Also , it could be unpopular with the public because scouring lake beds can upset ecosystems , churning up silt and debris that then threaten fish and wildlife .
One day during a meeting , a client showed Godsall an image of an underwater forest at the bottom of a reservoir .
“ I had become so obsessed with retrieving lost logs that the picture of a whole forest of trees under - water seemed at once surreal , obscene , and too good to be true .
I was convinced it was trick photography . ”
But the photo was genuine , and a few weeks later Godsall approached his bosses with a question : “ Why are we hunting for sunken logs when there are entire forests waiting to be reclaimed ? ”
Godsall suggested they build technology to go after all the standing underwater timber in the world .
Everyone just laughed .
Godsall resigned two days later , and in May 2000 he launched Triton .
Godsall is from a clan of overachievers — his father , he says , is a “ compulsive entrepreneur ” ; his mother , an “ extremely creative ” art gallery owner .
One brother is a Hollywood director ; another battles infectious diseases in Africa .
But building a new , unproven technology from scratch made him nervous .
“ I am not an engineer , ” he admits .
“ It was one thing to have a good idea , quite another to execute it . ”
He assembled a design team from a cross-section of fields , including commercial aviation , undersea exploration , and marine biology — there was even an engineer from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts .
During his years as a consultant , Godsall had seen all sorts of contraptions and schemes for retrieving sunken logs — submersible cranes , scuba divers with pneumatic chain saws , and a “ tree mower ” that was dragged like a straight razor along shallow lake beds .
Most did n’t work , some were extremely dangerous , and very few could go much deeper than 60 feet .
But Godsall knew that in Ootsa , nearly three - quarters of the good timber is more than 60 feet below the surface .
“ We had to make that our territory , ” he says .
The team needed to invent something totally new — like the Sawfish .
About the size of a VW bus and painted bright yellow , the sub can dive to 1,100 feet — deeper than any reservoir on earth — and fell a tree in two seconds .
Besides advanced video imaging , sonar , and GPS capabilities , the ROV has a 75 - horsepower engine and seven directional thrusters , making it extremely agile .
And the vehicle is robust enough to withstand an errant tree toppling on it underwater .
The Sawfish has a set of 52 - inch - long lobsterlike steel pincers used to attach the ROV to the base of a tree while cutting .
A powerful waterproof chain saw , mounted on a hinged mechanical arm , can slash through trunks up to 8 feet wide .
Perhaps the most ingenious innovation , though , is Godsall ’s solution for bringing trees to the surface .
Underwater timber is waterlogged and does n’t float .
So the Sawfish attaches airbags to each tree before cutting it .
Using a mouse , keypad , and joystick , a remote pilot can load an airbag on a chain - driven conveyer belt located inside the belly of the Sawfish , then engage a hydraulic ratchet that ejects the bag , screws it onto a tree trunk , and fills it with 5 cubic feet of air .
After the log floats to the surface , a tugboat drags it into a storage bunk , and a crew member removes the reusable bag .
The Sawfish can deploy up to 50 airbags before engineers have to raise it for a refill .
In August 2002 , preparing for its maiden voyage , Triton engineers loaded the Sawfish onto the back of a semi and hauled the sub 14 hours to Ootsa Lake .
“ We cut the first tree and everybody cheered , ” Godsall recalls .
“ We cut another tree and everybody cheered .
Then we cut a third tree and the Sawfish broke and everybody went home . ”
There were other setbacks — airbags exploded , the Sawfish got its tether lines wrapped around branches — but Godsall persisted .
To work out the kinks , he raised more money ( for a total of roughly $ 1.2 million ) and built a floating R&D lab on a reservoir near Triton ’s headquarters .
Triton now operates two Sawfish vehicles on Ootsa Lake , and Godsall plans to build 10 more .
He aims to harvest 45,000 trees a year in Ootsa Lake and hundreds of thousands more in other reservoirs .
The timing is perfect : Demand for decks , hardwood floors , and roofs crafted from sustainable timber is increasing .
Just as organic food swept into grocery stores in the 1990s , Godsall is planning to line the lumber aisles of Home Depot and Lowe ’s with underwater - harvested timber .
He ’s also talking to Ikea about an exclusive deal to provide wood for tables and chairs .
And the Triton logo is becoming an “ Intel Inside ” - type seal that retailers can slap on products to attract green - minded buyers .
A study by the Forest Stewardship Council , a nonprofit based in Germany , says the market for so - called good wood , which includes underwater logs , grew 25 percent in each of the previous two years to hit $ 5 billion in 2005 .
Godsall is also eager to expand operations beyond Canada .
He recently met with reservoir managers in the US , Australia , South America , Africa , and Southeast Asia to broker additional deals .
One project involves clearing trees from the bottom of Volta Lake in Ghana , where seasonal drops in the water level bring submerged timber dangerously close to the surface .
Trees have punctured holes in boats and passenger ferries sinking them and killing hundreds of people in the past four years alone .
Most salvage loggers believe that reservoirs conceal 200 million to 300 million trees worldwide .
“ That ’s a low estimate , ” Godsall says .
“ We ’re continually discovering reservoirs with trees in them .
There ’s one in Brazil called Tucurui with $ 1 billion worth of timber . ”
Eastern Europe is another untapped frontier : “ It has the largest reservoirs with the most trees . ”
But pinpointing underwater forests is tricky .
Godsall ’s team studies old maps that show where forests once stood .
They also use specialized sonar to verify the existence of trees and underwater cameras to identify the variety — spruce , pine , fir , or rare hardwoods such as teak and ebony .
Some species are more valuable than others , and Godsall wants the sticks that will bring in the most money .
To snag the best logs , Godsall hires people who know trees and can make snap decisions about wood quality based on a quick scan of underwater camera footage .
Take Josh Chernov , a marine biologist and one of Triton ’s five pilots .
He ’s inside the Sawfish ’s control room atop the barge , watching six LCD panels relay video from the submerged cameras .
Sitting in a Star Trek - style captain ’s chair , he uses a joystick to zoom around a stand of valuable lodgepole pines at the bottom of Ootsa Lake , ignoring nearby timber of lesser value .
There ’s a muffled whir in the corner from the 2.8 - GHz off - the - shelf Wintel PC — that ’s the Sawfish brain .
Chernov clicks a button on the joystick to toggle between video feeds , panning a front - mounted camera across the lake bed .
The scene is eerie : A lost forest beckons from the shadowy depths , ancient giants still standing proud in the 46 - degree - Fahrenheit water .
At the moment , however , Chernov is about to slice through the 3 - foot - wide trunk of a lodgepole pine .
He deftly glides the Sawfish to the base of the tree , where it hovers a few feet above the lake bed before clasping onto the trunk with its pincers .
While the Sawfish clutches the tree , Chernov switches to a different camera , this time with a view from behind the hydraulic airbag ratchet .
From this angle , I can see a column of fluorescent airbags stacked single file in a storage compartment .
Another click on the joystick and the ratchet telescopes forward , snagging an airbag , bolting it to the tree , then inflating it .
He radios over the PA : “ Clear to cut ? ”
“ Roger , clear to cut , ” a deckhand calls .
Chernov starts the chain saw , which swings out from inside the nose cone of the Sawfish and slices through the trunk in seconds .
Because the airbag is affixed to the base of the trunk , the tree inverts 180 degrees before beginning its ascent .
I step out of the control room and onto the deck just as it bursts through the surface of the water .
“ It ’s kind of like watching the Apollo rockets go up , ” says Dave Menzies , a Sawfish operator who spent 20 years as a pilot for a commuter airline before joining Triton .
Moments later , another log appears , then another .
There is enough timber in Ootsa Lake to keep the Sawfish busy for 50 years — and plenty more lumber in Panama , Malaysia , and other countries where Godsall hopes to begin harvesting by 2008 .
“ Mother Nature never intended for trees to be underwater , ” Godsall says .
But that ’s where forest after forest has ended up .
He still marvels at the perfect preservation of the submerged trees .
Just waiting , he says , to be harvested guilt free and for profit , by the Sawfish .

By far the most famous psychology experiment of all time is Milgram 's demonstration of obedience to authority .
As we all know , his subjects were willing to administer ( what they took to be ) lethal shocks to ( imaginary ) victims simply because a guy in a white coat told them to .
I 've always wondered if perhaps some of the motivation was the ability to inflict such cruelty and have it be ' OK , ' since after all ' The doctor told me to ! '
But I digress .
Even though Milgram's is the most famous , it 's not my favorite .
No , my favorite psychology experiment is Asch 's on conformity .
Here , in the typical setup Asch would have a vertical line drawn on one card and three other lines on a second card , and would ask the group of subjects ( all within earshot of each other ) questions about the relative lengths of the lines .
The twist is that all but one of the subjects were actually confederates , who purposely gave incorrect answers .
The point was to measure how much peer pressure ( or more broadly , the desire to conform ) would cause people to give obviously false answers .
What 's really interesting is that after the fact , the subjects would attribute their obvious mistakes to poor eyesight or some other personal failing .
They did n't seem to realize that the wrong answers of everyone else in the group made it very uncomfortable to give what was clearly the right answer .
And now we come to the most illuminating feature of Asch 's results :
Although as many as a third of the subjects would conform when all the confederates unanimously gave wrong answers , virtually every true subject would give the right answer so long as just one confederate dissented from the rest of the group by giving the right answer as well .
In other words , people are willing to trust their inner judgment and speak what they know to be true , so long as they do n't feel totally alone in those views .
In homage to Asch 's wonderful discovery , I now proceed to do my small part in dissenting from the other confederates in our society .
Here are some basic truths that no arsenal of pseudo - intellectuals can deny : '
It 's wrong to steal , and taxes are stealing .
This one 's pretty simple , folks .
The government tells you to pay your taxes or else .
Or else what ?
Or else , when push comes to shove , they send armed goons to your house to drag you away and throw you in a dungeon ( or ' prison , ' as the modern nomenclature would have it ) .
If you think the services government gave you were worth the price , then the government does n't need an IRS to collect payment .
McDonald 's does n't have thousands of employees whose only job is to force people to fork over money in exchange for Super Value Meals . '
It 's wrong to murder innocent people , and war is murder .
Once again , pretty straightforward , folks .
This is more black - and - white than the questions Asch asked his subjects .
But in case there 's confusion , let me change the wording to make it clearer , perhaps : Melting thousands of children in order to get somebody else to do what you want is evil .
'
Majority vote does n't turn something wrong into something right .
A lot of people think that taxes , and all the murders performed by our brave boys and now girls ( whom we 're all supposed to ' support ' ) , are rendered A - OK because the president orders them .
And this in turn rests on the belief that our system is a good one , because it relies on the will of the majority .
See , it 's not really stealing if ' the people ' approve of the tax code .
Now this is just balderdash and everyone knows it , deep down inside .
If tomorrow Bush stole a scene from Braveheart and ordered that every governor had the right to sleep with new brides , I do n't think the existence of the Electoral College would reassure too many new husbands .
It 's true that the American public would never stand for such a ridiculous decree , and that 's why Bush would never order it .
My point here is simply that it's not the political process that makes such a hypothetical decree right or wrong ; it 's wrong by its very nature .
The goal is to pick a political process that allows the right answer to occur as often as possible .
And when I look at the history of governments throughout history , even our own , I 'm not convinced we 've found a good process . '
The US government can be just as corrupt and backward as any other .
It always amuses me how Americans can be very wise and skeptical when it comes to other governments , but always give extremely generous explanations for apparently hideous actions that US politicians commit .
Sorry folks , it does n't work that way .
When we invade a country because of alleged weapons of mass destruction , and then we stay even though the weapons do n't turn up , then we 've been an aggressor nation .
Yup , we just took over another country on the basis of lies .
When other countries do that , Americans cry foul .
Still think the US is qualitatively better than all those nasty other regimes ?
Still think the American people are a cut above ?
Then how do you explain this ?
In 1963 , the US had a military coup , in which the elected president was murdered and replaced by one of his subordinates .
The ensuing cover - up was so palpably false that anyone who deigns to read up on the subject must realize the government has systematically lied to us all these decades .
For those who would like a good starting point , I recommend Mark Lane 's classic Rush to Judgment .
If just one of his major points is true ' for example , the APB on Oswald going out before the police could possibly have ' learned ' the description ' then the official Warren Commission report is a bunch of garbage .
Use your common sense , folks .
Your government lies to you every day .
If just a few of us started pointing this out , everyone else would soon admit the obvious as well .

The NatWest Three : Gary Mulgrew ( l ) , David Bermingham , Giles Darby
The NatWest Three will appear in court in Houston , Texas , later on Friday for a bail hearing to decide if they can return to England pending a full trial .
And a US spokesman has defended the controversial extradition treaty under which they were brought to Texas .
It is the first official response to the UK political row over the move .
' In UK interests '
The US State Department 's chief legal adviser , John Bellinger , told the BBC that British concerns about the treaty were misplaced .
" This image of the US not being committed to a system of laws is troubling ... it is very important for the British people to understand that an extradition treaty like this is very much in their interests , " he said .
While the procedures are different in different countries , the legal standard of evidence required for extradition is the same
John Bellinger , US State Department
The three men - David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby - have been indicted on fraud charges by federal prosecutors in Texas because of a scheme involving the bankrupt US energy company , Enron .
The FBI says the three cheated Greenwich NatWest - an arm of NatWest - out of about $ 7 m ( £ 3.8 m ) .
The three say they are innocent .
They were extradited last week under a new fast - track system agreed by the British government , and face up to 35 years in prison .
' Disappointing '
Critics - including human rights groups - claim the system is unfair , removing crucial legal rights and protections from British nationals .
Under the new rules , the US is no longer required to provide prima facie evidence in court when seeking to extradite suspects from Britain , while the UK still has to prove its case in court to extradite US citizens to the UK .
The treaty is in the interests of both countries because it will modernise extradition arrangements that can allow criminals to escape justice
John Bellinger , US State Department
Business leaders have also complained that while the new treaty was originally supposed to help combat terrorism , the US authorities have mostly used it to target white collar suspects .
However , Mr Bellinger rejected the suggestion that the system was lopsided .
" While the procedures are different in different countries , the legal standard of evidence required for extradition is the same , " he said .
The UK government has also complained that since the treaty was signed three years ago by Britain , it is still not binding on the US as the US Senate has failed to ratify it into law .
" To be frank it is disappointing to us that the Senate has not moved more rapidly ... we 're working very hard to have it ratified but this is not something that is in the power of the administration alone , " said Mr Bellinger .
' Modernising arrangements '
The process of ratification does finally get under way on Friday with the Senate Foreign Relations committee holding a hearing on the treaty .
However , it must be agreed by two - thirds of the whole Senate to pass into law .
Mr Bellinger stressed : " This is a top and urgent priority for the administration .
The treaty is in the interests of both countries because it will modernise extradition arrangements that can allow criminals to escape justice . "
Meanwhile , the NatWest Three - who have spent the last week in hotels in Houston - are appearing in court today .
They hope to persuade the judge to allow them to return to the UK to prepare their defence .
Their supporters claim bail terms that required them to stay in the US would be too onerous and hamper their ability to adequately defend themselves .

Does the ghostly Casimir effect really cause ships to attract each other ?
“ We have caught physicists in the very act of creating a myth . ” Fabrizio Pinto
Some stories are just too good to be true .
And according to physicist Fabrizio Pinto , that 's exactly the case for an analogy routinely used by physicists to illustrate the mysterious Casimir effect .
The Casimir effect is a strange force of attraction seen between two surfaces separated by empty space .
And it has become almost obligatory for popular articles on the subject to mention that the same effect also operates between ships lying close together in a strong swell .
This notion stems from an article published in 1996 by Dutch scientist Sipko Boersma1 .
He pointed out that the French nautical writer P. C. Caussée stated in his 1836 book The Album of the Mariner that two ships should not be moored too close together because they are attracted one towards the other by a certain force of attraction .
Boersma suggested that this early observation could be described by a phenomenon analogous to the Casimir effect .
Just popping out
The Casimir force arises from the way that empty space is pervaded by ' vacuum fluctuations ' — electromagnetic waves created by ' virtual ' particles that pop briefly in and out of existence .
In infinite space these waves can have any wavelength .
But in a confined space , like that between two parallel plates , the wavelengths cannot exceed the maximum width of the space .
This reduction in vacuum fluctuations acts rather like a reduction in pressure : it means that the plates get pushed together .
The effect that Hendrik Casimir proposed in 1948 is now well established experimentally , and although it is very weak at the everyday scale , it can cause very small objects to stick together .
Boersma suggested that if ships moor in a large swell , waves with wavelengths longer than the distance between the ships would be suppressed in the space separating them .
This could perhaps pull the ships together .
Spot the difference
The pictures in Caussée ’s book refer to ships moored in windless but rolling seas ( top : ‘ Calme avec grosse houle ’ ) and in a flat calm ( bottom : ‘ Le calme plat ’ ) .
Click here to read the original captions in French : only the second refers to “ une certaine force attractive ” .
It is a lovely story , and has been much repeated , including in Nature2 .
But Pinto has told news@nature.com that it is based on a mix - up .
Pinto had two reasons to be curious about the naval story .
A former NASA scientist , he is both a keen sailor and president of InterStellar Technologies , a company that researches practical applications of the Casimir force .
So he searched out a copy of Caussée 's book to find out more about it .
To his surprise , Pinto found that Caussée never claimed that two ships attract in a heavy swell .
Rather , he said that this happens when the sea is completely calm .
Caussée included two elegant prints in his book .
One showed ships tossed about on a high swell , to illustrate the potential problem of their masts getting tangled if they are moored too close together .
The other showed two ships in flat seas , and a small rowing boat pulling them apart to counter a mysterious attractive force .
Boersma included the high - swell picture in his paper , writing : " The old tales were true .
Rolling ships do attract each other . "
But this has mixed the two situations up , says Pinto .
" Physicists just fell in love with the theory , " says Pinto .
And it seems no one ever checked it out .
When asked about the mix - up , Boersma emailed news@nature.com saying that the problem lies with an " editing error " in the original Caussée book , and standing by the physics in his 1996 paper .
Parallel parking
So do ships attract each other at all , whether in a high swell or calm ?
Pinto says he has n't found any real evidence for the effect , in either sailing or scientific literature .
Naval architect Jason Smithwick of Southampton University says he has never heard of such an effect .
" I could imagine how it might possibly happen , but it would take a very specific set of circumstances , " he told news@nature.com .
" It 's nothing that naval architects have ever worried about . "

Pinto thinks that the whole tale is symptomatic of physicists ' approach to the history of their subject .
" Physicists love lore about their own science , " he says .
" There are other stories that are unfounded historically . "
( See ' Lore makers ' . )
Once established , Pinto says , these myths are accorded such reverence that questioning them seems almost an act of heresy , and ' whistleblowers ' get a very hostile reception .
The best plan , then , is to squash the myths before they take root .
Here , he suggests , " we have caught physicists in the very act of creating a myth . "

The Best Of SpikeMagazine.com - The Interviews
Kindle ebook featuring Spike 's interviews with JG Ballard , Will Self , Ralph Steadman , Douglas Coupland , Quentin Crisp , Julie Burchill , Catherine Camus ( daughter of Albert Camus ) and more .
More details
Japan is supposed to be the land of conformity , a land where nobody has original ideas , where everyone unquestioningly follows the pack .
But every now and then , people in Japan come up with some things so bewildering that you wonder where the idea could possibly have come from !
The Hello Kitty “ Snow Kitty ” is one of these .
The ultimate present for kids who have never had a chance to play with snow , I was told by the Sanrio employee who invented this .
For 4,800 yen , payable online or by bank transfer , the reliable blokes at the Sagawa Kyubin delivery service will deliver right to your door a frozen Kitty - chan snowman made of snow hand - packed in Hokkaido the very day before !
The picture above shows the plastic mold on the right into which the snow is packed , and the left is an actual Snow Kitty which came out of the package .
The Kitty arrives in a refrigerated delivery pack , with the snow packed inside the mold .
The kids can then have great fun taken out the frozen Kitty , and sticking the 2 eyes , 1 nose , and six whiskers , which are included in the package , onto Kitty ’s face .
I imagine that soon after that , Kitty either proceeds to melt slowly into the carpet , or begins the next chilly phase of her life in the family freezer , next to a leg of Hokkaido lamb .
A scene from Otaru , where the snow is packed into the kitty shaped moulds ( So many potential Kitty Chans ! )
With its many historical buildings , Otaru , one of Japan ’s leading tourist destinations , now has another notch on it ’s belt as the chilly birthplace for the latest incarnation of the ubiquitous Cat ( who , turning 30 this year maybe should not be called Kitty any more ) .
Hello Kitty was born at Tokyo based Sanrio in 1976 .
The very first Kitty product was a small clear vinyl coin purse ( pictured here ) which sold for 240 yen at the time .
Kitty is now a phenomenon , adorning over 22,000 products and accounting for over half of Sanrio ’s $ 1 billion yearly revenue ( although the person I spoke to suggested it was more likely up to 75 - 80 % ) .
The immense popularity and importance of Kitty in Japanese culture , in both children and adults is highlighted by the fact that this is her 2nd article on Stippy out of over 100 , the other of which discussed her relationship with Paris Hilton .
This wealth of licensing revenue has allowed for quite a free reign for Kitty product inventors inside the company to try anything they think might work , such as Snow Kitties .
This is exacerbated by the floors , walls , and roof of the Kitty product design rooms at the Tokyo headquarters of Sanrio , all being painted bright pink ( but that ’s a story for another day ) .

The official page for the Sanrio Snow Kitty is here , but please beware that it is noted in the instructions that due to the nature of this product , a money - back guarantee is not included , this product cannot be returned , and also cannot be delivered to far away islands ( Okinawa etc , although the Hopporyodos are okay I suppose ! ) .
Kids , please do not eat Kitty - chans eyes , nose or whiskers .
And please beware of yellow snow .
( Okay , I made that last piece up … )
遠いインドネシアの島で見つかった、身長3フィート（約0.9メートル）、1万8000年前の女性の人骨が、2003年の発見以来議論を巻き起こしているが、最近になってこの議論に関する、ある発表があった。
人骨の発見者は、この化石がホモ・フローレシエンシスと呼ばれる新種に属すると提案している。指輪物語の熱狂的なファンは、現実に「ホビット」がいた可能性に熱狂中だ。しかし、疑り深い人たちは、この骨格は小頭症のホモ・サピエンスのものではないかと主張している。
最近、フロリダ州立大学の人類学教授、Dean Falk氏は研究者のチームを率いて、ホビットの脳をコンピュータを使って分析し、小頭症の現代人と比較した。彼女はその結果をProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences（PNAS）に発表した。彼女の判断は、「ホビット」は実際に新種だというものだ。
CNET News.comは、Falk氏にインタビューを行い、進化論上の争点、そしてフロド・バギンズと頻繁に結びつけられることが邪魔になっているかなどを聞いた。
--ふと思ったのですが、お祝いの目的を兼ねて、このインタビューはダーウィンの198回目の誕生日である2月12日に行うべきだったのかもしれません。もし彼にバースデーカードを送るとしたら、どんなメッセージを書きますか？
「 あなたは正しかった」ですね 。
--あなたはどうしてこのホビット研究に関わり始めたのですか。
これは本当に思いがけない幸運でした。私が自宅の書斎に座っていると電話が鳴り、男性の声で、「もしもし、私は米国地理学協会（National Geographic Society ） のDavid Hamlinと申します」と言いました。私は勧誘電話拒否リストに載っており、勧誘電話なら切ろうとするところを、それよりも前に、彼は「雑誌のセールスではありません」と言ったのです。彼はNational Geographicのテレビ番組を制作しており、彼が私と話したがっていたのは、それまで情報が解禁されていなかったNatureの記事についてでした。当時、その情報がちょうど解禁されたのです。彼は私に、この新種の身長は3フィートであり、道具を持ち、小さな象に似た生き物を狩っていることなどを話し始めました。私は途中で遮り、「でっち上げをしているんですか？」と言いました。
彼は笑って、でっち上げなどしていないと請け合いました。彼はインドネシアから帰ってきたところでした。私はコンピュータの前にいたので、Google Newsを調べ、この話が世界中で盛り上がっているのを知りました。彼が電話してきた理由は、彼が番組を作っており、誰かに頭蓋腔（頭蓋の内側のモデル）を作ってもらって、この生物の脳についてどういうことが分かるかを知ろうとしており、私が推薦されたからでした。彼は私がこの仕事をやる意思があるかどうか尋ねました。私は、もちろんやると答えました。これは、今までで私に起こった中でも一番の幸運の1つです。
--最終的にPNASで発表することになるこの研究を始めたとき、あなたの印象はどのようなものでしたか。
そうですね、当時ホビットのバーチャル頭蓋腔についての私たちの説明が議論を呼んでいました。一部の人は、その中には科学者も含まれていましたが、ホビットの標本は新種の代表ではなく、小頭症と呼ばれる症状のある人間だと考えました。このため、私たちはこの問題に取り組み、ホビットが小頭症であると主張している人たちに答えなくてはなりませんでした。そしてこれがこの論文の目的になっています。説得力を持たせるために、小頭症の人々の頭蓋を見て、それを一般の人の頭蓋と比べ、さらにホビットの頭蓋と比較する必要がありました。
--あなたはこの研究の技術的な側面を担っているのですね。あなたは脳のスキャン画像は見ていますが、明らかに発掘はしていませんね。この議論の多いホビットに関する研究を通じて、フィールドワークとコンピュータを使った分析の間の違いは何だと思いますか。
本当に重要なことは現場で起こります。Mike Morwood氏が率いるインドネシアのチームは、標本を持っています。その標本にはとてもよい頭蓋骨があったので、Mikeは骨格のCATスキャンを行うよう手配し、そのデータを私のチームにくれました。これはセントルイスにあるワシントン大学医学部のMallinckrodt放射線医学研究所で行われました。そこで働くエンジニアは、医学的なことをやって命を救う仕事をしていますが、そこに2人の人類学者がいます。

Bush Turns to Fear - Mongering
Creation of “ Islamic ” Bogeyman
The Bush administration obviously wishes it were waging war on Nazi Germany .
Even the old Soviet Union would be fine , these nostalgic Cold Warriors seem to think .
Something big and menacing that would scare the blue - haired grannies in Peoria into voting Republican because , everyone knows , in addition to being good for business ( except for that Depression unpleasantness ) , Republicans are mean s.o.b.’s and would as soon shoot a potential menace to the US as glare at him .
The Bush administration has the misfortune to have no powerful enemies it is brave enough actually to take on .
China and Russia are not exactly enemies any more , and are the only potential state challengers to United States freedom of action as the sole superpower .
And they do n’t go beyond potential .
Too busy making money while Washington bleeds itself dry with military adventures .
Waiting in the wings to pick up the pieces .
So what enemies does Bush see that he really will confront ?
Here they are :
1. North Korea .
2. Syria , population 19 million .
Poor , militarily weak .
Gross Domestic Product of $ 26 bn . [ I.e. nothing . ]
Minority ruling clique of Alawi Shiites ( think New Age California Shiism ) .
State ideology , secular Baath Socialist Arab Nationalism , an ideology founded by Arab Christians and which has nothing much to do with Islam .
Would make peace with Israel and the US in exchange for the return of the Golan Heights and an equitable resolution of the plight of the Palestinians .
2 . The 1.3 million Shiites of southern Lebanon and the slums of south Beirut ( or what used to be the slums of south Beirut ) , who largely support the Hizbullah Party - Militia .
No one had ever heard of them as a threat back in Eisenhower ’s era .
That is because they only organized a militia after the Israelis kept invading and brutally occupying them .
3 . The 6 million Sunni Arabs of north , central and western Iraq .
Many are secular Iraqi nationalists .
A handful are radical Sunni fundamentalists .
They had all been encompassed by the secular Iraqi Baath Party before Bush destroyed it .
4. Iran . Population 69 million .
GDP per capital $ 2,825 ( exchange rate method ) .
Only some 15 - 20 percent support their religious , populist government .
Weak air force and navy .
Iran has not launched a war on a neighbor since the late 1700s .
5. Pushtun guerrillas in southern Afghanistan who do n’t like foreign troops in their country
6 . Al - Qaeda and similar tiny terrorist organizations around the world , in Saudi Arabia , the UK , France , Algeria , Pakistan , India , etc .
Often consist of cells of 4 - 8 persons not in direct contact with traditional al - Qaeda .
Al - Qaeda is proven dangerous , and should be combatted by good police and counter - terrorism work .
But it is small and mostly disrupted or under surveillance .
If its ideology were so challenging to Bush , then he should shut up those videotapes by capturing Bin Laden and Zawahiri .
He has not done it .
This is n’t a coherent enemy , it is a laundry list of places Bush would like to control because they have oil or gas , or are key to its development , or have other strategic benefits for the US and / or its regional allies , especially Israel .
So Bush tried to unify the Bogeyman by condemning radical Sunni Islam and then equally condemning radical Shiite Islam .
It does n’t help with North Korea , and signally does not work for Syria or most Iraqi Sunnis .
Of course , it also raises questions as to why Wahhabi Saudi Arabia , the ideology of which is not traditionally so very different from that of the radical Sunni fundamentalists , is in with the good guys .
( I ’m not saying Wahhabis are dangerous , I ’m saying most Salafis are not . )
So too is the Shiite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq , which was formed by Ayatollah Khomeini , and the Iraqi Da’wa Party , which conducted terrorist attacks on US facilities and personnel in the 1980s .
Shiite Islamism in Iraq is good , the same thing in southern Lebanon is bad .
And then of course the United States has more friends among regimes ruling Muslim - majority populations than virtually any other set of governments in the world .
Egypt , Jordan , Bahrain are all non-NATO allies .
Turkey is a full NATO ally .
Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , Saudi Arabia , etc– all dear friends .
So Bush is basically saying that the US is threatened by a congeries of Middle Eastern movements and governments that have nothing to do with one another , and only one of which has struck directly at the US since Bush came to office .
Plus North Korea .
And this is the reason for which he needs to keep 140,000 troops in Iraq , to stop the Muslim fundamentalists from taking it over .
But of course , the Da’wa Party , the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the Sadr movement have * already * taken it over .
Nor is it plausible that “ al - Qaeda ” could take over Iraq !
The United States could n’t take over Iraq .
The Shiites and Kurds would never put up with it .
Bush does n’t need to stay in Iraq to fight al - Qaeda there .
If Bush were n’t in Iraq , neither would al - Qaeda be .
There less than 1,000 such foreign fighters , anyway .
So there are good Muslim fundamentalist movements and bad ones .
What seems to distinguish them is whether they are eager to do business with Houston or whether they badmouth Bush .
5,000 al - Qaeda members , probably no more than a few hundred of them actually dangerous to the United States , just cannot justify all Bush ’s aggressive policies .
So now , even while denying he has anything against Muslims , Bush is creating this “ Islamic Fascist ” bogeyman , which mostly is a figment of his fevered imagination , or is woefully imprecise as a way of describing the phenomenon , or lacks any real political power , or could be dealt with by containment and decisiveness ( remember the Soviet Union ) , or turns out to be some goatherds on the side of a hill in southern Lebanon .
If you want to know what is really going on , it is a struggle for control of the Strategic Ellipse , which just happens demographically to be mostly Muslim .
Bush has to demonize the Muslim world in order to justify his swooping down on the Strategic Ellipse .
If demons occupy it , obviously they have to be cleared out in favor of Christian fundamentalists or at least Texas oilmen .
And what is the Strategic Ellipse ?
Voila .
Bush did n’t do anything about al - Qaeda his first 8 months in office .
He left the job half done in Afghanistan and ran off to Iraq , which was always irrelevant to al - Qaeda .
There were no good targets in Afghanistan , just Bin Laden and Zawahiri .
Iraq , now that is prime Ellipse territory .
Bush is undermining our Republic , gutting our rights , spending us into penury , and smearing a great civilization , in order to get his grubby fingers on the Ellipse .
You get to pay for it twice , once at the pump and once on your annual tax return .
May 5th 2013 - Emuboards now closed
I have decided to close the emuboards forums as the site is no longer being actively updated .
Thanks to everyone for visiting emuboards.com over the past 11 years and to those visiting before the sites were merged ( gbaemu , zodicgamer etc ) a few years before that .
We are not totally off the internet , you can find us at http://www.gamergeddon.com/ and http://www.thesteamchamber.com/.
At least 50,000 Iraqis have died violently since the 2003 U.S. - led invasion , according to statistics from the Baghdad morgue , the Iraqi Health Ministry and other agencies -- a toll 20,000 higher than previously acknowledged by the Bush administration .
Many more Iraqis are believed to have been killed but not counted because of serious lapses in recording deaths in the chaotic first year after the invasion , when there was no functioning Iraqi government , and continued spotty reporting nationwide since .
The toll , which is mostly of civilians but probably also includes some security forces and insurgents , is daunting : Proportionately , it is equivalent to 570,000 Americans being killed nationwide in the last three years .
In the same period , at least 2,520 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq .

Iraqi officials involved in compiling the statistics say violent deaths in some regions have been grossly undercounted , notably in the troubled province of Al Anbar in the west .
Health workers there are unable to compile the data because of violence , security crackdowns , electrical shortages and failing telephone networks .
The Health Ministry acknowledged the undercount .
In addition , the ministry said its figures exclude the three northern provinces of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan because Kurdish officials do not provide death toll figures to the government in Baghdad .
In the three years since Saddam Hussein ’s regime was toppled , the Bush administration has rarely offered civilian death tolls .
Last year , President Bush said he believed that “ 30,000 , more or less , have died as a result of the initial incursion and the ongoing violence against Iraqis . ”
Nongovernmental organizations have made estimates by tallying media accounts ;
The Times attempted to reach a comprehensive figure by obtaining statistics from the Baghdad morgue and the Health Ministry and checking those numbers against a sampling of local health departments for possible undercounts .

The Health Ministry gathers numbers from hospitals in the capital and the outlying provinces .
If a victim of violence dies at a hospital or arrives dead , medical officials issue a death certificate .
Relatives claim the body directly from the hospital and arrange for a speedy burial in keeping with Muslim beliefs .
If the morgue receives a body -- usually those deemed suspicious deaths -- officials there issue the death certificate .
Health Ministry officials said that because death certificates are issued and counted separately , the two data sets are not overlapping .
The Baghdad morgue received 30,204 bodies from 2003 through mid-2006 , while the Health Ministry said it had documented 18,933 deaths from “ military clashes ” and “ terrorist attacks ” from April 5 , 2004 , to June 1 , 2006 .
Together , the toll reaches 49,137 .
Advertisement
However , samples obtained from local health departments in other provinces show an undercount that brings the total well beyond 50,000 .
The figure also does not include deaths outside Baghdad in the first year of the invasion .
The documented cases show a country descending further into violence .
At the Baghdad morgue , the vast majority of bodies processed had been shot execution - style .
Many showed signs of torture -- drill holes , burns , missing eyes and limbs , officials said .
Others had been strangled , beheaded , stabbed or beaten to death .
The morgue records show a predominantly civilian toll ; the hospital records gathered by the Health Ministry do not distinguish between civilians , combatants and security forces .
Advertisement
But Health Ministry records do differentiate causes of death .
Almost 75 % of those who died violently were killed in “ terrorist acts , ” typically bombings , the records show .
The other 25 % were killed in what were classified as military clashes .
A health official described the victims as “ innocent bystanders , ” many shot by Iraqi or American troops , in crossfire or accidentally at checkpoints .
With the entire country a battleground , it is likely that some of the dead may have been insurgents or members of militias .
“ The way to think about the violence is that it ’s not just the insurgent attacks that matter , ” said David Lake , a member of the Center for Study of Civil War , an international group of scholars who study the causes and effects of internal strife .
“ What we should be concerned about is the sense of security at the individual level ....
If the fear has gotten out of control . ”
Societies fall apart when people stop believing the government can keep them safe them and instead turn to militias for protection , said Lake , who is a professor of political science at UC San Diego .

“ The question is , have we crossed that threshold ?
My sense is , we probably have , and that ’s why I ’m worried about the long - term outcome . ”
Three years of fighting have taken their toll on the country .
Gauging how many people died in the first year after the invasion , which included the initial invasion and aerial bombardment of Baghdad , and weeks of near - anarchy afterward , has proved difficult .
According to a 2003
Times survey of Baghdad hospitals , at least 1,700 civilians died in the capital just in the five weeks after the war began .
An analysis by Iraqi Body Count , a nongovernmental group that tracks civilian deaths by tallying media reports , estimated that 5,630 to 10,000 Iraqi civilians were killed nationwide from March 19 through April 2003 .
Health Ministry figures for May in each of the last three years show war - related deaths more than tripling nationwide , from 334 in May 2004 to 1,154 last month .
And as the violence has continued to escalate , it also has become increasingly centralized .
At least 2,532 people were killed nationwide last month .
Of those , 2,155 -- 85 % -- died in Baghdad .
Advertisement
“ Everything has increased , ” said one official in the Health Ministry who did n’t want to be identified for security reasons .
“ Bombings have increased , shootings have increased . ”
Iraqi Body Count estimates that 38,475 to 42,889 Iraqis have been killed since the invasion .
The estimate does not include deaths among the Iraqi security forces .
The toll in Iraq has been a sensitive issue for the Bush administration , which has maintained that it does n’t track civilian deaths .
However , military officials in Baghdad acknowledged that they track the number of civilians accidentally killed by U.S. troops .
Eric Stover , Director of UC Berkeley ’s Human Rights Center and an expert on medical and social consequences of war , said that the high death toll makes rebuilding society increasingly difficult .
Advertisement
“ The way to look at the effects of deaths on that scale is also in the context of how people are living , ” said Stover , who has also done human rights work in Iraq and identified mass graves in Bosnia - Herzegovina .
“ It ’s not just the immediate deaths that people are dealing with , but fractured lives .
They are living in this constant state of fear .
It ’s a very gloomy picture . ”
Roug reported from Baghdad and Smith from Los Angeles .
Times staff writer Raheem Salman in Baghdad contributed to this report .

So you have a great idea that you want to turn into the Next Big Thing ?
Well , jump aboard the Web 2.0 bandwagon !
The momentum that ’s building behind web applications means there ’s never been a better time to start reaping the rewards of your hard work .
Wait !
Hard work ?
Not interested in hard work ?
Do n’t have the time to put in all those late nights fixing bugs and adding killer features ?
Then this article is for you .
We ’ll show you how to go from idea to well - funded application without writing any code at all .
Thought that all you had to do was add " Beta " to your product for it to be successful ?
Not true !
In today ’s climate it ’s possible to arrange first - round venture capital funding and get your flavour - of - the - month web app snapped up by Yahoo !
before you even reach beta .
We call this Getting Rich .
What is Getting Rich ?
Getting
Rich is the faster , easier way to make a killing from your hot web app without even writing the darn thing .
Getting Rich is about putting in place a faÃ§ade to lure in interested parties ( like investors ) , then skipping that annoying business of coding and testing .
Getting Rich is less .
Less meetings , less communication , less documentation , less features , less code , less bugs , less pesky customers , and less actual programming .
Getting Rich delivers nothing to your customers , and everything to your back pocket .
The Old Way
In the past , web entrepreneurs had to address a unique problem that needed solving , and carve out a niche for themselves by producing a usable , reliable , scalable application .
Many a good web app made use of rich interactivity but failed to gain momentum at the turn of the century because either :
the app was too client - heavy for an era when client processors could not keep up , or
the development team members failed to deliver regular communication to customers because they were too busy fixing bugs
However , that was then .
Today , the playing field is different from 5 years ago — the Web is entering a new era , and Getting Rich capitalizes on this .
Build Less
In fact , do n’t build anything at all .
There are just seven key things that you need to put in place to launch a successful Web 2.0 application , and none of them are the application itself .
The Seven Elements of a Successful Web 2.0 Application
For your app to be successful , you need to have the following seven elements in place .
1 . A hot idea :
While it does n’t necessarily need to be a problem that you can actually solve ( or , indeed , a problem that even needs solving ) , your idea does need to sound intriguing and utilize more than one technology buzz - word of the moment .
At a bare minimum , you must , without exception , include AJAX — even if your app uses the technique inappropriately .
Remember : your application will fail if AJAX does n’t get a mention .
There are plenty of other technologies that will also help your cause , including RSS , Microformats , SOAP and Ruby on Rails .
Luckily , there are several useful resources out there that might provide some inspiration to help you with this .
Ideally , try to incorporate the buzz - word into the name of the app .
This is an easy way to garner additional attention ( and hence traffic ) , especially if the advocates of that technology get wind of the fact that you are n’t even using it .
2 . A cool name :
If the name of your app is n’t short and catchy , it wo n’t take off .
Try recording yourself reading paragraphs from Geoffrey Chaucer ’s The Canterbury Tales , then play the audio backwards , slowly , for inspiration .
If you ’re still having difficulty deciding on a name , you could always choose from those of the Star Wars characters .
3 . A trendy site design :
This is a given .
All Web 2.0 applications sport a front - end with rounded corners , gradients , plenty of white space and a stand - out colour scheme .
Do n’t possess any design skills ?
No matter : you can follow step - by - step instructions or generate a layout that will suffice until you secure that first round of funding instead .
Your layout will change anyway once the app is bought out and rebranded , so there ’s no point in labouring over the finer points at this stage .
It ’s particularly helpful to add further bling to your site using one of the many JavaScript libraries now appearing on the scene — take your pick from Prototype , DoJo , script.aculo.us , FACE , AjaxTK , Moo.fx , and the Yahoo ! UI Library .
This might seem like a lot of effort just to achieve a distraction that ’s not dissimilar to the < blink > tag , but believe me , these libraries are worth it to give your site a real edge .
And do n’t forget to validate your site when you ’re done !
4 . A blog : Constant communication with your users is essential to distract them from your inability to deliver on the final product .
The informal nature of a blog means that you can wander off on tangents , like talking about how your 3 - month - old cocker spaniel buried your mobile phone under the tomato bushes in your backyard , and be forgiven instantly !
This personal touch will help you identify with your users and show them a human side to an otherwise faceless ( and feature - less ) application .
If you want to bring things back on track after a tangent , there are plenty of resources to help you keep the buzzwords flying .
Even better , produce a podcast which contains similar personal content , postulates on the future of the Web and how your product is bridging the gap between what today ’s users want and what your misguided competitors are delivering .
Make sure you brush up on those buzzwords before recording your session , though — they can be quite a mouthful .
5. Syndication :
Any web developer worth his or her salt will tell you that that the Web is moving from HTML to XML at a rapid pace .
By providing RSS and Atom feeds for your application , you automatically increase the window through which you can convince your customers that your web app is actually doing something .
If you ’re wondering what content you should include in these feeds , it does n’t matter .
Send a random flickr photo one day and a del.icio.us link the next , to create the illusion that multiple APIs are being aggregated in true Web 2.0 style .
RSS has n’t yet reached the point where users of the technology bother to unsubscribe from feeds that do n’t generate quality content , so this is still an untapped channel to reinforce the faÃ§ade .
Plus , you ’re in beta !
6 . A community focus :
In marketing copy , describe your app as being " social " software .
Use the buzz - words folksonomies and tag cloud , and emphasise how your app empowers its users to take control of their content to help win over any nay - sayers .
7 . An open API : Publish an API for your application to get developers interested in hooking into it .
Implementation of specific methods is n’t important at this stage ; just put a series of stub methods in place that return the value 42 .
Do n’t worry , they ’re geeks — they ’ll have read Douglas Adams , so they ’ll get the joke .
Not only will they forgive you , they ’ll like you even more for your subtle humour .
And if anyone complains , remind them that your app is still in beta .

There are lots of ways that you can create your own hype , but we ’ve narrowed down the field .
Here are the seven that we ’ve found most useful .
1. Jump straight to Private Beta stage :
Make access to the app invite - only , but do n’t actually invite anyone .
Nothing creates more desire for a product than its exclusivity .
If no - one has it , everyone will want it .
Simple !
2 . Talk about it on forums :
Start some threads on notable forums , posting screenshots and raving about the app and how it has become your number one must - have productivity booster .
Register multiple usernames and have discussions with yourself in your thread post .
Include dissenting points of view from people who then " receive their invite " and come around .
If you do n’t have the time to do this , pay someone to do it for you .
3. Graffiti : Stencil art is currently a popular form of graffiti in larger cities that for some reason is viewed as being creative and insightful rather than an eyesore , and has therefore gained acceptance as a form of public artwork .
Take advantage of this !
Spend your evenings spray - painting the walls of your local train station with the domain name of your app below a picture of a man in a gas mask .
It does n’t matter that the image has no correlation to your application — you ’re not writing the thing , anyway !
4. Manual blog comment spam : Spam notable blogs with links to your web app ( tip : try to tie your response into an intelligent response to the article you ’re spamming ) .
When the site owner sees that your domain does not contain any reference to teen sex or Viagra , they ’re likely to follow your link , just to see what all the fuss is about .
And when they arrive at your site and realize that they can’t login because it ’s in private beta , they ’ll start crawling the Web for more information about your app and forget all about how they found your site in the first place .
Utilize computers at public libraries if your home and work IP addresses get blocked as a result of this practice .
5. Submit articles : Write an article about the new ground your app breaks , and submit it to a technology magazine such as SitePoint .
The editors at sites like these are too busy editing print publications and attending big - name technology conferences to pay much attention to articles that are submitted to their online presences .
Often , you can slip any old content through to their front page without them even noticing !
6. Create a " Web 2.0 app review site " : Scrape content from TechCrunch ( paraphrased accordingly ) and subtly review your own application on the site .
Make it the third or fourth app that you review , so as to not attract too much attention .
7 . Enlist the help of a blogebrity : Ask an A - list blogger to review your app ( linking to your own " review " , so that you drive traffic to both your web app and the site that reviews it ) .
While it ’s unlikely that they ’ll do so without actually logging in and trying out your app for real , they might change their tune if you offer them some kind of incentive .
Send them some Photoshopped screenshots showing tag clouds and images of your app in use , and blame your data centre for the server being down — the perfect excuse for why they ca n’t login just now .
Then promise them 20 % of your profit when you sell the app to Yahoo !
Negotiate as required — everyone has their price .
The Organisation
Meetings are Toxic
There are loads of reasons why meetings are a hurdle to Getting Rich , especially if they involve your venture capital investors .
The more time you have to look them in the eye , the greater the chance that they are going to want to see some actual results .
Instead , take a leaf out of George Costanza ’s philosophy on productivity .
Give your investors every reason to think you ’re flat out — send them lots of email informing them of your hectic travel schedule , which involves meeting clients who are interested in deploying your app in their corporate intranet .
Reply to every one of their questions with three questions of your own .
Automate tasks on your computer to send investors an email with updates at 3:00 a.m. reporting on an obscure bug that you ’ve just found and fixed .
Constantly mail them links to — and faked quotes from — fictitious press releases containing glowing reviews on news sites that require the user to take out a paid subscription in order to view the article .
Sounds risky ?
Do n’t worry !
When the investors realize they have to pay to read the entire article , they wo n’t bother .
After all , they ’ve already sunk wads of cash into your " business " for absolutely no result .
They ’re not prepared to pony up another dime until they see a return .
Instead , they ’ll take the quote you provided as gospel , and spend the time they should have dedicated to researching your " organisation " praying for any kind of profit to result from this sham media coverage before the quarter ’s end .
Hire Less , Hire Later
In order to minimize cost , hesitate before bringing on any staff .
If you absolutely must bring someone on board , outsource the work to India .
There ’s certain to be someone there who will complete the task for less than the cost of your monthly broadband connection fee .
Be Agile in your Company Vision
In fact , there ’s no need to even have a vision .
If you ’ve executed your promotion strategy correctly , people wo n’t care what your application does — they ’ll be so dazzled by the flashy site and use of cutting - edge technologies that they ’ll forget that they ’ve never actually used the thing .
Not having a vision makes you more adaptable .
If you want to take your application in a different direction , you ’ll find it much easier to do so if you have n’t committed yourself to any particular path .
Document Nothing
When soliciting first - round funding , do n’t capture any paper trail of your dealings .
Also be sure to purge your email correspondence and your Recycle Bin regularly ( at least every few hours ) .
If things go belly - up , you want to be able to claim total ignorance .
( Do n ’t ) Build It And They Will Come
Once everything is set up and you ’ve initiated your promotion strategy , lick your lips and wait for the VC offers to start rolling in !
At this point , it may be wise to set up an account with one of the more ( dis ) reputable Swiss banks .
Successful entrepreneurs often find it beneficial to take out residency in Bermuda , to minimize the large amounts of tax they might otherwise pay on forthcoming cash injections .
Rinse and Repeat
Of course it ’s possible that your first attempt at Getting Rich may fail .
Take heart in the knowledge that while these principles are sound , not every entrepreneur possesses the business acumen to execute them successfully .
All that ’s left to do in such cases is start over — source a new idea , reinvent your web presence and , if necessary , your own identity in order to distance yourself from unhappy investors .
This should n’t be a problem assuming you have followed the advice in this article about never meeting them in the first place .
Conclusion
You , too , can be on the short - track to Web 2.0 billions without writing a shred of code .
In this article , we ’ve covered a foolproof strategy for constructing a faÃ§ade to secure the investment funds for failing to build a successful web application , which we call Getting Rich .
We explored how to put in place the Seven Elements of Highly Successful Web 2.0 Applications , and combine them with the Seven Facets of Highly Effective Promotion to drive traffic to your application .
In summary : Set it up and sell it off — implementation is for losers !

Senators to push for $ 100 gas rebate checks Under proposal , most U.S. taxpayers would get one From Dana Bash
CNN
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Oil and Gas Senate GOP or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Most American taxpayers would get $ 100 rebate checks to offset the pain of higher pump prices for gasoline , under an amendment Senate Republicans hope to bring to a vote soon .
However , the GOP energy package may face tough sledding because it also includes a controversial proposal to open part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration , which most Democrats and some moderate Republicans oppose .
Democrats are also expected to offer their own competing proposal , as members of both parties jockey for political position on the gas price issue .
( CNN.com readers offer solutions to the gas problem )
" Our plan would give taxpayers a hundred dollar gas tax holiday rebate check to help ease the pain that they 're feeling at the pump , " Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist announced Thursday .
" It also includes strong federal anti-price gouging protection to protect consumers against anti-competitive behavior by oil companies or other suppliers of gasoline .
Our free market system works , but it works best when there 's full accountability and full transparency . "
Frist said the rebates would go to single taxpayers making less than $ 125,000 per year , and couples making less than $ 150,000 .
Republican senators said they hoped soaring gas prices would inspire Democrats to support their proposals .
" A lot of these other things we 're talking about today , supply , like ANWR , have had Democrats oppose them in the past , when gas was $ 1.25 , $ 1.50 .
Gas is now $ 3 , " said John Thune , R - South Dakota .
" I would expect that there would be a lot more bipartisan support for proposals that would increase supply in this country . "
" We have been trying for years to do something about supply without their help .
I hope now that we 'll have their help , " he added .
But Democrats seemed unimpressed .
" It 's designed to protect Big Oil while mistakenly believing that drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will solve America 's energy problems , " Jim Manley , a spokesman for Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada , told The Associated Press .
The energy package , sponsored by Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa , Ted Stevens of Alaska , Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania , will be offered as an amendment to an emergency spending measure now before the Senate funding the Iraq war and hurricane relief , according to a senior GOP leadership aide .
Under Senate rules , either the GOP amendment or the Democratic alternative would probably need 60 votes to pass , which is considered unlikely .
However , the amendments would give senators a change to cast votes on measures designed to help constituents being hit by high gas prices .
As outlined by Frist and other GOP senators , the energy package would give taxpayers a $ 100 rebate , repeal tax incentives for oil companies and allow the Federal Trade Commission to prosecute retailers unlawfully inflating the price of gasoline .
The measure would also give the Transportation Department authority to issue fuel efficiency standards for passenger vehicles , expand tax incentives for the use of hybrid vehicles and push for more research into alternative fuels and expansion of existing oil refineries .
The GOP senators are also calling on the Bush administration to suspend deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for six months to increase the nation 's oil supply .
President Bush announced Tuesday that he would halt new deposits into the reserve until after the summer driving season .
( Full story )
On the other side of the aisle , Democrats on Wednesday called for a new energy bill and federal legislation to punish price gougers .
" There 's no reason why we can't put forth a real energy policy that addresses the needs of this nation , " said Rep. Bart Stupak , a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , " from gouging to market manipulation to biofuels .
We can do it . "
( Full story )
And leaders of the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday asked the Internal Revenue Service to let them examine the tax returns of the nation 's 15 largest oil and gas companies , as part of a " comprehensive review " of oil industry profits .
" I want to make sure the oil companies are n't taking a speed pass by the tax man , " said Grassley , the committee 's chairman , in a written statement .

He did n't judge her .
The Jesus I follow said a lot about the old laws being wiped away and being replaced by one simple law - love each other as I have loved you .
I am a Christian and find it ironic that its difficult to find a Christian church that represents my values .
The Jesus I follow would be more concerned with figuring out how the richest country on earth could help it 's southern neighbor - where people are living like animals - than how much tax money is being spent on " illegals " .
I do n't think my Jesus would call anyone " illegal " .
My Jesus spent much of his life in the company of those socieity found unfit .
I believe my Jesus would have loved gays as much as hetrosexuals .
I do n't think my Jesus would lobby for a constitutional amendment that legalizes descrimination against them .

I 'm an American , but am embarased to fly my flag .
I wish the symbols of my faith and country represented what I believe .
Once they did .
I used to wear a cross around my neck .
I used to have a flag on my house .
Now people who represent values that I find very non-christ like have taken ownership of what theses symbols represent .
I hope there are others who believe what I believe .
I hope there are others who feel like I do .
I hope that one day we can do Christian work that matters - helping the poor , healing the sick , protecting the earth - and stop fighting about things that are simply devisive ploys politicians use to get our votes .

In this issue :
You see them all the time : “ Company X offers $ 1,000,000 to anyone who can break through their firewall / crack their algorithm / make a fraudulent transaction using their protocol / do whatever . ”
These are cracking contests , and they ’re supposed to show how strong and secure the target of the contests are .
The logic goes something like this :
We offered a prize to break the target , and no one did .
This means that the target is secure .
It does n’t .
Contests are a terrible way to demonstrate security .
A product / system / protocol / algorithm that has survived a contest unbroken is not obviously more trustworthy than one that has not been the subject of a contest .
The best products / systems / protocols / algorithms available today have not been the subjects of any contests , and probably never will be .
Contests generally do n’t produce useful data .
There are three basic reasons why this is so .
1 . The contests are generally unfair .
Cryptanalysis assumes that the attacker knows everything except the secret .
He has access to the algorithms and protocols , the source code , everything .
He knows the ciphertext and the plaintext .
He may even know something about the key .
And a cryptanalytic result can be anything .
It can be a complete break : a result that breaks the security in a reasonable amount of time .
It can be a theoretical break : a result that does n’t work “ operationally , ” but still shows that the security is n’t as good as advertised .
It can be anything in between .
Most cryptanalysis contests have arbitrary rules .
They define what the attacker has to work with , and how a successful break looks .
Jaws Technologies provided a ciphertext file and , without explaining how their algorithm worked , offered a prize to anyone who could recover the plaintext .
This is n’t how real cryptanalysis works ; if no one wins the contest , it means nothing .
Most contests do n’t disclose the algorithm .
And since most cryptanalysts do n’t have the skills for reverse - engineering ( I find it tedious and boring ) , they never bother analyzing the systems .
This is why COMP128 , CMEA , ORYX , the Firewire cipher , the DVD cipher , and the Netscape PRNG were all broken within months of their disclosure ( despite the fact that some of them have been widely deployed for many years ) ; once the algorithm is revealed , it ’s easy to see the flaw , but it might take years before someone bothers to reverse - engineer the algorithm and publish it .
Contests do n’t help .
( Of course , the above paragraph does not hold true for the military .
There are countless examples successful reverse - engineering –VENONA , PURPLE –in the “ real ” world .
But the academic world does n’t work that way , fortunately or unfortunately . )
Unfair contests are n’t new .
Back in the mid-1980s , the authors of an encryption algorithm called FEAL issued a contest .
They provided a ciphertext file , and offered a prize to the first person to recover the plaintext .
The algorithm has been repeatedly broken by cryptographers , through differential and then linear cryptanalysis and by other statistical attacks .
Everyone agrees that the algorithm was badly flawed .
Still , no one won the contest .
2 . The analysis is not controlled .
Contests are random tests .
Do ten people , each working 100 hours to win the contest , count as 1000 hours of analysis ?
Or did they all try the same things ?
Are they even competent analysts , or are they just random people who heard about the contest and wanted to try their luck ?
Just because no one wins a contest does n’t mean the target is secure … it just means that no one won .
3. Contest prizes are rarely good incentives .
Cryptanalysis of an algorithm , protocol , or system can be a lot of work .
People who are good at it are going to do the work for a variety of reasons–money , prestige , boredom–but trying to win a contest is rarely one of them .
Contests are viewed in the community with skepticism : most companies that sponsor contests are not known , and people do n’t believe that they will judge the results fairly .
And trying to win a contest is no sure thing : someone could beat you , leaving you nothing to show for your efforts .
Cryptanalysts are much better off analyzing systems where they are being paid for their analysis work , or systems for which they can publish a paper explaining their results .
Just look at the economics .
Taken at a conservative $ 125 an hour for a competent cryptanalyst , a $ 10 K prize pays for two weeks of work , not enough time to even dig through the code .
A $ 100 K prize might be worth a look , but reverse - engineering the product is boring and that ’s still not enough time to do a thorough job .
A prize of $ 1 M starts to become interesting , but most companies ca n’t afford to offer that .
And the cryptanalyst has no guarantee of getting paid : he may not find anything , he may get beaten to the attack and lose out to someone else , or the company might not even pay .
Why should a cryptanalyst donate his time ( and good name ) to the company ’s publicity campaign ?
Cryptanalysis contests are generally nothing more than a publicity tool .
Sponsoring a contest , even a fair one , is no guarantee that people will analyze the target .
Surviving a contest is no guarantee that there are no flaws in the target .
The true measure of trustworthiness is how much analysis has been done , not whether there was a contest .
And analysis is a slow and painful process .
People trust cryptographic algorithms ( DES , RSA ) , protocols ( Kerberos ) , and systems ( PGP , IPSec ) not because of contests , but because all have been subjected to years ( decades , even ) of peer review and analysis .
And they have been analyzed not because of some elusive prize , but because they were either interesting or widely deployed .
The analysis of the fifteen AES candidates is going to take several years .
There is n’t a prize in the world that ’s going to make the best cryptanalysts drop what they ’re doing and examine the offerings of Meganet Corporation or RPK Security Inc. , two companies that recently offered cracking prizes .
It ’s much more interesting to find flaws in Java , or Windows NT , or cellular telephone security .
The above three reasons are generalizations .
There are exceptions , but they are few and far between .
The RSA challenges , both their factoring challenges and their symmetric brute - force challenges , are fair and good contests .
These contests are successful not because the prize money is an incentive to factor numbers or build brute - force cracking machines , but because researchers are already interested in factoring and brute - force cracking .
The contests simply provide a spotlight for what was already an interesting endeavor .
The AES contest , although more a competition than a cryptanalysis contest , is also fair .
Our Twofish cryptanalysis contest offers a $ 10 K prize for the best negative comments on Twofish that are n’t written by the authors .
There are no arbitrary definitions of what a winning analysis is .
There is no ciphertext to break or keys to recover .
We are simply rewarding the most successful cryptanalysis research result , whatever it may be and however successful it is ( or is not ) .
Again , the contest is fair because 1 ) the algorithm is completely specified , 2 ) there are no arbitrary definition of what winning means , and 3 ) the algorithm is public domain .
Contests , if implemented correctly , can provide useful information and reward particular areas of research .
But they are not useful metrics to judge security .
I can offer $ 10 K to the first person who successfully breaks into my home and steals a book off my shelf .
If no one does so before the contest ends , that does n’t mean my home is secure .
Maybe no one with any burgling ability heard about my contest .
Maybe they were too busy doing other things .
Maybe they were n’t able to break into my home , but they figured out how to forge the real - estate title to put the property in their name .
Maybe they did break into my home , but took a look around and decided to come back when there was something more valuable than a $ 10,000 prize at stake .
The contest proved nothing .

Matt Blaze has too , but I can’t find a good URL .
A brute - force cracking machine tries every possible key until it finds the right one .
If the machine has a chunk of ciphertext and decrypts it with one key after the other , how does it know when it found the correct plaintext ?
It seems obvious to me , but I get this question often enough to address it in these pages .
The machine knows that it found the plaintext because it looks like plaintext .
Plaintext tends to look like plaintext .
It ’s an English - language message , or a data file from a computer application ( programs like Microsoft Word have large known headers ; even PK - ZIP files have known headers ) , or a database in a reasonable format .
When you look at a decrypted file , it looks like something understandable .
When you look at a ciphertext file , or a file decrypted with the wrong key , it looks like gibberish .
In the 1940s , Claude Shannon invented a concept called the unicity distance .
Among other things , the unicity distance measures the amount of ciphertext required such that there is only one reasonable plaintext .
This number depends both on the characteristics of the plaintext and the key length of the encryption algorithm .
For example , RC4 encrypts data in bytes .
Imagine a single ASCII letter as plaintext .
There are 26 possible plaintexts out of 256 possible decryptions .
Any random key , when used to decrypt the ciphertext , has a 26/256 chance of producing a valid plaintext .
The analyst has no way to tell the wrong plaintext from the correct plaintext .
Now imagine a 1 K e-mail message .
The analyst tries random keys , and eventually a plaintext emerges that looks like an e-mail message : words , phrases , sentences , grammar .
The odds are infinitesimal that this is not the correct plaintext .
Everything else is in the middle .
The unicity distance determines when you can think like the second example instead of the first .
For a standard English message , the unicity distance is K / 6.8 , where K is the key length .
( The 6.8 is a measure of the redundancy of English in ASCII .
For other plaintexts it will be more or less , but not that much more or less . )
For DES , the unicity distance is 8.2 bytes .
For 128 - bit ciphers , it is about 19 bytes .
This means that if you are trying to brute - force DES you need two ciphertext blocks .
( DES ’s block length is 8 bytes . )
Decrypt the first ciphertext block with one key after another .
If the resulting plaintext looks like English , then decrypt the second block with the same key .
If the second plaintext block also looks like English , you ’ve found the correct key .
The unicity distance grows as the redundancy of the plaintext shrinks .
For compressed files , the redundancy might be 2.5 , or three blocks of DES ciphertext .
For a 256 - bit - key cipher , that would be 105 plaintext bytes .
If the plaintext is a random key , the redundancy is zero and the unicity distance reaches infinity : it is impossible to recognize the correct plaintext from an incorrect plaintext .
But that ’s a special case .
Most of the time , it is easy to recognize plaintext .
Okay , I finally got the story right about Network Associates Inc. and the Key Recovery Alliance .
( Last month I pointed to a Wired News story that they quietly rejoined . )
The story is wrong .
They never left the KRA .
Since its inception , Trusted Information Systems was a big mover and shaker in the KRA .
When NAI bought TIS in May 1998 , TIS ’s membership transferred to NAI .
NAI resigned the leadership posts that TIS had held in the Alliance and stopped attending its meetings , but never left the KRA .
So , NAI is a member of the KRA , and has been since it bought TIS .

The Clinton Administration is n’t satisfied with trying to destroy personal privacy in the U.S. ; for years they ’ve been taking their arguments abroad .
Now , according to the administration , the 33 Wassenaar Arrangement signatories have agreed to implement the same bizarre export controls on mass market encryption software as the U.S. has .
Now I do n’t know if this is true –the administration has lied before about the international reception of its policies –but if it is , it ’s a major step backwards .
I ’m not sure why the administration believes that making sure that sensitive information is encrypted poorly so that criminals can read it will help the world , but I ’m sure they ’ve got it figured out .

The following instructions describe a hack around the read / write protection on IOMEGA ZIP - 100 disks .
This is n’t my work ; I received it anonymously .
If anyone knows who discovered this , please have him or her contact me .
The password protection feature involves having a password and security flag stored on the ZIP disk ( in the boot sector ? ) .
This password and security status are read by the firmware in the ZIP drive and it refuses to allow access to a disk it believes to be read / write protected .
The ZIP drive supports a “ power down ” feature that literally stops the drive spinning ( and parks the drive ’s read / write head ? ) after 15 minutes of inactivity .
Drives automatically restart as needed .
The firmware does not currently ( 28 May 1998 ) notice a disk change via the manual disk eject hole on the back of the device .
If , after spin - down , a known protected disk is manually ejected and a different protected disk is then inserted , the password for the first disk is still considered current by the firmware , and is thus valid for the second disk .
The second disk can then be “ unprotected ” by using the password of the first disk .
To implement this hack , perform the following steps :
You need a new blank ZIP - 100 disk .
Call this disk the KNOWN disk .
Insert the KNOWN disk into the ZIP drive .
Give the KNOWN disk a read / write password using the IOMEGA toolset .
Remember the password .
Using the IOMEGA toolset startup preferences , set the SLEEP TIME of the ZIP drive to 1 minute .
Let the drive , with the KNOWN disk still inserted , spin down .
( You can hear the obvious difference in noise output . )
Take an unfolded paper clip .
Poke it into the small hole at the back of the ZIP drive , and manually eject the KNOWN disk .
( The hole is located at the back of the drive casing above the printer or second SCSI connector . )
Insert the UNKNOWN disk .
The drive may spin up to speed again or may remain silent .
Using the IOMEGA toolset , REMOVE the protection on this disk .
Use the KNOWN PASSWORD from step ( 3 ) above .
Using the normal eject button on the front of the device , eject the UNKNOWN disk .
Reinsert the UNKNOWN disk a second time ( to prepare for directory and file access ) .
Double - click on the disk drive icon in your Explorer / File Manager window .
Done .
There is another Twofish technical report ( # 3 ) on the website .
This one is called “ Improved Twofish Implementations , ” and gives better performance numbers for 32 - bit computers , smart cards , and hardware .
http://www.schneier.com/paper-twofish-speed.html
There is also a Twofish implementation in Delphi :
http://www.scramdisk.clara.net/d_crypto.html
And finally , we have published a paper that compares the performance of all fifteen AES candidates on 32 - bit processors , smart cards , and hardware .
http://www.schneier.com/paper-aes-performance.html
The Technical Advisory Committee to Develop a Federal Information Processing Standard for the Federal Key Management Infrastructure was established by the Department of Commerce in July 1996 .
The Committee , which was formally chartered on July 24 , 1996 , held its first meeting on December 5 - 6 , 1996 .
The goal , near as I can tell , was to get industry to agree on rules for key recovery .
Its final meeting was held November 17 - 19 , 1998 .
The meeting was more of a fizzle than a finale .
Although the committee concluded all of its work , their final document continues to undergo editing and will continue to do so for the next several weeks .
The document is far more coherent than it was at the end of their June “ finale ” ; however , it has still not been thoroughly reviewed .
Here are some points which may be of interest .
Although it may be described as such , the committee ’s final document was hardly the product of “ a 22 - member commission . ”
Participation dwindled to such an extent that members who were not present at the final meeting were asked to resign so that a quorum could be achieved .
By the end of the final meeting , the fewer than half a dozen remaining participants were still making substantive changes to the document .
Changes continued to be made by the chair and other individuals even after the conclusion of the committee ’s final meeting .
The commission did not “ conclude ” anything .
The committee never voted on or addressed any issues about whether key recovery made sense , where it could / should be deployed , or even if it is possible , safe , or makes economic sense .
The commission did not make any recommendations .
The work of the committee is a matter of public record and will presumably be continued by NIST .
However , the committee did not recommend that its work go forward .
The document produced by the committee does not give a blueprint for how to do key recovery .
It lists over two hundred things that key recovery products should and should not do without ever saying how to do them .
There is no reason to believe that the committee ’s document is consistent or complete .
As an example , most of the document ’s 200 + requirements are contained in a section that was completely rewritten by a single member shortly before the final meeting .
During the last day of the final meeting and before this section had been reviewed by what remained of the committee , this individual left saying that since the group had already dropped below quorum , his presence was no longer necessary .
The section was later reviewed only superficially by the few remaining members .
The document was written at least as much by NIST and NSA as by the committee .
Although the only voting members of the committee were from the private sector , this was certainly not a product of ( or at the initiative of ) the private sector .

You write about Canada ’s new crypto policy .
However , the new policy is not , as you have described , about “ export policy , ” but about domestic policy .
This is about cryptography in Canada .
My understanding is that Canada will continue to abide by the Wassenaar Arrangement , which currently limits the export of strong encryption .

I read every issue of the CRYPTO - GRAM with great interest .
If I may as a simple subscriber be permitted an observation , I would say that there is a great need to learn from the warning in the above paragraph .
But what principles should be adopted to guard against the danger which is predicted ?
My criterion is simplicity .
Discard the complex algorithms which at every convolution open a crack through which their inner working may be examined exhaustively without limit of time .
Choose instead a simple system which has unique parameters for every two stations desiring to intercommunicate and for every message passed , which publishes no keys and which has no association whatever with a third party .
From Illuminatus Primus < vermont@gate.net >:
I see that the main reason automation poses a new risk is because the system increasingly depends on dumb ( comparatively speaking ) components , rather than humans .
A small , isolated program will usually not recognize when cash flow trends suddenly change because small , isolated programs will not teach themselves how to recognize fraud .
However , humans sometimes unreasonably expect them to .
The cure is for more people to spend the time translating warning systems that humans are accustomed to into machine - friendly language .
For example , Visa warns me every time a sharp change in my spending patterns is noticed .
It ’s almost like I have a friendly banker keeping a watch over my money , but in reality it ’s just a few checks completed in a fraction of a second by a computer somewhere .
Automation also brings a great benefit : new holes in the system can be squashed in very little time .
Centralized systems benefit the moment that the hole is repaired , and decentralized systems benefit the moment that the fix propagates .
I think a good argument could be made about how the current human - dependent systems might actually be worse off than the digital ones .
For example , look at the problems involved with introducing new US currency to stop counterfeiting .
Humans often times can take longer to adapt to a new situation than the time it takes to transmit a new piece of authentication code across the world millions of times .
Perhaps there is a larger issue underneath all of this : the need for individual nodes to become more intelligent .
If my credit card was actually a small terminal that allowed me to clear requests to charge to it , perhaps fraud against my card would be more difficult to accomplish .
Perhaps if cars had meters at the gasoline intake , gas stations could n’t fraudulently overcharge people so easily .
And perhaps , if merchants exchanged digital money instead of paper money , counterfeiting would n’t take decades to stamp out .

In a city famous for its views , the one from the observation tower of the year - old De Young Museum is among the best , stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the distant Berkeley hills .
Though most of the visitors are too busy snapping blurry cellphone pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge to notice , it ’s also an unusually good place to consider one of the most dramatic shifts to hit the architecture world in decades : the growing prominence of the roof -- and , perhaps more important , the top - down perspective that exposes it to view -- in the design of buildings , neighborhoods and even whole cities .
Thanks in part to the surging popularity of Google Earth and other Web - based programs , which give the public a bracingly new , if detached , way to interact with the built environment , rooftops are shedding their reputation as forgotten , wind - swept corners of the urban landscape and moving toward the center of architectural practice .
The nascent rooftop revival is visible in three very different forms from the De Young tower .
Looking straight down you can see the roof of the museum ’s main wing , which is covered in long , thin skylights and the same copper panels that wrap the rest of the museum .
Knowing it would unfurl prominently beneath the tower , the De Young ’s Swiss architects , Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron , gave the roof extra attention .

Directly to the south is the site of the new $ 429 - million home for the California Academy of Sciences , designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano .
When it ’s finished in 2008 , the academy will be topped by an undulating , 2.5 - acre green roof , planted with wildflowers and other native species -- a remarkable piece of landscape architecture lifted 35 feet into the air .
Turning away from the windows , finally , you encounter a huge satellite photograph of San Francisco , picked specifically by Herzog and De Meuron and covering an entire wall .
At the center of the image is a copper - colored speck : the museum .
The photograph offers a wry twist on the idea of the observation tower in an age of digital technology and pervasive surveillance -- a reminder that while you are looking down on the world , the world is also looking down on you .
Thanks to a flurry of interest in the top - down view , architecture is full of such moments these days .
Environmentally minded firms are making dramatic use of green roofs like the one Piano developed in San Francisco , which can help insulate buildings and reduce polluted storm runoff .
And in many of the world ’s biggest cities , increasing density means occupants of one building are more likely than ever to look down on another .
The pair of towers Frank Gehry is designing on Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles will overlook not only new retail pavilions but also the architect ’s Walt Disney Concert Hall across the street .

“ It ’s an issue in Brooklyn too , ” Gehry said , referring to his design for the $ 4.2 - billion Atlantic
Yards development , which will include more than a dozen tightly packed towers .
And then there ’s Google Earth .
Using satellite images and aerial photographs , the program and its competitors , including Microsoft ’s Virtual Earth and Live Local , have enabled a new kind of architectural tourism , allowing Web surfers to zoom around the globe to see how buildings by Santiago Calatrava or their own houses look from above .
According to Google Earth director John Hanke , more than 100 million people have downloaded the free program since its April 2005 debut .
“ Our idea has been to democratize access to views of the places where people live and work , ” Hanke said .
The program , developed by a small Silicon Valley firm called Keyhole that Google acquired two years ago , remains a work in progress .
Only a third of the world ’s cities are shown in high - resolution imagery , and a number , including Los Angeles , are represented by clearly outdated views .
But if you view the images of a city that has been updated recently , such as London , the images are startlingly crisp .

The forgotten facade
To tour a typical American downtown with Google Earth is to see a collection of roofs that either sit forlornly empty or are littered with rusting mechanical equipment -- a lack of architectural attention that can be traced to the rise of the Modern movement a century ago .
Modernist dogma , by insisting that roofs be flat , robbed urban buildings of the handsome ornament and geometric forms that grace the top of New York ’s Chrysler Building , L.A. 's Central Library and other landmarks .
The irony of that development is that many Modernist architects were obsessed with the roof and what to do with it .
The Swiss - born architect Le Corbusier , in fact , wrote extensively about the potential of the rooftop as a building ’s “ fifth facade . ”
New York , Chicago and other crowded cities have grown more aggressive in exploiting that underutilized space ; even Los Angeles has a few popular rooftop spots , such as the Standard hotel downtown .
But the shift now emerging will have ramifications far beyond the addition of a penthouse bar or pool .

In his design for the 1,300 - acre Orange County Great Park , New York landscape architect Ken Smith included a giant helium balloon , painted bright orange , that will lift two dozen visitors at a time 500 feet into the air .
The balloon is meant to act as a visual icon for the park , visible from nearby streets and freeways .
It will also give its passengers a sprawling view of how the park is laid out -- in essence , allowing them to look down on a design blueprint at full scale .
Smith worked with similar themes in a design for a new rooftop garden at the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
When the garden opened early last year , some were surprised to discover not only that it was composed entirely of synthetic materials , including plastic rocks and rubber mulch , but also that it was inaccessible to museum visitors and even staff .
But those groups were n’t the intended audience .
The garden was designed almost entirely for the benefit of the residents of the high - rise condo towers that surround and overlook the museum .
“ From the beginning , we thought of it strictly as a top - down design , ” Smith said .

Architects say the influence of the bird ’s - eye view seems to grow by the week .
Clients arrive for preliminary meetings having studied overhead views of their building sites on the Internet .
And if you sit in on thesis reviews at an architecture school these days , chances are quite good that a student presentation will begin with an image from Google Earth or another online source .
Earlier this year , Google bought a design program called SketchUp and incorporated it into Google Earth , allowing architects to move quickly from an overhead photograph of a building to a three - dimensional digital rendering of it .
“ My students use Google Earth obsessively , especially now that it includes SketchUp , ” said Paul Preissner , a Chicago architect who is teaching this fall at the University of Nebraska .
Prominent structures have long been seen from the air :
Think of the blimps that hover over college football stadiums on Saturday afternoons .
And Los Angeles is familiar with the bird ’s - eye perspective of a televised police chase .
Thanks to the Web , the public can now bring the same kind of scrutiny to almost any building at any time .
Advertisement
There is a significant political dimension to that shift .
The overhead view has always been synonymous with power .
Indeed , many satellite images in Google Earth were once available only to government agencies .
“ For me , Google Earth is revolutionary in that sense , ” said Enrique Norten , a Mexican - born architect based in New York .
“ Even a year or two ago , it was a huge problem just to get a single aerial photograph for a site .
And you had to pay for it . ”
But there are reasons to be less sanguine about the implications for architecture and urbanism .
Precisely because it is so easy to use , Google Earth suggests a kind of access to cities that ca n’t be matched in the real world , especially after the attacks of Sept. 11 .
It may tempt architects to play to their growing virtual audience at the expense of a building ’s day - to - day users , creating new architectural icons designed to look striking not from the sidewalk but from above , on a computer screen .
And the technology may promote a false sense that cities are somehow knowable at a glance .
The power of that illusion has become clear on cable news programs , whose anchors use satellite imagery to zoom in , godlike , on the site of a story .

Top - down design
Some designers and planners are already combining iconic design and the top - down view .
Dubai , in the United Arab Emirates , has dredged up huge swaths of its waterfront to make room for luxury housing developments .
Among the best known is the Palm Jumeirah , a man -made island that fans out into the Persian Gulf .
Seen from the air , it makes up a palm - frond pattern that has become a de facto logo for a newly ambitious Dubai .
The Dutch landscape architecture firm West 8 won a competition this summer for Toronto ’s waterfront with a plan calling for a floating island in the form of a maple leaf -- a graphic element borrowed from the Canadian flag -- that will be visible from the top of the nearby CN Tower .
Such projects herald the emergence of a new , hybrid brand of urban planning , one that mixes elements of highly marketable , camera - ready design , earthworks ( such as Robert Smithson ’s Spiral Jetty in Utah ) and the perspective made possible by Google Earth .
Advertisement
It ’s difficult to ignore the fact that the approach to design that works best in that framework is muscular and grandly scaled .
Santa Monica architect Thom Mayne ’s recent proposal for a state park at the so - called Cornfield site near downtown L.A. , a deliberately provocative plan created with the landscape firm Field Operations , calls for a new Dodger Stadium on the edge of Chinatown and housing on the stadium parking lot .
The design team ’s overhead renderings only furthered the sense that Mayne was moving around huge chunks of the city like chess pieces .
In beginning to grapple with the effects of technology on the design world , architects have fixated on the fluid , “ blobby ” shapes made possible by powerful software .
But Google Earth suggests the most significant result of the marriage between architecture and computer power has to do with perspective rather than form .
What ’s changing most radically , in other words , is not how buildings look but how we look at buildings .

Believe it or not , the difference in the way the Democrats and Republicans react to the performance of the U.S. economy is clarified by a mathematical distinction studied in elementary school .
The distinction is between the mean , which the Republicans emphasize , while the Democrats prefer the median .
Before turning to the economy , let me review a little fourth - grade arithmetic .
The Mean and the Median
The mean of a set of numbers is simply the average , and it is obtained by adding the numbers in the set and dividing by how many there are .
The median of a set of numbers is obtained by listing the numbers in the set in ascending order and locating the middle number in the list .
The same set of numbers can have a mean and a median , which differ significantly .
A real estate agent , for example , informs you that the mean price for a house in a certain neighborhood is $ 500,000 and implies that there are many houses above that price in the neighborhood .
Not necessarily .
If most of the houses sell for somewhere between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 , and there are a few multimillion dollar mega-mansions , the mean price of a house in the neighborhood might well be $ 500,000 , even if the median is , say , $ 160,000 .
Or a salesman tells you that the median commission on the nine sales he made that week is $ 80 and suggests that he therefore made $ 720 on these sales .
Maybe , but he could have made millions of dollars on these sales if one of the sales was enormous , or he might have made little more than $ 400 if four of the sales were near $ 0 and the other five were $ 80 or slightly more .
The Economy
The relevance of this distinction is apparent in the just - released figures on the U.S. economy for 2004 , the latest year for which there is complete data .
The Republicans chortle that the economy grew at a healthy rate of 4.2 percent .
( It 's slowed since then . )
The Democrats point to data from the Census Bureau for the same year ( and earlier as well ) , indicating that the real median family income fell and that poverty increased .
Economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez , who have long studied income distribution , have recently looked at the data and calculated that during this one - year period the real incomes of the richest 1 percent , those making at least $ 315,000 annually , grew by almost 17 percent .
Furthermore , this growth in income not only eluded the lower - and middle - income classes , but by and large passed up the upper middle class as well .
The income increases of even those whose incomes were greater than 95 percent of other Americans were quite minimal .
The huge increases in income went to those with already huge incomes .
In fact , half of the increased income going to the top 1 percent of households went to the top tenth of the top 1 percent !
And the minimum wage ?
The lowest in real terms that it 's been since the 1950s .
And the income of the typical college graduate ?
Down in 2004 .
This rich - get - richer dynamic is not something new .
The flocking tendency of Internet surfers , vacation motorists , market investors , as well as a host of physical , social and financial measures suggest a general phenomenon , usually described by what are called power laws in mathematics .
Along various social dimensions , the dynamics underlying these laws may lead naturally to the development of stark inequalities , which increasingly seem to reign not just here but throughout the world .
The United Nations issued a report a few years ago , for example , saying the net worth of the world 's three richest families -- the Gateses , the Sultan of Brunei and the Waltons of Wal - Mart -- exceeded the gross domestic product of the 43 poorest nations .
Philosophy and a Little Game
Still , this lopsidedness is neither necessary nor inevitable , and it bodes ill for civil society .
Almost 2,400 years ago Aristotle , seeing the discord between ancient Greece 's rich and poor , applied his idea of the golden mean to call for an equitable ( but not equal ) income distribution .
For purposes of stability , he favored establishing a strong middle class and government policies to assist in this establishment .
A little game from the field of behavioral finance illustrates the class resentment Aristotle described .
The so - called " ultimatum game " generally involves two players :
One is given a certain amount of money , say $ 100 , by an experimenter , and the other is given a kind of veto .
The first player may offer any nonzero fraction of the $ 100 to the second player , who can either accept or reject it .
If he accepts it , he is given whatever amount the first player has offered , and the first player keeps the balance .
If he rejects it , the experimenter takes the money back .
Viewing this in rational game - theoretic terms , one would argue that it's in the interest of the second player to accept whatever is offered , since any amount , no matter how small , is better than nothing .
This is not what happens , however .
The offers generally range from 5 percent to 50 percent of the money involved , but , when deemed too small , the offers are often rejected .
Better to receive nothing , the resentful rejectors say , than to be humiliated .
Notions of fairness and equity , as well as anger and revenge , seem to play a role .
Almost as if on cue , just as I finished writing this , the House passed a modest minimum wage bill but typically linked it to a significant cut in the estate tax .
Once again , one for you , 10 for me .
( It seems the bill will not make it through the Senate , however . )
So was Aristotle a card - carrying Democrat ?
No .
I think he was just expressing some increasingly uncommon common sense .
It 's mean to ignore the median .
Professor of mathematics at Temple University , John Allen Paulos has written such best - sellers as " Innumeracy " and " A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market . "
His " Who 's Counting ? " column on ABCNEWS.com appears the first weekend of every month .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 10 — By stepping up the American military presence in Iraq , President Bush is not only inviting an epic clash with the Democrats who run Capitol Hill .
He is ignoring the results of the November elections , rejecting the central thrust of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and flouting the advice of some of his own generals , as well as Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki of Iraq .
In so doing , Mr. Bush is taking a calculated gamble that no matter how much hue and cry his new strategy may provoke , in the end the American people will give him more time to turn around the war in Iraq and Congress will not have the political nerve to thwart him by cutting off money for the war .
The plan , outlined by the president in stark , simple tones in a 20 - minute speech from the White House library , is vintage George Bush — in the eyes of admirers , resolute and principled ; in the eyes of critics , bull - headed , even delusional , about the prospects for success in Iraq .
It is the latest evidence that the president is convinced that he is right and that history will vindicate him , even if that vindication comes long after he is gone from the Oval Office .
Mr. Bush long ago staked his presidency on Iraq , and to the extent he can salvage the war he can also salvage the remaining two years of his administration .
So he is taking a risk , challenging not only the Democratic leadership in Congress but also some members of his own party , who are openly skeptical that the new policy will work and who , unlike the president , will be running for re-election .
For families , it can be a long , emotional adjustment .
Shortly after her son ’s third birthday , Pam B. and her husband , Joel , began a parental journey for which there was no map .
It started when their son , J. , began wearing oversized T - shirts and wrapping a towel around his head to emulate long , flowing hair .
Then came his mother ’s silky undershirts .
Half a year into preschool , J. started becoming agitated when asked to wear boys ’ clothing .
En route to a mall with her son , Ms. B. had an epiphany : “ It just clicked in me .
I said , ‘ You really want to wear a dress , do n’t you ? ’ ”
Thus began what the B.’s , who asked their full names not be used to protect their son ’s privacy , call “ the reluctant path , ” a behind - closed - doors struggle to come to terms with a gender - variant child — a spirited 5 - year - old boy who , at least for now , strongly identifies as a girl , requests to be called “ she ” and asks to wear pigtails and pink jumpers to school .
Ms. B. , 41 , a lawyer , accepted the way her son defined himself after she and her husband consulted with a psychologist and observed his newfound comfort with his choice .
But she feels the precarious nature of the day - to - day reality .
“ It ’s hard to convey the relentlessness of it , she said , “ every social encounter , every time you go out to eat , every day feeling like a balance between your kid ’s self - esteem and protecting him from the hostile outside world . ”
The prospect of cross-dressing kindergartners has sparked a deep philosophical divide among professionals over how best to counsel families .
Is it healthier for families to follow the child ’s lead , or to spare children potential humiliation and isolation by steering them toward accepting their biological gender until they are older ?
Both sides in the debate underscore their concern for the profound vulnerability of such youngsters , symbolized by occurrences like the murder in 2002 of Gwen Araujo , a transgender teenager born as Eddie , southeast of Oakland .
“ Parents now are looking for advice on how to make life reasonable for their kids — whether to allow cross - dressing in public , and how to protect them from the savagery of other children , ” said Dr. Herbert Schreier , a psychiatrist with Children ’s Hospital and Research Center in Oakland .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Takeru Kobayashi won his fifth consecutive hot - dog eating title Monday by downing 49 frankfurters in 12 minutes , leaving 17 competitors in his wake .
But the Nagano , Japan , eating champion fell short of his personal best set last year -- a record 53.5 hot dogs and buns .
" I 'm very sad , " Kobayashi , 27 , said through an interpreter .
" I came here to beat it .
Maybe next year I will . "
American Sonya Thomas , 37 , placed second .
Her consumption of 37 frankfurters set an American record .
" I trained for speed , " said the diminutive dog devourer , who weighs 100 pounds , stands 5 feet 5 inches and manages a Burger King restaurant in Virginia .
" My stomach does n't hurt , but my jaw is tired , " she said less than an hour after finishing the competition .
" Maybe tonight , I 'm going to eat a light dinner , a kind of salad . "
Finishing third , with 32 hot dogs under his belt , was Joey Chestnut , 21 , from San Jose , California .
Heft did not appear to confer any advantage :
At 150 pounds , Kobayashi weighs half of what some of his competitors weigh .
He also holds records for eating 17.7 pounds of cow brains , 20 pounds of noodles and 20 pounds of rice balls .
Kobayashi credited his technique for Monday 's win .
He breaks the hot dog in two , eats it , then soaks the buns in water before swallowing them .
Kobayashi retains the " Coveted Mustard Yellow International Belt " and wins a year 's supply of hot dogs from Nathan 's , sponsor of the annual event .
The competition has been held at Surf and Stillwell avenues in Brooklyn 's Coney Island section since 1916 .
CNN 's Allan Chernoff , Adam Reiss and Shannon Troetel contributed to this report .

I 've been meaning to try out SLIME for a long time , and finally got around to it a couple of months ago .
Let me say that I 'm very , very impressed with the rich development environment Common Lisp people have made for themselves .
The python environment I use at work ( Emacs for editing , ipython for experimenting , occasional usage of grep ) pales in comparison .
I told myself then that I 'd have to write down what it is that makes SLIME so great , but that got put aside in the runup to GStreamer 0.10 .
Now with a bit more time on my hands I 've taken another look at it .
It 's still impressive .
Implementation notes
I have to touch on the implementation first , because otherwise the rest wo n't make sense .
Most emacs and vi users are accustomed to specialized editor modes for different languages : one for python to help in indentation , one for C , etc .
These modes rely on textual , syntactic analysis of the source code file to try to anticipate what you want the editor to do .
However it 's never perfect ; local variables that have the same name as builtin functions in python still get highlighted as if they were builtins , some macros might upset the indenter in C , etc .
SLIME takes a different approach to " editor modes " .
It 's a client - server architecture ; the Emacs part of SLIME connects to an external Lisp process , which is running a SLIME server .
The two sides communicate via a special RPC protocol .
If SLIME existed for Python , it would not highlight builtins based on their name .
Instead it would have an inferior python interpreter running the whole time , and when the user types in map , it would ask the python interpreter what map is .
Based on that answer it would then choose how to highlight the word , and maybe even tell the programmer what the arguments to map are .
The server is written in mostly - portable Common Lisp , so that it runs on something like 9 implementation of the language .
Because the protocol is the same , SLIME can interact with all implementations in the same way .
This is of great interest to CL programmers , but even Python has a couple of other slightly incompatible implementations , so the idea of communicating via sockets with an external server is still a good one .
I 'm going to artificially divide up SLIME 's feature set into a few categories : writing new code , changing existing code , finding code , and debugging .
To make the examples more relevant for most people , I 'll make some speculations throughout about what these features would mean if they were implemented for Python .
Writing code
I 've amazed my co-worker Thomas , a vi user , with the emacs command dabbrev- expand , normally bound to M-/ .
For example typing p r o g M-/ in this file expands prog out to programmers .
However because this expansion is just textual , it often takes a few presses of the M-/ before I get the word I want .
For example , when looking for a method , a module name will expand out , or a word from comments .
SLIME extends emacs such that M - TAB tries to expand the symbol at point ( the cursor ) to other symbols available in that package ( module ) in Lisp .
If I type a p p M - TAB , SLIME tells me that the two symbols append and apply are available for me to use , and if there is only one possible completion it goes ahead and finishes the word .
In addition " fuzzy completion " is available as an option , such that norm - df could expand to least - positive - normalized - double - float .
Neat eh ?
In Python this would be more usefully implemented to autocomplete attributes as well .
Once you have the function you want , moving to the arguments by pressing the space bar ( SPC ) will show the function 's argument list in the minibuffer .
For example typing ( a p p e n d SPC in a Lisp file or at the REPL ( listener ) will cause ( append &rest lists ) to show up in the minibuffer .
This describes the kind of arguments that append can take .
For more complicated functions with lots of keyword arguments , it 's sometimes better to have the form expand out into your source itself .
This can be done with C-c C-s , the binding for slime - complete - form .
For example , if you have this in your source :
( find 17
and you press C-c C-s , it will expand out to :
( find 17 sequence : from - end from - end : test test : test - not test - not : start start : end end : key key )
If you need full documentation on find , you can put the point over find and run slime - describe - function via C-c C-f , and you get full documentation on the routine displayed in another pane .
The same can be done with other variables via slime - describe - symbol .
Thankfully , unlike C , there is one indentation custom agreed upon by most all Lisp programmers .
The convention depends on the first element of an expression .
SLIME makes sure that the editor knows how to indent properly by checking the type of the operator with the Lisp environment .
( This is a pet peeve of mine when hacking Guile , that Emacs often does n't know how to indent my macros . )
Changing code
Of course , programming in a dynamic language usually does n't follow a strict write - compile - run - debug cycle .
Normally , people try to make small pieces that work , and then put them together .
SLIME offers a number of conveniences that decrease the distance between writing code and seeing what it does .
Common Lisp is a dynamic , compiled language .
You can recompile just one function , and have a running program take up that new definition .
In fact , because SLIME has a connection to your running program , there are hotkeys to do just that .
Like compilers for other languages , Lisp compilers can issue warnings corresponding to particular pieces of code .
These warnings then show up in your source files as being underlined .
For example , after compiling a function , unused variables will become underlined , and if you hover the mouse over the variables , the text of the compiler warning will show up as a tooltip .
In the hypothetical SLIME for Python , you would expect that the same would be possible -- send over a new method implementation , monkeypatch the class , and then all instances will use that method ( even existing instances ) .
Also if pychecker is available , it can be run on that function to give you similar kinds of warning information that can be translated to tooltips in the source files .
All this is possible without having to restart your program .
( As a parenthesis , Common Lisp 's object system was designed to allow reloading class definitions , and lazily migrating existing instances over to the new layout .
I do n't think Python can do this yet , but I 'm not sure . )
Finding code
Oftentimes a programmer decides to change some aspect of a program 's behavior , but is unfamiliar with the code concerned .
This happens especially often on multi-programmer projects .
The search for the proper code to change usually takes more time than the change itself .
SLIME offers a number of facilities to speed up the search .
The traditional way of cross - referencing source code is via the use of ctags / etags .
First you set up some makefile rules for producing a TAGS file , which syntactically analyzes all of the source files in a project and notes the names and locations of all of the function definitions .
Automake can assist with this .
Then in your editor with the cursor on a function invocation , you press some key combination ( M -. in emacs ) and your editor takes you to the definition .
This method is useful , but also a pain .
If there are multiple functions with the same name ( particularly bad in object - oriented languages ) , it takes a while to find the right one .
Then there 's the fact that you have to set up your source to build TAGS files , and keep them up - to - date .
Finally , at least in Emacs , using TAGS files from multiple project is a PITA .
SLIME instead offers a meta - point facility ( named after the key combination , M-. ) that asks Lisp where the function was defined .
SLIME saves where you were so you can go back there later .
The saved location list is a stack , so you can meta - point out more than one time , and when you pop back via M- , you 'll be in the last place you pressed M-. .
This eliminates the need for syntactical analysis via TAGS files , and removes the duplicate - name problem .
If the Lisp implementation supports it , SLIME can offer much more detailed cross-referencing information : where a function is called , where a variable is referenced , where a macro is expanded , and where a generic function is specialized ( akin to implementing a virtual method ) .
Python could offer this information as well , but you would have to run a function to walk all modules , examining functions ' bytecode and building an index .
Finally , SLIME offers easy access to all of the interactive documentation that Lisp knows about : docstrings on functions , documentation properties on variables , and the hyperspec , a heavily cross-referenced language reference .
A SLIME for Python would offer similar facilities .
Debugging
I hardly ever use the debugger in Python .
Part of it is that the code I work on mostly involves asynchronous calls , which are tough to debug , but mostly it 's that I always forget how to use it .
There are many occasions on which a debugger would be useful but I can't be bothered to remember how to start it .
SLIME makes all this very easy .
Whenever a condition ( like an exception ) is signaled , the debugger is brought up in a transient pane ( emacs ' equivalent of a dialog box ) .
From there you get a nice backtrace , a description of the error , and a list of restarts .
The normal case is to press q and the last available restart will be chosen , which for example in the REPL will abort the evaluation .
Simple backtraces are readily had from ipython however .
SLIME goes significantly beyond this .
Each frame in the backtrace can be expanded out to show all of the local variables in the frame .
This is done by putting the cursor on the frame and pressing enter .
If you press enter on a local variable , you start up the inspector , which opens in another transient pane .
The inspector is really neat .
It tells you everything it knows about a value .
For example , the number 3 is described as an integer , then is shown in many different bases and as a time value .
Compound values like closures are decomposed into their constituents .
From a closure you can get the function object , together with the local variables that the function closes over .
The function object itself can be inspected to show the source info ( where it came from ) , the native code that the function compiled to , the arguments , etc .
The inspector keeps a stack of objects so you can dig down and come back up to where you were .
I would kill to have this in Python .
It would be really useful to be able to open up such a debugger if an exception has to be trapped , for example if an error occurs in a function run from the GObject main loop .
As it is , I have to deal with python printing a backtrace , and I do n't even get to know which values were on the stack .
Of course , SLIME also supports the traditional debugger interface of breakpoints and single - stepping .
There are hotkeys assigned to break on certain lines , and also to trace / untrace functions .
Common Lisp specifies a statistical profiling interface , so that also can be enabled and disabled from within the editor .
Some Lisp implementations can give profiling information for each instruction executed by the CPU .
Things I did n't know python - mode could do
Until writing this , I had n't fully investigated python - mode .
It does n't exactly have a nice manual like SLIME does , nor have I seen exponents like I have from the Lisp community .
But , browsing the docstrings it appears that python - mode offers rudimentary support for dynamic programming .
It can run python in a subshell , and send strings to that shell .
Unfortunately the listener is unmodified from what python gives you : no highlighting , no indentation , nothing .
The subshell does n't even know it 's python that it talks to ; it just recognizes the >>> and ... .
There is some support for the python debugger , pdb , but I 'm not sure how to get to it .
It just recognizes the strings that pdb outputs .
There is supporting for reloading modules as well , but again it 's quite primitive .
All in all python - mode appears to be a start at dynamic programming but it does not approach SLIME .
( This is an opportunity , not a condemnation . )
Coda
I wrote this article for a couple of reasons .
One was for myself , to make sure that I understood everything that SLIME does .
Another was to raise awareness of the integration possibilities between editors and dynamic languages , in the hopes that in a couple years I wo n't be using the same environment I 'm using now .
I 'm particularly interested in Emacs integration with Scheme and Python .
There does exist a port of SLIME to Scheme48 .
I suspect that for languages not in the Lisp family , a fork or a " port of ideas " would be the best that can be done .
Comments welcome via e-mail or trackback , especially regarding other ways of programming dynamic languages .

Occasionally , ok often , I 'm gently mocked for the length of my posts .
I start with good intentions of making short , pithy Jason Yip - style posts , then think of something else I want to say and 10 pages later I manage to hit the publish button .
This is one of those that got away from me .
I 'm writing this post for a reason .
Specifically , I 'm seeing a lot of harm being done on my project by focusing narrowly on performance optimizations and neglecting maintainability .
This is an ongoing discussion and debate for me at work , and I suspect it 's going to continue to be an issue as long as I work in the financial world .
I think it 's important to win this argument , or at least gain some concessions , so I would be very happy to hear everyone else 's thoughts on this subject , especially folks that disagree with me .
In the course of this post I 'm going to criticize the decisions and code of some of my teammates ( and myself ) on my current project .
It is n't that I think they 're doing a bad job , just that there is a very real opportunity to do better .
When you 're architecting a software system , you must understand what the needs of the system really are and act accordingly .
It 's important to understand the desired qualities of a system because software design often involves making compromises between opposing qualities .
For example , performance and scalability are often very much at odds — you can generally only optimize on one or the other .
The point I 'm trying to make is that you absolutely cannot focus completely on one quality of your software without considering the consequences to the other " ility " qualities of your system .
In the end , you need to be optimizing on the qualities that genuinely create business value — and I believe that the single most important quality for delivering business value on most projects is maintainability .
Any deviation from a more maintainable solution in favor of performance or security or scalability or whatever is dead wrong — at least until proven otherwise .
Even if you do have stringent performance or scalability targets , I 'm going to argue in this post that focusing on maintainability first will get you to those very same performance or security goals more efficiently in terms of development time .
Early Performance Optimization did not Work
To use a concrete example that I 'm dealing with on my current project , the back end developers are consciously coding to minimize the number of IL instructions in an attempt to improve performance .
They 're very concerned by issues like auto - boxing and the number of objects being created .
In fact , it seems to be their main judgement of code quality .
So our code is fast right ?
Well , no , but we 're working on it and making strides .
When we started integrating the client and server we found that marshalling data from the server to the client was extremely sluggish .
A little bit of profiling from one of my team members showed that we had a fairly severe bottleneck in our transport layer that totally dwarfed the run time of the rest of the system .
The IL instruction optimization in the server side code did n't particularly achieve anything .
What makes me angriest at myself is that we flirted with a more common approach to integration that I think would be more maintainable in the long run , but went with our current strategy in no small part because we thought it would be faster ( sic ) .
I change my mind , what I 'm really livid with myself for is not forcing the backend guys to benchmark the more maintainable approach first before we committed to this path * .
Neglecting Maintainability is an Opportunity Cost
The server side developers spent time making optimizations that might , or might not have , made some minor improvements in performance .
We collectively made some wide ranging architectural choices for performance that have not , in my opinion , added any value whatsoever .
I 've got a major problem with the previous statement .
You only have a finite amount of time and resources to throw at your project .
Yeah , you can crank up your hours for short bursts , but there 's always a cost for doing that .
To be truly successful , you should strive to spend these finite resources on things that add the most value .
The time spent on the server side architecture for performance bothers me a little bit , but the opportunity cost from not writing maintainable code or automated tests on the server side has been far more significant .
From Wikipedia , Opportunity Cost is " the cost of something in terms of opportunity forgone . "
The end result ?
While gaining essentially nothing in performance , we cost ourselves the opportunity to have worked more efficiently with that code in terms of both developer and project time by neglecting test automation and well factored code .
What we have is code that is genuinely hard to follow and spot errors through inspection because the methods are too long , with deeply nested if / then and looping constructs for good measure .
The existing code is much harder to change than orthogonal code backed up by unit tests would have been .
Surprise !
That server side code had to be changed in the very next iteration to add new features with additional changes looming for later iterations .
If I had n't spent a couple of days slicing that code up with IntelliJ 's automated refactoring support , we could have very easily ended up with code duplication in areas that have a high potential to change in the future .
Nothing makes extension harder than having to code the same rules in multiple places ( a. More work and b. Greater chance of screwing it up ) .
Even worse is poor coupling and cohesion properties that have defeated our attempts at writing isolated unit tests .
I 'm all for integrated FIT style tests , but that should n't have to be the most granular testing that you can do on a system .
One of the lessons I 've learned by dealing with so much legacy code in the last 2 1 / 2 years is that coding throughput is very much effected by the granularity and quickness of the feedback loop .
Writing small , granular unit tests that execute quickly leads to better productivity than the much slower feedback cycle from more coarse grained integration tests .
Having to fire up the UI to test something by hand is even slower yet .
I will very confidently claim that debugging time goes up geometrically with the coarseness of the testing , and that 's significant because debugging is a major drain on developer productivity .
Just to beat this horse into the ground , the system we 're building does n't even have any realistic need for high performance .
The data sets are small , and the transaction complexity is fairly mild .
What we * do * need is reliability , but the stateful socket connection integration scheme we adopted in the name of performance has added complexity in the way that we deal with server connectivity .
I think a stateless connection model , while arguably slower , would have provided more value in terms of business value .
While surely improving performance , the proprietary binary formats we use for communication come with the opportunity cost of decreased interoperability , and hence a very real reduction in business opportunities .
Ok smart guy , now my code is n't fast enough !
Back to performance again .
So you concentrated on producing the correct business functionality first , with maintainability in mind , and it turns our that your architecture is n't responsive enough , or maybe can't handle the volume , or just that the user interface is n't responsive enough .
I 'm not really addressing performance optimization and profiling in depth here , but take a quick read through Jeff Atwood 's post
Why are n't my optimizations optimizing ?
and you 'll see that performance tuning is a tricky business .
There are too many conflicting variables to solve the problem through pure deduction alone .
Dollars to donuts , I bet you that some of the performance optimizations being done by my colleagues ended up hurting performance instead .
The point being that you almost certainly need empirical measurements to measure a range of trial solutions to arrive at better performance .
To drive this point home , let 's say that your performance bottleneck is in the communication between physically distributed subsystems .
Forgetting for a minute about the cost of making changes to your code base , what can you do to make your system faster ?
Use lazy fetching techniques in fetching parent / child aggregate data structures to avoid fetching the child details when you do n't need them .
Use eager fetching techniques in fetching parent / child aggregate data structures to make fewer network round trips
Minimize the number of network round trips because that often makes the system faster by compressing the data sent over the wire or gathering data into a more coarse grained Data Transfer Object
Maybe the fancy compression or transformation of the data is eating up resources .
Change that to something else
Use more background threads
Eliminate thread swapping by cutting down the number of threads
Cache shared resources
Eliminate thread synchronization slowdowns caused by shared resources
a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing … ( sorry , could n't help myself )
Wait , some of these changes contradict the other .
Which one is right ?
Are you sure ?
It could easily take you several attempts to find the right recipe for performance ( or scalability or usability ) .
You definitely need to make changes to improve performance , but those changes cannot break the functionality of the application .
Fast , buggy code is n't an improvement on slow , functional code .
If you 've written maintainable code that exhibits orthogonality , you should be able to contain the changes to isolated modules without spilling into the rest of the code .
If you 've built a maintainable software ecosystem of full build automation and solid test automation , you can drastically reduce the overhead of staging new code to the performance testing environment with less risk of breaking working code .
In other words , the things you do for maintainability should have a direct impact on your ability to efficiently make empirical
Conclusion
There are two general themes I wanted to explore in this post .
The first theme is just yet another cry for YAGNI .
Try not to invest time or effort into something that is n't warranted .
Make any piece of complexity earn its existence first .
A lot of this thinking is based on the assumption that it 's easier to add complexity to a simple solution when it 's warranted than it is to work around unnecessary complexity .
I 'm also making a large assumption that you can make optimizations later if you 've taken steps to flatten the change curve .
The second theme is that I think a deliberate focus on maintainable code structure and solid project infrastructure is a more reliable path to quality optimization than early optimization .
If your code and project infrastructure facilitate change you can always make adaptations to improve your other " ilities " — assuming that you 're paying attention as you work and make adaptations in a timely manner of course .
And , by the way , maintainability is still the most important code quality .
Your system may not have to be blindingly fast , or scale like eBay , but it will change .
By all means , go learn about Big O notation and delve into the inner workings of the CLR ( I 'm finally reading the Jeffrey Richter book this week myself ) .
There 's a very important point I 'm trying to make for anybody engaged in building software , and that is that focusing on maintainability first is very often the most reliable means to get to exactly the other qualities that you need .
Ant if you write code that can't be maintained or changed , you 're probably on a path to failure .
Wait , there 's going to be more .
The next post in the " Maintainable " software series is going to be about the DRY principle and the Wormhole Antipattern .
First I 'm going to give StructureMap a serious DRY 'ing out for awhile , then I 'm going to come back and tell you how it went .
* I believe that the decision that ultimately led to our performance and tight coupling problems was based far too much on a " Sunk Cost . "
More on that someday .

BBC News science reporter
The team used mitochondrial DNA removed from Oetzi 's intestine
Genetic research , published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology , also confirms that his roots probably lie in Central Europe .
Oetzi's body was found in the melting ice of the Schnalstal glacier in the Italian Alps in 1991 .
Examination of his remains has already revealed the Copper Age man almost certainly died as a result of a fight .
The assessment is based on the presence of an arrowhead that is lodged in his back and extensive cuts to his hands .
The scientists behind the latest genetic research now speculate that Oetzi 's possible sterility could have been a factor that led to this violent end .
We cannot say for certain that he was suffering from this [ reduced sperm mobility ] , but there is a chance
Dr Franco Rollo , University of Camerino
In particular , they looked at the genetic material contained in mitochondria , tiny structures that provide power to cells .
This type of DNA is passed only down the maternal line .
The team says it found areas that are linked to an increased chance of male infertility .
" We screened sites [ of the DNA ] which have been described by other scientists as being linked to other pathologies or environmental adaptations , " Dr Rollo said .
" A couple of these sites have been described as being linked to reduced sperm mobility and we found both on Oetzi 's mitochondrial DNA , " he told the BBC News website .
" We can not say for certain that he was suffering from this [ reduced sperm mobility ] , but there is a chance . "
' Lack of family '
Dr Rollo said the idea that Oetzi might have been infertile was intriguing , and while emphasising that this was purely speculation , he noted it would be interesting to pursue the idea further .
Extensive study is reconstructing Oetzi 's life and features
" One would have to investigate whether there was an awareness of male infertility in this ancient society ; and if so , whether the lack of a family or clan could represent a kind of social weakness . "
At first it was thought Oetzi had died from exposure to the cold , but the wounds on his hands and the arrowhead would seem to indicate he died as a result of injuries he received in a fight .
Given the suggestion that Oetzi may have been infertile , Dr Rollo wondered whether the social implications of this could have played a role in the chain of events that led to a confrontation .
Maternal line
The team also looked at patterns in Oetzi's DNA to try to establish more information about his roots .
The scientists discovered that he belonged to the K1 subdivision of the haplogroup known as K .
Haplogroups can be described as the branches of the human genealogical tree .
Each haplogroup corresponds to early human migrations to the various continents or geographical regions .
ANCIENT HUMAN DNA
The DNA within our cells contains the genetic information that spells out the " code of life "
It is wound up in bundles known as chromosomes that are found in the cell nucleus ( nuclear DNA ) ; DNA also lies within mitochondria outside of the nucleus ( mtDNA ) mtDNA is inherited only through females via the egg and can be used to trace backwards through evolution ; the male sex chromosome ( Y ) similarly tracks male evolution DNA breaks down over time making recovery difficult from ancient specimens .
Fossils are often contaminated with modern human DNA during handling , and it is difficult to tell this apart from ancient DNA
But Dr Rollo cautioned against the certainty of these results because knowledge of the group 's distribution is still poor and there are only small population samples to compare with it .
The researchers also found that Oetzi belonged to a fourth subcategory of the K1 group that had previously not been seen .
" This means that our analysis of the mummy 's mitochondrial DNA is more detailed than the average analysis done on modern populations , " said Professor Rollo .
Dr Mim Bower , an archaeogeneticist from the McDonald Institute at the University of Cambridge , UK , commented on the research : " This is an interesting paper and shows how valuable mitochondrial DNA can be .
" From the point of view of ancient DNA , it is extremely useful because each cell has lots of mitochondria in it , and therefore lots of copies of mitochondrial DNA , which gives you a much better chance of recovering it after several thousand years of DNA decay . "
But Dr Bower pointed out that it can also have limitations .
" What it does not do is give us a complete picture .
Because mitochondrial DNA is passed through the maternal line , what we are actually looking at is Oetzi 's mother , and grandmother , and so on .
We are only seeing the female line , " she said .
" With nuclear DNA can we build a more complete picture , but this is very hard to extract from such ancient specimens . "
Landis says he did not cheat and has vowed to clear his name
Regulations limit the ratio of the male sex hormone testosterone to its shadow epitestosterone to four to one .
However , Dr Brent Kay says that the initial test on Landis showed that the ratio in the American was 11 to one .
" I 've seen bodybuilders with numbers 100 to one , " Kay said .
" Floyd 's was elevated but it 's not off the chart . "
The range for an average person is between one to one and two to one .
Landis faces a two - year ban and could be stripped of his title after testing positive for unusual testosterone levels after stage 17 of the race .
The 30 - year - old won that stage by almost six minutes to put him back into contention for the yellow jersey .
His victory was made even more remarkable by the fact that the day before Landis had cracked on the final climb of stage 16 .
The Phonak rider denies the charges , stating that he has naturally high levels of testosterone .
The result of tests on Landis ' B sample will be announced on Saturday .
" It is imperative that the B test be done this week for the credibility of our sport , " said International Cycling Union president Pat McQuaid .
" This needs to be put to rest because there is too much innuendo , too much talk , too much damage being done to our sport .
" We have to get this process done quickly so we can move on . "
Consumer Reports today unveiled its first - ever public education campaign urging shoppers against buying an extended warranty .
This holiday season , consumers are expected to spend a whopping $ 1.6 billion on extended warranties for laptops , flat - screen TVs , and other electronics , and appliances .
And Consumer Reports says that almost all of it will be money down the drain .
Consumer Reports ' public education campaign kicks off on Tuesday , Nov. 14 with a full - page advertisement in USA Today advising consumers that extended warranties have become big business for retailers -- and a waste of money for consumers .
At the same time , Consumer Reports will launch an email campaign to 825,000 if its subscribers and e-activists , and a hub on http://www.ConsumerReports.org that will invite consumers to share their experiences .
" This campaign may be a first for Consumer Reports , but its goal of educating the public goes back to our very first days of publication , " says Jim Guest , president and CEO of Consumers Union , nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports .
" When we started in 1936 , advertising first flooded the market and consumers needed an independent , and ad - free source of information . "
A Boon For Retailers ; Research Shows a Waste for Consumers
In a time of razor - thin margins , extended warranties have been a boon for retailers .
extended warranties can reap a 50 percent margin or higher , which is often well more than the profit on the product being sold .
Years of survey data from Consumer Reports data shows that extended warranties are a notoriously bad deal for consumers .
The Consumer Reports National Research Center tracks the ownership experiences of millions of consumers and thousands of products .
Annual surveys ask Consumer Reports subscribers if they own certain products and whether they 've needed major repairs .
By analyzing that data Consumer Reports has learned which brands have been more repair - prone than others .
Consumer Reports survey findings show that products seldom break within the extended warranty window -- typically three years -- and that when electronics and appliances do break , the repair often costs about the same as the cost of the warranty .
" Based on our extensive testing and research , Consumer Reports has long advised against extended warranties , " says Kim Kleman , deputy editorial director , Consumer Reports .
" A better idea is to buy a reliable brand . "
Two Possible Exceptions and Peace of Mind
Consumer Reports notes that there are two possible exceptions when it comes to extended warranties : rear - projection microdisplay TVs , which Consumer Reports notes are expensive to repair and are three times more likely to need repairs that other types of TVs ; and Apple computers , because they come with only 90 days of tech support and the additional warranty extends that .
For consumers who want absolute peace of mind and do n't mind paying for an extended warranty that they 'll probably never need , Consumer Reports offers the following advice :
* Check your credit card --
Plans , often found on gold and platinum cards , typically lengthen the original manufacturer 's warranty by as much as one year .
* Shop around -- Extended Warranties vary in length and term .
Consumer Reports advises that shoppers should n't pay more than 20 percent of the purchase price for the Extended Warranty and should negotiate the price and terms .
* Beware of hidden " gotchas " --
For heavy items such as large TVs or major appliances consumers should ask if in - home repair or pickup is included .
For TVs , who reinstalls it ?
And if the product will be repaired , is there a lemon clause such that after a few repairs the product is replaced ?

I ’ve mentioned Self , the flagship of prototype based programming , a couple of times before .
Not that i have , right now , much more to say about this very interesting paradigm and this particular implementation , which its creators describe ( better than i could ) in the following terms :
The Self system attempts to integrate intellectual and non-intellectual aspects of programming to create an overall experience .
The language semantics , user interface , and implementation each help create this integrated experience .
The language semantics embed the programmer in a uniform world of simple ob jects that can be modified without appealing to definitions of abstractions .
In a similar way , the graphical interface puts the user into a uniform world of tangible objects that can be directly manipulated and changed without switching modes .
The implementation strives to support the world - of - objects illusion by minimizing perceptible pauses and by providing true source - level semantics without sac rificing performance .
As a side benefit , it encourages factoring .
Although we see areas that fall short of the vision , on the whole , the language , interface , and im plementation conspire so that the Self programmer lives and acts in a consistent and malleable world of objects .
( From Programming as an Experience : The Inspiration for Self )
( If you prefer a less heady introduction , this video is a delightful alternative , and there ’s also the Self tutorial . )
Chances are , however , that i will have more to say about Self in the near future , for i’ve just made a pleasant discovery .
Self was developed at Sun during the late eighties and nineties , and last time i looked there was a 2004 version available for PowerPC .
But the Self group seemed dissolved , and i got the impression that the coming of Intel Macs would see the end of its development .
Well , as is often the case , i was wrong !
As recently as June this same year , a new Self 4.3 was available for download , for both PowerPC and Intel Mac .
Admittedly , it looks a bit outdated and changes in this version are less than earth - shakening , but it ’s still great to experiment and healthily bend your mind for a while .
The ideas behind Self are worth investigating too .
For instance , you ’ll find in the demo image a Smalltalk interpreter , and there ’s much to be learned about the compiler ’s implementation or the still on - going ( latest release was this august ) project of writing a metacircular virtual machine , aptly christened The Klein Metacircular VM .
Finally , those of you on Linux or Windows can give a try to Self / x86 , although i’m afraid this one looks might be abandoned by now .
On the other hand , it ’s Free Software , so any sufficiently motivated gal or guy can jump into the wagon !
I ’m sure it would make for an awesome learning experience .
Although I like Notepad2 , it has some pathological alert dialog behavior , particularly when it comes to searching .
Here 's an alert dialog I almost always get when searching a document :
Thanks for the update , Notepad2 .
I really wanted a whole modal alert dialog to tell me this important fact .
And if my search text is not found ?
Because I could n't possibly tell if the text was not found without a giant .. alert .. dialog .
These are both unnecessary alert dialogs that , collectively , destroy the flow of my search task .
It 's the GUI equivalent of that annoying little kid from Jerry Maguire telling me that :
Meanwhile , I 'm trying to get some freaking work done .
Alan Cooper , in his book About Face 2.0 , calls this stopping the proceedings with idiocy .
And that 's exactly what it is .
There is a particular form of excise that is so prevalent it deserves special attention .
In Chapter 9 , we introduced the concept of flow , where the user enters a highly productive mental state by working in harmony with his tools .
Flow is a natural state , and people will enter it without much prodding .
It takes some effort to break into flow after someone has achieved it .
Interruptions like a ringing telephone will do it , as will an error message box .
Most interruptions are avoidable ; a few are n't .
But interrupting a user 's flow for no good reason is stopping the proceedings with idiocy and is one of the most disruptive forms of excise .
Poorly designed software will make assertions that no self - respecting individual would ever make .
It states unequivocally , for example , that a file does n't exist merely because it is too stupid to look for it in the right place , and then implicitly blames you for losing it .
A program will cheerfully execute an impossible query that hangs up your system until you decide to reboot .
Users view such software behavior as idiocy , and with just cause .
The canonical example of unnecessary dialogs , the delete confirmation dialog , lives on in Windows Vista :
The real irony here is that moving files to the recycle bin is a completely recoverable action .
It does n't matter what I click in this dialog .
If I mistakenly " delete " files this way , I can simply recover them from the recycle bin .
This alert dialog is utterly superfluous .
It 's just another button I have to click through to get my work done .
Sure , I can disable it ( and I have ) , but the fact that the delete confirmation dialog exists at all is a giant sock in the nose for usability professionals everywhere .
Here 's how strongly I feel about this : every time you send your users to an alert dialog , you have failed them .
In a perfect world , we should never see a single alert dialog .
Ever .
Heck , I 'm not even sure the dialog box itself was ever a good idea .
There 's a lot of evidence that users never read dialogs and quickly train themselves to mindlessly click through them .
Consider Mike 's latest experience :
Over the weekend I was at a meeting of parents where many laptops were open and we were all looking at a spreadsheet .
One parent opened the spreadsheet in Excel and was confronted by that big dialog boxes that warns you about macros .
It was classic .
She just stopped and said " What am I supposed to do !?
What does this mean ! ? "
She did not read one single word of the dialog box text .
Being me and all , I said " What does it say ? " and more - or - less made her read the text , mostly on principle .
Not that it probably helped much , because even when she 'd read that " macros can be harmful " or whatever it says , she asked me " But it 's ok to open this spreadsheet " ?
Yes , it was .
Who knows what she would have done if she 'd been on her own .
I 'm not sure she knows what a macro actually is .
The web has been a dialog - free world for years , and nobody seems to miss them very much .
Maybe this is why .
I dream of the day when we can produce a dialog - free GUI .
This is not where humanity hoped it would be as it viewed the smoking wreckage of World War II , and world leaders embarked upon an effort to rebuild their shattered nations .
Granted , one reason for this failure is that the founders of the United Nations decided not to give the new institution the power to create and enforce its own laws .
In consequence , the United Nations then , and still today , lacks the capability to determine that violations of human rights are occurring , and then to intervene with force or sanctions against the guilty party , except through the cumbersome , slow , and often unsuccessful means of open debate .
But in a fundamental sense , such powers would be useless absent agreement on a single set of standards for determining precisely what rights human beings innately possess .
Much more impressive progress has been made in this pursuit , but perhaps the effort to stem human rights abuses is being undermined not by the absence of such definitions , but by the classic case of having too many standards , each ostensibly applicable to a different situation , time or place .
For example , while 141 nations have ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( first approved by the United Nations in 1948 ) , there are numerous other conventions in force that have relevance in certain situations ( such as the Geneva Conventions , which address human rights in times of war ) , or with respect to certain practices ( e.g. , the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ) , or within a specified geographical area ( such as the European Convention on Human rights , which binds only EU nations ) .
The unfortunate result is that in a given context , the rights of the individual can become muddied and indistinct , and perhaps lost entirely in a fog of disputed interpretation .
Is a given individual an enemy combatant , or a " terrorist ? "
Does that individual 's rights differ with geography , and if so , can the rules change if the individual is moved ?
For example , if one set of rules applies at the time of capture on the battlefield , do those rules change if the individual is transferred to the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay , and again if transferred to the United States itself , and yet again if he is finally subjected to rendition to a country that does not observe international conventions against torture ?
Can it be contended that a terrorist has no rights at all , by simply contending that terrorists are not covered by any identified convention ?
Today , we seem to be in danger of countenancing a retreat from the 18th century concept of " inalienable rights " in favor of a purely legalistic approach that looks only to the applicability of identifiable rules to specific situations .
The logical result of referring only to rules of selective applicability is that if a place , or a category ( or both ) can be found where those rules do not apply , then the individual is left totally at the mercy of the state .
Certainly this is inconsistent with the concept of innate human rights and the values upon which this country was founded .
It would seem that the only way to avoid such a result is to restore the concept of some baseline set of inalienable rights , rights that are unabridgeable under any circumstance , by any authority , at any time , as originally conceived by John Locke , Thomas Paine , and , indeed , the draftsmen of the American Declaration of Independence .
Only by agreeing upon such a base standard of human dignity can the individual be protected against the temptations of those in power to justify abridgement of human rights by the exigencies of the moment .
Hopefully , this is one area of Constitutional interpretation upon which liberals and strict constructionists alike , upon reflection , can find common ground .

BAGHDAD , Iraq , July 18 —
An average of more than 100 civilians per day were killed in Iraq last month , the United Nations reported Tuesday , registering what appears to be the highest official monthly tally of violent deaths since the fall of Baghdad .
The death toll , drawn from Iraqi government agencies , was the most precise measurement of civilian deaths provided by any government organization since the invasion and represented a substantial increase over the figures in daily news media reports .
Contributing to the trend cited by the United Nations , a suicide car bomber killed at least 53 people and wounded at least 105 in the holy Shiite city of Kufa on Tuesday after he lured a throng of day laborers to his van with the offer of work .
The attack , one of the bloodiest this year , struck at the heart of Shiite Islam — Kufa is a stronghold of the powerful Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr and the site of a major shrine — and aggravated sectarian fury .
This story is just breaking and deserves a special mention .
Police identify woodsman
Man tells police he has lived in woods for past 20 years
Buried in the thick woods of northern Warren County , 2 miles from the nearest road , was a testament to human adaptability .
A tarp - covered lean - to loaded with clothing , sleeping bags and provisions — items believed to have been stolen from seasonal homes around the Brant Lake region — was his residence , at least for the last several months .
The man police believe endured the elements of the Adirondacks in a pine - branch shelter was Alan G. Como , 56 , whose last known address was in Massachusetts , police said .
He told police he ’d lived in the woods for the past 20 years .
This guy had been breaking in and burglarizing camps for gear – for 20 years !!
Seems he started near Chazy Lake and began moving south after he was detected .
Big and muscular with little fat on his body , police said he is in remarkably good shape for someone his age who has apparently lived in the woods for at least several years .
“ He ’s a pro .
He knows what he ’s doing , ” Cleveland said .
Only items needed for survival — clothes , sleeping bags , food and batteries — were taken during the burglaries , with the thief leaving behind valuables like jewelry and electronics , the sheriff said .
Here ’s the best account of his capture :
For over a year , Warren County Sheriffs Deputies and State Police have been looking for a man living in camps in the middle of the woods , stealing items here and there from camps in northern Warren County .
“ A lot of people seen him and whatnot , but they just were n’t able to catch up to him , ” says Paul Smith , with the Horicon Highway Department .
Until Wednesday , the arrest of 59 - year - old Alan Como came on the heels of a Tuesday morning tip from two Horicon snowplow operators who saw something that just did not look right .
“ 2:30 in the morning , somebody is out on a bicycle and there is two - inches of snow on the road … something is going on , ” says Mark Younes , with the Horicon Highway Department .
There was a bike trail in the snow that the plows followed along their route .
“ I finally tracked him out on to Pallisades Road , which eventually leaded to Beaver Pond Road , ” Younes says .
“ Then that was the end of my route , and one of the other plow guys picked the track up from there . ”
The plow operator followed the tracks in the snow until they went over the snow bank and left the road .
“ They sent up some investigators … Mark and I went up to show them where he went over the bank , and they took it from there , ” says Smith .
After two days of scouring the woods , on Wednesday , deputies found Como ’s latest campsite .
“ ( It was ) about two - miles in , way back in the deep woods … ( we ) spooked this guy out of his place , ” says Warren County Sheriff Larry Cleveland .
Then , a nearly two - mile foot chase ensued , until Como ran into uniformed officers waiting for him .
I do n’t know what to make of this .
Sort of reminds me of famous Adirondack hermits of the past and even some people I know who live in “ houses ” .

When it comes to crime and punishment , the Amish live by a different set of rules -- God 's rules , to be exact .
Abiding strictly by a moral code that values religion over all else and stresses forgiveness over anger , the Amish concept of justice looks very different from what most Americans encounter .
In a community that is largely left to police itself , there are no courts and no set of punishments attached to a given transgression .
And no matter what the crime , " if the perpetrator professes repentance before the church community , they are forgiven , " said sociologist Deborah Morse - Kahn , who has studied and written about the Amish .
After Monday 's shooting at a Nickel Mines schoolhouse in Pennsylvania , it was that forgiveness -- not anger -- that marked the Amish community 's response .
One early reaction , even among the families of the young victims , was one of sympathy for shooter Charles Roberts .
People close to the group tell ABC News that some in the community were sad for Roberts .
Because he committed suicide , he would n't have the chance to repent and seek salvation .
God is everywhere in the Amish follower 's daily life , dictating what 's right and wrong .
If there is a dispute within the community , it is solved by the bishop , the highest - ranking member of the Amish clergy .
If there 's a problem too big to resolve , other bishops from other communities in other states step in to help solve it .
The Amish lifestyle is driven by the concept of " gelassenheit , " a German word that suggests serenity , quietness of character , and submissiveness to God , church and family .
The closest thing to punishment for a repeat offender is to be " shunned " by the community , either temporarily or for good .
Excommunication is the most severe consequence , saved only for the utterly unrepentant .
Having such a peaceful , forgiving character means there are fewer consequences for anyone in the outside world who tries to do them harm -- they rarely press charges and would rather forgive than send a perpetrator to jail .
" There have been some hate crimes against the Amish , " said Ruth Irene Garrett , a writer who was born into the Amish community .
" A lot of times they experience things around Halloween -- people are out playing pranks , high school kids are out and look at them as freaks . …
They 'll vandalize a buggy or push it into a ditch , " she said .
When God 's Law and Man's Law Collide
When the law of the land conflicts with Amish values , those values generally take precedence .
In the last century , Amish parents who did n't want their children in public school past the eighth grade pulled them out of class , breaking the law that required schooling until the age of 16 .
They were willing to go to jail for it , as some did until the Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that they would get an exemption .
Mainstream law and Amish justice have collided more recently in a handful of sexual - assault cases within the Amish community .
In the case of Mary Byler , who grew up Amish in Wisconsin and was raped throughout her childhood by her two brothers , Amish values dictated that she forgive them for their repeated assaults .
When she pressed charges and one brother was sentenced with jail time , Byler was seen as in the wrong .
According to the community , her brothers had been punished and forgiven by the church .
The incidents should have been kept out of the courtroom and the brothers kept out of jail .
In other cases , charges are never filed , and punishment is left to the forgiving standards of the church .
" More likely than not , they would n't do anything , " Morse - Kahn said .
" They do n't care to be in the courts . "
" The Amish see the force of law as contrary to the Christian spirit , " Donald Kraybill , a professor and expert on the Amish told Legal Affairs Magazine .
Moreover , sociologist Morse - Kahn says , judges are generally reluctant to send the Amish to jail .
" It can drive social service agencies and medical authorities out of their minds .
What does this say about our world of law that it applies to some people and not others ? "
Compared to the lives of most Americans , Amish life seems different in every way -- and the sphere of justice is no exception .
In the Amish world , there 's crime but no punishment , only forgiveness and salvation .

ROYAL PRECISION Electronic Computer LGP - 30 PROGRAMMING MANUAL Royal McBee Corporation Port Chester , New York April 1957
Printed in the U.S.A
CONTENTS
WHAT IS PROGRAMMING ?
Programming is planning how to solve a problem .
No matter what method is used -- pencil and paper , slide rule , adding machine , or computer - problem solving requires programming .
Of course , how one programs depends on the device one uses in problem solving .
Programming the Royal Precision LGP - 30 is basically simple .
Understanding certain problems requires special knowledge , however programming for the LGP - 30 does not .
Hence this manual is meant for beginners as well as those with experience in stored program computers and describes completely the fundamentals of programming for the LGP - 30 .
Experienced programmers may find a reading of the summary of orders at the back of the manual sufficient .
A Program for a Desk Calculator .
Deleted as excessively confusing .
What Type of Computer is the LGP - 30 ?
The Royal Precision Electronic Computer LGP - 30 is a general purpose electronic digital computer .
The phrase " general purpose " is intended to mean that the computer can solve to any required order of accuracy any mathematical problem expressable in numerical or logical terms .
However , for any given computer there are always some problems beyond its practical reach because of the length of time required for their solution .
By " electronic " is meant simply that the device uses vacuum tubes and germanium diodes .
One way of classifying computers is by the terms analog and digital .
An analog computer measures while a digital computer counts .
The prototype of the analog machine is the slide rule or the automobile speedometer .
A digital computer works on the principle of the abacus or of the desk calculator .
There are other phrases , too , which help to classify the LGP - 30 .
The LGP - 30 is ( 1 ) a fixed point machine .
In the desk calculator which we described , the decimal point is always understood to be at the right hand end of the keyboard and the accumulator .
So also in the LGP - 30 there is a fixed location for the decimal point .
However , the LGP - 30 is ( 2 ) a fractional machine .
That is , the point is understood to be at the left hand end of the accumulator , rather than at the right hand end .
Hence , all numbers must be scaled so that representation in the machine is in the range between - 1 and +1 .
However , scaling can always be accomplished by a program and need never be the concern of the operator or programmer .
Furthermore , the LGP - 30 is ( 3 ) internally binary .
Instead of a digit from 0 to 9 in each position of the accumulator , it is only possible for either a 0 or I to be in each digit position of the accumulator .
One common device , which is both fractional and binary , is the ruler .
Suppose , for instance , we were to measure 13/16th of an inch .
We would note that we had a 1 an inch , a 1 of an inch , and a 1/16 of an inch .
A simple representation of this process of counting halves , quarters , eighths , etc. , is as follows : 1/2's 1/4's 1/8's 1/16's 1/32's etc. .1 1 0 1 0 0 ... or .1101 = 13/16 BINARY = DECIMAL FRACTION
Just as scaling can be handled by a program so also can conversion from binary to decimal so that the LGP - 30 can be used as easily as any decimal computer .
The LGP - 30 is ( 4 ) a stored program computer .
It is easy now to see that a problem requires not only the numbers to be operated on but also a set of instructions describing the sequence of operations ; that is , a program .
In the case of a stored program computer , not only can the numbers be stored , but the instructions can also be stored .
Functional Components of the LGP - 30 .
There are four basic functional groupings of the components of the Royal Precision Electronic Computer LGP - 30 which are necessary for problem solving .
These functional groupings are :
The accumulator , the memory , the input - output system , and the control system .
Each of these have analogs in the case of the desk calculator .
For instance , the memory of the LGP - 30 is equivalent in the desk calculator case to the paper required for storing initial data , intermediate results , and final results .
An essential difference from the desk calculator , however , is that in the case of the LGP - 30 the program itself is also stored in the memory .
The accumulator of the LGP - 30 is entirely similar in function to the accumulator in the desk calculator .
In the case of the desk calculator , getting the results from our system is simply a matter of reading what is in the accumulator , or what we have written on paper .
In the case of a stored program computer , however , the numbers to be operated on and the results are stored in the memory .
In the LGP - 30 it is the input - output system which enables us to get numbers in and results out .
The control function is manual in the case of the desk calculator but is automatic in a stored program computer .
For instance , control in the desk calculator requires pressing the start button to execute each instruction , but in the stored program computer the control function provides for executing the program either one step at a time by pressing the start button for each instruction or all at once by pressing the start button just once for the entire program .
Why a Stored Program Computer ?
Since the desk calculator is a useful computer , the question arises , " What is the need for a stored program computer ? "
The answer lies in the speed of computation .
For instance , the stored program computer LGP - 30 can execute over 400 additions per second , whereas the desk calculator can only execute approximately one addition per second , not counting the time required to enter the numbers into the keyboard .
A table at the back of the manual shows the important physical and operational specifications of the Royal Precision electronic computer LGP - 30 .
Besides a comparison of the LGP - 30 with desk calculators , a comparison with other general purpose stored program computers is of interest .
The LGP - 30 occupies less floor space , requires less power , has a simpler list of instruction types , has fewer components , and costs less than any other general purpose stored program computer now in use .
The LGP - 30 has as large a memory , requires as few operators , is as fast , and is as easy - to program as any other , general purpose stored program computer now in its price range .
We will cover in order :
Memory and recalculating registers Building a program Number representation Input - output and control
MEMORY AND RECIRCULATING REGISTERS
Memory Drum .
The heart of the memory section of the Royal Precision electronic computer LGP - 30 is the magnetic drum shown below .
The drum is a metal cylinder 6.5 inches in diameter and 7 inches long .
It is coated with material which can be magnetized , and it rotates at approximately 3700 revolutions per minute .
Track .
Read - record heads , which are for magnetizing and for detecting magnetization on the drum , are mounted in a frame around the drum .
Reading and recording on the drum are done in a manner somewhat different from that used to record on tape in tape recorders .
The read - record heads are spaced along the axis of the drum so that each one can record and read spots in a circle around the drum as the drum rotates .
There are 64 such circles and they are called tracks .
The use of 64 tracks and 64 read - record heads means that any given portion of the drum is available to a read - record head at least 64 times faster than if the memory consisted of a tape governed by one read - record head .
Sector .
In each track there are 64 groups of spots .
Each group occupies a sector .
Each sector consists of 31 spots each of which can be magnetized or de-magnetized and a 32nd spot , called the spacer , which is always unaffected by recording and is never examined by reading .
Locations and Addresses .
There are 64 tracks and 64 sectors per track in the memory .
Hence every location in memory can be identified by a track and sector number and there are 64 x 64 = 4096 such locations .
Location numbering is generally by track and sector , tracks being numbered 00 through 63 , sectors 00 through 63 , and locations 0000 through 6363 .
Note , however , that although there are 4096 locations , a location number such as 2089 is impossible with this numbering system since sectors number only through 63 .
A location number is called an address .
Access Time .
Each sector of a given track is accessible for reading or recording by the head associated with the track of that location once per revolution .
Since the drum rotates once every 17 milliseconds , each location is accessible once every 17 milliseconds .
Recirculating Registers .
In addition to the 64 tracks of memory on the drum , there are three tracks each of which contains a recalculating register .
Each of these recalculating registers is one sector in length .
As the recalculating register passes under a read head , a record head continuously records the information read , back into the drum at a distance of one sector length from the read head .
The advantage of the recalculating register is a reduction of sector access time to the equivalent of one sector length or about .26 milliseconds , whereas , a location in memory has an access time equivalent to one track length or 17 milliseconds .
The three recalculating registers are the accumulator , the instruction register , and the counter register .
The function of the accumulator should be clear from the discussion of the desk calculator .
The functions of the instruction register and the counter register are covered later .
Fig. 1 - Schematic of LGP - 30 drum
Bit .
Each of the 31 spots in each sector on the drum can be in either of two states : not magnetized or magnetized .
These two states may be interpreted as corresponding to 0 and 1 which are the number system just as 0 through 9 are the digits of the decimal system .
The usefulness of a drum type computer depends on this correspondence between magnetized spots and binary digits .
It can be seen , then , that information can be stored on the drum in terms of binary numbers .
There is a binary digit , either 0 or 1 , corresponding to the state of each spot on the drum .
The phrase " binary digit " is generally contracted to the word " bit " .
The term " bit " is sometimes used to mean the spot on the drum as well as the binary digit which the spot represents .
Also the word bit is sometimes applied as meaning the digit I as opposed to the digit 0 .
Although the LGP - 30 operates in the binary number system , a program to convert from decimal to binary can be stored on the drum so that the LGP - 30 is as convenient as any decimal computer .
Number Words .
The information stored in a memory location in terms of magnetized or de-magnetized spots is called a word .
A word can either be a number or , since this is a stored program computer , an instruction .
We will discuss here what a word looks like once it is in the memory and defer until later how to get words in and out of the LGP - 30 .
If a word is a number , it consists of 30 bits to represent magnitude , one bit related to sign representation , and a spacer bit .
+-+-----------------------------------------------------------+-+
|0|1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1|0 | +-+-----------------------------------------------------------+-+
^ ^ ^ | | | sign bit 30 magnitude bits spacer bit ( always 0 in memory )
If a number is positive , the sign bit will be 0 .
If the number is negative the sign bit will be 1 .
In the desk calculator example , the accumulator is ten decimal digits long , and hence can be used to represent numbers up to 10 lO in magnitude .
Since a word in the LGP - 30 is thirty binary bits long , a number up to a magnitude of 230 can be represented in each word .
Note that 100 in the number system base 2 is 22 just as 100 in the number system base 10 is 102 .
Hence , 1 followed by 30 0's in the binary system is equivalent to 230 .
Since 230 is approximately equal to 109 in the decimal system , magnitudes of nine significant decimal digits can be represented in the LGP - 30 .
A discussion of binary arithmetic , representation , and scaling is covered later .
Instruction Words .
An instruction word consists of two parts , an order part and an address part .
For instance , the order part of the instruction might represent the operation add .
The address part of the instruction represents , by track and sector , the location in memory of some number .
For instance , add 2000 is interpreted as meaning add the number located in track 20 sector 00 to the contents of the accumulator and store the result in the accumulator .
Note that add 2000 means add number in location 2000 , not add the number 2000 .

(----------)(------------) order bits track bits sector bits = add = 20 = 00 instruction word = a 2000 As indicated , bit positions 12 through 15 in a word are used to represent the order .
Since 4 bits are used to represent the order , there are 24 or 16 possible orders in the LGP - 30 .
For instance , 1 110 in binary is interpreted as " add " if located in bit positions 12 through 15 of an instruction word .
Bit positions 18 through 23 are used to represent track and bit positions 24 through 29 are used to represent sector .
Since there are six bit positions allowed for track , and six bit positions allowed for sector , 26 or 64 tracks and 26 or 64 sectors can be designated by the address part of an instruction word .
The computer has no way of knowing by examining the word itself , whether a word is intended as a number or an instruction .
Under most circumstances it is the numbers which are operated on and the instructions which are followed as instruction .
The LGP - 30 has the ability to operate on instructions as numbers .
This ability is not only valuable but a feature which makes for the great power of stored program computers .
However , it is always to be avoided to use numbers as instructions .
Since an instruction word is indistinguishable from a number word , some means must be provided to avoid using numbers as instructions .
How this is accomplished is described under " BUILDING A PROGRAM " .
Also , how we convert from a 2000 to the binary representation shown is discussed later .
Summary .
In summary , the essential element with which we deal in the computer is the word , and it may be either a number or an instruction .
The next section discusses the orders of the LGP - 30 and the effect they have on number representations in the computer .
BUILDING A PROGRAM
Instruction Execution .
We have learned that an instruction consists of two parts , an order part such as the letter a to designate " add " and an address part such as 2000 to designate a memory location .
For instance , the instruction a 2000 means add the number in location 2000 to the number in the accumulator and put the result in the accumulator .
Let us see what the LGP - 30 does to execute this instruction .
There are four phases to instruction execution .
First let us suppose that a 2000 is in location 1000 and that the LGP - 30 is ready to execute the instruction in location 1000 .
The computer is ready to execute the instruction in location 1000 when 1000 is in the counter register .
Hence , we are assuming that 1000 is in the counter register .
The first phase of execution is " search " .
As the drum rotates , the LGP - 30 searches for the address given by the counter register , in this case 1000 .
The second phase is " transfer "
As location 1000 passes under the readrecord head of track 10 , the LGP - 30 places a 2000 in the instruction register , but at the same time leaves a 2000 undisturbed in location 1000 .
The third phase is " search for operand " .
The LGP - 30 searches for location 2000 .
The fourth phase is " completion " .
The LGP - 30 picks up the operand as location 2000 passes under the read - record head of track 20 and completes the operation according to the order part of the instruction .
In this case , it adds the operand to the contents of the accumulator and places the result in the accumulator .
Before execution of an instruction is complete , the LGP - 30 adds 1 to the contents of the counter register .
Therefore , when execution of the instructions in 1000 is complete , the LGP - 30 begins execution of the instruction in 1001 .
Hence , the LGP - 30 executes instructions in sequence according to memory location .
When the last instruction in a track is executed ( for instance , the instruction in 2063 ) , the instruction in sector 00 of the next track is executed because 2100 appears in the counter register .
Now we see how the LGP - 30 executes a sequence of instructions .
How it begins executing a sequence and how it stops is covered in the following discussion of the orders .
Later we will discuss what we have to do to store instructions in memory in the first place and how a 2000 is converted into binary representation .
For now we are going to discuss what orders and instructions do and how we can use them to build a program .
What orders do we need to evaluate the expression ( ( ( a 0 x + a 1 ) x + a 2 ) x + a 3 ) x+ a 4 ?
We said that four LGP - 30 orders designated by b , m , a , and h ( called bring , multiply , add , and hold ) were sufficient .
To make from these orders the instructions necessary to evaluate the given expression , we need the address of some memory locations .
Hence let us assume that x , a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , and a 4 are in locations 2000 through 2005 respectively .
Bring From Memory .
Now we can write an instruction such as b 2001 .
This means reset the accumulator to zero and add the number in 2001 ( in this case a 0 ) to the contents of the accumulator .
M Multiply .
The instruction m 2000 means multiply the contents of the accumulator by the number in location 2000 and put the most significant half of the resulting product in the accumulator ( in this case , a 0 x ) .
In general , the multiplication of two numbers results in a product which has as many digits as the sum of the number of digits in the multiplier and the multiplicand .
For instance , if we multiply .20 by .10 , we get .0200 .
Hence , if we interpret these operands as x = 2 at a scale factor f = 1 and a 0 = 1 at a scale factor f = 1 and if we retain only the significant half of the product , the result is a 0 x = 2 at a scale factor f =
2 .
Therefore by proper scaling , significance may be retained with the M multiply in keeping only the most significant half of the product .
More about scaling later .
Add .
The instruction a 2002 means add the number in location 2002 to the contents of the accumulator and keep the result in the accumulator ( in this case , a 0 x + a 1 ) .
Hold & Store .
The instruction h 2006 means store the contents of the accumulator in location 2006 and retain it also in the accumulator .
Now supposing we locate our program beginning in location 1000 , we are equipped to write the following program notes .
Location Instruction

We have now provided instructions which perform all of the functions in the solution of this problem : reset , add , multi] ply , and write .
We have written the answer into a memory location , however , and do not know what it is .
Later we will discuss how to program so that our answer is printed out on the typewriter .
Stop .
In the desk calculator , computation requires pressing the start button to execute each instruction .
In the case of the LGP - 30 , however , pressing the start button may initiate the entire sequence of instructions .
Hence , we need some method of instructing the computer to stop computation when we have accomplished what we desire .
The LGP - 30 provides a stop order designated by the letter z .
Up to this point every instruction has implied an address .
Actually , however , computation does not stop to any memory location ; it simply stops .
Hence , a stop instruction usually has the same effect regardless of the numbers in the address portion of the instruction .
It is customary to write a stop instruction as z 0000 .
Looping .
The repetition of the group of two instructions , multiply and add , suggests a generalization of the program we have written .
Perhaps we could in some way use the same multiply and add instructions repeatedly instead of writing a sequence of several pairs of multiply and add instructions .
We require two additional types of functions to accomplish this : an instruction to transfer back to the multiply and add instruction and a means of modifying the address in the add instruction .
Since we have located the coefficients a 0 through a 4 in sequential memory locations , it will be useful to add 1 to the address portion of the add instruction before transferring back to the multiply and add instructions
Let us consider program notes for the same expression as above which look as follows : Location Instruction
or Number Operand Result 1000 b 2000 working storage initially zero 1001 m 2004 x .
1002 a ( 2005 ) a n initially a 0 1003 h 2000 .
Intermediate and final answers into memory location 2000 1004 b 1002 a ( ) modify add instruction 1005 a 2001 1 " 1006 h 1002 a ( ) " 1007 u 1000 . .
Location Instruction
or Number 2000 working storage 2001 1 2002 not used 2003 not used 2004 x 2005 a 0 2006 a 1 2007 a 2 2008 a 3 2009 a 4
Note that after executing the add instruction for the first time we write into memory our first intermediate result , a 0 .
The following three instructions bring , add , and hold change the add instruction from a 2005 to a 2006 .
Hence , we note that address modification has not required any new type of order .
Unconditional transfer .
However , transfer back to the multiply instruction does require a new order .
For this the LGP - 30 provides an unconditional transfer order designated by the letter u .
An instruction such as u 1000 means execute next the instruction in location 1000 .
Each repetition of the sequence preceding the u instruction is called an iteration .
It should be noted that a u instruction does not affect the contents of the accumulator .
So far the only other instruction of this nature is the stop instruction .
Now we have an answer to the question " How do we start and stop a sequence of instruction ? "
A u instruction transfers computation to the beginning of a sequence and a z instruction stops computation at the end of a sequence .
Later we will describe how to use the typewriter and control console to execute the proper u instruction to begin executing a program once it is stored in memory .
We also have an answer to the question " How do we avoid executing numbers as instructions ? "
Since instructions are executed in sequence and since we have means of starting and stopping any sequence , we can avoid any sequence of memory locations where numbers are stored .
Working storage .
Besides transfer and address modification , there are two other ideas in our new program worth noting .
First , the initial bring instruction when first executed does not bring a 0 but brings the contents of 2000 which is zero .
The reason is this : after executing the multiply and add pair , we must store the result each time because we need to make use of the accumulator in modifying the address of the add instruction .
Having stored the intermediate result each time we have to bring it again after we transfer to the beginning .
Since we want to avoid bringing a 0 after the first time and need to bring the intermediate result , we provide a special memory location for storing intermediate results and find another method for bringing a 0 initially .
Since the add instruction initially has the address of a 0 and the contents of working storage is initially zero .
the effect of the first execution of the add instruction is to bring a 0 .
A second idea we need to mention is that the 1 we add to the instruction in location 1002 must increase the sector by one each time .
Hence , according to the diagram of an instruction word which appeared earlier , the number in location 2001 must have a one in position 29 but otherwise have all zeroes .
Locations 2002 and 2003 we did not use so that they would be available for certain modifications we will later make to the program .
The Counter .
You probably notice several things wrong with the program as it stands .
The principal fault is that there is no way of controlling when it stops .
After the instruction in 1002 becomes a 2009 , it becomes a 2010 and so on indefinitely .
Numbers in locations following 2009 are added into the result , which we do not want .
Two additional orders are helpful in controlling the number of iterations executed .
These orders are " subtract " and " test " .
Subtract .
The instruction s 2003 means subtract the number in location 2003 from the contents of the accumulator and keep the result in the accumulator .
Test .
The instruction t 1000 means that if the number in the accumulator is negative , transfer to location 1000 and if the number in the accumulator is zero or positive , execute the instruction following t 1000 .
Let us consider the following sequence of instructions : Location Instruction
or Number Operand Result 1007 b 2002 counter .
1008 a 2001 1 argument counter 1009 h 2002 counter store augmented counter 1010 s 2003 5 flag 1011 t 1000 .
tests number if iterations 1012 z 000 .
stops program 2001 1 at 29 . .
2002 working storage .
counter initially zero 2003 5 . flag
The first iteration brings zero , adds one , holds one subtracts 5 to leave - 4 in the accumulator , and transfers .
The second iteration leaves - 3 in the accumulator before testing and so on until the last iteration leaves zero and the result of the test instruction is to go to the stop instruction in 1012 .
In this case , the sequence of instructions not shown ( from 1000 to 1007 ) is executed 5 times before testing out .
Since the preceding program required modification of the add instruction in 1002 by one for each iteration , we might use the add instruction itself as the counter .
Then out program notes look as follows : Location Instruction
or Number Operand Result 1004 b 1002 a ( ) as counter .
1005 a 2001 1 at 29 augment counter 1006 h 1002 a ( ) store augmented counter 1007 s 2003 a 2010 flag 1008 t 1000 .
tests number of iterations 1009 z 0000 .
stops program 2001 1 at 29 . .
2002 working storage .
counter initially a 2005 2003 a 2010 .
flag
The question usually arises , " Given a certain initial value of counter and augmenting by 1 sector each time , how do we determine what to have for a flag ? " '
Note that the add instruction in 1002 is augmented after execution and before testing .
Hence , it is augmented after execution the last time and the flag should have an address larger by one than the address of the last add instruction to be executed .
This last sequence for controlling iterations permits us to execute the preceding multiply - add pair exactly 5 times , which is the number of times required since we must add in the five coefficients 3.0 through 3.4 .
Initializing .
There are still faults with the program .
If we execute the computation a second time , we obtain a different answer .
For one thing , when computation begins the second time , the contents of the working storage location 2000 contains the final answer and not zero .
For another , the counter and initial add instruction is a 2010 not a 2005 .
We must provide instructions to precede those we have written which set correct initial values in both of these locations .
If we store the instruction a 2005 in 2002 and a zero in 2010 , the following four instructions are sufficient to properly initialize our program .
b 2002 h 1002 b 2010 h 2000
Clear and Store .
The LGP - 30 provides a clear order which can make this initialization even simpler .
The instruction c 1002 means replace the contents of memory location 1002 with the contents of the accumulator and replace the contents of the accumulator with zero .
Now the initializing instructions can be reduced to : b 2002 c 1002 h 2000
The use of the clear instruction reduces the number of instructions by one and eliminates the need for storing a zero because the use of a clear instead of a hold to store the initial add instruction leaves a zero accumulator .
Subroutines .
A subroutine is a program which computes a frequently needed function such as the square root or the printing out of a number in the accumulator .
The word " routine " simply means " program " and the prefix " sub - " simply reflects the fact that the evaluation of a function such as the square root is often needed as a subordinate part of a larger program .
Subroutines are frequently retained in known locations in memory so that they may easily be used when needed .
In the case of our present program we have need of a print - out subroutine so that the final result stored in location 2000 can be printed out .
Suppose we locate the printout subroutine in locations 3000 through 3050 .
We can easily transfer to the subroutine by executing a u 3000 instruction .
The question arises , however , " How can we easily return for more computation to the sequence of locations where we have stored the program of which the subroutine is a part ? "
Return address .
The answer is provided by the return address order .
If the instruction r 3050 is located in 1013 , it stores the address 1015 in location 3050 .
If the instruction u 0000 is located in 3050 , it becomes u 1015 .
Hence if we have 1012 b 2000 1013 r 3050 1014 u 3000 1015 z 0000 we bring the answer to the accumulator , set up a return transfer instruction , transfer to the beginning of the printout subroutine in 3000 , execute the printout routine , transfer back to 1015 , and stop .
Refer to the LGP - 30 Subroutine Manual to see how various subroutines are programmed .
Final Program .
Now we can write a program to evaluate ( ( ( a 0 x + a 1 ) x + a 2 ) x + a 3 ) x + a 4 which incorporates all the devices we have learned to this point .
Location Instruction
or Number Operand Result 1000 b 2002 a 2005 initial add instruction 1001 c 1005 . .
1002 h 2000 zero initialize working storage 1003 b 2000 working storage .
1004 m 2004 x . 1005 a( 2005 ) a n .
1006 h 2000 working storage intermediate and final results 1007 b 1005 a( 2005 + n ) .
1008 a 2001 1 at 29 . 1009 h 1005 a( 2005 + n +1 ) .
1010 s 2003 a 2010 flag 1011 t 1003 . .
1012 h 2000 final result .
1013 r 3050 . .
1014 u 3000 print routine .
1015 z 000 . stop 2000 working storage 2001 1 at 29 2002 a 2005 2003 a 2010 2004 x 2005 a 0 2006 a 1 2007 a 2 2008 a 3 2009 a 4
Aside from the four instructions required for printout , this program is two steps longer than the original program consisting of b , m , a , m , a , m , a , m , a , h instructions and requires the use of three additional storage locations .
Nevertheless , we have gained something , for we now have a program capable of evaluating the more general expression (. . .( a 0 x + a 1 ) x + . . .a n - 1 ) x + a n
All we need to supply each time are a value for x and the coefficients a 0 through an and a value for the flag equal to a( 2006 + n ) .
Note that , although more storage space is required for more coefficients , the number of instructions in our program is constant regardless of the size of n .
That we can achieve such a program shows the great power of the LGP - 30 and of stored program computers generally .
Although we have been able to build a respectable program , there are several orders provided by the LGP - 30 which we have not used .
Store address .
Suppose we have a problem in which we wish to square all the numbers stored in track 20 and store each square in the location formerly occupied by the number .
We might write a program to appear as follows : Location Instruction Operand Notes 1000 b( 2000 ) x 1001 m( 2000 ) x 1002 h( 2000 ) x2 x2 1003 b 1000 b( 2000+n ) 1004 a 1015 1 at 29 1005 h 1000 b( 2001+n ) 1006 b 1001 m( 2000+n ) 1007 a 1015 1 at 29 1008 h 1001 m( 2001+n ) 1009 b 1002 h( 2000+n ) 1010 a 1015 1 at 29 1011 h 1002 h( 2001+n ) 1012 s 1016 h 2100 flag 1013 t 1000 loop 1014 z 0000 stop 1015 1 at 29 augmenter 1016 h 2100 flag
This program can be greatly simplified by the use of the store address order .
The instruction y 1000 means replace the contents of the address portion of the word in location 1000 with the contents of the address portion of the word in the accumulator .
The contents of the accumulator is unaffected .
Hence we can rewrite the program as follows : Location Instruction Operand Results or or number notes 1000 b( 2000 ) x 1001 m( 2000 ) x x2 1002 h( 2000 ) x2 1003 b 1000 b( 2000 + n ) 1004 a 1011 1 at 29 1005 h 1000 Counter and augmented instruction 1006 y 1001 1007 y 1002 1008 s 1012 b 2100 flag 1009 t 1000 1010 z 0000 stop 1011 1 at 29 1012 b 2100 flag
We have been able to shorten the program by 4 steps because each y instruction takes the place of the b , a , h sequence .
A y instruction can put the same address into instructions which have different orders .
Extract .
More than one kind of data may be stored in a given word .
For instance , a calendar date consists of three types of data : month , day an year .
A word with these three types of data might look this way .
+-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
( month ) ( day ) ( year )
Sometimes it is desirable to deal with only one of the three pieces of data .
The extract order makes it possible to separate different data stored in one word .
The instruction e 2000 means : put zeroes in the wore in the accumulator wherever there are zeroes in the word in location 200 ( but otherwise leave the word in the accumulator unchanged .
For instance ; if the above data word is in the accumulator and in location 2000 is the word +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
| 1|1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
( month ) then the result in the accumulator is the following word which contains only the month part of the date .
+-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
( month )
The word in location 2000 is called the extract mask .
It is possible with another extract instruction and mask to retain the day and not the month or the year , or to retain any part of any given word in the accumulator .
The extract order achieves its result by multiplying bits in corresponding positions of the extract mask and the accumulator .
That is , if there is a one in position 29 of both words , there is a one in position 29 of the result ; otherwise , there is a zero .
N multiply .
The instruction n 2000 means multiply the contents of the accumulator by the contents of location 2000 and retain the least significant half of the product in the accumulator .
The N multiply and the divide order which follows are both discussed further in connection with binary representation .
Divide .
The instruction d 2000 means divide the contents of the accumulator by the contents of location 2000 and retain the rounded quotient in the accumulator .
Print and Input .
Both the print and input orders are discussed under input output and control .
Summary .
There are 16 orders available for constructing instructions in the LGP - 30 .
An instruction contains an order part such as the letter a for add and an address part such as 2000 .
It must be emphasized that 2000 in the instruction a 2000 is the location of a number stored in memory and not the number itself .
Further properties of the m , n , d , a , and s orders are discussed in connection with binary representation , but a summary of the properties of each order can be found all in one place at the back of the manual .
NUMBER REPRESENTATION
Binary Numbers .
Just as a number system can be developed using the ten digits 0 through 9 , so also a number system can be developed using only the two digits 0 and 1 .
This number system is called the binary system
In counting with the decimal system , when the digits 0 through 9 have been used in the low order position , a one is placed to the left of the low order position and counting continues with 10 , 11 , 12 , etc .
In the counting with the binary system we also first use all the digits in the low order position and then place a one to the left of the low order position so that counting goes 0 , 1 , 10 , 11 , etc .
The binary numbers equivalent to the decimal digits are as follows : Decimal digit Binary number 0 0000 1 0001 2 0010 3 0011 4 0100 5 0101 6 0110 7 0111 8 1000 9 1001
Number representation can be looked on as an efficient method of counting .
That is , we need just the ten digits , not as many digits as the magnitude of number we wish to represent , because the digit to the left of the low order position represents the number of 10's .
For instance , the number 1,234 is ( 1 x 103 ) + ( 2 x 102 ) + ( 3 x 101 ) + ( 4 x 100 ) similarly in the binary system the number 1101 means ( 1 x 23 ) + ( 1 x 22 ) + ( 0 x 21 ) + ( 1 x 20 ) ( where the digits are decimal ) .
Sometimes it is useful to use a subscript to identify what number system a given expression is in , especially where different number systems use some of the same symbols for digits .
For instance , 11012 = 1310 ; that is , 1101 in binary is equal to 13 in decimal not one thousand one hundred one .
It is worthwhile pointing out that 10 10 = 101 10 2 = 210 100 10 = 102 100 2 = 410 1000 10 = 103 1000 2 = 810
Binary Arithmetic .
Arithmetic in the binary system is similar to arithmetic in the decimal system .
a .
The rules for addition are 1 . 0 + 0=0 2 . 1 + 0 = 1 3 . 1 + l= 10 ( 0 with 1 carried )
As an example the sum of the two numbers 1011001 and 1001010 is Carries 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 ------------- 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 b .
The rules for subtraction are : 1 . 0 - 0 = 0 2 . l - l = 0 3 . l - 0 = l 4 . 0 - l = l ( with one borrowed )
As an example the difference of the two numbers 11001011 and 1010110 is Borrows 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 - 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 ------------------
Difference O 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 c.
The multiplication table for binary digits is 1 . 0 x 0 = 0 2 . l x 0 = 0 3 . l x l = l
The rules for multiplication and division in longhand are exactly the same as the rules in the decimal system .
For example the multiplication of 1.011 by 0.110 is 1 . 0 1 1 0 . 1 1 0 ---------- 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 -----------------
1 . 0 0 0 0 1 0 To facilitate the handling of the binary point in binary arithmetic , most computers are constructed so that the binary point is fixed either to the left of the most significant digit or to the right of the least significant digit .
The LGP - 30 is designed to operate on numbers with the binary point left of the most significant digit .
Numbers held in the computer are then represented as fractional quantities with the range of magnitude from +1 to - 1 .
Number Conversion and Scaling .
Let us consider how we might represent the decimal number 19 in the LGP - 30 .
First of all , let us convert 19 into binary .
To do this we first find the largest number representable by a power of 2 which is equal to or smaller than 19 . -
The number in this case is 24 or 16 , or in binary , 10000 .
Conversion is easier to visualize if we represent the binary number as ( 1 x 24 ) + ( 0 x 23 ) + ( 0 x 22 ) + ( 0 x 21 ) + ( 0 x 20 ) With respect to the remainder 19 - 16 = 3 , 21 is the largest power of 2 equal to or less than 3 .
Now we can write a binary representation of 18 based on the fact that it is the sum of numbers which are integral powers of 2 .
That is , 18 = 24+21 = 16+2 , which in binary is 10010 or ( 1 x 24 ) + ( 0 x 23 ) + ( 0 x 22 ) + ( 1 x 21 ) + ( 0 x 20 )
By this time it should be easy to see that 19 in decimal is equivalent to 10011 in binary .
Now that we have converted the number we chose into binary , we need to since the LGP - 30 is a fractional machine .
We can do this by shifting the number far enough right with respect to the places gives .10011 for the representation .
Note that 5 is the smallest number of places we could shift right and still have a fraction .
We keep track of shifts by the scale factor q .
In this case , we say we have 19 at q = 5 .
In a memory location the number word would appear as +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+ ^^ ^ || | || + scaled binary point |+ binary point + sign bit q = 5
If the number we wish to represent is small enough , it is possible to represent it at a negative q .
For instance , 1/8 decimal is equivalent to 0.001 in binary and 0.1 in binary is 1/8 at q = - 2 .
In this case we moved the number two places to the left with respect to the binary point .
In spite of the fact we have given some attention to converting a number here , the LGP - 30 can be programmed to do all such conversion so that the operator may use it as a decimal computer .
M multiplication .
Suppose we consider multiplying 2 and 3 .
In binary 2 is 10 and 3 is 11 .
Each can be represented in the LGP - 30 at a binary scale factor q = 2 .
Hence 2 at q = 2 is .10 and 3 at q = 2 is .11
When we multiply , scale factors add .
The result , then , is 6 at q = 4 , which in binary is .0110 .
The appearance of the operands and the result of an M multiply in the LGP - 30 are as follows :
In the accumulator +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
In memory +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
Result in the accumulator +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
Addition .
If we add 2 and 3 each at q = 2 , the result is 5 at q = 2 which in binary is 1.01 .
Since this number is not fractional , it can not be held in the LGP - 30 .
Hence , although a q = 2 was sufficient for multiplication of 2 and 3 , 3 is the minimum q for adding 2 and 3 .
Numbers can be added only if they are at the same q .
Overflow .
When addition results in a number too large for the LGP - 30 , we say computation overflows .
The result is that the machine stops computing at the add order .
Overflow can occur as the result of subtraction when numbers of opposite signs are the operands .
Overflow due to division can also occur .
Multiplication can never result in overflow since the multiplication of fractions can never result in a number as large as 1 .
Truncation .
An M multiply , however , has another characteristic worth noting .
Suppose we multiply 3 at q = 30 by 2 at q = 2 .
The result should be 6 at q = 32 .
In the accumulator +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
In memory +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
Result in the accumulator +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
The result is 4 at q = 32 instead of 6 at q = 32 .
In other words , part of the result has been lost because the word length is 30 bits .
This type of error is called truncation error and can be minimized by carrying operands for multiplication at as small a q as possible .
In general then , it is desirable to carry numbers at as high a q as possible to avoid overflow and at as small a q as possible to avoid truncation errors .
Division .
Suppose we divide 3 at q = 2 by 2 at q = 2 .
The result is 1.5 at q = 0 since the q of a quotient is the q of the dividend minus the q of the divisor .
This result in binary is 1.1 , which is too large for the machine to hold .
In this case , too , we have an overflow and the LGP - 30 stops computation .
However , if we divide 3 at q = 3 by 2 at q = 2 the result is 1.5 at q = 1 .

In case the result of division includes a remainder , the quotient is rounded to the nearest bit in the thirtieth place .
Negative number representation .
In the LGP - 30 , negative numbers are represented by their complements .
A complement is formed by changing all the ones to zeroes and all the zeroes to ones and then adding one in the thirtieth position .
The complement of 6 at q = 4 is as follows : 6 at q = 4 +-+---------------------------------------------------------+

Subtraction is performed by adding the complement of the number to be subtracted .
Scaling Example .
Let us reexamine the program for ( ( ( a 0 x + a 1 ) x + a 2 ) x + a 3 ) x+ a 4
to see what happens in the accumulator when the program is executed .
Suppose again that x = 1/2 , a 0 = 32 , a 1 = 24 , a 2 = 16 , a 3 = 10 , and a 4 = 1 .
Suppose we convert the numbers representing x and the coefficients into binary .
a 0 = 100000 .
a 1 = 011000 .
a 2 = 001000 . x = O.1 a 3 = 001010 . a 4 = 000001 .
Next , let us scale these numbers .
The minimum q for a 0 is 6 .
Since all the coefficients play similar roles in the program , let us keep them all a q = 6 .
The variable x requires no scaling since it is already a binary fraction .
Now let us examine what happens in the program .
a 0 = .100000 = 32 at q = 6 a 0 x = .010000 = 16 at q = 6 a 0 x + a 1 = .101000 = 40 at q = 6 . . . . . . a 0 x4 + a 1 x3 + a 2 x2 + a 3 x = .001110 = 14 at q = 6 a 0 x4 + a 1 x3 + a 2 x2 + a 3 x + a 4 = .001111 = 15 at q = 6 Suppose , however , in the preceding problem , matters are complicated by having x = I instead of x = 1 /2
Then the minimum q at which we can keep x is 1 .
In this case , the first steps result in a 0 = .100000 = 32 at q = 6 a 0 x = .010000 = 32 at q = 7
Note that we now can no longer add a 1 as we did before because a 1 is at q = 6 and a 0 x is at q = 7 and we are permitted to add terms only if they are at the same q .
One solution to this problem is to enter the coefficients at different q's .
However , this requires a good deal of effort on the part of the operator .
The best solution is to enter the coefficients - in some unconverted and unscaled decimal form and have a program to convert and scale .
Subroutines can be written called floating point routines which can take care of this problem , so that the LGP - 30 can be used as a floating point machine .
Shifting .
One of the essential requirements of such a program is that it scale numbers by shifting .
There are three orders in the LGP - 30 which can be used for shifting , M multiply , N multiply , and divide .
If we M multiply by I at q = I we shift right by 1 .
If we M multiply by I at q = 2 , we shift right by 2 .
And so on .
In the case of divide , if we divide by I at q=s I , we shift left by 1 .
If we divide by I at q = 2 , we shift left by 2 .
And so on .
How we shift with an N multiply is discussed in the next paragraph .
N multiplication .
Suppose , now we are interested in the result of a multiply as a magnitude and not simply as a shift .
If we multiply I at q = 20 in the accumulator by I at q = 20 in memory , the result is I at q = 40 .
The result from M multiplication is lost , since I at q = 40 is not in the most significant half of the product .
However , we have an order which can preserve the least significant half of a product as well as the most significant half .
The order which the LGP - 30 provides for this function is the N multiply .
The instruction n 2000 means : multiply the number in the accumulator by the number in location 2000 and retain the 31st through the 61st bits of the product in the sign position and the 30 magnitude positions of the accumulator .
Note that the sign position in this case represents magnitude and not sign .
The sign of the product is found as a result of the M multiply .
If one of the two operands is negative , the result relates to the sign of the product to the extent that it is complement in form .
Why the thirtieth magnitude position of the result is sometimes significant is shown in the discussion of input and output .
The N multiply can be used for shifting left .
For instance , to N multiply by a 1 at q = 30 shifts left 1 .
To N multiply by a I at 29 shifts left by 2 .
And so on .
Hexadecimal Digits .
A shorthand is useful to indicate each word , since it is somewhat space consuming and time consuming to write out 32 0's and l's .
In order to develop such a shorthand the word is marked off into groups of four bits each to total 32 bits consisting of the sign bit , the 30 magnitude bits , and the spacer bit .
There are 16 possible combination : for any group of four bits .
Hence , each combination of four bits can be represented by one of a group of 16 characters .
The following table shows single character representations for each of the 16 possible combinations and their decimal equivalents .
Decimal and Hexadecimal Equivalents of Binary Numbers Binary Hexadecimal Decimal 0000 0 0 0001 1 1 0010 2 2 0011 3 3 0100 4 4 0101 5 5 0110 6 6 0111 7 7 1000 8 8 1001 9 9 1010 f 10 1011 g 11 1100 j 12 1101 k 13 1110 q 14 1111 w 15
This method of single character representation is , in fact , the number system of base 16 called the hexadecimal system .
Just as there are the two digits 0 and 1 in the number system base 2 and the ten digits 0 through 9 in the number system base 10 , so also there can be digits 0 through W in the number system base 16 .
For Example , we converted the number 19 in decimal into 10011 in binary and scaled to .10011 .
Hence , the binary and hexadecimal equivalents of 19 at a q - 5 as they appear in a word are +-+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|0|1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ ( 4 ) ( j ) ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( 0 )
Scaling for Range .
Suppose we have a problem which requires computing ALQ2 for various values of A , L , and Q but where each variable is confined to a range of values as follows : 12 x 10 - 15 <= A <= 523,000 x 10 - 15 0 <= L <= 9,9999 0 <= Q <= 125,000 and we want our result in the range 0 <= ALQ2 <= 12 but we want our accuracy to supply the third decimal place from 0.000 to 12.000 .
First let us determine the minimum q for values of L. Since 9,999 is the maximum value for L , it determines the minimum q .
We can find the minimum q by referring to the table of powers of 2 .
From this table we see that 213 <= L max <= 214 .
Hence q = 14 is high enough for the minimum q
We can generalize the procedure for finding the minimum q .
If there is a number x such that 2n - 1 <= x < 2n
then q = n is sufficiently large for q min but if x = 2n , q = n is not large enough and q min = n + l is required .
We follow this procedure to determine that for A , q min = - 30 for L , q min = 14 for Q , q min = 17 If we are to provide for the whole range of values for our variables , we must be sure that our program can store the values of these variables at no smaller q's than these .
Table of Powers of 2
( 42 K bytes in size ) Next , by following the rule that multiplication implies the addition of q's , we determine that for AL , q min = - 16 for ALQ , q min = 1 for ALQ2 , q min = 18 Since word length is 30 bits , there are 30 - 18 = 12 bits used for expressing the fractional part of the answer .
Since 2 -12 << 0.001 10 , the result is at a q sufficient to provide the accuracy required .
Note that we might have specified conditions which could not have been met by single precision operation .
Floating point subroutines are available which take care of all such scaling problems as these .
Binary Representation of Orders .
The order part of an instruction is contained in bit positions 12 through 15 in a word .
Each of the 16 order letters is represented by a unique pattern of zeroes and one 's located in these four bit positions .
The following table gives the binary equivalents of the orders .
Binary equivalents of order letters z 0000 b 0001 y 0010 r 0011 i 0100 d 0101 n 0110 m 0111 p 1000 e 1001 u 1010 t 1011 h 1100 c 1101 a 1110 s 1111
INPUT OUTPUT AND CONTROL
Print .
Before discussing how to get information into the LGP - 30 , we must discuss the print order .
A print instruction executes the typewriter keyboard function indicated by the 6 track bit .
A print instruction affects only the typewriter and has no effect on any memory location , the accumulator , or the counter register .
For example , p 2000 has 010100 in the track bits which is the code for a back space on the typewriter .
The execution of p 2000 , then , results in the typewriter 's back spacing .
The following table gives a complete list of typewriter keyboard codes .
The print order provides the means for executing any typewriter function .
The principal method of entering information is by means of paper tape punched with holes representing the keyboard codes .
Hence , in order to enter data , we must have the means of starting the tape reader .
If we are to program the entry of data , we can begin by executing a p 0000 instruction which starts the tape reader .
Although the print instruction is the means we have of creating output , the unique instruction p 0000 is related to input .
Input .
The instruction p 0000 must always be followed , but not necessarily immediately , by the instruction i 0000 , the input instruction .
This instruction transfers the characters read on the tape into the accumulator .
No address portion other than 0000 is ever associated with the input order , and the instruction p 0000 always precedes the instruction i 0000 .
One of the typewriter codes which can appear on the punched paper tape is the stop code .
Its function is to stop the tape reader and to send a start signal to the computer .
After the codes for characters necessary to fill a given word are read from the tape and transferred into the accumulator , a stop code is used .
When the computer receives a start signal , it executes the instruction which follows the i 0000 instruction in memory .
Often this is a clear or hold instruction so that the word which has been filled into the accumulator can be stored in some memory location .
Note that the stop code on the tape is reciprocal in function to the pair of instructions p 0000 and i 0000 in the computer .
The pair stops computation and starts the reader , whereas , the stop code stops the reader and starts computation .
Be sure not to confuse a stop code with a stop order or stop instruction .
A stop instruction can be located in the computer to stop computation but a stop code is always on tape and stops the rape reader .
Two types of input are provided , 4 bit and 6 bit .
Four bit input fills into the accumulator only the first four of the 6 bits representing each character .
Hence , although 000101 represents b and 000110 represents I , both have the same effect on the accumulator when read from tape ( 0001 ) .
When characters are read from tape , they are typed at the same time so that although the codes for 1 and b have the same effect on the computer using four bit input , the typed result is different .
The 6 bit input switch on the computer control console selects 6 bit input when depressed .
For numerical work , the use of 4 bit input is more common .
Since the accumulator is 32 bit positions long , including sign bit and spacer bit , 8 characters are sufficient to fill the accumulator on 4 bit , input .
Hence , a stop code must appear on tape at least every eight characters .
The accumulator is filled four bits at a time from the right hand end .
That is , when the first character is read , it goes into the last four bit positions of the accumulator .
When the next character is read , it occupies the last four bit positions of the accumulator and pushes the first character read into the next to last four bits .
And so on .
If a ninth character , is read , the first character read is lost .
Bootstrap .
Consider , now the following program .
Location Instruction
or Number Operand Results or
Notes 0000 p 0000 . start tape reader 0001 i 0000 .
bring in a word 0002 c ( 2000 ) input word .
0003 b 0002 c( ) . 0004 a 0007 1 at 29 modify c( ) 0005 y 0002 c( ) . 0006 u 0000 . return to input 0007 1 at 29 . .
This program represents the simplest type of input routine , one which simply brings in words and stores them without conversion .
It is called a bootstrap routine .
Note that the initial clear instruction has an address 2000 .
Actually this initial address could be anything from 0008 through 6363 depending on the number of words to be filled .
Hence , we must prepare our input routine to include the initial address into which we wish to fill the words on tape .
Actually , we could modify the routine so that it would use the first word on the tape as the start fill address .
Note also , that although we loop through the instructions repeatedly , there is no need to have a counter .
This is because after the last word has filled and computation returns to the input instruction , there is no further stop code on the tape to stop the tape reader and to send a start signal to the computer .
Hence , the reader continues even after the end of the tape has passed out of the reader and we can stop the reader at our convenience simply by depressing the STOP READ switch on the typewriter .
Now the question arises , " How do we get the bootstrap routine into memory ? "
Our discussion of input so far assumes that there is already an input routine in the computer .
Before discussing the process of entering the bootstrap , there are three things to consider .
Turning Power On .
First , let us consider turning the power on .
Turning on the typewriter is simple .
Just flip the toggle switch to ON .
The typewriter can be turned on even if the computer is not on , but the computer must be plugged in .
To turn on the computer ; Depress MANUAL INPUT switch .
Note that the NORMAL , ONE OPERATION , and MANUAL INPUT switches are interlocked .
The MANUAL INPUT switch can only be depressed after the ONE OPERATION switch is depressed .
Depress the OPERATE switch .
Depress the POWER ON switch .
For fifty seconds the STANDBY light is on to indicate that tubes are at half filament power .
For fifty more seconds the STANDBY TO OPERATE light is on indicating that the tubes are at full filament power and that the drum motor is energized .
When the operate light comes on , the D.C. voltages are applied and the computer is ready for use .
Control Switches .
Second , let us look at some of the other switches on the typewriter and on the control console of the computer .
The CONNECT switch on the typewriter when turned off prevents start signals from passing from the typewriter to the computer and start - read signals from going from the computer to the typewriter .
When the MANUAL INPUT switch on the computer is depressed , keyboard characters typed on or read by the typewriter fill into the accumulator even though the CONNECT switch may be off .
With the MANUAL INPUT switch depressed , recording in the memory is impossible , and therefore pressing the START switch by mistake can do no harm if an error has been made in typing .
The FILL INSTRUCTION switch transfers the contents of the accumulator to the instruction register .
When the ONE OPERATION switch is depressed , pressing the START switch executes one instruction at a time .
The instruction executed is the one contained in the location given by the counter register .
However , if the EXECUTE INSTRUCTION switch is depressed when the ONE OPERATION switch is down , it is the instruction in the instruction register which is executed .
Instruction Representation .
Finally , let us consider the hexadecimal representation of instructions .
Consider , for instance , the binary representation of the instruction c 2710 .
+-+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|0|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 | +-+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ || |10 ->|10 ->| ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( c ) ( 1 ) ( g ) ( 2 ) ( 8 ) Note that there is no problem with the order bits .
If we had filled c 2000 , the address portion of the word in memory would have been wrong but the order part would have been correct .
The track bits appear different because the two highest order track bits belong to one hexadecimal character on input and the lowest four to another .
The sector bits appear different for two reasons .
First , like the track bits they are divided between two hexadecimal characters .
Second , the lowest order sector bit corresponds to a hexadecimal 4 not a I in the last hexadecimal position of the word .
A quick method of conversion is to divide the track number in decimal by 16 to get the first hexadecimal character and then express the decimal remainder as a hexadecimal digit for the second hexadecimal character .
For sector , divide the decimal number for sector by 4 and express the result as a hexadecimal digit .
Then multiply the remainder by 4 and express the result as a hexadecimal digit .
27/16 = 1 (+ remainder ) 27-( lx16 ) = 11 = g 10/4 = 2 (+ remainder ) ( 10 - 2x4 ) x 4 = 8
Filling the Bootstrap .
Now suppose we want to put the instruction p 0000 into location 0000 .
Depress MANUAL INPUT switch on computer control console Turn CONNECT switch off Turn on the typewriter and the computer Type c0000 on typewriter keyboard Depress FILL INSTRUCTION switch Type 000p0000 on typewriter keyboard Depress ONE OPERATION switch ( 8 ) Depress EXECUTE INSTRUCTION switch
The instruction p0000 has now been stored in location 0000 .
Suppose we wish to fill i 0000 into location 000l , The procedure is the same except that we have 000i0000 and the clear instruction is c0004 .
Instead of typing each instruction we could have put on tape c0000'000p0000 ' c0004'000i0000 ' . . . etc .
The apostrophes stand for stop codes .
Then our instruction would be the same except that instruction ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) would be " Depress START READ switch on the typewriter . "
and to fill the entire bootstrap we would add instruction ( 9 ) " Return again to step ( 3 ) until all the words of the bootstrap routine are filled into memory . "
It is important that the CONDITIONAL STOP switch on the typewriter is not depressed .
If it is , one pressing of the START READ switch sends the entire tape through the reader without stopping at the end of each word .
Note that we can express the number which is added to modify the address of the clear instruction as 00000004 16 or z0001 10 since the code for the z order is 0000 2 .
The tape for the whole bootstrap is c0000'000p0000 ' c0004'000i0000 'c0008'000cxxxx 'c000 j '000b0008'c00l0'000a001j ' c0014'000y0008 'c0018'000u0000'c001 j'000z0004 '
Carriage return codes may be interspersed among instructions on the tape in order to limit line length for typing .
When used , carriage return codes should follow the stop orders .
Executing the Bootstrap .
Now let us execute the bootstrap .
Turn CONNECT switch on Depress CLEAR COUNTER switch .
This action puts zero in the counter register so that the next instruction to be executed is the instruction in location 0000 .
Since we usually place a program input routine such as the bootstrap starting in location 0000 , clearing the counter is the quickest way to get to the program input routine .
Either the MANUAL INPUT switch or the ONE OPERATION switch must be down , not the NORMAL switch .
Depress the NORMAL switch Depress the Start switch
When the last word on the tape has been read , depress the STOP READ switch on the typewriter .
Program Input Routine .
The bootstrap input routine described has several shortcomings .
For one thing , it requires manually filling the initial address - of the clear instruction , called the start fill address .
For another , both numbers and instructions must be put in hexadecimal .
However , a simple bootstrap such as this can be used to load another program capable of filling instructions expressed in decimal form , of distinguishing between instructions and data words , and of accepting a word on tape as a start fill instruction .
Such a program input routine is described in the Subroutine Manual for the LGP - 30 .
Executing a Program .
If we wish to execute a program located somewhere other than in 0000 .
we can not use the CLEAR COUNTER switch to reach it .
To transfer manually to any location in memory Turn CONNECT switch off Depress MANUAL INPUT switch on computer control console Type , for instance , u2000 in hexadecimal Depress FILL INSTRUCTION switch Depress ONE OPERATION switch Depress EXECUTE INSTRUCTION switch
At this point 2000 appears in the counter register .
Next , if we depress the NORMAL switch and the START switch , the program beginning in 2000 is executed .
Calling for Data .
The pair p 0000 and i 0000 need not appear only at the beginning of a program input routine .
They can appear in the middle of a program to bring in more data .
We could have added them to the program discussed earlier so that values for x and the coefficients a 0 through a n , could have been brought in from tape .
When these instructions are included in a program , be sure that the CONNECT switch is on .
If the MANUAL switch on the typewriter is depressed when the p 0000 and i 0000 pair are executed , the reader does not start but the MANUAL FILL light on the typewriter comes on .
When this happens data can be entered from the keyboard .
After the desired characters have been typed , depressing the START COMPUTER switch on the typewriter continues execution of the program .
Filling the Spacer .
Typing a character such as 9 for input fills the last four bits of the accumulator so that 1001 appears in the 28th , 29th , 30th , and spacer positions of the accumulator .
Hence , although the spacer for a word in a memory location is always zero , it may be a one in the accumulator .
In order not to lose this bit by storing immediately following accumulator fill , it is often worthwhile to execute an N multiply by a 1 at 30 in order to shift the input word by one bit .
Using the typewriter .
The typewriter handbook covers those functions of the typewriter which do not relate to the computer such as punching a tape .
However , it is worth noting that a good safety precaution in punching tape or otherwise using the typewriter by itself is to turn the CONNECT switch off to prevent the interchange of start signals between the computer and the typewriter and to depress the MANUAL INPUT switch on the computer so that recording in memory is prevented .
Reading the Scope .
An oscilloscope on the LGP - 30 makes it possible to read the contents of the accumulator , the instruction register , and the counter register in binary representation .
Wherever there is a square wave on the scope there is a one stored ; otherwise , there is a zero stored .
For instance , _| - |_|-|
represents 0101 in binary or 5 in decimal .
In ONE OPERATION the LGP - 30 executes a program one at a time as the START switch is depressed .
The middle line on the scope shows a binary representation of the instruction which has been executed as the result of the last depression of the START switch .
The counter register shown on the top line , gives the address of the next instruction to be executed , and the accumulator , shown on the bottom line , shows the results .
In MANUAL INPUT , when the START switch is depressed successively , the contents of successive locations appears in the instruction register .
The counter register , in this case also , gives the address of the location following the one shown in the instruction register .
No change in the appearance of the accumulator occurs in this mode of operation since the contents of locations are simply being observed and instructions are not being executed .
In ONE OPERATION the same instructions appear successively in the instruction register as in MANUAL INPUT except in the case of unconditional transfer instructions and test instructions which may result in a transfer .
Break Points .
If computation is to stop , the address portion of the stop instruction is usually of no significance .
However , the stop order has a special ' characteristic .
If there is a one in the third bit from the right hand end of the track portion of a stop instruction , -------------- bit numbers
----------------------------
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 -------------- bit values

(----------)(------------) order bits track bits sector bits = z = 4 = 00 computation does not stop if break point switch 4 on the console of the computer is depressed .
There is a similar relationship between the stop ) order and each of the other four break point switches as follows : Track bits Break Point Switch 000100 4 001000 8 010000 16 100000 32 Break points may be combined .
For instance , if a track number in a stop instruction is 010100 , computation fails to stop if either break point switch 4 or 16 is depressed .
Transfer Control .
The test order has one special characteristic .
If it is stored in memory with a one in the sign position -------------- bit numbers
----------------------------
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 -------------- bit values

(----------)(------------) | order bits track bits sector bits | = t = 20 = 00 one in sign position the instruction acts like a test instruction unless the " transfer control " switch on the console of the computer is depressed .
If the " transfer control " switch is depressed , the test instruction acts like an unconditional transfer instruction , regardless of whether a one or a zero is in the sign bit of the word in the accumulator .
Printing Out .
When a print instruction other than p 0000 is executed , a signal goes to the typewriter to execute a typewriter character or function such as the letter " a " or a carriage return .
However , unlike the case when there is an input instruction following the print instruction , computation does not stop .
After the typewriter has executed the character or function it sends a start signal to the computer .
Hence , it is desirable to have computation in the computer stop before the completion of character execution at the typewriter .
Therefore , a stop instruction should follow a print instruction .
Since the execution of a typewriter character requires about 6 drum revolutions computation requiring up to 6 drum revolutions may occur between a print instruction and the following stop instruction .
Turning Power Off .
To turn power off , first depress the MANUAL INPUT switch and then depress the POWER OFF switch .
In MANUAL INPUT mode of operation , recording in the memory is impossible so that transients occurring when the LGP - 30 is turned off cannot affect the contents of memory .
It is possible to depress the STANDBY switch so that only half tube filament power remains on .
When the machine is not to be used for some time period during a shift of operation , the LGP - 30 can be maintained in STANDBY mode of operation rather than in OPERATE mode so that tube life can be extended .
In switching to STANDBY as in turning power on or off be sure that the MANUAL INPUT switch is depressed first .
SUMMARY OF ORDERS
An instruction consists of an order part such as the letter b for bring and an address part such as the number 2000 to designate a memory location .
All instructions have a similar appearance in an LGP - 30 word .
The order bits occupy positions 12 through 15 of the word and the address bits occupy positions 18 through 29 of the word .
For instance , the instruction b 2000 appears as -------------- bit numbers
----------------------------
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 -------------- bit values

The following pages describe the orders of the LGP - 30 and give examples of instructions using the orders for which the address part is usually 2000 .
For all of these cases the appearance of the instruction in a word is as given above except for the order bits .
Bring from Memory :
Letter designation :
b which is equivalent to 0001 binary , 1 decimal , 1 hexadecimal
Example of a bring order as used in an instruction : b 2000 Meaning :
Replace the contents of the accumulator with the contents of memory location 2000 .
The contents of memory location 2000 is unaffected .
This order is equivalent to a reset and add order in some other computers .
Hold and Store :
Letter designation :
h which is equivalent to 1100 binary , 12 decimal , j hexadecimal
Example of a hold order as used in an instruction : h 2000 Meaning :
Replace the contents of memory location 2000 with the contents of the accumulator .
The contents of the accumulator is unaffected .
This order is equivalent to a write order in some other computers .
Clear and Store :
Letter designation :
c which is equivalent to 1101 binary , 13 decimal , k hexadecimal
Example of a clear order as used in an instruction : c 2000 Meaning : Replace the contents of memory location 2000 with the contents of the accumulator and replace the contents of the accumulator with zero .
This order is equivalent to a write and reset order in some other computers .
Store Address :
Letter designation : y which is equivalent to 0010 binary , 2 decimal , 2 hexadecimal Example of a store address order as used in an instruction : y 2000 Meaning :
Replace the contents of the address portion of the word in memory location 2000 with the contents of the address portion of the word in the accumulator .
The contents of the accumulator is unaffected .
Notes :
If the word in the accumulator before execution of the instruction y 2000 is an a 3000 and the word in memory location 2000 is a b 5000 the result in memory location 2000 after execution is b 3000 .
Unconditional transfer ;
Letter designation :
u which is equivalent to 1010 binary , 10 decimal , f hexadecimal
Example of an unconditional transfer order as used in an instruction : u 2000 Meaning :
Replace the number in the counter register with the contents of the address portion of the unconditional transfer instruction .
Notes :
Normally instructions are executed in sequence according to memory location .
For instance , if b 3000 is located in 1000 and h 4000 is located in 1001 , the hold instruction is executed immediately after the bring instruction .
This is governed by the fact that during the execution of the instruction located in 1000 , one is added to the 1000 that already exists in the counter register .
After execution of the instruction in 1000 , the counter register gives the address of the next instruction to be executed ; in this case , the instruction in 1001 .
However , if instead of b 3000 the instruction u 2000 had been located in 1000 , 2000 would be in the counter register after execution of the u instruction , and the instruction in 2000 would follow the instruction in 1000 instead of the instruction in 1001 .
Hence , computation is transferred to location 2000 .
Most instructions affect or use the contents of the accumulator but unconditional transfer and return address instructions affect the counter register .
Return address ;
Letter designation :
r which is equivalent to 0011 binary , 3 decimal , 3 hexadecimal
Example of a return address order as used in an instruction : r2000 Meaning ;
Add one to the contents of the counter register and replace the address portion of memory location 2000 with the contents of the counter register .
Notes ;
If the word in memory location 2000 is u 0000 before execution of the return address instruction and if the return address instruction is located in 1000 , the result after execution is u 1002 in memory location 2000 .
This type of instruction is almost always used before a u instruction .
The purpose of this pair of instructions is to execute a block of instructions not in normal sequence .
For instance
This program segment shows that the r and u instructions allow computation to transfer from the 1000 , 1001 , 1002 , 1003 sequence into the 1900 through 2000 sequence and then to transfer back to the 1004 , 1005 , etc. sequence .
Test :
Letter designation ;
t which is equivalent to 1011 binary , 11 decimal , g hexadecimal
Example of a test order as used in an instruction .
t 2000 Meaning ;
If a one is in the sign bit of the word in the accumulator , the test instruction has the effect of an unconditional transfer .
If a zero is in the sign bit of the word in the accumulator , the next following instruction in normal sequence is executed .
Note A :
Since a zero in the accumulator has a zero in the sign bit , a test instruction goes on to the next instruction in normal sequence if the word in the accumulator is zero or positive and transfers if the word in the accumulator is negative .
For instance , if the word in the accumulator is zero and t 2000 is located in 1000 , the next instruction to be executed is the one located in 1001 .
Note B :
The test order has one special characteristic .
If it is stored memory with a one in the sign position , -------------- bit numbers
----------------------------
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 -------------- bit values
-----------------------------
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ^ (-------)
(----------)(------------) | order bits track bits sector bits | = t = 20 = 00 one in sign position the instruction acts like a test instruction unless the " transfer control " switch on the console of the computer is depressed .
If the " transfer control " switch is depressed , the test instruction acts like an unconditional transfer instruction , regardless of whether a one or a zero is in the sign bit of the word in the accumulator .
Stop :
Letter designation :
z which is equivalent to 0000 binary , 0 decimal , 0 hexadecimal
Example of a stop order as used in an instruction : z 2000 Meaning ;
Stop computation .
Note A ;
When the computer begins computation in normal operation , each instruction is executed in sequence according to memory location as fast as the computer can execute them .
A stop instruction is the method used to prevent the computer from going on to some sequence of instructions other than those required for solving the problem at hand .
Note B : If computation is to stop , the address portion of the stop instruction is usually of no significance .
However , the stop order has a special characteristic .
If there is a one in the third bit from the right hand end of the track portion of a stop instruction , -------------- bit numbers
----------------------------
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 -------------- bit values
-----------------------------
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (-------)
(-----------)(------------) order bits track bits sector bits = t = 04 = 00 computation does not , stop if break point switch 4 on the console of the computer is depressed .
There is a similar relationship between the stop order and each of the other four break point switches as follows : Track bits Break Point Switch 000100 4 001000 8 010000 16 100000 32 Break points may be combined .
For instance , if a track number in a stop instruction is 010100 , computation fails to stop if either break point switch 4 or 16 is depressed .
Print :
Letter designation :
p which is equivalent to 1000 binary , 8 decimal , 8 hexadecimal Example of a print order as used in an instruction : p 2000 Meaning :
Execute the typewriter keyboard function indicated by the 6 track bits .
The print order has no effect on the contents of any memory location , the accumulator , or the counter register .
Notes :
For example , p 2000 has 010100 in the track bits which is the code for a back space on the typewriter .
The execution of p 2000 , then , results in the typewriter 's back spacing .
A table in the section INPUT OUTPUT AND CONTROL gives a complete list of typewriter keyboard codes .
The print order provides the means for the execution of any typewriter function by the computer .
Special note must be made of the instruction p 0000 ; that is , the execution of typewriter keyboard code 000000 .
This instruction starts the tape reader as necessary for bringing from tape words for storage in the memory .
The instruction p 0000 is always followed in memory but not necessarily immediately by i 0000 , the input instruction .
After a p 0000 instruction starts the tape reader , an i 0000 instruction transfers into the last 4 bit positions of the accumulator the first 4 bits of the typewriter code for the first character read on the tape .
When the second character is read , the bits representing the first character are shifted into the next to last four bit positions of the accumulator and the first four bits of the typewriter code of the second character on tape are placed in the last four bit positions of the accumulator .
This process continues indefinitely until a stop code ( 100000 ) appears on the tape .
The stop code stops the tape reader and sends a start signal to the computer so that the instruction following i 0000 in memory is executed .
Often this next instruction is a hold or clear instruction so that the characters read into the accumulator can be stored in some memory location .
It is never desirable to have more than eight characters to be filled into memory preceding a stop code on tape .
If more characters are on tape , the four bits in the accumulator representing the first of the nine characters is shifted out of the accumulator and lost when the ninth character on the tape is read .
The p 0000 i 0000 combination is reciprocal in function to the stop code on tape ; that is , it stops computation and starts the tape reader , whereas the stop code on tape stops the tape reader and starts computation .
This combination is also required for manual input as well as for tape input .
When the MANUAL switch on the typewriter is depressed , the execution of p 0000 and i 0000 instructions stops computation but turns on the MANUAL FILL light on the typewriter instead of starting the tape reader .
When the MANUAL FILL light is on , characters typed on the keyboard enter the accumulator as they enter when read from tape .
When the characters desired have been typed , depressing the START COMPUTER switch on the typewriter sends a start signal to the computer .
When a print instruction other than p 0000 is executed , a signal goes to the typewriter to execute a typewriter character of function such as the letter " a " or a carriage return .
However , unlike the case when there is an input instruction following the print instruction , computation does not stop .
After the typewriter has executed the character or function , it sends a start signal to the computer .
Hence , it is desirable to have computation in the computer stop before the completion of character execution at the typewriter .
Therefore , a stop instruction should follow a print instruction .
Since the execution of a typewriter character requires about 6 drum revolutions , computation requiring up to 6 drum revolutions may occur between a print instruction and the following stop instruction .
Input :
Letter designation ; i which is equivalent to 0100 binary , 4 decimal , 4 hexadecimal
Example of an input order as used in an instruction : i 0000 Notes :
The address portion of an instruction constructed from this order i 0000 Notes :
The address portion of the instruction constructed from this order is always 0000 .
It is always preceded by the instruction p 0000 .
Refer to the notes under print order for an explanation of its meaning .
Add
Letter designation : a which is equivalent to 1110 binary , 14 decimal , q hexadecimal
Example of an add order as used in an instruction : a 2000 Meaning :
Add the contents of memory location 2000 to the contents of the accumulator and place the result in the accumulator .
The contents of memory location 2000 is unaffected .
Notes :
Suppose we consider adding a 2 in memory location 2000 to a 3 in the accumulator each scaled to a q == 3 .
A scale factor q = 3 is equivalent to considering the number to be shifted 3 places to the right with respect to the binary point .
The appearance of the words before execution is as follows :
-------------- bit numbers
----------------------------
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 -------------- bit values
-----------------------------
In location 2000 : 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the accumulator : 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The result in the accumulator after execution is : 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Note that although the numbers 2 and 3 could have been expressed at a scale factor q = 2 , the result could not .
In such a case we say that the accumulator overflows .
The machine is designed to stop computation if such a situation arises .
To prevent overflow it is necessary to carry the numbers to be added at a high enough q .
It is possible , of course , to shift so far to the right as to lose significant digits .
For example , a 3 at q = 31 appears in memory only as a 2 at 31 since the word is 30 bits long .
Hence , the criteria which determine the scale factor at which to perform additions are ( 1 ) to carry the number far enough left to prevent loss of significant digits and ( 2 ) to carry it far enough right to prevent overflow .
Note , too , that two numbers must be added at the same scale factor q .
The result of adding 2 at 3 and 3 at 4 , for instance , would be 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 which is not 5 at any scale factor and hence has no significance in relation to the process of adding 2 and 3 .
Subtract :
Letter designation ;
s which is equivalent to 1111 binary , 15 decimal , w hexadecimal
Example of a subtract order as used in an instruction : s 2000 Meaning ;
Subtract the contents of memory location 2000 from the contents of the accumulator and place the result in the accumulator .
The contents of memory location 2000 is unaffected .
Notes :
If the number in memory location is of the same sign as the number in the accumulator , the result of subtraction is a number smaller in absolute value than the larger of the two numbers .
Hence , in such a case , overflow as described under add cannot occur .
However , if the numbers are of opposite sign , overflow can occur and the numbers must be scaled as described in the notes under add in this summary .
Negative numbers are represented in the LGP - 30 by a complement formed as follows .
Change all the ones to zeroes and all the zeroes to ones and add a one in the thirtieth bit position .
The process of subtraction is accomplished by complementing the minuend and adding the complement to the subtrahend .
For instance , suppose we subtract 2 from 5 each held at a scale factor q = 3 .
In memory : 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the accumulator : 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Complement of minuend : 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Result in accumulator : 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The result , of course , is 3 at a scale factor q = 3 .
M Multiply :
Letter designation :
m which is equivalent to 0111 binary , 7 decimal , 7 hexadecimal
Example of an M multiply order as used in an instruction : m 2000 Meaning ;
Multiply the number in the accumulator by the number in memory location 2000 and place the most significant thirty bits of the product in the accumulator .
The contents of memory location 2000 is unaffected .
Notes :
In general , the multiplication of two numbers results in a product which has as many digits as the sum of the number of digits in the multiplier and the multiplicand .
For instance , the product of 9 , a one digit number , and 12 , a two digit number , is 108 , a three digit number .
In the LGP - 30 , a word in memory has 30 binary digits of magnitude .
A word in the accumulator may have as many as 31 binary digits of magnitude , if the spacer bit is filled on input .
Hence , a multiplication in the LGP - 30 can result in a product with 61 magnitude bits .
The result of an M multiply order is the sign bit and the 30 most significant bits of the 61 bit product .
Multiplication requires the addition of scale factors .
For instance ( 0.2 ) ( .03 ) = ( .006 ) can be interpreted in terms of scale factors as 2 ( at a scale factor of 1 ) times 3 ( at a scale factor of 2 ) equals 6 ( at a scale factor of 3 ) .
As an example of an M multiply , suppose we multiply 3 at a scale factor q = 3 in the accumulator by 2 at a scale factor q = 4 in memory location 2000 .
The result in the accumulator is 6 at a scale factor of q = 7 .
In the accumulator : 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In memory : 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Result : 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
As noted under add in this appendix , numbers to be added must be at the same scale factor .
Hence , it is sometimes necessary to shift one of the numbers to be added so that it is at the same scale factor as the other .
For instance , in the example above , the number in memory can as well be interpreted as I at a scale factor q = 3 as 2 at a scale factor q = 4 .
The result then can be interpreted a ; 3 at a scale factor q = 6 .
Hence we can shift a number to the right using an M multiply by an amount equal to the scale factor at which we carry the I in the multiplier .
In this case we shifted 3 from a scale factor q - 3 to a scale factor q = 6 .
Note that an M multiply can result only in a shift to the right because all numbers in the LGP - 30 must be scaled to less than one since the binary point is at the left - hand end of the accumulator .
Hence , an M multiply is sometimes referred to as a fractional multiply .
Let us consider another example .
Suppose we multiply 3.25 at a scale factor q = 15 in the accumulator by 2 at a scale factor q = 15 in memory location 2000 .
The result in the accumulator is 6.5 at a scale factor q = 30 .
Result : 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 Note that the result when an M multiply is used , is 6 at a scale factor q = 30 instead of 6.5 .
The reason is that it requires 31 bits to express 0.5 at a scale factor q = 30 and only the most significant 30 bits of the 61 bit product are retained by an M multiply .
Note that the last bit in the above representation of the result is the spacer bit which is always zero as a result of an M multiply .
This example also serves to point out the fact that an M multiply results in a truncated , not a rounded product .
Another type of multiply , the N multiply , is described in the section that follows .
N multiply :
Letter designation : n which is equivalent to 0110 binary , 6 decimal , 6 hexadecimal Example of an N multiply order as used in an instruction : n 2000 Meaning :
Multiply the number in the accumulator by the number in memory location 2000 and place the least significant thirty - one magnitude bits of the product in the sign bit and thirty magnitude bits of the accumulator .
The contents of memory location 2000 is unaffected , Notes :
As discussed in the section under M multiply , multiplication in the LGP - 30 can result in a product with 61 magnitude bits .
The result of an N multiply is the least significant 31 bits of the 61 bit product .
Note that there is no truncation since the result of the N multiply includes the bit of least significance of the entire 61 bit product .
The sign position as well as the thirty magnitude bit positions of the accumulator must be used to hold the thirty - one bits resulting from an N multiply .
Since the sign position is required to represent a magnitude bit , there is no room in the accumulator for holding the sign bit of the product resulting from an N multiply .
To N multiply by a 1 at q == 30 shifts the multiplicand left by 1 place .
To N multiply by a 1 at q = 29 shifts left 2 places , and so on .
Therefore , an N multiply by a 1 at q = 1 shifts left 30 places ,
This provides a left shift symmetrical with the right shift of the M multiply with which a 1 at q = 1 shifts right 1 and a 1 at q = 30 shifts right 30 .
As pointed out in the discussion of the M multiply , scale factors add .
As an example , suppose we N multiply 3 at q = 31 in the accumulator by 2 at q = 30 in memory .
Note that this implies that there is a one in the spacer of the accumulator .
In the accumulator : 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 In memory : 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 Result : 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
The result , of course , is 6 at q = 61 .
Note that the result of M multiplying these numbers would be a zero accumulator .
The N multiply provides a left shift just as the M multiply provides a right shift .
The above example can be interpreted as the multiplication of 3 at q =- 31 in the accumulator by 1 at 29 in memory .
The result , then , is 3 at q = 29 in the accumulator .
In other words we have shifted the 3 two places .
In an example discussed under M multiply , part of the product was lost , namely 0.5 .
The result 6.0 occurred instead of 6.5 .
If an N multiply is executed with the same operands , the result in the accumulator is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 which is , in this case , 0.5 at q = 31 .
Hence , the one in the sign position represents , in this case , magnitude and not sign .
However , if one of the operands is negative , the sign of the product is represented to the extent that the result of the N multiply is complement in form although the sign bit is not included .
The shifting right by an M multiply has led to calling the M multiply the fractional multiply .
Since the N multiply shifts left , it is sometimes referred to as the integral multiply .
Note that there can never be overflow with either type of multiply since multiplication always results in the addition of q's and hence can never result in a number that is as large as I at q = 0 .
Divide :
Letter designation :
d which is equivalent to 0101 binary , 5 decimal , 5 hexadecimal
Example of a divide order as used in an instruction : d 2000 Meaning ;
Divide the number in the accumulator by the number in memory location 2000 and place the quotient rounded to thirty bits in the accumulator
The contents of memory location 2000 is unaffected .
Notes :
Suppose we divide Sat q = 2 by 2 at q = 2 .
The result is 1.5 at q = 0 since the q of a quotient is the q of the dividend minus the q of the divisor .
This result in binary is 1.1 , which is too large for the machine to hold .
In this case , too , we have an overflow and the LGP - 30 stops computation .
However , if we divide 3 at q = 3 by 2 at q = 2 the result is 1.5 at q = 1 .
In the accumulator : 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In memory : 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The result in the accumulator : 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In case the result of division includes a remainder , the quotient is rounded to the nearest bit in the thirtieth place .
Extract :
Letter designation ;
e which is equivalent to 1001 binary , 9 decimal , 9 hexadecimal
Example of an extract order as used in an instruction : e 2000 Meaning ;
Place zeroes in the word in the accumulator wherever there are zeroes in location 2000 but otherwise leave the word in the accumulator unchanged .
The contents of location 2000 is unaffected .
Notes ;
More than one kind of data may be stored in a given word .
For instance , a calendar date consists of three types of data : month , day an year .
A word with these three types of data might look this way .
+-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
( month ) ( day ) ( year )
Sometimes it is desirable to deal with only one of the three pieces of data .
The extract order makes it possible to separate different data stored in one word .
The instruction e 2000 means : put zeroes in the wore in the accumulator wherever there are zeroes in the word in location 200 ( but otherwise leave the word in the accumulator unchanged .
For instance ; if the above data word is in the accumulator and in location 2000 is the word +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
| 1|1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
( month ) then the result in the accumulator is the following word which contains only the month part of the date .
+-+---------------------------------------------------------+
|0|1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | +-+---------------------------------------------------------+
( month )
The word in location 2000 is called the extract mask .
It is possible with another extract instruction and mask to retain the day and not the month or the year , or to retain any part of any given word in the accumulator .
The extract order achieves its result by multiplying bits in corresponding positions of the extract mask and the accumulator .
That is , if there is a one in position 29 of both words , there is a one in position 29 of the result ; otherwise , there is a zero .

Samsung Launches First PCs with NAND Flash - based Solid State Disk Posted on 24 - May - 2006 08:47 | Filed under : Notebooks
Posted on 24 - May - 2006 08:47
Filed under : News
Samsung Electronics Co. , Ltd. is planning to release the first PCs embedded with a 32 - Gigabyte ( GB ) NAND flash - based solid state disk ( SSD ) .
The Samsung Q1 , an ultra-mobile computing device and the Q30 , a 12.1 - inch screen notebook PC , will be available in the Korean market from early June .
This marks the first time that NAND flash has moved into a commercial mobile computing application and is a breakthrough that will pave the way for replacing hard disk drives with NAND flash - based memory disks .
The company says the data in flash memory are much more secure against external shocks that can occur when transporting a mobile computer .
The SSD can withstand about twice the impact that would damage a regular hard disk drive .
In addition , stored data can be more easily retrieved from flash memory than traditional hard drives when PCs are dropped or liquid is spilled on the device .
The SSD reads at 53MB /s and writes at 28 MB /s .
According to test results released by Samsung .
Microsoft Windows XP will boot up 25 - 50 % faster on the SSD than on other drives .
Also , the typical 1.8 - inch hard disk drive weighs around 50 grams ; whereas the SSD is 20 to 30 grams lighter , depending on the package type .
The typical notebook PC will generate around 30 dB of operating noise , while the Q30 - SSD will operate in complete silence .
A promise of the Q1 - SSD is to show video or still photos as well as play audio without having to be booted up first .
This " instant on " feature provides access to multimedia content such as digital multimedia broadcasting ( DMB ) TV , with DMB TV receivers embedded in both PCs .
The retail price for the Q1 - SSD will be KRW2.3 million ( US $ 2,430 ) , while the Q30 - SSD will sell for KRW3.5 million ( US $ 3,700 ) .
The NT - Q30 - SSD will run on an Intel Celeron M 753 ( 1.2GHz ) , and have 512MB DDR2 400MHz memory installed .
The display on this model is a WXGA 12.1 " ( 1280x768 ) .
The NT - Q1 - SSD runs on an Intel Celeron M ( 900MHz ) and comes with 512MB DDR2 400MHz memory plus a 7 " WVGA ( 800x480 ) display .

That sound you hear is former Iraq war supporters scrambling to cover their asses :
Richard Perle Regarded as one of the intellectual godfathers of the war , Perle changed his tack in November , admitting that " huge mistakes were made " in the invasion of Iraq .
" The levels of brutality we 've seen are truly horrifying , " he added . [ snip ]
Colonel Tim Collins
The Army colonel made a famous rousing speech to troops on the eve of battle .
But in September 2005 , he declared : " History might notice the invasion has arguably acted as the best recruiting sergeant for al - Qa'ida ever . "
Yes , they 're all admitting it was a mistake , and has turned out to be an absolute disaster .
However , as the graphic indicates , Tony Blair still stands by his man , George W. Bush .
I mean , I almost a little hope for Blair when I read this on the BBC News website :
Tony Blair has agreed with the incoming US defence secretary 's assessment that the war in Iraq is not being won .
Asked by Tory leader David Cameron at prime minister 's questions if he agreed with Robert Gates ' assessment of the war , Mr Blair said : " Of course . "
Right on , Tony !
Oh ... wait , he was n't finished :
In response to Mr Cameron during PMQs [ Prime Minister 's Questions ] , Mr Blair said : " What 's important however is that we go on to succeed in the mission we set ourselves . "
It looks like the good ship " Mission Accomplished " " Complete the Mission " has only a skeleton crew left : Captain George W. Bush , and his sidekick Tony Blair .
Pretty sad .
Valerie Wilson , the former Central Intelligence Agency officer whose identity was publicly disclosed three years ago , has agreed to sell her memoir for a little more than $ 2.5 million , according to people involved in the bidding process for the book .
The book , whose working title is " Fair Game , " is scheduled to be published in the fall of 2007 by Crown Publishing , an imprint of Random House .
Steve Ross , senior vice president and publisher of Crown , said the book would be Ms. Wilson 's " first airing of her actual role in the American intelligence community , as well as the prominence of her role in the lead - up to the war . "
Ms. Wilson , he added , " has been this mysterious woman at the very eye of a major storm , and the concentric circles keep widening . "
Ms. Wilson 's name first appeared in a column by Robert D. Novak , the syndicated columnist , in 2003 , spawning a full - scale Washington scandal that ensnared several government officials and journalists .
The special prosecutor assigned to the leak case , Patrick J. Fitzgerald , has already brought perjury and obstruction of justice charges against I. Lewis Libby , the former chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney , stemming from his investigation , and the inquiry continues .
Karl Rove , the presidential adviser , recently testified before the grand jury in the case .

A key feature of the Google Web Toolkit ( GWT ) is that it allows developers to write browser - hosted Web applications entirely in Java , and have GWT translate that Java code into browser - specific JavaScript .
In this interview with Artima , Scott Blum , the Google software engineer behind GWT 's Java - to - JavaScript compiler , talks about the challenges of turning Java source code into JavaScript .
Last week , Google announced that it had fully open - sourced its Google Web Toolkit , or GWT , a set of tools that enables Java developers to code up interactive , browser - based applications in Java , and then have GWT automagically convert that Java application into browser - specific JavaScript .
At the heart of GWT is a Java - to - JavaScript compiler that performs extensive static analysis on Java source files , and then outputs highly optimized JavaScript translations of the Java source code .
The compiler output is tailored to satisfy the idiosyncrasies of the four most popular Web browsers in use today .
Artima spoke with Scott Blum , the Google software engineer behind GWT 's Java - to - JavaScript compiler .
Frank Sommers : Could you start by giving us an overview of the GWT development process ?
Scott Blum :
The basic idea is that you write your application in Java , debug it in Java , and then our compiler takes your Java program and turns it into JavaScript .
In order to allow us to do a lot of optimization , the basic strategy the compiler takes is monolithic compilation .
That 's our mantra .
We figure out the exact and complete set of classes in your application , and where the entry point to your application is , and we use that constraint system to allow us to do a lot of really neat optimizations .
For example , suppose you have an application that is written in terms of the List interface , because you are a good object - oriented developer and use abstract types .
But let 's say that you only ever instantiate the ArrayList as a concrete implementation of List .
Everywhere we make a call to a List method , we figure out at compile time that that 's actually a call to an ArrayList method , and in cases where it 's appropriate , we actually inline that call .
Probably the biggest advantage that brings to the table is when we compile for different platforms : we bring in only classes that are specific to that platform .
For example , when we 're compiling for Firefox , we only bring the DOM implementation for Firefox into the compile .
That cuts down the code size , which is a very important thing for us .
Frank Sommers :
What are the biggest differences in the JavaScript the GWT generates for the various browsers ?
Scott Blum :
It turns out that at the language level most of the browsers are pretty uniform .
The actual JavaScript programming model itself is implemented fairly consistently .
We do n't really have a lot in the way of specific idioms we use on particular browsers at the compilation level .
In fact , the compiler does n't have any special knowledge of the browser that 's being targeted .
The main differences come in when you start dealing with the DOM on different browsers , and when dealing with the browser UI - level events , or the object model the browser exposes .
We are able to keep that part of the problem contained away in specific classes that are targeted towards individual browsers .
The compiler does n't really have any first - hand knowledge of those differences .
The GWT compile system brings in the appropriate classes for the browser , and that class contains the implementation details .
Frank Sommers :
What happens to a Java class when it 's compiled into JavaScript ?
Scott Blum : JavaScript does n't really have a well - defined class system :
It 's a prototype - based language .
There are idioms that people follow in JavaScript to do things that are very similar to what you 'd do in Java classes .
There is more flexibility with what you can do in JavaScript that , in some ways , I 'd say is more rope [ to hang yourself with ] .
The point , though , is that it 's pretty easy to implement Java 's ideas of classes in JavaScript , because JavaScript is slightly more flexible .
For example , if we have a Java class that we 're translating into JavaScript , we 'll create a class seed function , a constructor function , for that class .
And then we add all the fields and polymorphic methods to that prototype , so that when you go to instantiate , say , a Button in Java code , what you actually get is a call to that constructor function in JavaScript that returns the translated version of the class .
The methods pretty much are translated on a method - by - method basis .
If you look at the un-obfuscated version of our compiler output and compare that to the original Java source code , there is a high degree of correlation .
You could pretty much follow the output JavaScript and be able to figure out where in your source code that came from .
Frank Sommers :
What are prototype - based objects ?
Scott Blum :
The way JavaScript works is that objects have what 's called a prototype chain .
When you 're trying to look up some field foo on a particular object [ that is assigned to ] , say , some variable X , the first thing [ the JavaScript interpreter ] does is look in X to see if X has a foo .
If X does , then you get whatever value happens to be there .
If it does n't , [ the interpreter ] walks up the prototype chain to X 's prototype object , and sees if it has one .
It will walk up that chain [ to ] as many prototype parents as there are , until it gets to the end of the chain .
If it has n't found that still at the end , then you get an undefined back .
We were able to take this construct and map on the Java idea of superclasses .
For example , we set up the constructor function for Object , and set up a prototype that has just hashCode , equals , and toString .
For any classes that we derive from that , we start with an instance of Object , which becomes the prototype for some more specialized subclass , and so on down the chain .
Frank Sommers :
What types of Java code are the hardest to translate to JavaScript ?
Scott Blum :
The most difficult aspect is that Java 's exact behavior is very highly specified .
For example , when you have a class that 's being initialized in its constructor , there are rules governing when the superclass constructor gets called , when you can make polymorphic method calls to your subclass , evaluation order , things like that .
There are a whole series of those issues that are precisely specified .
That makes it difficult to have an accurate compiler , because there are a lot of corner cases you have to worry about .
Sometimes the most natural and efficient thing you might want to do does n't actually end up doing the right thing .
Most people would never run into most of those cases , but it does make writing a compiler quite difficult .
If they left things a bit looser , a little more unspecified , most people would never know or care about them , but it would make implementing a correct compiler a lot easier .
Frank Sommers :
You mentioned that browser - specific functionality is brought into the compile process from external libraries .
Can you explain how that works ?
: We have a general mechanism in the compile process that we call deferred binding .
It gives you the ability to replace classes wholesale at compile time .
Imagine that you have an abstract DOM class , and that you want that to be replaced at compile time with a concrete version that would be exactly tailored to the platform you 're on .
Through deferred binding , you set up rules in your project configuration that allow you to specify under what conditions particular classes get swapped in for other classes .
For a basic application , most developers would n't have to worry about this because that 's already built into our libraries .
It 's part of how our metadata gets inherited .
But this is something you can take advantage of if you provide browser - specific implementations of your own class library .
When the compiler goes to compile something , it looks at a set of properties and generates one permutation of the compile for each of the possible states of a property .
For example , there is a user agent property that has one of four different values —
Firefox , IE , Opera , or Safari .
The compiler will generate four versions of your application , one tailored for each one of those .
If the first permutation is Firefox , it comes up with the Firefox implementation of the DOM as being the correct replacement class , and the next time around , it will come up with one for IE , and so on .
In addition to just being able to replace classes with already written classes , the other powerful facility is to generate classes on the fly during compilation .
You can run a generator which will spit out new classes that can be subclasses of classes you 've already defined in your project .
That is how our RPC mechanism works .
All the code to serialize and deserialize your object gets generated at compile time .
Frank Sommers :
Once you have those browser - specific versions , how do you deploy them so that each browser gets only the code aimed for it ?
Scott Blum :
When the compiler generates each of the browser - targeted output files , it also generates something we call a selection script .
That is a JavaScript file that runs on the client during the GWT bootstrap process , and runs any of the logic needed on the client browser to determine what their correct property values are .
Based on those property values , the script generates the request for one of the possible compiler output permutations .
So a Firefox user will get the outerHTML for the page , which will include this selection script .
The selection script realizes it 's running on Firefox , and that will cause it to request as its next script the right compiler output .
As a user , all you really have to worry about is copying the output from your compiler directory to your Web server .
Frank Sommers :
You said earlier that JavaScript is more flexible than Java .
In what way do you take advantage of more flexibility in JavaScript to get , say , better performance , or more concise code ?
Scott Blum :
We definitely try to take advantage of tricks in JavaScript to make [ the generated code ] more efficient in both size and speed .
One thing to point out is JavaScript 's support of the JSON format , which we use in a couple of places .
In the compiler , we use that to be able to wrap and construct objects with a very small amount of syntax .
It 's actually quite fast .
JSON has an object notation syntax that allows you to use an open brace , and then a bunch of identifiers , with colons separating them from their values , followed by a close brace .
We can use that syntax to very quickly construct what an object would look like in code , instead of having to explicitly assign every single identifier .
The other place we use it in is our RPC — we use JSON as our RPC wire format .
That allows us to very quickly serialize and deserialize things that go over the wire .
That cuts down on the amount of processing that has to be done .
Frank Sommers :
In addition to excellent Java developer tools , what do you think are the biggest differences for a developer between writing a browser - based application in Java versus writing that app directly in JavaScript ?
Scott Blum :
The biggest difference is not so much what the program might eventually do , or its general performance characteristics — although I think GWT has really good performance characteristics .
To me , the real story is that when you write some large piece of code in JavaScript , the more [ code ] you write , the harder it is to maintain [ that code ] , simply because it 's not statically typed , and you do n't get any real good IDE help or compiler help .
Also , [ JavaScript code ] is very hard to break down into functional chunks that you 'll know will work well together through , for instance , well - defined interfaces .
In Java , what you get is scalability , which comes into play the larger the project you 're doing is , and the more people you have on it .
If you 're going to sit down and write a small application , JavaScript is probably a fine choice .
But the bigger the thing you try to do , the more leveraging the power of Java is really going to help you .
JavaScript is quite flexible and powerful .
Most of its drawbacks , at least to me , come not from what you can express in it — because you can express a whole lot — it 's just that it 's all completely free - form , so to speak .
The power of JavaScript is also rope that you can very easily hang yourself with .
That 's why , when people are creating big class libraries , a lot of what you 're doing is convention - based .
You have a convention for how you construct a class , you have a convention for this or that , and there is no programmatic enforcement of any of those conventions .
Frank Sommers :
What are the GWT compiler 's current limitations in translating Java code to JavaScript ?
Scott Blum : None of the Java 5 language features are supported right now .
We 're strictly 1.4 - based in terms of source compatibility .
In terms of the actual language itself , we pretty much support everything .
Inner classes , anonymous classes are supported , for instance .
Pretty much anything you can express is straight Java code , you can do in GWT .
The only real limitation of what Java code you can translate into JavaScript is that you have to have all the sources available .
One reason you can't translate all of the Java I/O classes is that they have a bunch of native methods in them that are implemented in C++ code , so there is no way we could translate that .
Also , a couple of things would n't make sense in a browser , like synchronization , because JavaScript is single - threaded .
And we do n't fully support the long data type because none of the browsers do .
They all support double - precision floating - point , but do n't have a 64 - bit integer type .

IE7 やFirefox2は、「 フィード 」 をMIMEタイプで判別できないときは、コンテンツの先頭部分のテキストマッチで判断して「フィードプレビュー」を起動しているらしい。判定用の文字列パターンをRSSファイルで直接用いないようにしたら、確かにどちらのブラウザもプレビューではなくてXSLTを適用するようになった。ただし、一般のフィードリーダーの中にも同じような文字列マッチを使っているものがある模様で、方法によってはこれらのフィードリーダーでも修正版RSSを読めなくなってしまうので注意が必要だ。
Microsoft Team RSS BlogのWindows RSS Publisher 's Guideによれば 、MIME タイプが application / xml もしくは text / xml であるとき は
、IE7 はコンテンツ冒頭の512バイトを読んで、その中に次の3つの文字列があればRSS1.0と判定するのだという。
<rdf:RDF http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
最初の rdf:RDF は接頭辞の問題だから任意に変更できる。試しにRDF名前空間URIの接頭辞を r : （つま り1.を <r:RDF ）にしてみたら、あっさりとXSLTが適用できた。Firefox2.0でも同様の判定方法をとっているらしく、この接頭辞でどちらのブラウザもうまくいく。2番目と3番目はRDFとRSS1.0の名前空間URIなので直接手を加えるわけには行かないが、実体参照を使って文字列を分割することはできるから、これらも同様に利用可能だ。
対応法としては接頭辞 rdf : を変更するのが簡単そうだが、いくつか試してみると、一般のRSSリーダーの中にも rdf:RDF を使ってRSS1.0を判定方法を用いているらしきものが結構あることが分かった。結果として、接頭辞置き換えによる修正版RSSは多くのフィードリーダー（オンライン、オフラインともに）で読めなくなってしまい、少々具合が悪い。
興味深いことに、実体参照を使った方法は、IE7、Firefox2では一般のXML扱い（XSLTが適用される）でありつつ、大部分のフィードリーダーできちんと読める。これは、例えば次のような具合に記述すればよい。
（例） <?xml - stylesheet href= " your xlst " type = " text /xsl " ? >
<!
DOCTYPE rdf:RDF [ <!ENTITY host " http://purl.org " >
<!
ENTITY rss1 " /rss/1.0 / " > ]> < rdf:RDF xmlns:rss= " &host ; &rss1 ; " xmlns:rdf= " http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# " ...
（ここで 、 <!ENTITY rss " http://purl.org/rss/1.0/ " >
のような実体宣言をしても、URIの文字列がそのまま記述されているので、テキストマッチ回避には役立たないことに注意）

In the current JSON vs. XML debate ( see Bray , Winer , Box , Obasanjo , and many others ) , there are three things that important to understand :
There is no information that can be represented in an XML document that cannot be represented in a JSON document .
There is no information that can be represented in a JSON document that cannot be represented in an XML document .
There is no information that can be represented in an XML or JSON document that cannot be represented by a LISP S - expression .
They are all capable of modeling recursive , hierarchical data structures with labeled nodes .
Do we have a term for that , like Turing completeness for programming languages ?
It would certainly be convenient in discussions like this .
Syntactic sugar
The only important differences among the three are the size of the user base ( and opportunity for network effects ) , software support , and syntactic convenience or inconvenience .
The first two are fickle — where are the Pascal programmers of yesteryear ? — so let ’s concentrate on syntax .
Here ’s a simple list of three names in each of the three representations : <!-- XML --> < names > < name > Anna Maria</ name > < name > Fitzwilliam </name > < name > Maurice </name > </names > /* JSON */ { " names " : [ " Anna Maria " , " Fitzwilliam " , " Maurice " ] } ;; LISP '( names " Anna Maria " " Fitzwilliam " " Maurice " )
Nearly all comparisons between XML and JSON look something like this , and I have to admit , it ’s a slam dunk — in an example like this , XML seems to go out of its way to violate Larry Wall ‘s second slogan : “ Easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible . ”
On the other hand , I rarely see any data structures that are really this simple , outside of toy examples in books or tutorials , so a comparison like this might not have a lot of value ; after all , I could have written the XML like this : < names >
Anna Maria , Fitzwilliam , Maurice < / names >
Let ’s dig a bit deeper and see what we find .
Node labels
In the previous example , I made some important assumptions : I assumed that node label for the individual names ( “ name ” ) did n’t matter and could be omitted from the JSON and LISP , and I assumed that the node label for the entire list ( “ names ” ) was a legal XML and LISP identifier .
Let ’s break both of those assumptions now , and make the label for the list “ names ! ” and the labels for the items “ male - name ” or “ female - name ” .
Here ’s what we can do now to handle this in XML , JSON , and LISP : <!-- XML --> < list label = " names ! " > < female-name > Anna Maria</ female - name > < male-name > Fitzwilliam</male-name > < male-name > Maurice</male-name > </ list > /* JSON */ { " names ! " : [ { " female - name " : " Anna Maria "} , { " male - name : " Fitzwilliam "} , { " male - name " : " Maurice " } ] } ;; LISP '( names !
( female - name " Anna Maria " ) ( male - name " Fitzwilliam " ) ( male - name " Maurice " ) ) XML is forced to use a secondary syntactic construction ( an attribute value ) to represent the top - level label , because it no longer matches XML ’s syntactic rules for element names .
LISP simply switches from a token to a string to represent “ names ! ” can still use names !
as a token , and JSON does n’t notice , because it has been using a string all along — XML syntax is convenient for trees of labeled nodes only when the labels are heavily restricted .
That aside , however , note that as soon as we add any non-trivial complexity to the information — as soon as we assume that node labels matter — then all three formats start to look a little more like XML .
Additional node attributes
Now , let ’s add the next wrinkle , by allowing additional attributes ( beside a label ) for each node .
In this case , we ’re going to add a “ lang ” ( language ) attribute to each of the nodes : <!-- XML --> < list label = " names ! " > < female - name xml:lang = " it " >
Anna Maria </ female - name > < male - name xml:lang= " en " >
Fitzwilliam </ male - name > < male - name xml:lang= " fr " > Maurice </ male - name > </ list > /* JSON */ { " names ! " : [ { " female - name " : [ { " lang " : " it " } , " Anna Maria " ] } , { " male - name : [ { " lang " : " en "} , " Fitzwilliam " ]} , { " male - name " : [ { " lang " : " fr " } , " Maurice " ] } ] } ;; LISP '( names !
( female - name ( ( ( lang it ) ) " Anna Maria " ) ) ( male - name ( ( ( lang en ) ) " Fitzwilliam " ) ) ( male - name ( ( ( lang fr ) ) " Maurice " ) ) )
Now , while XML is still using ad - hoc convention to represent the “ name ! ” label , JSON and LISP are forced to use ad - hoc conventions to represent attribute lists ( a dictionary list for JSON , and an a - list for LISP ) .
It ’s also worth noting that JSON and LISP now look so much like XML , both in length and complexity , that it ’s hardly possible to distinguish them .
Node attributes are not esoteric — they ’re the basis of such simple things as hyperlinks .
Data typing XML certainly looks better for the attributes , but now let ’s jump to data typing .
Let ’s assume that there is a country where people use real numbers as names , and we need to find a way to distinguish names that are real numbers from names that just happen to look like real numbers ( say , a person named “ 1.7 ” in a country where names are strings ) .
JSON and LISP can make that distinction naturally using first - class syntax , while XML has to use a different standard that is not part of the core language : <!-- XML --> < list label = " names ! " xmlns:xsd = " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema " xmlns:xsi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance " > < female - name xml:lang = " it " > Anna Maria </ female - name > < male - name xml:lang= " en " >
Fitzwilliam </ male - name > < male - name xml:lang= " fr " > Maurice </ male - name > < female - name xsd:type= " xsi:float " xml:lang = " de " >7.9</female-name > </ list > /* JSON */ { " names ! " : [ { " female - name " : [ { " lang " : " it " } , " Anna Maria " ] } , { " male - name : [ { " lang " : " en "} , " Fitzwilliam " ]} , { " male - name " : [ { " lang " : " fr " } , " Maurice " ]} , { " female - name " : [ { " lang " : " de "} , 7.9 ] } ] } ;; LISP '( names !
( female - name ( ( ( lang it ) ) " Anna Maria " ) ) ( male - name ( ( ( lang en ) ) " Fitzwilliam " ) ) ( male - name ( ( ( lang fr ) ) " Maurice " ) ) ( female - name ( ( ( lang de ) ) 7.9 ) ) ) XML loses badly on this particular example ; however , if the extra data were ( say ) a date or currency , we would have to make up an ad - hoc way to label its type in JSON and LISP as well , since they have no special syntax to distinguish a date or monetary value from a regular number or string .
For anything other than simple numeric data types , this one ’s actually a draw .
Mixed content
And now , finally , for mixed content .
I will add surnames to all of the ( non-numeric ) names in the list , and ( here ’s the kicker ) will put those in their own labeled nodes : <!-- XML --> < list label = " names ! " xmlns:xsd = " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema " xmlns:xsi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance " > < female - name xml:lang = " it " >
Anna Maria < surname > Mozart</ surname></female-name> < male - name xml:lang= " en " >
Fitzwilliam < surname > Darcy </ surname ></ male -name > < male - name xml:lang= " fr " > Maurice < surname > Chevalier </ surname ></male-name > < female - name xsd:type= " xsi:float " xml:lang = " de " >7.9</female-name > </ list > /* JSON */ { " names ! " : [ { " female - name " : [ { " lang " : " it " } , " Anna Maria " , {surname : " Mozart " }]} , { " male - name : [ { " lang " : " en "} , " Fitzwilliam " , {surname : " Darcy " }]} , { " male - name " : [ { " lang " : " fr " } , " Maurice " , { " surname " : " Chevalier " }]} , { " female - name " : [ { " lang " : " de "} , 7.9 ] } ] } ;; LISP '( names !
( female - name ( ( ( lang it ) ) " Anna Maria " ( surname " Mozart " ) ) ) ( male - name ( ( ( lang en ) ) " Fitzwilliam " ( surname " Darcy " ) ) ) ( male - name ( ( ( lang fr ) ) " Maurice " ( surname " Chevalier " ) ) ) ( female - name ( ( ( lang de ) ) 7.9 ) ) )
Character for character , the JSON and LISP are still shorter , but the difference is not nearly as dramatic as it was in the very first example .
In fact , typing all of these examples by hand , I find myself appreciating the redundant end tags on the XML parts , because it ’s getting very hard to keep track of all the closing “ ] ” , “ } ” and “ ) ” for JSON and LISP .
No silver bullet
There are a few morals here .
First , with markup , as with coding , there ’s no silver bullet .
JSON ( and LISP ) have the important advantage that they make the most trivial cases easy to represent , but as soon as we introduce even the slightest complexity , all of the markup starts to look about equally verbose .
That means that the real problems we have to solve with structured data are no longer syntactic , and anyone trying to find a syntactic solution to structured data is really missing the point : JSON , XML ( and LISP ) people would be best making common cause to start dealing with more important problems than whether we use braces , pointy brackets , or parentheses .
That ’s why I was excited to have JSON inventor Doug Crockford speak at XML 2006 , and why I hope that we ’ll get more submissions about JSON as well as XML for 2007 .
Personally , I like XML because it ’s familiar and has a lot of tool support , but I could easily ( and happily ) build an application based on any of the three — after all , once I stare long enough , they all look the same to me .
What is the UK - Japan Climate Collaboration ?
The aim of the UJCC project is to exploit the power of the Earth Simulator to produce world - leading climate simulations .
The enhanced resolution models will allow unprecedented fidelity of simulation , and allow many emergent phenomena to be resolved .
The science of the project will then be to understand how the increased resolution changes the large scale mean climate , consider whether the emergent processes are therefore essential to produce reliable climate models , and consider if these processes can be parameterized in lower resolution models , or if their importance is enough to drive model resolution to increase .
There are already plenty of full - case mods , they just are n't supported by MSFT , and installing them can presumably void your warranty .
That said , there are quite a few guides out there for installing a full case mod , and it does n't look all that difficult .
decalgirl.com has some full case mods ( I think ) and a ton of full case skins ( I know ) .
USA executes its citizens every ten days
Texas is the leading unit of the USA on the number of executed death sentences : 355 deaths
The day of November 30 , 2005 will mark the execution of the 1,000th death sentence in the USA since the moment when death penalty was reinstated in the country : murderer Robin Lovitt sentenced to death penalty in Virginia back in 1999 will die by electric chair .
US - based organization Death Penalty Information Center released a survey of facts regarding the state of affairs in the field of death sentences and their execution in the USA in connection with the forthcoming significant event in the nation .
The report presents pure statistics and lacks any comments , which makes the document rather an objective material for further analysis .
Adversaries of death penalty made US authorities pass an adequate moratorium in 1967 .
Death for severe crimes was substituted with lifetime imprisonment without pardon .
In 1972 the US Supreme Court abolished the laws about death penalty in several states , where they were practiced , and described them as incidental and willful .
However , a sudden upsurge of severe crimes in the USA made the Supreme Court retrieve the right for authorities in 1972 to apply death penalty against inmates .
For the time being , death penalty is excluded from legal systems of only 12 of USA's 50 states : Alaska , Hawaii , Iowa , Man , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , North Dakota , Vermont , Rhode Island , West Virginia and Wisconsin .
There is no death penalty in Columbia DC , where the US capital is situated , and in US - controlled Puerto Rico .
Death penalty moratorium is currently in effect in the states of Illinois and New Jersey .
The USA is proud of the fact that the national legal system has been searching for humane methods of executing death penalties for 120 years already .
The process was initiated on 1 January 1889 , when the authorities of the state of New York passed the Electrical Execution Law .
The first execution with the use of electric chair took place on 6 August 1890 : electric current killed a man named as William Kemmler , who hacked his lover , Matilda Ziegler , to death with an axe .
Nebraska is the only state in present - day USA , which uses electric chair as the only execution tool and has no other alternative for it .
In all other 37 states , where death penalty is legal , convicted criminals are put down by means of lethal injections .
Alternative methods of execution include : electric chair ( Alabama , Arkansas , South Caroline , Virginia ) , gas chamber ( Wyoming , California , Maryland , Missouri , Mississippi , Arizona ) , hanging ( Washington and New Hampshire ) and shooting ( Idaho and Oklahoma ) .
About 3,400 people are currently waiting for their death sentences to be executed in the USA .
It is noteworthy that 122 people from 25 states have been struck out of the sad list since 1973 , when supplementary investigation found them not guilty of incriminated crimes .
Texas is the leading unit of the USA on the number of executed death sentences : 355 citizens have been executed in Texas since the abolishment of the moratorium .
The majority of 999 executed individuals in the USA were killed with lethal injections – 828 people .
US authorities have executed 20 foreign citizens since 1976 .
Fifty citizens of Mexico , six Cuban nationals , six Jamaican citizens , five residents of Salvador , five natives of Vietnam , four Colombian nationals , three citizens of Cambodia , three individuals holding Honduran citizenship and two Germans anticipate similar fates .
As for racial and ethnical affiliation of individuals executed since 1976 , 58 percent of them were white , 34 percent – black , six percent of the executed were Latin Americans , and two percent represented people of other races .
According to the October research prepared by Gallup , 64 percent of Americans support death penalty in the USA ( against 80 percent in 1994 ) .
The number of death sentences halved in the III Millennium in comparison with the nineties of the past century .
On average , the USA executes one person every ten days .
A research by Amnesty International said that only 25 countries executed death penalties in 2004 , whereas the mast majority of them ( 97 percent ) was conducted in China , Iran , Vietnam and the USA .
It brings up the idea that the US administration will not be pleased to know that the USA now stands next to those countries , which it constantly blames for violation of human rights and democratic standards .

To make sure it would n’t collapse , he hired a structural engineer who calculated how much weight the roof could support .
The answer was 35 pounds per square foot , dry weight , or 60 pounds per square foot , if saturated with rain .
That calculation limited Mr. Puchkoff ’s green roof to no more than eight inches of soil , so he chose seven , just to be safe , even building a little crest of a hill , over a lightweight polystyrene mound , “ because I did n’t want it perfectly flat , ” he said .
He sealed the roof with a combination of polyethylene and woven polyester from the Andek Corporation , whose products he had used over the years to seal custom - built bathtubs .
( Cost : $ 1,500 , including labor . )
Then he was ready to install the four - layered system he chose from American Hydrotech .
The layers consist of a five - millimeter polyethylene membrane that keeps roots from penetrating the roof ; then a spongy moisture retention layer , which absorbs any water that overflows the next layer of “ Floradrains , ” from a German company named ZinCo .
These are cup - like plastic units that look like upside - down egg cartons ; when laid together , they hold water that seeps down through the layer of soil , which is laid over a filter that prevents sifting and clogging of the drains .
The multilayered system establishes not only a reservoir of water for plants , but also a backup supply , held by the moisture retention sponge , which evaporates slowly , in dry times , to moisten plant roots .

At the final stage , drip tubes are laid down on top of the soil filter , before the soil medium is spread .
These drip lines , plus some early top - watering , supplied water to the young plants — which arrived as plugs with three - inch roots , and were planted eight inches apart — until they were well - established .
( The Hydrotech system cost $ 3,800 , plus $ 800 labor . )
Cyndi Lauper and Ray Charles are on the full list of XCP CDs
Sony BMG , the world 's second largest record label , has for the past three weeks been the subject of a corporate embarrassment that rivals earlier public relations nightmares involving tampered Tylenol and contaminated Perrier .
While in the short - term one of the world 's best - known brands has suffered enormous damage , the longer - term implications are even more significant - a fundamental re-thinking of policies toward digital locks known as technological protection measures ( TPMs ) .
The Sony case started innocently enough with a Halloween day blog posting by Mark Russinovich , an intrepid computer security researcher .
Mr Russinovich discovered his own tale of horror - Sony was using a copy - protection TPM on some of its CDs that quietly installed a software program known as a " rootkit " on users ' computers .
The use of the rootkit set off alarm bells for Mr Russinovich , who immediately identified it as a potential security risk since hackers and virus writers frequently exploit such programs to turn personal computers into " zombies " that can send millions of spam messages , steal personal information , or launch denial of service attacks .
While the Sony saga has still not ended , it is increasingly clear that it will have a long - term impact on consumers and policy makers
Although users were presented with a series of terms and conditions that refer to software installation before launching the CD , it is safe to assume that few , if any , realised that they were creating both a security and potential privacy risk as well as setting themselves up for a " Hotel California " type program that checks in but never leaves .
Class action
While Sony and the normally vocal recording industry associations stood largely silent - a company executive dismissed the concerns stating that " most people do n't even know what a rootkit is , so why should they care about it " - the repercussions escalated daily .
One group identified at least 20 affected CDs , including releases from international artists such as Celine Dion and Neil Diamond .
Class action lawsuits were launched in the US , a criminal investigation began in Italy , and anti-spyware companies gradually updated their programs to include the Sony rootkit .
Nearly two weeks after the initial disclosure , Sony finally issued an apology , indicating that it was suspending use of the TPM and issuing a software patch to remove the rootkit .
At about the same time things went from bad to worse .
It was soon discovered that Sony 's patch created its own security risk - potentially leaving personal computers even more vulnerable than with the initial rootkit - and was pulled from its website .
Sony BMG has released the full list of XCP CDs
The recall was even bigger than anticipated as Sony disclosed that there were at least 52 affected CDs .
Moreover , researchers estimated that the damaging program had infected at least 500,000 computers in 165 countries .
Finally , just when it appeared that Sony had hit bottom , analysis of the rootkit revealed that it included open source software code contrary to the applicable licence .
In other words , Sony itself may have infringed the copyright of a group of software programmers and be on the hook for significant copyright infringement damages .
While the Sony saga has still not ended , it is increasingly clear that it will have a long - term impact on consumers and policy makers .
The incident has alerted millions of consumers to the potential misuse of TPMs as well as to the need for consumer protections from such systems .
While policy makers have raced to provide legal protections for TPMs ( known as anti-circumvention legislation since the provisions prohibit attempts to circumvent the digital locks ) , the real need is to protect against the misuse of this technology .
The Sony case provides a vivid illustration of how TPMs can create real security and privacy risks .
The US Computer Emergency Response Team was jointly established in 2003 by the US government and the private sector with the aim of protecting the internet infrastructure from cyber - attacks .
It advised users that they should not " install software from sources that you do not expect to contain software , such as an audio CD " .
Moreover , Stewart Baker , the US Department of Homeland Security 's assistant secretary of policy , admonished the music industry , reminding them that " it 's very important to remember that it 's your intellectual property - it 's not your computer .
" And in the pursuit of protection of intellectual property , it 's important not to defeat or undermine the security measures that people need to adopt in these days . "
Worldwide action
Mr Baker 's comments point , as well , to another issue that has been percolating for some time , namely that TPMs not only put users ' property at risk , but they also limit use of lawfully - acquired personal property .
Justice Ian Binnie of the Supreme Court of Canada raised this concern in a copyright case several years ago when he noted that " once an authorised copy of a work is sold to a member of the public , it is generally for the purchaser , not the author , to determine what happens to it " .
The Australian High Court expressed similar sentiments in a decision issued last month that ironically also involved Sony .
It rejected Sony 's attempt to block the use of " mod chips " , utilised by video game players to unlock copy - protected games purchased outside the country .
It emphasised that " the right of the individual to enjoy lawfully acquired private property ( a CD - Rom game or a PlayStation console purchased in another region of the world or possibly to make a backup copy of the CD - Rom ) would ordinarily be a right inherent in Australian law upon the acquisition of such a chattel . "
The incident should also galvanise regulators and political leaders worldwide .
Data protection commissioners should use their powers to investigate other potentially invasive uses of TPMs , while fair business practice regulators should consider whether Sony violated deceptive practice legislation .
Moreover , countries should begin to reconsider the rush to provide legal protection for TPMs as embodied in the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European Union 's Copyright Directive .
The approach evidently has the effect of protecting spyware , undermining consumer confidence , and ultimately reducing the sales of musical artists .
The Tylenol and Perrier debacles led to dramatic changes in corporate practice and consumer protections .
Similarly , with consumer backlash against protected music CDs and licensing agreements , policy maker worries about the privacy and security implications of TPMs , and the courts ' concern for personal property rights , the Sony rootkit case is destined to resonate long after the CDs disappear from store shelves .

The RIAA has decided it wants to drop another copyright infringement case , but the defendant is fighting back .
Warner v. Stubbs began like so many of the file - sharing cases .
MediaSentry found shared music on Kazaa and the IP address was traced to Tallie Stubbs of Oklahoma .
After settlement talks proved futile , Warner Bros. , UMG , Sony Music , and Arista Records filed suit in the US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on July 25 , 2006 .
After " further investigation , " according to a plaintiff 's court filing , the record labels decided to dismiss the case .
However , they requested that the case be dismissed without prejudice and with prejudice .
Likely due to a typographical error , the distinction is important .
Dismissal without prejudice means that the action can be brought again in the future .
If a case is dismissed with prejudice , it cannot be refiled and the defendant may be named the " prevailing party " and be eligible for attorney 's fees and court costs from the plaintiffs , which is what happened in the case of Capitol Records v. Foster .
When the RIAA decides to drop a case , it will file for dismissal without prejudice .
If the motion is made prior to the defendant filing an answer to the complaint or a counterclaim , that 's the end of the case .
The RIAA extricates itself from a case it decided was unwinnable and the defendant is left holding the bag for attorney 's fees .
In Warner v. Stubbs , the defendant filed an answer and counterclaim seeking affirmative relief before the RIAA filed a motion .
One common thread in the Capitol Records v. Foster and the Warner v. Stubbs cases is the defendant 's counsel , Marilyn Barringer - Thompson .
After reading through the paperwork from the two cases , it 's clear that Barringer - Thompson is playing hardball with the record labels .
Ray Beckerman , who runs the Recording Industry vs The People blog and is representing other defendants embroiled in litigation with the RIAA , told Ars that it looked to him like the RIAA decided to cut and run when it saw who the opposing counsel was .
If Tallie Stubbs wins her motion for dismissal with prejudice , then she , too , will be considered the prevailing party and will be eligible for attorney 's fees and other court costs from the RIAA .
More importantly , it would put the RIAA in the position of having lost one of their file - sharing - related copyright infringement casenone of which have yet gone to trial .
Unfortunately , we do n't know what transpired behind the scenes and why the RIAA wants to drop the case .
What " further investigation " did the RIAA undertake with regard to the Stubbs case ?
Was it another case of mistaken identity ?
We contacted the RIAA for answers to these and other questions and were told by a spokesperson earlier today that the RIAA would be unable to provide answers because our questions " go to an element of legal strategy that we 'll pass on detailing . "
Should one of the file - sharing cases actually make it to trial , we may get definitive answers on a number of elements of the RIAA 's legal strategy .
Is an IP address and the name and address of an ISP subscriber enough to make a positive identification of who was doing the alleged file sharing and when ?
( We were reminded earlier this week that relying on ISP data is not foolproof . )
Is a list of music files allegedly discovered by MediaSentry enough to prove infringement ?
Beckerman does n't think so .
The RIAA 's actions indicate that they 're not anxious to get a definitive answer either .

A Post By : Darren Rowse
I love cities .
While I enjoy getting out into the wide open spaces of the countryside I am also a big fan of the hustle and bustle of inner city life .
It ’s not for everyone but I find that such areas are so interesting to spend time in – both on a personal level but also photographically .
Some people might be a little depressed by the greyness of concrete , towering skyscrapers and graffiti covered walls – but I find them full of photographic potential .
Urban Landscape
Photography looks for these photographic possibilities in the cities and and urban areas where we live and work .
Urban Landscape photography is a little slippery to define as it sits between a number of other genres .
For the purposes of this article let me contrast it with a few related photographic genres :
Cityscape Photography – urban landscapes go beyond the capturing of the big picture cityscape that is usually quote polished and clean .
– urban landscapes go beyond the capturing of the big picture cityscape that is usually quote polished and clean .
Architectural Photography – urban landscapes are less interested in the building and it ’s architectural style and more interested in what happens in and around it .
– urban landscapes are less interested in the building and it ’s architectural style and more interested in what happens in and around it .
Candid Street Photography – urban photography focussed more upon the city itself ( and it ’s life ) than the people who live in it .
Urban Landscape photography is often gritty , it ’s not always pretty and it can be quite abstract .
Following are 11 tips to help you improve your urban landscape photography :
1. Take a Variety of Lenses
I find that taking two lenses with me is usually enough for urban photography .
I prefer to take one wide angle lens and a zoom with a fair bit of length to it .
Longer focal lengths are useful for capturing the details of building and street scenes ( be aware that they also tend to flatten pictures ) but wide angle lenses are great for capturing the big picture and they tend to give a bigger depth of field which can add interest and a nice feel to your shots .
2. Other Gear to Take
The gear you take on an urban landscape shoot will of course reflect your own style of photography ( and budget ) but in addition to the above two lenses and DSLR I take a monopod ( or tripod if I ’m going to shoot into the evening ) , polarising filters , UV filters ( for when I ’m not using the polarisers ) , sling style camera bag ( I use a Crumpler bag which I find gives me the access I need as well as being reasonably inconspicuous , spare batteries and I generally take my external flash with me ( although I do n’t use it as much for landscape shots – it ’s there more if I find a good portrait opportunity ) .
3. Look for Contrasts
One of the things that I love about cities is the diversity that you can find there – both in terms of the people ( it ’s where all types come together ) as well as visual diversity in the sites you ’ll see there .
Look for and capture the contrasts between architectural styles , building materials , colours etc and you ’ll end up with some very interesting shots .
4. Regarding People
A constant challenge for urban landscape photographers is that cities are places where people naturally gather .
There ’s nothing wrong with people but in urban photographs they do tend to become the focal point of shots whether you want them to be or not .
My thoughts on people in urban photography is that you either work with the fact that there are people in the shots and use them as a focal point or if possible they need to be eliminated from the shot – there ’s not really too much middle ground .
One way of eliminating people from shots is to shoot on weekends or after work hours .
Ultimately when it comes to whether to include people in a shot or not I ask myself the questions ‘ are they relevant to the shot ? ’ and ‘ do they add or take away from the composition ?’.
If they add something – include them .
If they distract – get rid of them .
5. Evidence of People
If you choose to take the approach of eliminating people from your shots they almost always still live in the shots by the things that they leave there .
Urban landscapes do n’t always include people directly but speak about the way we live ( both good and bad ) .
It can be very powerful to look for the evidence of people in a landscape and to feature this in your shots .
In doing so you add layers of interest and make your photos more dynamic .
6. Research Your Locations
Urban landscape photography might seem like a pretty spontaneous thing ( and at times it can be ) but many of the most spectacular shots are a result of careful planning .
It ’s amazing how a location can change depending upon the time of day ( as a result of angles of light especially ) so scout out potential locations at different times of the day and consider returning to the same location over time to see what else it might offer .
In terms of what time of day is ‘ best ’ to photograph – I ’m not sure there is one but my personal preference is late afternoon or on days which are overcast but where it ’d not too dark .
7. Look for Themes
While there is real diversity in urban areas there are also many recurring themes of life .
For instance I recently saw one exhibition of urban landscapes that explored the places people lived in a city – it was a series of people ’s home ranging from park benches , to converted warehouses , to old period homes .
Seeing them side by side was quite powerful .
8. Look for Mirrors
Many buildings these days are built with highly reflective surfaces .
These can both present themselves as an opportunity and a challenge .
Some stunning effects can be achieved by shooting the reflections in such buildings – to find the perfect way to do this often means you need to try lots of angles to find the best reflection .
If you want to eliminate the glare or unwanted reflections from mirrors or shiny windows it is worth investing in and using a polarising filter .
9 . Shoot into the Evening
Cities change incredibly as evening comes and the lights go on .
What can be a drab or featureless scene can quickly become something with a lot of character and mood .
I enjoy shooting in the twilight zone between day and night as there is still light in the sky but you also get the impact of city lights .
10 . Explore Different City Zones
One thing that fascinates me about cities is the differences in the feel and sites that you can witness from area to area .
Within a block or two you can move from a business district or commercial zone to a gritty , run down industrial zone or a trendy inner city residential or shopping area .
Many urban landscape photographers have a preference for one or more of these types of areas but if you ’re just starting out it can be worth experimenting with exploring the possibilities that each of these areas can present you with .
Keep in mind that not all areas of cities are always safe – sometimes for this reason it can be wise to shoot with others .
11 . Finding the Urban in the Suburban or Rural
Perhaps I ’ve been a little ‘ city - centric ’ with this post – but most of what I ’ve written about can be explored in the suburbs of our cities and even smaller towns as really urban landscapes document and explore the places where people live and gather – bid or small .
Reginald Braithwaite has just posted a short introduction to closures in Ruby .
Closures allow you to pass functions around your program , and build new functions from old ones .
Programming languages that support closures include Perl , Ruby , Python ( sorta ) , Lisp , Haskell , Dylan , Javascript and many others .
The Dylan programming language included four very useful functions built using closures : complement , conjoin , disjoin and compose .
The names are a bit obscure , but they can each be written in a few lines of Ruby .
Let 's start with complement :
# Builds a function that returns true # when 'f ' returns false , and vice versa .
def complement f lambda { |* args | not f . call ( * args ) } end
We can use this to build the " opposite " of a function :
is_even = lambda { | n | n % 2 == 0 } is_odd = complement ( is_even ) is_odd .
call ( 1 ) # true is_odd .
call ( 2 ) # false
compose is another useful function :
# Builds a function which calls 'f ' with # the return value of ' g '.
def compose f , g lambda { |* args | f . call ( g . call ( * args ) ) } end
We can use this to pass the output of one function to the input of another :
mult2 = lambda { | n | n * 2 } add1 = lambda { | n | n + 1 } mult2_add1 = compose ( add1 , mult2 ) mult2_add1 .
call ( 3 ) # 7
The conjoin function is a bit more complicated , but still very useful :
# Builds a function which returns true # whenever _every_ function in ' predicates ' # returns true .
def conjoin * predicates base = lambda { |* args | true } predicates .
inject ( base ) do | built , pred | lambda do |* args | built .
call ( * args ) && pred .
call ( * args ) end end end
We can use it to construct the logical " and " of a list of functions :
is_number = lambda { | n | n . kind_of ? ( Numeric ) } is_even_number = conjoin ( is_number , is_even ) is_even_number .
call ( " a " ) # false is_even_number .
call ( 1 ) # false is_even_number .
call ( 2 ) # true
The opposite of conjoin is disjoin :
# Builds a function which returns true # whenever _any_ function in ' predicates ' # returns true .
def disjoin * predicates base = lambda { |* args | false } predicates .
inject ( base ) do | built , pred | lambda do |* args | built .
call ( * args ) || pred .
call ( * args ) end end end
This allows us to construct the logical " or " of a list of functions :
is_string = lambda { | n | n . kind_of ? ( String ) } is_string_or_number = disjoin ( is_string , is_number ) is_string_or_number .
call ( " a " ) # true is_string_or_number .
call ( 1 ) # true is_string_or_number .
call ( :a ) # false
These were four of the first closure - related functions I ever used , and they 're still favorites today .

Near suppertime on the evening of November 7th , 2004 , the skies lit right up for many parts of North America .
Forecasters had been predicting a strong probability of aurora activity and the planetary K Index shot right up to 9 .
In Caledon , Ontario the cloud cover partially dissipated enough to provide a great show , the strongest being early in the evening .
The beautiful show was non -stop all evening .
After midnight , a ghostly looking green corona slithered almost directly overhead and it continued to morph into many interesting shapes .
The coyotes were yipping and howling in the distance , which only added to the spooky effect .

To understand the Universe we must start from the here and now .
The Universe may have come in countless different versions .
Â© NASA
How did the Universe begin ?
Many scientists would regard this as one of the most profound questions of all .
But to Stephen Hawking , who has perhaps come closer than anyone to answering it , the question does n't in fact even exist .
Hawking , based at the University of Cambridge , UK , and his colleague Thomas Hertog of the European Laboratory for Particle Physics at CERN in Geneva , Switzerland , are about to publish a paper claiming that the Universe had no unique beginning1 .
Instead , they argue , it began in just about every way imaginable ( and maybe some that are n't ) .
Out of this profusion of beginnings , the vast majority withered away without leaving any real imprint on the Universe we know today .
Only a tiny fraction of them blended to make the current cosmos , Hawking and Hertog claim .
That , they insist , is the only possible conclusion if we are to take quantum physics seriously .
" Quantum mechanics forbids a single history , " says Hertog .
“ Quantum mechanics forbids a single history . ”
Thomas Hertog
CERN , Geneva
The researchers ' theory comes in response to a problem raised by ' string theory ' , one of the best hopes for a theory of everything .
String theory permits innumerable different kinds of universe , most of them very different from the one we inhabit .
Some physicists suspect that an unknown factor will turn up that rules out most of these universes .
But Hawking and Hertog say that the countless ' alternative worlds ' of string theory may actually have existed .
We should picture the Universe in the first instants of the Big Bang as a superposition of all these possibilities , they say ; like a projection of billions of movies played on top of one another .
It all adds up
This might sound odd , but it is precisely the view adopted by quantum theory .
Think of a particle of light reaching our eye from a lamp .
Common sense suggests that it simply travels in a straight line from the bulb to the eye .
But to make correct predictions about the particle 's behaviour , quantum mechanics must consider all other possible paths too , including ones in which , say , the photon bounces around the walls thousands of times before reaching us .
This summation of all paths , proposed in the 1960s by physicist Richard Feynman and others , is the only way to explain some of the bizarre properties of quantum particles , such as their apparent ability to be in two places at once .
The key point is that not all paths contribute equally to the photon 's behaviour : the straight - line trajectory dominates over the indirect ones .
Hertog argues that the same must be true of the path through time that took the Universe into its current state .
We must regard it as a sum over all possible histories .
Take it from the top
He and Hawking call their theory ' top - down ' cosmology , because instead of looking for some fundamental set of initial physical laws under which our Universe unfolded , it starts ' at the top ' , with what we see today , and works backwards to see what the initial set of possibilities might have been .
In effect , says Hertog , the present ' selects ' the past .
Within just a few seconds after the Big Bang , a single history had already come to dominate the Universe , he explains .
So from the ' classical ' viewpoint of big objects such as stars and galaxies , things happened only one way after that point .
Other ' histories ' , say , one in which the Earth formed only 4,000 years ago , have made no significant contribution to this cosmic evolution .
But in the first instants of the Big Bang , there existed a superposition of ever more different versions of the Universe , instead of a unique history .
And most crucially , Hertog says that " our current Universe has features frozen in from this early quantum mixture " .
In other words , some of these alternative histories have left their imprint behind .
This is why Hertog and Hawking insist that their ' top - down ' cosmology is testable .
Hertog says that the theory predicts the pattern of the variations in intensity of microwave background radiation , the afterglow of the Big Bang now imprinted on the sky , which reveal fluctuations in the fireball of the nascent Universe .
These variations are minute , but space - based detectors have measured them ever more accurately over the past several years .
As the two researchers work out top - down cosmology in more detail , they hope to be able to calculate the spectrum of these microwave fluctuations and compare it with observations .
The theory also suggests an answer to the puzzle of why some of the ' constants of nature ' seem finely tuned to a value that allows life to evolve .
If we start from where we are now , it is obvious that the current Universe must ' select ' those histories that lead to these conditions .
Otherwise we simply would n't be here .

Uredba namreč predvideva , da bomo morali kupci praznih DVD - in CD - medijev , ker ti omogočajo zlorabo avtorskih pravic , denimo ob kopiranju glasbe ali filmov , plačati pristojbino v višini osem tolarjev za vsak gigabajt podatkov , ki ga lahko shranimo na medij .
Običajen DVD lahko sprejme 4,7 gigabajta podatkov , kar pomeni , da bo novi prispevek avtorskim organizacijam , kot sta SAZAS in IPF , za vsak prazen DVD znašal kar 50 tolarjev .
Prazni DVD mediji , ki so bili s ceno okoli 70 tolarjev doslej razmeroma poceni , se bodo tako podražili tudi za 80 odstotkov .
Na ministrstvu za gospodarstvo , ki je uredbo predlagalo , pravijo , da so se o višini nadomestila odločali na podlagi več kriterijev .
" Oblikovanje nadomestil ni bil administrativni proces , temveč iskanje optimalne rešitve med različnimi interesi zainteresiranih strani .
Narejena je bila primerjalna analiza z drugimi državami in iskali smo pravične rešitve , " pojasnjuje Saša Prešern , vršilec dolžnosti direktorja direktorata za notranji trg na ministrstvu za gospodarstvo .
Poudarja še , da so pri pripravi sodelovali tudi z uradom za intelektualno lastnino in da je uredba primerljiva z evropskimi .
Uredba se sicer pri doplačilih ne omejuje samo na DVD medije .
Vanjo so poleg praznih CD - jev vključeni še predvajalniki MP3 datotek , kjer bo treba , ker omogočajo predvajanje piratske glasbe in tako kršenje avtorskih pravic , doplačati debelih 2000 tolarjev , ali celo spominskih SD karticah , ki jih potrebujemo za shranjevanje počitniških fotografij v digitalnih aparatih .
Na seznamu doplačil so tudi fotokopirni stroji , ki se bodo podražili do 7000 tolarjev , ter posamezne fotokopije , kjer bodo v fotokopirnicah od vsake kopije , ne glede na vsebino , avtorskim kolektivnim organizacijam nakazovali en tolar .
Na uradu in direktoratu so šli celo tako daleč , da bo doplačilo veljalo tudi za mobilne telefone , ki danes povečini že omogočajo predvajanje multimedijskih datotek .
Tako bodo GSM - telefoni za vsak gigabajt prostora dražji za osem tolarjev .
Uvozniki in proizvajalci naprav in medijev so zato že sprožili presojo ustavnosti te uredbe .
Ne zdi se jim namreč logično , da se pristojbina plačuje zgolj zaradi tega , ker mediji omogočajo tudi zapisovanje datotek , ki bi lahko bile sporne .
Gregor Schoss , direktor podjetja Anni , ki uvaža predvajalnike in drugo računalniško opremo , pravi , da so njihove marže zaradi konkurence že tako ali tako minimalne , zato dodatne davščine ne bi mogli prevzeti nase .
" Vse se bo podražilo , " pravi Schoss , ki posebej izpostavlja računalniške medije , kjer bo cena poskočila astronomsko .
Researchers have decoded the genetic makeup of the parasite that causes trichomoniasis , one of the most common sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) , revealing potential clues as to why the parasite has become increasingly drug resistant and suggesting possible pathways for new treatments , diagnostics and a potential vaccine strategy .
The genome sequencing project , funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , part of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , is detailed in the January 12 issue of Science .
" The progress that continues to be made in deciphering the genomes of organisms , such as the Trichomonas vaginalis parasite , helps to further our collective scientific understanding of these organisms , so that we can better address public health issues , " says NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni , M.D .
" By better understanding the genetic makeup of the Trichomonas vaginalis parasite that causes trichomoniasis , we can target our efforts to developing the most effective medicines to treat the infection and potentially create a way to prevent infection altogether , " says NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci , M.D .
Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection that affects both men and women and results in roughly 7.4 million new cases in the United States each year , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
In women , trichomoniasis infection commonly occurs in the vagina , resulting in heavy yellow - green or gray vaginal discharge , vaginal odor , discomfort during sexual intercourse and urination , irritation and itching of the genital area and , in rare cases , lower abdominal pain .
In men , trichomoniasis is most common in the urethra ; however , infected men often do not have symptoms .
Those that do may experience irritation inside the penis , mild discharge , or a slight burning sensation after urination or ejaculation .
Symptoms in both men and women generally appear within five to 28 days of exposure to the parasite .
Both men and women with trichomoniasis have an increased susceptibility to HIV infection and may transmit HIV to their sexual partners .
Pregnant women with trichomoniasis may deliver a low birthweight ( less than five pounds ) or premature infant .
Although the prescription drugs metronidazole and tinidazole usually cure trichomoniasis , drug resistance has become an increasing concern .
T. vaginalis is pear - shaped with thread - like flagella that propel its movement .
Once it attaches to cells lining the host 's urinary or genital tract , it flattens out and begins to ingest the cells , as well as white and red blood cells , causing direct damage to the urinary and vaginal tissues and resulting in inflammation .
T. vaginalis also consumes bacteria that may be present in the urinary and genital areas , including the bacteria necessary for maintaining a normal healthy environment in the vagina .
As a result , women infected with trichomoniasis become more susceptible to becoming infected by HIV and other STIs .
In generating the genetic blueprint for the parasite , researchers were surprised to find such a large and highly repetitive genome comprising nearly 26,000 predicted genes as determined by computer models and previously sequenced parasitic genomes .
Repetitive genes accounted for roughly 65 percent of the genome .
" Parasites generally have smaller amounts of DNA than non-parasitic organisms , but in this case , there was ten times as much DNA than we originally thought there would be , " says lead author Jane M. Carlton , Ph.D. , who led the project while at The Institute for Genomic Research ( TIGR ) , a not - for - profit research organization based in Rockville , Maryland .
Dr. Carlton is now an associate professor in the Department of Medical Parasitology at New York University 's School of Medicine .
Although it is not entirely clear why the genome is so large and repetitive , researchers theorize that the parasite evolved over time , previously inhabiting the intestine and later moving to the urogenital tract , which resulted in increased cell size and , subsequently , a considerably expanded genome .
The researchers also discovered more than 150 instances where bacterial genes may have transferred into the parasite 's genome , suggesting that bacteria may have influenced the development of the parasite 's metabolism .
The decoded genome also revealed 800 genes for surface proteins that likely enable T. vaginalis to adhere to cells in the urinary and genital tracts and cause infection .
Additionally , the researchers were able to analyze proteins thought to be linked to the parasite 's hydrogenosome - - its energy source and the target of the two drugs approved to treat trichomoniasis -- and identified possible ways the parasite may become resistant to these medications .
Understanding how T. vaginalis causes infection and developing methods to prevent it could also help curb the transmission of other STIs often found in connection with trichomoniasis , including chlamydia and gonorrhea , according to the researchers .
" Although trichomoniasis is very prevalent as a sexually transmitted infection , it has not received the attention given to other STIs , " says Carlton .
" Women are the population most affected by it , yet routine gynecological check - ups do not test for this particular infection , and it's not an STI that generally requires public health notification under state statutes .
By better understanding the parasite 's genetic structure , we hope to better understand how best to prevent and / or treat the infection it causes . "

In the rush of the holiday season you may have missed that a white buffalo was born at a small zoo in Pennsylvania .
Only one in 10 million buffalo is born white , and local Native Americans gave him a name in the Lenape language : kenahkihinen , which means " watch over us . "
They found that in a book , however .
No one has actually spoken Lenape for a very long time .
It was once the language of what is now known as the tristate area , but its speakers gradually switched to English , as happened to the vast majority of the hundreds of languages Native Americans once spoke in North America .
The death of languages is typically described in a rueful tone .
There are a number of books treating the death of languages as a crisis equal to endangered species and global warming .
However , I 'm not sure it's the crisis we are taught that it is .
There is a part of me , as a linguist , that does see something sad in the death of so many languages .
It is happening faster than ever :
It has been said that a hundred years from now 90 % of the current 6,000 languages will be gone .
Each extinction means that a fascinating way of putting words together is no longer alive .
In , for example , Inuktitut Eskimo , which , by the way , is not dying , " I should try not to become an alcoholic " is one word : Iminngernaveersaartunngortussaavunga .
Yet the extinctions cannot be stopped , for the most part .
Trying to teach people to speak their ancestral languages , for example , will almost never get far beyond the starting gate .
Some years ago , I spent some weeks teaching Native Americans their ancestral language .
To the extent that the exercise helped give them a feeling of connection to their ancestors , it was time well spent .
However , it was clear that there was no way that they would learn more than some words and expressions .
Languages are hard to learn for adults , especially ones as different from English as Native American ones .
In Pomo , the verb goes at the end of the sentence .
There are sounds it 's hard to make when you 're not born to them .
For busy people with jobs and families , how far were they ever going to be able to get mastering a language whose word for eye is uyqh abe ?
Yes , there was Hebrew .
But that was because of an unusual combination : religion , a new nation , and the superhuman dedication of Eliezer Ben - Yehuda , who settled in Palestine and insisted on speaking only Hebrew to all Jews , including his infant son .
But this extended to reducing his wife to tears when he caught her singing a lullaby to the child in her native Russian .
Clearly Ben - Yehuda 's was one of those once - in - a - lifetime personalities .
Yet the conventional wisdom is that we must strive to have as many future Hebrews as possible , since supposedly one 's language determines one 's cultural outlook .
But a simple question shows how implausible that notion is .
To wit , precisely what " cultural outlook " does English lend its speakers ?
Thinking about the broad heterogeneity of people using this language , it is obvious that the answer is none , and the academic literature on the topic yields little but queer little shards of faint support for the " language is culture " idea .
Which brings us back to languages as , simply , languages .
The language revivalists yearn for  surprise  diversity .
What they miss is that language death is a healthy outcome of diversity .
If people truly come together , then they speak a common language .
We can muse upon a " salad bowl " ideal in which people go home and use their nice " diverse " language with " their own . "
But in reality , almost always the survival of that " diverse " language means that the people are segregated in some way , which in turn is almost always due to an unequal power relationship  i.e. , precisely what " diversity " fans otherwise consider such a scourge .
Jews in shtetls , for example , spoke Yiddish at home and Russian elsewhere because they lived under an apartheid system , not because they delighted in being bilingual .
The Amish still speak German only because they live in isolation from modern life , which few of us would consider an ideal for indigenous groups to strive for .
In the end , the proliferation of languages is an accident : a single original language morphed into 6,000 when different groups of people emerged .
I hope that dying languages can be recorded and described .
I hope that many persist as hobbies , taught in schools and given space in the press , as Irish , Welsh , and Hawaiian have .
However , the prospect we are taught to dread  that one day all the world 's people will speak one language  is one I would welcome .
Surely easier communication , while no cure - all , would be a good thing worldwide .
There 's a reason the Tower of Babel story is one of havoc rather than creation .
For those still uncomfortable given that this single language would be big bad English , then notice how that discomfort eases when you imagine the language being , say , Lenape .

My friend Pighelmet sent me an IM on AR15.com saying , “ Hey O_P , I ’ve got some bullet resistant glass .
Wonder if it will really stop bullets ?
Want to shoot it ?
I will send it to you . ”
The only answer was , “ Sure !
Why not ? ”
The material is called Polycast , cast acrylic sheet .
It is clear and 1 1/ 4 inches thick .
The sheet was approximately 20 ″ X 14 ″
Of course , you give up something for this protection .
In this case you accept the penalty of weight .
t ’s not a laminated type of glass but a type of plastic .
I found the properties listed on this website .
Its uses include : “ Aircraft manufacturers use Polycast sheet in jets and helicopters .
Bullet - resisting Polycast sheet helps solve security problems for banks and stores . ”
The challenging question for today is : “ How “ bullet - resistant ” is bullet - resistant Polycast sheeting ? ”
I built a frame for it as this is required for the glass to work as directed .
We shot from approximately 50 feet .
First we shot it with a .22 LR rifle .
It just made a little crack - type mark on the glass .
Then with a 9 mm 115 gr. Ball .
Shot it with my Beretta 92FS , as is in current use in the sandbox .
It dimpled the glass , but no effect on the back side .
Then with .45 ACP Ball .
We were surprised that the .45ACP only slightly dimpled the glass .
Or , as Tman said , “ Stop , or I ’ll dent your car ! ”
Time for the rifles .
First the favorite of AR15.com , the AR15 ( what else ? )
It made a deep crater in the glass , but did not go through .
It blew shards off of the back side .
Then , the favorite weapon of the “ other side ” , the 7.62 X 39 AK .
Again , it blew shards off the front and back , but did not go through .
Now the big boys .
Shot it with a 7.62 X 51 Ball .
Once again , we were surprised that it did not go through , although it blew shards off front and back .
Wonder if a 12 gauge slug will bust it ?
Let ’s see !
Tman caught me in full recoil and you can see the fragments of glass splashing into the water puddle behind the target .
It went through it like a dose of salt .
It was amazing !
This is where we found the biggest pieces of glass .
Before we went home , I needed to see if Quigley could bust through .
Shot it with my Shiloh Sharps .45 - 70 , 510 grain hard cast , gas - checked round nose .
As Masterson says , “ The legendary Sharps … ”
It blew a hole about 4 inches by 6 inches through the glass .
To be honest , we felt that the glass had been compromised somewhat by this time due to cracks made by the 12 gauge slug .
But it would n’t have made any difference .
Lessons learned :
Shooting stuff is fun .
Bullet resistant Polycast is bullet resistant .
For some bullets .
Not so for others .
Handguns are handguns and rifles are rifles .
Once again , enough said .
Shotgun slugs are awesome .
Tman and I discussed how we are continuing to gain respect for the 12 gauge slug .
We do n’t want to over - learn any lessons .
That does n’t mean that it is the best defense load , but it sure seems to be a tough penetrator .
Thanks to Pighelmet for the material and thanks to Tman for the photo work .
MEN may contribute more than just sperm to the babymaking process - their semen may coax things along as well .
Seminal fluid is regarded as primarily a carrier agent for sperm .
It is thought to increase sperm motility and strength but not actually affect the woman 's body .
Indeed , IVF clinics rinse the semen from sperm and discard it .
But now Rebecca Burch , at the State University of New York at Oswego , has found some intriguing compounds in semen .
In particular , hormones .
Some found in semen , such as follicle stimulating hormone , luteinising hormone and estradiol , are known to induce ovulation .
FSH actually causes the egg to ripen and burst out of the ovary .
Others , such as human chorionic gonadotropin and human placental lactogen have a role in maintaining pregnancy .
Burch thinks human males have evolved the concoction as a counter - strategy to concealed ovulation in women .
Although there are subtle chemical cues that a woman is ovulating , there are no overt signs .
So at any given copulation , a male wanting to reproduce could be wasting his time .
Semen that could help induce ovulation while his sperm are in her reproductive tract would be a great advantage , she says , as would compounds that could bolster a new conception and help the fertilised egg implant .
If this was an evolved strategy , Burch reasoned , species where ovulation is not concealed would not need it .
To test her theory , she asked colleagues at Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta , Georgia , to test the semen of six chimpanzees .
Unlike humans , chimp females advertise their fertility with bright red swollen behinds .
Sure enough , compared to humans , the semen of chimp males had significantly lower levels of FSH and no luteinising hormone whatsoever .
Burch presented her results earlier this week at the meeting of the International Society for Human Ethology in Detroit , Michigan .
IVF clinics should consider not rinsing away the semen , she told New Scientist .
Roger Gosden , at the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility in New York , says he doubts that enough of these compounds could get into the female bloodstream to make a difference , but says he and others remain " mystified " by semen 's composition .

Are Husbands Really Like Potatoes ?
By Bryan Caplan
When men ’s incomes go up , everyone expects the demand for wives to go up as well .
If average male income rises , men have to offer women a piece ( maybe a large piece ) of the increase if they want to attract a wife .
But when women ’s incomes go up , lots of people expect the demand for husbands to go down : “ Once women can become financially independent of a man , they will choose to do so . ”
This is theoretically possible , but only if husbands , like potatoes , are inferior goods .
Counter - intuitive , to say the least .
How many women dream of becoming affluent cat ladies ?
If you distrust intuition , take a look at the facts .
Back when women ’s incomes were low , men who wanted to get married had to be ready to shoulder , say , 90 % of the financial burden of the household .
As women ’s incomes have risen , the fraction of the burden men have to carry to marry has plummeted .
This is just what you would expect if rising female income raised the demand for husbands .
So what ’s going on ?
I can easily believe that some kinds of husbands are inferior goods ; a high - earning woman might rather be a spinster than marry a high - school drop - out .
And there are symbolic margins along which men get a worse deal than 100 years ago – modern males are probably more afraid to make sexist remarks within earshot of their wives .
But if you take a look at how much income women deposit in joint checking accounts , it ’s hard to avoid the conclusion that demand for husbands is at an all - time high .
The course teacher , Sharon Lemburg , is a special education teacher with a degree in physical education and the social sciences .
Philosophy does not feature on her resume , but her marriage to a minister of the Assembly of God church does .
The Assembly of God is a Christian fundamentalist , pro-creationist church , and Lebec , home to 1,300 souls , has become the latest frontline in the debate over intelligent design .
While the debate rumbles away in Kansas , North Dakota and Pennsylvania , it has found its spiritual home in southern California .
For the last hundred years or so , as Carey McWilliams chronicles in the admirable collection of his writings Fool 's Paradise , southern California has provided a welcoming home for all manner of religious offshoots , wacky beliefs , cults , messiahs and worse .
The Mighty I AM movement , with its deity Saint Germain and his earthly messengers Guy Ballard and his wife Edna , took hold in the 1930s before ending in his death and her conviction on fraud .
Modern astrology also came of age in southern California , and can still be seen today with the ubiquitous roadside fortune - tellers .
Annie Besant established a home to await the next coming of the Messiah , but she was some years after the coming of the next best thing , Sister Aimee McPherson .
Arriving penniless in 1922 , so the legend goes , in three years she collected more than $ 1 m from her congregation and owned property worth $ 250,000 .
She built the Angelus Temple , with an auditorium capable of holding 5,000 people , and her revivalist meetings attracted thousands of people and thousands of dollars .
But her rise ended with a faked disappearance in 1926 and her arrest on charges of having given false information .
The charges were subsequently dropped and she died from an overdose of sleeping powder in 1944 .
Today southern California is the spiritual home to a movement with a deity to match anything from the past , Scientology .
The southern Californian manifestation of intelligent design is no straightforward matter .
While a group of parents has filed a lawsuit alleging that the school is violating the separation between church and state by teaching intelligent design , its advocates are unhappy too .
Smarting from their defeat last month at the hands of a Pennsylvania judge who dismissed the theory as " an interesting theological argument but ... not science " , supporters of intelligent design have argued that the course is misleading because it suggests a philosophical rather than a scientific debate .
Their intention to present intelligent design within the mainstream of scientific debate is being stymied by the creationists ' insistence on seeing everything through the eyes of God .
" It 's clear that the course wrongly mixes intelligent design with ... biblical creationism , " said a letter from the Discovery Institute to the school board .
Intelligent design , the letter continued , " is based upon empirical data , rather than religious scripture " and " does not try to inject itself into religious discussions about the identity of the intelligence responsible for life . "
But , allege opponents of the school 's actions , the school board described its course as philosophy precisely to avoid the potential illegality of teaching intelligent design or creationism as science following the Pennsylvania ruling .
A description of the course circulated to parents in December said : " The class will take a close look at evolution as a theory and will discuss the scientific , biological and biblical aspects that suggest why Darwin 's philosophy is not rock solid .
The class will discuss intelligent design as an alternative response to evolution .
Physical and chemical evidence will be presented suggesting the earth is thousands of years old , not billions . "
Most of the evidence comes from videos .
The original syllabus for the course listed 24 videos that would be used for instruction , 23 of them produced by religious groups .
One , made by a group called Answers in Genesis , is titled Chemicals to Living Cells : Fantasy or Science .
In a letter to lawyers representing parents opposed to the class , the school superintendent , John Wright , wrote : " Our legal advisers have pointed out they are unaware of any court or California statute which has forbidden public schools to explore cultural phenomena , including history , religion or creation myths . "
He would , he said , " promptly intervene if anyone should stray into teaching or advocating the tenets of any religion or creed , including intelligent design . "
Barry Lynn , the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , which has brought the lawsuit on behalf of the parents , believes that the course is a blatant attempt to teach intelligent design , but under the auspices of philosophy instead of science .
" There is a national crusade under way to inject religion into our public schools , and it must not succeed , " said Mr Lynn .
" Religious Right activists are looking for every opportunity to proselytise students into their doctrines . "
All of which brings us to the 15 teenagers enrolled in the Philosophy of Design course .
" Personally , I do n't know what to think , " 15 - year - old Jeremy Hurst , told the Los Angeles Times .
Hurst 's father is a scientist and one of the parents involved in the lawsuit .
His mother takes him to Baptist church every Sunday .
I stumbled upon this quite a while ago , but I thought I might share it with the world .

ちょうど1年前に日経ソフトウエアというプログラミング雑誌の編集部に異動になって以来，「プログラミングって一体何だろう？」とずっと考えて続けている。今度，日経ソフトウエア6月号で“プログラミングをしたことのない人向けの超入門記事”を書くことになり，プログラミングの本質について考えてみるいい機会だと思った。そこでふと気が付いた。「プログラミングをしたことのない人が考えていることが，自分にはわからない」ということに。
私には職業プログラマの経験はないし，長いプログラムを書いた経験もない。いわゆる「コードが書ける」人間だとはお世辞にも言えない。自分が記事の中で書いたサンプル・プログラムをあとで見返して，不自然な部分を発見して赤面するなんてことはよくあるし，最近よく参加している勉強会 （注1） では演習問題が解けなくて苦しんでいる。
注1：「素人くさいSICP読書会」といいます。SICP（Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs，邦題：計算機プログラムの構造と解釈）は，コンピュータのプログラムに関する古典的名著。この本の中で説明に使われているプログラミング言語は，Lispの方言の一つであるScheme。
それでも，プログラミングとの付き合いだけは長い。BASICというプログラミング言語の文法を知ったのは確か中学生のときだし，高校生のときにはシャープの「MZ-80K2E」というマイコンで簡単なゲームのプログラムくらいは書いていた。自分にとっては，「変数」という概念一つとってみても，当たり前すぎて，それが学校の数学の授業で普通に習うものなのか，プログラミングに特有な概念なのかということさえ思い出せない。
そこで身内に応援を頼むことにした。この身内は，パソコン雑誌の編集の経験があり，コンピュータについてまんざら知らないわけではない。ただしプログラミングは一切したことがない。今回の記事が想定する読者のサンプルにまさにうってつけだ。
まず 「なぜ君はプログラミングをしないの？」と聞いてみた。返ってきたのは「野菜を作ったり魚を捕ったりすることと同じなんじゃない？」という答え。「自分は野菜を利用するけど畑を耕すわけじゃない。魚も食べるけど捕ったりはしない」。同じように，自分はソフトウエアは使うけど自分でプログラミングはしない，というわけだ。なるほど。どんなことでも，仕事でする人もいれば，全くしない人もいる。その中間に趣味でする人がいる。例えば，市民農園で野菜を育てる人とか釣りをする人とか。日経ソフトウエアも，読者の3分の1は趣味でしかプログラミングをしない人たちだ。趣味なら，やるもやらないもまさに本人の“ 趣味” である。
プログラマに対するイメージも聞いてみた。「最先端だけど不安定」「学歴不問でハイIQ」。実力主義っぽいイメージだ。これはこれで当たっている気がする。“学歴不問”というのは，きっと大学を中退したBill Gates やSteve Jobsのことが頭に浮かんだのだろう。「オブジェクト指向とか，普通の単語を普通でない意味で使っている」とも言った。これもわかる。“普通の人とはちょっと違っている”ことは，よくも悪くもプログラマのアイデンティティの一部になっている。すばらしいプログラムを書くには，ある種の特別な能力が必要であるのはまぎれもない事実だ （注2） 。ただ，それはプロフェッショナルが存在する仕事ならどんな仕事にも当てはまるが。
注2：プログラマが「プログラミングに特別な能力が必要であること」を強調したがるのには理由がある。現在の日本のソフトウエア業界には「プログラミングをしない人のほうが立場が上である」というケースが往々にして見られ，そのせいでプログラムの質が上がらないという構造的な問題があるからだ。この問題に関しては「
Life is beautiful 」 というブログの 「 ソフトウェアの仕様書は料理のレシピに似ている」というエントリが参考になる。
で，何がわからないのだろう？
身内への取材の主題は 「プログラミングをしない人は何がわからないか」である。そこで，プログラミングに関するいろんな事項について知っているかどうかを尋ねてみた。
個人的に最も新鮮だったのは，「プログラミング言語には様々な種類がある」ことを知らなかった点である。コンピュータ雑誌の元編集者が知らないということは，プログラミングに縁の薄い人はまず知らないと考えて間違いない。「人がしゃべる言語と同じで，いろいろなプログラミング言語があるんだよ」と説明すると「結構，アバウトなんだね」という答えが返ってきた。何か理路整然とした美しい世界を想像していたらしい。プログラミングがそうした世界であるという理解はあながち間違いではないが。
それでも，いくつかのプログラミング言語の名前を挙げると「聞いたことがある」というものもあった。固有名詞と“プログラミング言語”という概念が結びついていなかったようだ。具体的には
聞いたことがある ：COBOL ，BASIC，C/C++，Java，Ruby，Perl
聞いたことがない ：FORTRAN，Lisp，Pascal ，Smalltalk ，Python，PHP
という結果だった。もちろん，1個人の話なので意味のあるデータではない。ただ，言語のメジャー度や個人的な経験が加味された結果だと思うと興味深かった。
会話の中では，様々な鋭い指摘が飛び出し，楽しかった。「プログラムは字が書いてあるだけなのにどうして絵が動くの？」「パソコンを動かすソフトを，特別な機械ではなくパソコンを使って作れるのはなぜ？」「ソフトを開発するためのソフトがあるのが不思議」。こうした疑問は私ひとりでは出てこない。「早く作業を進めるために面倒なプログラミングをするのはかえって段取りが悪いんじゃないの？」と言うのを聞いたときには，自分が最近Webに書いた，自動化に関する講演の記事（参考リンク）を思い出した。
根元的な問いも出た。 「なんでプログラミングしないとソフトウエアができないの？。もっと簡単に作れたほうがいいのに」。もっともである。もし，人間が普通の言葉で指示すると，その通りにコンピュータがやってくれるようになれば，プログラミングは不要になる。
私も実は4年ほど前，プログラミング言語Rubyの開発者にして日本一のプログラミング言語オタクでもあるまつもとゆきひろ氏に，同じようなことを聞いてみたことがある。今はなき日経バイトの取材でのことだ。そのときの回答は「いつかはコンピュータが人間の言葉を理解して動作するようになるだろう」ということだった。ただし，遠い遠い未来のことだという注釈付きだったと記憶している。
それから も 「プログラミングが不要になることはあるのか」ということについて考え続けているが，むろん答えは出ていない。未来のプログラミングで，今のように英単語と数式をちりばめたようなプログラミング言語が依然として主流であり続けるのかどうかもよくわからない。ただ最近，一つだけ確かなことがあると思うようになった。「形態がどんなに変わっても，プログラミングは創造的な作業であり続けるに違いない」ということだ。ソフトウエアが「誰かを幸せにする」ことを目指している限りは。
OK I ’ve decided to jump into this discussion of using stored procedures for data access and manipulation .
First I will start out with some background .
I have been involved in building multi tier applications for nearly 10 years .
In this time we have adopted a rule for our projects :
Stored Procedures are the ONLY mechanism for accessing data .
In this post I will discuss some of the points made by Jermey Miller in his post :
http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/05/25/145450.aspx
One thing I will compliment Jeremy on is his disclosure of the types of applications he builds .
Jeremy discusses using the database as mechanism for object persistence .
Jermemy states his apps are “ are primarily about business rules , not reporting ” .
Fair enough .
Generally speaking the applications I work on deal with large amounts of data and an equally large number of users .
The largest application I work on has over a Terabyte of live OLTP data and upwards of 1,000 concurrent users .
This application started with 70 GB of data in 1999 and had grown to that size in 7 years .
This application was created with 100 % stored procedures .
In the interest of disclosure : I am not a TDD expert , nor do we implement a TDD style of development here .
However , we do use concepts that have been adopted by the TDD world .
Further down this blog post I will discuss TDD concepts so keep this in mind .
So here are some of our realities :
Stored Procedures are a Requirement for Batch Processing
In systems of any size there are always batch processes : Credit card applications need to be scored , letter files need to be created for export to mail houses , customer statements need to be created .
How much of this data will you transfer to a middle tier server ?
If your data is of any significant size the answer should be none or very little .
These types of processes need to be run on the server .
Transferring data back and forth to a middle tier is not a wise idea on a number of levels the primary one being network performance .
These types of operations are best suited to running in a stored procedure .
Stored Procedures as API
Another benefit of stored procedures is that they are an API .
Stored procedures separate implementation from interface .
Stored procedures are a contract between the developer layer and the database layer .
The physical storage mechanism for data may differ greatly from the presented view of the data .
DBA ’s must be able to physically change the underlying data without the permission of the developers .
There job is to conform to the contract they provided the developer .
How they implement that contract is up to them .
Also … stored procedures can be testing in an automated way .
You can incorporate stored procedure calls into your unit testing framework .
Stored Procedures and TDD
One of Jeremy ’s criticisms about stored procedures is that they : “ make TDD a slower , less productive process . ”
He goes on to state that referential integrity ( or other database constraints ) requires you to set up a lot of other data in order to run your tests .
From his words he never says it ’s not possible , just more difficult .
It seems to me that having ordered sets of tests or branched sets of tests might solve this issue .
DBA ’s Do Work Separately from Developers
In a lot of companies this is the reality : DBA ’s work separately from developers .
A lot of organizations separate operational and developmental ( R&D ) duties .
DBA ’s responsibility is to keep a database operating within acceptable performance parameters .
The function of DBA is not just making sure there ’s enough disk space and that the data is backed up .
DBA ’s do lots of query analysis and tuning .
One thing that may not be obvious in a database is that a query that runs fine today might not run the same way tomorrow .
Why not ?
Well as data is added to a database the statistics surrounding that data may change .
This means queries that ran fine last night might not run the same way today .
It is the job of the DBA to fix these problems ASAP when they are found .
So if the queries are all being fired from a client , what is a DBA to do ?
Are they going to ask a developer to make a change to production code and slip stream a version to 1000 desktops during production ?
Yah right !
What they will do in a production environment is : change the offending stored procedure , test it and put it into production on demand .
This is a much less intrusive mechanism for making a change during production .
Is this recommended ?
Not necessarily but it is a reality in a production world .
Another reality is that in a lot of cases DBA ’s own their databases .
Developers are required to live in the world of the DBAs and they dictate just how data is access from there database and who can access that data .
In a lot of cases DBAs will provide data to developers in the form of stored procedures , no questions asked .
If this is the case what do you do with your TDD process ?
As Clint Eastwood said in Heartbreak Ridge : “ You adapt , you overcome ” .
Just because it ’s hard does n’t mean it can be done .
TDD developers need to adapt there processes to this reality .
Without saying : Let me know whatcha think !

A quarter century after they discovered it , researchers have identified the job of one of the most common DNA - damage response proteins .
The enzyme has puzzled scientists because it is present in nearly every organism , which suggests that it is crucial to life , and yet , in laboratory experiments , its function has remained a mystery .
The discovery suggests that the enigmatic enzyme known as DinB DNA polymerase is specialized for proficient and accurate replication of a particular kind of damaged DNA , reports Graham Walker , an HHMI professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
DNA is assaulted daily by toxic chemicals , metabolic byproducts , sunlight , and other forms of radiation .
Most of the nicks and dings are quickly fixed by the cell ’s fleet of precision DNA repair processes , which can surgically excise and replace a faulty section .
But sometimes a damaged bit of DNA slips through unrepaired .
A faulty nucleotide –the basic constituent of DNA –can stall the temperamental DNA replication machinery as it unwinds and copies the genome in dividing cells .
In humans , uncorrected DNA errors passed along to the new daughter cells can lead to cancer .
When DNA integrity is at stake , a family of proteins known as translesion DNA polymerases comes to the rescue .
They cannot actually repair a damaged strand of DNA , but they can smooth over the problem by inserting a nucleotide opposite the damaged partner , so the DNA replication machinery can finish duplicating the chromosome despite the damaged DNA .
This trick is usually referred to as a DNA damage tolerance mechanism .
“ It enables the replication to keep going and tolerate the damage , even though it does n’t get rid of it , ” Walker explained .
The molecular building blocks of DNA are adenine , cytosine , guanine , thymine – A , C , G , and T in the shorthand of molecular biology .
In different combinations , they make up the genes that code for the proteins that carry out the routine and complex tasks necessary for life .
Now , researchers in Walker ’s lab have discovered that the enzyme DinB is exceptionally skilled at copying over a particular kind of damage to the G nucleotide .
When the main DNA replication machinery stalls at the damaged G , the DinB translesion polymerase recognizes the G and adds its chemical partner , C , to form the correct base pair in the new chromosome .
“ It was a pretty striking result , ” Walker said .
“ Not only did DinB copy over the damaged G nucleotide , it was 10 to 15 times better at copying the damaged G than copying the undamaged G. Up until now , it did n’t look like that useful a polymerase . ”
Experiments led by MIT graduate student Daniel Jarosz and former postdoctoral fellow Veronica Godoy revealed that when bacteria that are missing DinB are exposed to a chemical that causes DNA damage , these bacteria are 1,000 times more likely to die than normal bacteria .
Godoy is now an assistant professor of biology at Northeastern University in Boston .
She and Jarosz also found that DinB can only repair G damage of a certain size .
For example , they said , DinB cannot efficiently copy over a particularly bulky type of damage caused by a chemical found in charcoal - broiled steaks .
The researchers also discovered that a single change in the amino acids that make up DinB will strip it of its unique talent and change it into an ordinary polymerase .
When a protein is that easy to modify , scientists assume its function must be important to have survived several billion years of evolution .
“ In general , we think that nature evolved this function to help us survive DNA damage that would otherwise kill us , ” said Walker .
“ It ’s probably a kind of damage that all cells encounter frequently in life . ”
Walker and colleagues found that DinB ’s unique ability to repair DNA damage extends to mice and archaea , an ancient and diverse group of single - celled organisms .
In nearly every organism , they believe , the same specialized enzyme is poised to patch over a certain kind of blemish so that it does not permanently damage the genome .
The DinB gene and its protein product were first discovered in Walker ’s lab in 1980 , long before scientists knew anything about translesion polymerases .
Then graduate student Cynthia Kenyon , now a biologist at University of California , San Francisco who has done groundbreaking work on the genetic basis of aging in worms , systematically identified the genes turned on in bacteria exposed to DNA damaging agents , the so - called SOS response .
Kenyon named the damaged - inducible ( Din ) genes in order of discovery , and DinB was the second one she found .
“ Knocking it out did n’t seem to have an obvious effect , ” Walker said .
“ We could n’t find anything interesting in the mutant bacteria . ”
Since then , the known DinB family has grown to include five related proteins in bacteria , 10 in yeast , and four in people .
“ We found it 25 years ago , ” said Walker about DinB , “ and we ’re just now finding out what it does . ”

Google CEO joins Apple board
Eric Schmidt elected to computer maker 's board of directors .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Apple Computer said Tuesday it had elected Google CEO Eric Schmidt to its board of directors .
Shares of Cupertino , Calif . - based Apple ( Charts ) rose nearly 1 percent in extended trading on the announcement , which was made after the market close .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt
" Like Apple , Google is very focused on innovation and we think Eric 's insights and experience will be very valuable in helping to guide Apple in the years ahead , " Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in a statement .
Schmidt also serves on Google 's ( Charts ) board of directors as well as Princeton University 's board of trustees .
Schmidt is in charge of handling Google 's day - to - day operations as well as developing the search provider 's corporate infrastructure .
" Apple is one of the companies in the world that I most admire , " said Schmidt in a statement .
" I 'm really looking forward to working with Steve and Apple 's board to help with all of the amazing things Apple is doing . "
Before Google , he was chairman and CEO of business software maker Novell .
Schmidt also held the chief technology officer position at Sun Microsystems .
Google 's terrible twos
The main political parties supported a bill establishing jail sentences of six to 30 years for women who terminate their pregnancies and doctors who perform the procedure .
The proposal was fast - tracked through parliament in the run-up to a presidential election next month , prompting accusations that it was an opportunistic vote - grabbing ploy .
The bill , if signed into law by President Enrique Bolaños , will overturn a 130 - year - old policy permitting abortions in exceptional cases and put Nicaragua among several countries , mostly in Africa and the Middle East , with total bans .
Latin America seemed to be going the other way , with Mexico , Colombia and Chile signalling possible moves to loosen abortion laws .
Human rights groups and medical associations said the decision would endanger women 's lives and criminalise doctors who tried to save their patients .
A few politicians have also voiced opposition , saying it was " mad " to make such an important decision in the heat of an election .
However , leaders of the ruling conservative Liberal Alliance and the opposition leftwing Sandinistas , which control all but one of parliament 's 92 seats , voted in favour .
Permitting abortions in exceptional cases , they said , gave pregnant women and sympathetic doctors a loophole by citing risk to health .
Rafael Cabrera , an obstetrician and leader of the Yes to Life movement , told journalists that medical science advances meant a foetus could be brought to the point of viability without endangering the mother 's life .
" We do n't believe a child should be destroyed under the pretext that a woman might die , " he said .
The church , a powerful force since 85 % of the population of 6 million is Catholic , drove the campaign .
Posters , billboards and pamphlets urged people to vote against pro-abortion candidates , a message echoed at a recent 200,000 - strong rally in the capital Managua .
The bill drew heavily on a text drafted by the Nicaraguan Catholic Bishops Conference .
A pro-choice march drew just a few hundred people .
Daniel Ortega , the Sandinista leader and former president who has a strong chance of getting his job back , has backed the ban .
Last year he was married by a Catholic cardinal and in recent months has quoted the Pope and been photographed attending Mass .
Critics , including some within the Sandinistas , said the 60 - year - old former revolutionary had betrayed the movement 's tradition of feminism and liberalism to try to clinch victory in the first round of the presidential election on November 5 .
Of the four leading candidates , Edmundo Jarquín , leader of a dissident Sandinista faction , was the only one to oppose the bill .
In the past three years , only 24 legal abortions have been performed , including one in 2004 carried out on a nine - year - old rape victim , but it is an open secret that many well - off families send female relatives to Cuba for the procedure .
A third of new mothers are aged 16 or younger and in opinion polls women cite domestic abuse as one of their biggest problems .
Tens of thousands of pregnant women are estimated to have illegal abortions in Nicaragua every year .
An open letter from medical workers this week pleaded with legislators to reject the bill .
Efrain Toruno , president of the Nicaraguan Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics , told a news conference that his colleagues would be afraid to do anything if a woman with vaginal bleeding arrived at hospital .
" If we treat her we could be prosecuted , and if we do n't we could also be prosecuted . "
It never ceases to amaze me the way in which management budget holders will cut of their nose to spite their face when it comes to investing in developer 's workstations .
I 'm constantly going into companies where every techie from their top developers ( who like to call themselves ' Architects ' but that 's for another post ) to their junior programmers are slaving away on some Pentium 3 piece of crap with less than 2GB of RAM .
Often I sit with these people to do some pairing or mentoring and it is painful in the extreme .
Start the database , start the application server , start the IDE and before long the pitiful machine is having trouble rendering the screen let alone compiling the source code .
Throw in an on access scanner for viruses and the machine is virtually useless ( I say virtually because they would be perfectly effective for use by Word jockeys such as the management and procurement drones who insist that developers use these underpower machines ) .
So how much time is wasted by using sub par machines ?
Having timed myself working on a rubbish desktop for an entire week ( Pentium 4 1.8GHz /w 768 MB of RAM ) and added up the time I have had to wait for things like the screen to render , windows to minimise , for the mouse cursor to react I can give the figure as 45 % .
That is 45 % of my time is spent waiting for the machine to give me back control plus the extra time it takes to do things such as long compile cycles .
It does n't include the time wasted because I forgot what I was doing because the machine locked up or took 5 mins to do a task that would take 10 seconds on a modern machine .
So forget how much I 'm paid , because I 'm not telling you , but I happen to know the going rate for a very junior developer is around 50,000 USD ( 40,000 EUR or 30,000 GBP ) .
Therefore we have a loss of 11,250 USD ... 11,250 USD per year !.
How much does a decent developer machine cost ?
Not much more that 3,000 USD for a dual core 3.75 GHz with 4GB of memory and an 300 GB hard disk .
Therefore buy the decent machine actually makes a saving of 8,250 USD per year .
However managers get patted on the back for not spending money .
And the last thing they want is things to get complicated , like doing ROI and making investments , as they get a little confused and so does their boss and that 's why techies very rarely get suitable machines .
New York Jets wide receiver Laveranues Coles is a survivor of sexual abuse .
In a profile in Sunday editions of The New York Times , Coles said he was molested between the ages of 10 and 13 by a man his mother later married .
The Pro Bowl wide receiver thought he was alone in his inner
struggles , and too proud to let any outsiders into his personal
prison .
But Coles recently decided to free himself of his secret in the hopes it might help other children who have endured abuse .
" I have n't talked about it in ... forever , but I know that
holding something like that inside has been a burden for so long , "
Coles said Sunday after helping the Jets beat Miami 17 - 7 .
" For me
to get on this platform that I have , having been in the league and
have all the media attention that we have , I think it 's something
that should be said .
" If it gets one kid to come out and say , ' Look , this is
happening to me , ' ... I think it 's right . "
Coles remained silent about the abuse for years ,
instead using it to drive him to become one of the NFL 's best receivers .
He said even close friends on the Jets were unaware that he had been abused .
According to the Times , Coles ' stepfather , whose name the
receiver did n't want to reveal , was sentenced to nine years in a
Florida prison in 1992 after pleading guilty to the crimes .
He
served 3 ½ years , but was later convicted of another crime and has
been in prison since 2001 .
Coles ' mother , Sirretta , divorced her husband when the abuse was
first revealed and sought counseling for the youngster .
Coles
realizes that coming out with this now publicly will reopen old
wounds for the family .
" We 'll talk about it , " Coles said .
" I love my mom and we love
each other and we 'll talk about it briefly and put it behind us
again . "
Coles told The Times that he received counseling , but it clashed with the athletic mentality of shrugging off injuries .
" You just want to put it behind you , " he said .
" I think , you know , as a man , when you 're violated in that way , you do n't know how other people are going to take it , how other people are going to view you .
There 's so much that comes with revealing that part of your life and story . "
Coles does n't worry about what others might think or say about
what he went through .
He 's proven himself to be a star on the
football field , now in his sixth NFL season -- and second stint with
the Jets after spending the last two years with Washington .
" I think with age comes maturity , and I think now that I 'm a
little older , I think I can deal with it a little better and I just
want to help kids because I think it happens to more people in this
world than we actually allow ourselves to believe , " said Coles , 27 .
" Coming up , I always felt like I was the only one that ever
happened to .
Then , when I started going to different sessions , they
let me know that it happens to a lot more people . "
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
Every once in a while The Name Inspector likes to step back and look at the big picture .
This post illustrates ten name categories that account for all the names in the TechCrunch company / product index .
Well , almost all of them .
The name 1 800 Free 411 would have required its own category , and that would have made eleven categories instead of the magic ten .
So let ’s just ignore that name for now .
Though most of the TechCrunch names are “ Web 2.0 ″ names , there ’s nothing particularly Web 2.0 about the categories .
They all represent linguistic naming strategies that can be used for companies or products of any kind .
Of course , there are different ways to categorize names .
You can use phonetic properties like sonority or number of syllables .
You can use semantic criteria , such as whether they are metaphorical , metonymic , or literally descriptive .
The categories below are based on the morphological structure of names : what kinds of meaningful pieces they have and how the pieces fit together .
They ’re listed in descending order of frequency .
The number of names in each category is in parentheses .
1. Real Words ( 34 )
Names that are simply repurposed words .
Such names ca n’t be generically descriptive , because then they would n’t be protectible trademarks , so they usually work through metaphor or metonymy ( indirect association ) .
Pros :
These names are short and come ready - made with rich , often multiple associations .
Cons : Expect to pay money –possibly a lot–to secure the URL .
Trademarking can be tricky too .

Misspelled words
These are simply words that have been misspelled to make them more distinctive .
This addresses the URL / trademark issue .
( Update 9/23/2011 : See Fritinancy ’s great cautionary post about how misspelling does not help to defend a trademark . )

Topix ( topics )
Zooomr ( zoomer )
Foreign words
Renkoo ( Japanese renku , a type of poetry )
Rojo ( Spanish ‘ red ’ )
Vox ( Latin ‘ voice ’ )
2. Compounds ( 31 )
Each of these names consists of two words put together , with the first word receiving the main emphasis in pronunciation .
( It does n’t matter if there ’s a space between words ) .
In most cases both words are nouns .
Names with verbs in the second position are Bubbleshare , Google Talk , and possibly Tailrank ( share , talk , and rank can all be nouns , but they ’re verbs under the most natural interpretation ) .
Names with non-nouns in the first position are BlueDot , SocialText , JotSpot , Measure Map , and possibly Jumpcut , Rapleaf , and SearchFox .
Again , the first words here can all be nouns , but they ’re more naturally treated as two adjectives ( blue and social ) and a bunch of verbs .
Compounds are a simple way to create new words and are very common in English ( and other Germanic languages ) , so it ’s not surprising to find them high on the list .
Pros :
The practically limitless number of possible combinations makes it easy to create a unique name .
Interesting meanings can be created through the combination of words .
Cons :
There are no huge drawbacks , which is one reason that compounds are popular , but they are longer than many other kinds of name .

3. Phrases ( 25 )
These are names that follow normal rules for putting words together to make phrases ( other than compounds ) .
Pros :
They sound linguistically natural and have clear meanings because they follow regular rules .
Cons :
Phrase names can be long , and they can also sound awkward when used as nouns if they are not already noun phrases ( e.g .
Have you tried iLike ? )

Notice the Google Talk is not here –it ’s on the compound list .
That ’s because Google Talk is pronounced with the emphasis on Google , which means that the whole thing is treated as one word .
As far as The Name Inspector knows , all the names immediately above are pronounced with some emphasis on each word , and the main emphasis on the second .

Each of these names has two parts , at least one of which is a recognizable portion of a word rather than a whole word .
Pros :
When they work , blends can be short and elegant and have all the advantages of compounds .
Cons :
When they do n’t work , blends can be awkward and / or have obscure meanings .

Zillow ( zillions + pillow , with overlap of - ill -)
5 . Tweaked words ( 11 )
Some names are just words that have been slightly changed in pronunciation and spelling–usually with a letter replaced or added .
Pros :
As long as people recognize the word , you get all its rich meaning while still having a distinctive name .
Cons : People might not recognize the word , and some of these names can be a little cheesy and gimmicky .
Attensa ( attention )
CNet ( might stand for computer network , but who thinks of it that way ? )

6. Affixed words ( 10 )
These are all novel forms consisting of a real word and a real prefix or suffix .
Notice how common the - ster suffix is .
Pros :
These names can be distinctive and meaningful while remaining relatively short .
Cons : Sometimes these names sound contrived .
The meanings added by affixes are limited in variety and usually abstract ( which means not very vivid ) .
Browster
CoComment
Dogster
Feedster
Findory

Performancing ( performance is n’t a verb , so does n’t normally take - ing ending )
PostSecret ( post can also be a noun or a verb , making this a compound )
7 . Made up or obscure origin ( 8 )
These are short names that are either made up or whose origins are so obscure that they might as well be made up .
Pros : Made - up names can be short , cute , and very distinctive ( and therefore easy to trademark ) .
Cons : Made - up names do n’t provide much ready - made meaning to work with ( all the meaning has to come from sound symbolism ) .
Good ones are hard to think of , and when they ’re short the URLs are likely to be taken .

8. Puns ( 8 )
These names are words or phrases that have been modified slightly to evoke an appropriate second meaning .
They ’re similar to blends , but they involve a coincidental similarity between part of the main word and the second evoked word .
Pros :
Pun names can be fun and memorable .
Cons : Nothing sounds dumber than a bad pun .
Automattic ( automatic , mat –> matt , the guy who started the company )
Consumating ( consummating , consumm –> consum(e ) )
Farecast ( forecast , fore –> fare )

Writely ( rightly , right –> write )
9 . People ’s names ( real or fictitious ) ( 5 )
Some names are either pitched or recognizable as people ’s names .
If the audience for a name does n’t see the connection , the name is just like a made - up one .
Pros :
These names are short and give personality to a company ( or product or service ) .
Cons : Aside from personality , these names do n’t provide meaning to work with .
As with made - up names , good , short ones might not be available as URLs .
Bix ( e.g. Bix Beiderbecke )
Jajah ( F. Jajah Watamba seems to be their fictitious spokesperson )
Kiko ( a name in Japanese and other languages )
Ning ( a Chinese name )
Riya ( the name of a founder ’s daughter )
10 . Initials and Acronyms ( 3 )
These are names made up of the first letter of each word in a much longer phrase name .
Sometimes the letters are pronounced individually , in which case we can just think of them as initials , and sometimes the combination of letters is pronounced as a word , in which case it ’s an acronym .
Pros :
These names provide short mnemonics for long , descriptive phrases .
Cons : Zzzzzz .
Also , sometimes initials are short when written but long when spoken .
For example , the initials www have nine syllables when spoken , while the phrase world wide web has three .
AOL ( America Online )
FIM ( Fox Interactive Media )
Guba ( Gigantic Usenet Binaries Archive )
The Name Inspector hopes that these name categories will be useful to people struggling with their own naming problems .

Olive Oil Lowers Oxidative Stress Marker
The ability of olive oil to lower a marker for oxidative damage of DNA in cells suggests that olive oil might lower the risk of cancer .
If you want to avoid developing cancer , then you might want to add eating more olive oil to your list of New Year 's resolutions .
In a study to be published in the January 2007 issue of The FASEB Journal , scientists from five European countries describe how the anti-cancer effects of olive oil may account for the significant difference in cancer rates among Northern and Southern Europeans .
The authors drew this conclusion based on the outcomes of volunteers from Denmark , Finland , Germany , Italy , and Spain , who consumed 25 milliliters ( a little less than a quarter cup ) of olive oil every day for three weeks .
During this time , the researchers examined urine samples of the subjects for specific compounds known to be waste by - products of oxidative damage to cells , a precursor to cancer .
At the beginning of the trial , the presence of these waste by - products was much higher in Northern European subjects than their Southern European counterparts .
By the end of three weeks , however , the presence of this compound in Northern European subjects was substantially reduced .
" Determining the health benefits of any particular food is challenging because of it involves relatively large numbers of people over significant periods of time , " said lead investigator Henrik E. Poulsen , M.D. of Rigshospitalet , Denmark .
" In our study , we overcame these challenges by measuring how olive oil affected the oxidation of our genes , which is closely linked to development of disease .
This approach allows us to determine if olive oil or any other food makes a difference .
Our findings must be confirmed , but every piece of evidence so far points to olive oil being a healthy food .
By the way , it also tastes great . "
I 'd like to see more dietary studies using oxidative stress markers as a quicker way to guess at the likely long term effects of various food choices .
The polyphenols in olive oil surprisingly do not look like the cause of the lowered oxidative stress marker .
Another interesting finding in the study suggests that researchers are just beginning to unlock the mysteries of this ancient " health food . "
Specifically , the researchers found evidence that the phenols in olive oil are not the only compounds that reduced oxidative damage .
Phenols are known antioxidant compounds that are present in a wide range of everyday foods , such as dark chocolate , red wine , tea , fruits , and vegetables .
Despite reducing the level of phenols in the olive oil , the study 's subjects still showed that they were receiving the same level of health benefits .
I 'd like to see studies done using different high phenol foods that are low in fat to see if any of the foods can lower oxidative stress using the same marker ( 8oxodG - sounds like an oxidized form of the nucleic acid guanine ) that these researchers used .
The researchers measured the compound 8oxodG in the urine as an indicator of oxidative stress and damage and found olive oil lowered 8oxodG .
Oxidative damage is a process whereby the metabolic balance of a cell is disrupted by exposure to substances that result in the accumulation of free - radicals , which can then damage the cell .
The men were found to have around 13 % less 8 oxodG compared with their levels at the beginning of the study .
At the beginning of the study , men from northern Europe had higher levels of 8oxodG than those from southern Europe , supporting the idea that olive oil had a reductive effect .
I 've started eating more olives and olive oil .
The olive oil is displacing canola oil .
But we need a comparative study of the effects of olive oil and canola oil on urine 8oxodG .
Ditto for fish oils .
The bigger story on olive oil has been the suspected heart benefit .
A September 2006 paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found olive oil boosts heart healthy HDL cholesterol while lowering triglycerides and lowering oxidized LDL cholesterol .
Results :
A linear increase in high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol levels was observed for low - , medium - , and high - polyphenol olive oil : mean change , 0.025 mmol / L ( 95 % CI , 0.003 to 0.05 mmol / L ) , 0.032 mmol /L ( CI , 0.005 to 0.05 mmol / L ) , and 0.045 mmol / L ( CI , 0.02 to 0.06 mmol / L ) , respectively .
Total cholesterol HDL
cholesterol ratio decreased linearly with the phenolic content of the olive oil .
Triglyceride levels decreased by an average of 0.05 mmol / L for all olive oils .
Oxidative stress markers decreased linearly with increasing phenolic content .
When you can lower heart disease and cancer risk with the same dietary practice that sounds like a winner to me .
GooTube 's Porn Opportunists : The Expanding World of Upload - It - Yourself Smut
People have been making amateur porn and uploading it to YouTube since its inception ; after all , it 's human nature to sexualize any new technology .
Smart online sites like Second Life , while not a sex site , take this need to sexualize as a grown - up given .
In their architecture and business model , they just sort of budget in that adult users will use a certain percentage of their world for sex , and set up all the necessary precautions to make this a safe and sane ( and even fun ) experience for everyone , and easily avoided if you prefer real estate to RealDolls .
According to Linden Labs / Second Life 's Catherine Smith , " All ' adult content ' is confined to Mature sims in Second Life and takes place behind closed doors . "
But in the aftermath of Google 's acquisition of YouTube , YouTube 's methods of trying to control questionable content and Terms of Use ( TOU ) enforcement are emerging as clumsy at best , and highly exploitable at worst .
Even so , YouTube 's policies on porn and adult content have opened up a whole new market for an ever - growing roster of upload - it - yourself smut sites , while raising some interesting questions about businesses whose TOU and operational models turn a blind eye to the inevitable intersection of sex and technology .
Lawyer and executive director at The Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society Jennifer Granick adds : " Internet regulations tend to be ill - defined and confusing , and as a result , they are discriminatorily enforced .
Companies have to guess whether they are going to be targets for regulators or law enforcement .
As a result , general - interest content companies like YouTube or Google Images will choose to ignore regulations that special - interest content companies like a pornography video or photo site believes it must comply with . "
As content delivery evolves , porn , as an extension of human sexual expression , follows .
The Flickr spin -off sites are a great example : Flickrchicks , Adult Flickr , FlickrBooty ( all defunct ) and several others made up for what Flicker 's TOU could n't , or would n't , deliver ( yet appeared on the site , regardless ) .
These sites essentially skimmed Flickr for hotties to repost in babelog - style form and pull in affiliate click - through revenue , many knowing full well that the pictures they link to have a limited life span .
Many businesses have flourished where others decidedly feared to tread , rather than creating a healthy , inclusive and lucrative business structure .
Where Google 's AdSense would n't go , AdBrite mopped up the revenue .
And when PayPal decided that grown - up money was filthy lucre , a whole host of adult transaction services were eager to Dumpster - dive for PayPal 's sizable leavings .
Similarly , early this year sites like ( NSFW ) HotTube.wordpress .
com and ( NSFW ) DudeTube.blogspot .
com sprang up in the tradition of the Flickr spin - off babe sites , making the most of YouTube 's easily accessed user - submitted content and its inconceivably exponential growth rate .
Simply sifting through YouTube for porn and coming up with the goods over and over again and then reposting the juicy finds was enough to make these sites merit repeat visits for viewers .
And knowing the content was against YouTube 's TOU , sites like DudeTube often posted video embeds with the title " not around for long , " acknowledging the temporary nature of the amateur offerings , whether the videos were explicit or not , with the understanding that YouTube 's policies and policing were often bizarrely erratic and only a YouTube employee 's judgment call away from removal .
By summer , YouTube had proved itself simply unreliable for a number of users -- not just for porn , but for being a content - delivery system for anyone whose content might get flagged by concerned or malevolent users and yanked by a YouTube customer service department that seemed to be in over their heads .
Similarly , Internet video site Veoh , which had been a smart , rational , useful place to upload and watch hard - and soft - core video , abruptly changed its TOU in June and no longer allowed adult content to be uploaded to its network -- all video deemed " pornographic ( which shall include any depictions of nudity ) . "
Veoh then did what many people have been wondering aloud about YouTube , and they scrubbed their site clean of anything that smelled like copyright infringement -- at least at the time .
Enter sites like ( NSFW ) Xtube.com , and the new era of porn - loving video sharing , user - submitted communities .
Like YouTube ( in fact , a lot like YouTube ) , Xtube has a similar user interface for viewers and uploaders alike , as do the more recently hatched competition ( NSFW ) YuVuTu.com ( Caution : some users are experiencing malware installs ) and ( NSFW ) PornoTube.com .
These sites have quickly filled with thousands of amateur and professional porn ( and soft - core ) clips featuring dozens of straight , gay and " everything " categories .
Same flash upload / encode systems , same tagging systems , same pseudo - social network connecting users and favorites , and nearly identical options for easy URL grabbing and video player embeds for porn - happy bloggers .
For the founders of these sites , it was a no - brainer to build a smart , sex - positive YouTube clone .
Steve Jacobs from YuVuTube said , " YouTube clearly missed a trick when they decided not to include adult material , as that is more likely to be monetizable .
We started YuVuTu simply because we saw that YouTube and its competitors were staying out of adult .
We felt that amateur productions can compete with professional productions far better than in any other genre ( sport , comedy , action movies , music videos , etc. ) , so it 's obvious to us that the YouTube model of user - generated content will be most successfully applied to adult content . "
Jacobs added , " The jury is still out as to whether YouTube has a viable business model . "
Lance Cassidy , marketing director of Xtube , explained how YouTube 's market practically demanded the delivery system ASAP : " You Tube was rockin ' it and no one had an answer to them for the adult industry .
We were actually not sure we would be first on the scene and hesitated , but once we looked , we were shocked and hurried to it . "
Though it may seem like YouTube 's sex clones rushed to fill a gap in the market in typical dot - boom style , their business models have been built from the start to openly deal with adult content , making direct eye contact with many issues that could streamline TOU enforcement on nonporn sites like YouTube -- and not just in terms of avoiding dreaded uploads of underage or otherwise illegal content .
For example , from the outset Xtube has actively partnered with adult companies and porn auteurs to offer free DVD previews , circumventing the lure of copyright - infringing uploads from users .
They also offer options for filmmakers to sell streaming clips to users , providing a nice one - two of both free and monetized content options outside ad - revenue models .
Xtube also has the most stringent user interface for actively managing and explaining copyright permissions and age - of - consent 2257 documentation as requirements within the user interface for upload , explicitly making users responsible for legality of content .
Having a reliable content - delivery system for porn makes all of our hard drives smile -- but being realistic about your users and what they 'll want to do with your content - delivery system makes everyone happy , from censorship to legalities to contributing to a more - needed - than - ever healthy attitude toward human sexual expression .
Building your tech in keeping with the way people will use it will always make more sense than trying to change human behavior .
Just do n't actually call it GooTube , OK ?

A leading atheist says people must embrace rationalism , not faith–or they will never overcome their differences .
Interview by Laura Sheahen
Sam Harris is not your grandfather ’s atheist .
The award - winning writer practices Zen meditation and believes in the value of mystical experiences .
But he ’s adamant in his belief that religion does more harm than good in the world , and has sparked controversy by suggesting that when it comes to faith - based violence , religious moderates are part of the problem , not the solution .
Beliefnet editor Laura Sheahen spoke with him about his provocative book “ The End of Faith ” and his comments at the World Congress of Secular Humanism , where this interview was conducted .
You ’ve said that nonbelievers must try to convince religious people “ of the illegitimacy of their core beliefs . ”
Why are these beliefs dangerous ?
On the subject of religious belief , we relax standards of reasonableness and evidence that we rely on in every other area of our lives .
We relax so totally that people believe the most ludicrous propositions , and are willing to organize their lives around them .
Propositions like “ Jesus is going to come back in the next fifty years and rectify every problem that human beings create ” –or , in the Muslim world , “ death in the right circumstances leads directly to Paradise . ”
These beliefs are not very contaminated with good evidence .
There are beliefs –like kids believing in the tooth fairy –that I would n’t say are dangerous .
Right .
Those are not as consequential .
But this whole style of believing and talking about beliefs leaves us powerless to overcome our differences from one another .
We have Christians against Muslims against Jews , and no matter how liberal your theology , merely identifying yourself as a Christian or a Jew lends tacit validity to this status quo .
People have morally identified with a subset of humanity rather than with humanity as a whole .
You ’re saying we should be part of the human race , not part of any particular religious or national group ?
Yeah .
It is still fashionable to believe that how you organize yourself religiously in this life may matter for eternity .
Unless we can erode the prestige of that kind of thinking , we ’re not going to be able to undermine these divisions in our world .

A common thread that links seemingly disparate aspects of aging biology is that age - related change is not a cell - autonomous feature operating entirely in response to intrinsic factors within individual cells .
Rather , cell - cell communication ( via contact , paracrine , and endocrine signaling ) is key .
For a quick review that puts a lot of recent data on this subject in one place , check out this recent piece by Francis Bellino ( emphasis and formatting are mine ) :
The purpose of this brief review is to highlight some of the more important advances in endocrinology of aging research over the past year .
…
First , exploration of the early steps in the generation of the internal steroidal hormonal signal involved in lifespan extension via the insulin / IGF - like signaling pathway in the nematode by two research groups revealed that the product of cholestanoic acid derivatives metabolized by a cytochrome P - 450 - like protein activates a protein with homology to the mammalian nuclear receptor superfamily , a process strikingly similar to the steroid hormone signaling pathway documented in mammalian systems .
Second is the discovery that sirtuins , proteins that regulate lifespan in model organisms , enhance pancreatic insulin secretion in mice following a glucose challenge , suggesting the potential to regulate mammalian lifespan through regulation of the insulin signaling pathway .
Third , the newly discovered hormone klotho , which also plays a role in regulating lifespan , in this case in mice , is reported to not only negatively affect insulin sensitivity but , perhaps more importantly , significantly affects calcium and phosphate metabolism as a required cofactor of Fgf - 23 signaling .
Finally the gonadotropin FSH is shown to directly affect bone density in mice separate from any direct effect of estrogen , suggesting that reproductive hormones other than estrogen can directly impact menopause - associated pathophysiology in non-reproductive tissues .
The idea that much of aging is regulated endocrinologically , with hormone - producing cells acting “ at a distance ” , may be heartening for those who might hope to intervene in the process .
It would , after all , be a much easier matter to add soluble factors to the blood ( or even deplete specific ones , given very reasonably - sized advances in immune - based therapies ) than to make an internal adjustment to every cell in the body .

Let two things never be discounted again .1. )
The power of social media ( and lactating women ) .
2. )
The fact that there ARE big businesses out there that can and will do the right thing .
( Just getting here ?
Learn about the National Pork Board lawsuit . )
It 's over .
I received two letters over the weekend .
The first was from National Pork Board CEO Steve Murphy apologizing for the offensive comments leveled at The Lactivist in the original C&D letter .
( Read the full text of Mr. Murphy 's letter )
The second was a letter to Brian Moore , the attorney representing me , from Faegre & Benson 's Christopher Beall .
( Download the full letter as a PDF .)
It stated , in part : Because of federal limitations on the expenditure of " Pork Checkoff " funds , National Pork Board is unable to make charitable contributions to any organization , including a non-profit organization such as Mother 's Milk Bank of Ohio .
Despite this restriction . . .
National Pork Board intends to conduct a voluntary fundraising campaign among its staff and executives to gather donations for Mother 's Milk Bank of Ohio . . . . based on the support we have already seen among employees at National Pork Board - that this campaign will result in a generous contribution to Mother 's Milk Bank of Ohio .
Having just spoken to the Georgia Morrow , Director of the Mother 's Milk Bank , I can share that the funds raised by the members of the National Pork Board ( along with the $ 1000 raised during the Lactivist fundraiser ) will go toward the purchase of desperately needed refrigeration units that the milk bank had been struggling to purchase .
I want to make it clear to my readers that based off of our contact with the staff at the National Pork Board it is quite clear to me that they were extremely upset that anyone would feel they were not supportive of nursing mothers .
The fact that the staff has dug into their own pockets in order to make a contribution strikes me as extremely generous and I think that they should be applauded for their response to this issue .
Now , this is where YOU come in once again .
It 's quite clear that bad news travels fast .
The question is , will good news travel as well ?
We all know how rare it is these days for a big corporation to admit that they 're wrong .
Rarer yet , is the group of executives that are willing to dig into their own pockets to make a donation to right a wrong .
( So much easier to dip into the corporate coffers and to write it off as a business expense . )
If we 're going to lambaste the companies that behave poorly , we must celebrate the companies that do the right thing .
So my request is this ...
Help me spread the word about a company that not only admitted their mistake , but that quickly worked to come together in an act of good will that will benefit the countless babies and families that benefit from the work of the Mother 's Milk Bank of Ohio .
Take a moment and write a letter of thanks to the same email addresses that you fired off your letter of fury to .
Take a simple moment to say " thanks .
" When big business sees the support that flows their way when they do the right thing , more businesses will realize the value of doing the right thing .
Now anyone that knows me ( or reads this blog ) can likely imagine how hard it was for me to keep from commenting on this whole debacle as word was flying around the Internet .
Heck , the post titles alone were enough to make me want to speak up .
( My personal favorite was SE Roundtable 's " Search Engine Industry Blogger , Jennifer Laycock , Ordered to Remove Her Shirt .
" Add in the fact that social media and the blog world act much like that old fashioned game of telephone ( you know , where you whisper in someone 's ear and hear how the story changes ? ) and it's been hard to hold my tongue .
So if you 'll now humor me , I 'd like to add a few thoughts of my own .
First , while I truly appreciate the passion with which readers have responded and the myriad bloggers and forum members that spread the word about this story , I 'd specifically like to thank the posters that kept level heads while offering up sage words of advice and insight .
Bloggers like Ian McAnerin and the woman behind Kerflop did an excellent job of looking beyond the concept of " evil pork " to examine the issue in a level - headed manner .
There 's nothing wrong with protecting your trademark folks .
Many of the posts that I read stated that the Pork Board had no business bugging me because I 'm just a poor , innocent , breastfeeding promoting mom .
( Some went so far in deifying me that I half expected Emmitt to walk on water in the bath tub . )
I 'll say it again ... there is NOTHING wrong with a big business protecting their trademark .
My argument was that they should do it by hiring a lawyer that wo n't make asinine assumptions about the site in question and that they could do it a little more politely .
Next , I want to clear up a few items that seem to have been " lost in translation " ( please do n't sue me Universal Studios ... ) .
1. )
Yes I am a work at home mom , and yes this is a hobby site .
That said , I also work at home doing a " real " job , which just happens to be teaching small business owners how to market themselves online .
In fact , I actually wrote a pretty popular free e-book about the very process of building this business .
2. )
Yes , I donate funds from this site to the Mother 's Milk Bank of Ohio , but not ALL of them .
I have held two fund raisers in the last year .
I also donate 10 % of all profits when I 'm not holding fund raisers .
All said and done , this site has raised $ 2000 for the milk bank and about $ 4000 for my children 's college fund .
3. )
Yes , I made just $ 8 profit off the shirt , but it was from two shirt sales , not one .
4 . ) I never had any issue with the fact that I received a C&D for alleged trademark infringement .
I disagreed with them , but I understand why they sent it .
My issue was with both the tone of the letter and the implication that I seemed to be peddling fetish products .
5. )
No , you may not now buy a shirt from me that reads " The Other White Milk . "
I do n't have them stockpiled somewhere , I 'm not holding out on you and I DID agree not to sell them anymore .
That said , you can now buy a National Pork Board approved " breast .
the original white milk " shirt from me .
I 'd like to again thank Amy Hooker of Maven Communications , Brian Moore of Brian J Moore and Associates for their assistance .
I 'd also like to thank my hosting company , Mor Designs who have generously ( read : for free ) increased my bandwidth several times over to keep the site from crashing under the traffic load .
I 'd also like to thank the many lawyers and law firms that contacted me to offer pro bono services .
As of yesterday , the number had grown too numerous to list , though I will make special mention of the team at the Electronic Freedom Foundation since they exist for exactly this type of issue .
It 's been quite a few days folks .
I must say that I 've walked away from this feeling a little better about the world .
Friends and strangers alike rallied to my cause .
Big business did the right thing .
Word about breast milk banking was spread hither and yon .
( Of course you 'll probably never go to either hither or yon , so you 'll have to take my word for it .
)
So let 's wrap it up with this ... That 'll do pig , that 'll do .

Earlier this week Nepia , one of the nations largest manufacturer and distributor of domestic paper products released a very limited number of what may be the most expensive tissue paper in the world .
Nepia very shrewdly made their new product available only through their internet shop at mid night on Friday , by the time the Saturday morning talk shows had picked up on the campaign it was all but over and all 3000 sets had sold out .
Japan has long been know as a place where tissue paper comes cheap , so cheap in fact that there exists an entire industry of handing out of free tissue paper ( ティッシュ配り ) for advertising .
Young men and women , typically with spiked coloured hair and adorned with various body piercings , tissue distributors can be found around any big city in Japan usually around the entrances to train stations .
Given a good location , one of these skilled workers can hand out some 2 to 3 hundred packs of tissue paper an hour , even more impressively this unlikely looking bunch dole out approximately 2.5 billion packets a year or about 20 packs per person in Japan .
Despite this seemingly flooded market , Nepia has introduced a line of tissue paper that sells at 3,000 yen for a set of 2 boxes ( about 10 yen / tissue ) .
As a comparison my local supermarket sells a set of 5 boxes for 298 yen ( about 0.2 yen / tissue ) .
The new brand is called the ‘ Super Celebrity Nose ’ ( 超鼻セレブ ) , it features a 3 ply tissue with double moisture retention and is perfumed by Verbena , a flower native to the Americas .
Nepia ’s official stance is that they will not be selling any more of the ‘ Super Celebrity Nose ’ line , but judging from the effort that has gone into PR so far as well as its popularity its fair to say that this was ploy to further gain the public ’s interest and we ’ll see more in stock soon .
On a side note , the company ’s current campaign “ Hana nice day ! ” advertising for its less exclusive ‘ Celebrity Nose ’ line of tissues is quiet amusing and well worth a look just to see just how strange Japanese TV can get ( CM1 , CM2 & my favourite CM3 ) .

“ Science told : hands off gay sheep . ” 
It ’s hard to think of a headline more joyous than this classic from the Sunday Times .
Apparently a scientist called Professor Charles Roselli is conducting cruel and gruesome experiments on sheep in the name of eradicating homosexuality .
Unfortunately this “ news ”  story , co-written by Isabelle Oakeshott – the Deputy Political Editor no less – is little more than dystopian science fiction fantasy , conjured up to drive a pressure group ’s agenda .
We ’ll open with their big hitter .
“ The animals ’ skulls are cut open and electronic sensors are attached to their brains . ”
It sounds gruesome .
But this was simply – and rather bizarrely – not true .
There ’s no neurophysiology in these experiments .
They do n’t even measure things from nerve cells : they measure mate preference , by watching the sheep choose a mate .
Cilla Black does not open up Blind Date contestants ’ skulls to attach electronic sensors to their brains ( disappointingly in some respects ) and they do n’t do it in these experiments either .
From this point , if you can believe that such a thing is possible , the Sunday Times then goes rapidly downhill .
” By varying the hormone levels , ”  they continue , “ mainly by injecting hormones into the brain [ cough ] they have had ‘ considerable success ’ in altering the rams ’ sexuality , with some previously gay animals becoming attracted to ewes . ” 
This is not just completely untrue , it is , in fact , the polar opposite of what the researchers really did .
The only similar work completed and published by this team of researchers was about trying to make “ straight ”  animals “ gay ” ( although animal behaviour researchers avoid those terms ) and in any case , that experiment was negative : it failed to achieve this aim .
Go read the study if you do n’t believe me ( Endocrine .
2006 Jun;29( 3):501-11 ) .
I could go on for pages : even the details are wrong .
“ Initially , the publicly funded project aimed to improve the productivity of herds … ” 
Wrong .
“ Michael Bailey , a neurology professor ” Wrong .
“ The research is being peer - reviewed by a panel of scientists in America ” wrong , “ demonstrating that it is being taken seriously by the academic community . ”
Wrong .
I contacted the lab to double check : nothing is currently under peer review , because nothing has been submitted for publication , because no current experiments are completed .
There are n’t even any grants under review .
But most bizarre is the suggestion that the research was somehow ultimately about making gay people straight .
This is stated and restated , even at the very top of the article : “ Scientists are conducting experiments to change the sexuality of “ gay ” sheep in a programme that critics fear could pave the way for breeding out homosexuality in humans . ” 
For those of you at the Sunday Times with some catching up to do , here ’s a news flash : we cleared up the question of Lamarckian inheritance of acquired traits over 100 years ago .
If it helps , you could think about whether boob jobs will make future generations have larger breasts .
And even if you could intervene to make a gay human straight – which only the Sunday Times and their friends are claiming here , not the researchers – then in any case , you might reasonably expect this to make any inherited tendency towards homosexuality more prevalent , rather than less .
And even then , the scientists have been very clear that this is a basic science study , from animal behaviour researchers , aimed at gaining an understanding of the biology of sexual attraction .
They ’ve been proactively clarifying that from the moment PETA – People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals – started campaigning against them .
Because that ’s where this disinformation seems to have come from , in case you had n’t guessed it yet .
I ’ll say this nicely – because we all know animal rights people can be scary – but almost all the misinformation and misunderstandings in this Times piece appeared first in a PETA campaign , clearly aimed at recruiting the political energy of the gay community to the animal rights cause .
And it ’s not even a very recent campaign : the the blogosphere has already run – 6 months ago – and then subsequently retracted PETA ’s Roselli story .
There are serious ethical issues in science – including animal rights – and there are also interesting discussions to have about whether theoretical research into sexual behaviour makes us nervous .
I ’m not even going to start on them here , not just because I ’m out of space , but because these are matters for us all , not just scientists or medics like me .
It was a funny headline .
But the biggest barrier to a sensible discussion of what we all think and feel about research ethics is inaccurate , ill - informed prejudice , slander , and disinformation .

And by the way …
One thing I thought was pretty strange about the Times article was the way it was suggested that simply researching a biological basis of sexual preference was somehow an inherently iffy or even homophobic project to be involved in .
This is particularly surprising given things like this :
www.popmatters.com/pm/columns/article/8970/the-ugly-duckling-has-two-daddies/
Also ,
The Advocate , a US gay and lesbian newsmagazine , reported in 1996 that 61 % of its readers believed that “ it would mostly help gay and lesbian rights if homosexuality were found to be biologically determined ” , and a cross-national study in the United States , the Philippines , and Sweden found that those who believed that “ homosexuals are born that way ” held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuality than those who believed that “ homosexuals choose to be that way ” and / or “ learn to be that way ” .
Ho hum .
Update 28/1/07 :
The Sunday Times , 4 weeks later , has had the decency to express some kind of correction .
They do n’t quite ‘ fess up to the spectacular extent of their fantasies but the stuff at the end , about how they should have got a science journo to look the story over , could have sprung from my own sweet mouth .

Corrections
The report “ Science told : hands off gay sheep ” ( News , December 31 ) contained several inaccuracies in its description of research into the brain ’s role in sheep ’s sexual partner preference being conducted at Oregon Health & Science University and Oregon State University .
The research is aimed at understanding the role of the brain in sexual attraction .
The researchers deny that they were trying to “ cure ”  homosexuality in sheep , a statement that is backed up by their published studies .
The research included a study that limited androgen in sheep to determine if this resulted in same partner preference .
Our report misconstrued this experiment .
The researchers also stress that contrary to our report they have had no success in altering the sexual preference of the animals .
The research is funded by the National Institutes of Health and is not being conducted to improve farm productivity .
The authors of our report were not science specialists and we should have ensured that the story was checked by the science editor before publication .
We apologise for the errors and any subsequent confusion .

Instead , the clinics say that their remedies are sufficient to protect against malaria .
Each year , two million Britons travel to parts of the world where malaria is rife .
About 2,000 of them return having contracted the disease .
In the vast majority of cases , they have fallen ill because they have not taken any anti-malaria tablets .
But doctors have begun noticing some cases where patients have taken homeopathic remedies instead of licensed medicines .
We 've certainly had patients admitted to our unit with falciparum , the malignant form of malaria , who have been taking homeopathic remedies
Dr Ron Behrens
Newsnight investigation Malaria : Global menace
Dr Ron Behrens runs a travel clinic at the London Hospital for Tropical Diseases .
He has seen several patients who thought they were safe because they were taking homeopathic remedies to protect them .
" We 've certainly had patients admitted to our unit with falciparum , the malignant form of malaria , who have been taking homeopathic remedies - and without a doubt the fact that they were taking them and not effective drugs was the reason they had malaria , " he says .
According to Dr Behrens , some homeopaths are offering Britons travelling to the malaria belt an easy option and false hope .
" Sub - Saharan Africa is a high risk for malaria .
If they got it and they were n't immediately diagnosed and treated , they could die and that claim would actually put their lives at risk , " he Dr Behrens .
Undercover research
Such cases prompted the scientific campaigners Sense About Science to send an undercover researcher into 10 homeopathic practices .
She said that she was about to go to a malaria - infested country .
They all recommended doses of homeopathic remedies .
These were 99.99 % water with an almost undetectable trace of quinine .
Newsnight followed up the research with a hidden camera .
A programme researcher told a South London practice she would be travelling in Africa for three or four weeks , including high risk areas such as Malawi .
She said she did not like the side effects of the drugs the doctors prescribe , and asked if there was anything else she could take .
This is the advice she was given by one homeopath : " The doctors have this big fear thing about malaria ... obviously it is a nasty thing , but actually , as I say , you can prevent it with the remedies ; and as you say , the tablets are really horrible .
They 're very nasty , have nasty side effects , and I 've seen quite a lot of patients who have had serious problems from them . "
In that 20 - minute consultation , there was no mention of going to the doctor - the homeopath made the claim that malaria could be prevented by taking homeopathic remedies .
When Newsnight called the clinic asking why its consultant gave that advice , it said that this was a mistake .
Normally , the clinic said , practitioners did tell people to go to their GP for serious conditions such as malaria .
The Power To Be Your Best

One day , you ’re browsing through your code , and you notice two big blocks that look almost exactly the same .
In fact , they ’re exactly the same , except that one block refers to “ Spaghetti ” and one block refers to “ Chocolate Moose . ”
// A trivial example : alert ( " I 'd like some Spaghetti ! " ) ; alert ( " I 'd like some Chocolate Moose ! " ) ;
These examples happen to be in JavaScript , but even if you do n’t know JavaScript , you should be able to follow along .
The repeated code looks wrong , of course , so you create a function :
function SwedishChef ( food ) { alert ( " I 'd like some " + food + " ! " ) ; } SwedishChef ( " Spaghetti " ) ; SwedishChef ( " Chocolate Moose " ) ;
OK , it ’s a trivial example , but you can imagine a more substantial example .
This is better code for many reasons , all of which you ’ve heard a million times .
Maintainability , Readability , Abstraction = Good !
Now you notice two other blocks of code which look almost the same , except that one of them keeps calling this function called BoomBoom and the other one keeps calling this function called PutInPot .
Other than that , the code is pretty much the same .
alert ( " get the lobster " ) ; PutInPot ( " lobster " ) ; PutInPot ( " water " ) ; alert ( " get the chicken " ) ; BoomBoom ( " chicken " ) ; BoomBoom ( " coconut " ) ;
Now you need a way to pass an argument to the function which itself is a function .
This is an important capability , because it increases the chances that you ’ll be able to find common code that can be stashed away in a function .
function Cook ( i1 , i2 , f ) { alert ( " get the " + i1 ) ; f( i1 ) ; f( i2 ) ; } Cook( " lobster " , " water " , PutInPot ) ; Cook( " chicken " , " coconut " , BoomBoom ) ;
Look !
We ’re passing in a function as an argument .
Can your language do this ?
Wait … suppose you have n’t already defined the functions PutInPot or BoomBoom .
Would n’t it be nice if you could just write them inline instead of declaring them elsewhere ?
Cook ( " lobster " , " water " , function ( x ) { alert ( " pot " + x ) ; } ) ; Cook ( " chicken " , " coconut " , function ( x ) { alert ( " boom " + x ) ; } ) ;
Jeez , that is handy .
Notice that I ’m creating a function there on the fly , not even bothering to name it , just picking it up by its ears and tossing it into a function .
As soon as you start thinking in terms of anonymous functions as arguments , you might notice code all over the place that , say , does something to every element of an array .
var a = [ 1,2,3 ] ; for ( i=0 ; i< a.length ; i++ ) { a [ i ] = a [ i ] * 2 ; } for ( i=0 ; i< a.length ; i++) { alert ( a [ i ] ) ; }
Doing something to every element of an array is pretty common , and you can write a function that does it for you :
function map ( fn , a ) { for ( i = 0 ; i < a.length ; i++) { a [ i ] = fn( a [ i ] ) ; } }
Now you can rewrite the code above as :
map ( function ( x ) {return x *2;} , a ) ; map ( alert , a ) ;
Another common thing with arrays is to combine all the values of the array in some way .
function sum( a ) { var s = 0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < a.length ; i++) s += a [ i ] ; return s ; } function join ( a ) { var s = " " ; for ( i = 0 ; i < a.length ; i++ ) s += a [ i ] ; return s ; } alert ( sum ( [ 1, 2,3 ] ) ) ; alert ( join ( [ " a " , " b " , " c " ] ) ) ;
sum and join look so similar , you might want to abstract out their essence into a generic function that combines elements of an array into a single value :
function reduce ( fn , a , init ) { var s = init ; for ( i = 0 ; i < a.length ; i++ ) s = fn( s , a [ i ] ) ; return s ; } function sum ( a ) { return reduce ( function ( a , b ) { return a + b ; } , a , 0 ) ; } function join ( a ) { return reduce ( function ( a , b ) { return a + b ; } , a , " " ) ; }
Many older languages simply had no way to do this kind of stuff .
Other languages let you do it , but it ’s hard ( for example , C has function pointers , but you have to declare and define the function somewhere else ) .
Object - oriented programming languages are n’t completely convinced that you should be allowed to do anything with functions .
Java required you to create a whole object with a single method called a functor if you wanted to treat a function like a first class object .
Combine that with the fact that many OO languages want you to create a whole file for each class , and it gets really klunky fast .
If your programming language requires you to use functors , you ’re not getting all the benefits of a modern programming environment .
See if you can get some of your money back .
How much benefit do you really get out of writting itty bitty functions that do nothing more than iterate through an array doing something to each element ?
Well , let ’s go back to that map function .
When you need to do something to every element in an array in turn , the truth is , it probably does n’t matter what order you do them in .
You can run through the array forward or backwards and get the same result , right ?
In fact , if you have two CPUs handy , maybe you could write some code to have each CPU do half of the elements , and suddenly map is twice as fast .
Or maybe , just hypothetically , you have hundreds of thousands of servers in several data centers around the world , and you have a really big array , containing , let ’s say , again , just hypothetically , the entire contents of the internet .
Now you can run map on thousands of computers , each of which will attack a tiny part of the problem .
So now , for example , writing some really fast code to search the entire contents of the internet is as simple as calling the map function with a basic string searcher as an argument .
The really interesting thing I want you to notice , here , is that as soon as you think of map and reduce as functions that everybody can use , and they use them , you only have to get one supergenius to write the hard code to run map and reduce on a global massively parallel array of computers , and all the old code that used to work fine when you just ran a loop still works only it ’s a zillion times faster which means it can be used to tackle huge problems in an instant .
Lemme repeat that .
By abstracting away the very concept of looping , you can implement looping any way you want , including implementing it in a way that scales nicely with extra hardware .
And now you understand something I wrote a while ago where I complained about CS students who are never taught anything but Java :
Without understanding functional programming , you ca n’t invent MapReduce , the algorithm that makes Google so massively scalable .
The terms Map and Reduce come from Lisp and functional programming .
MapReduce is , in retrospect , obvious to anyone who remembers from their 6.001 - equivalent programming class that purely functional programs have no side effects and are thus trivially parallelizable .
The very fact that Google invented MapReduce , and Microsoft did n’t , says something about why Microsoft is still playing catch up trying to get basic search features to work , while Google has moved on to the next problem : building Skynet ^H^H^H^H^H^H the world ’s largest massively parallel supercomputer .
I do n’t think Microsoft completely understands just how far behind they are on that wave .
Ok .
I hope you ’re convinced , by now , that programming languages with first - class functions let you find more opportunities for abstraction , which means your code is smaller , tighter , more reusable , and more scalable .
Lots of Google applications use MapReduce and they all benefit whenever someone optimizes it or fixes bugs .
And now I ’m going to get a little bit mushy , and argue that the most productive programming environments are the ones that let you work at different levels of abstraction .
Crappy old FORTRAN really did n’t even let you write functions .
C had function pointers , but they were ugleeeeee and not anonymous and had to be implemented somewhere else than where you were using them .
Java made you use functors , which is even uglier .
As Steve Yegge points out , Java is the Kingdom of Nouns .
Correction :
The last time I used FORTRAN was 27 years ago .
Apparently it got functions .
I must have been thinking about GW - BASIC .

Under the personality cult of leaders Kim Jong-il and his father Kim Il- sung , North Korea has become fiercely isolationist , nationalistic , and totalitarian .
Despite being one of the planet ’s poorest countries , the communist state looks for any achievement to boost itself in eyes of the world .
Its people know little or nothing of other nations except for the fact that Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) is vastly superior .
The DPRK is also one of the world ’s most secretive nations .
For a North Korean , contact with a foreigner can land one in jail … or worse .
But there is one embarrassing secret that is hard for the government to hide , literally .
It ’s the Ryugyong Hotel in the Potong District of North Korea ’s capital city of Pyongyang .
It ’s difficult to hide because it ’s a massive , 105 - story structure which dominates the city ’s skyline .
It ’s an embarrassment because it ’s a complete engineering failure … its empty , dilapidated husk lurks over the capital , mocking the citizens of the proud country .
The hotel ’s story begins in 1987 , when the North Korean government began construction at an estimated cost of $ 750 million , or 2 % of the country ’s gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
By comparison , 2 % of the United States ’ GDP would be about $ 220 billion .
Construction of the hotel was a cold war response to other massive skyscrapers in Asia , most notably South Korea ’s towering Stamford Hotel in Singapore .
The North Koreans expected the project to bring in western investors as a first move into their nation .
Investors were told to expect little oversight , and assured that casinos , nightclubs and lounges could be added .
The North Korean government was so proud of the project that they added it to their official city maps before the project was even started , and they issued postage stamps touting the hotel before it was even half - finished .
The Ryugyong or “ Capital of Willows ” Hotel stands 1,083 feet tall , and it was planned to have 3,000 rooms and seven revolving restaurants .
It has a total of 3.9 million square feet of floor space .
The hotel would be the tallest hotel and seventh largest building in the world if it were finished .
It would also have been the first building with over one hundred floors outside of New York or Chicago .
The first event scheduled to be held at the hotel was June 1989 ’s World Festival of Youth and Students .
The hotel was nowhere near ready for that event .
Its construction was plagued with problems , and after five years construction completely ground to a halt due to a shortage of everything … especially funding and electricity .
Work on the hotel has never resumed ; the project was abandoned , leaving a lonely construction crane perched on its peak .
Pyongyang skyline , showing the Ryugyong Hotel on the top right .
The shell of the building is complete but it has not been certified as safe for occupancy .
There are no windows , fixtures , or fittings .
The extremely poor quality concrete used in its construction has left the building sagging to such a great degree that the structure can never be finished without a massive overhaul .
The North Korean government is still looking for foreign investment , hopefully around $ 300 million .
It ’s going to be hard to find such an investor considering the DPRK has such a tight stranglehold on visitors coming to their nation .
The DPRK only allows about 130,000 tourists in an entire year , and almost none of them come to Pyongyang .
To make matters worse , the nation appears to be in a never - ending drought and famine cycle that is not conducive for the operation of a five - star hotel .
Today , few North Koreans are willing to discuss the hotel with outsiders .
The hotel , which was once found on city maps before the construction even began , has now been completely stricken from the official maps .
Tour guides usually claim not to know where it is .
Either a majority of the country is in a state of denial about the whole thing , or they avoid the subject for fear of reprisal .
Since the government ’s embarrassing monument is visible from practically every point in the city , it ’s most likely the latter .
Maybe someday North Korea will become a popular tourist destination , but not in the foreseeable future .
If they ever do , there could be plenty of vacancies waiting for the throngs of outsiders … assuming some investors are willing to risk a third of a billion to reanimate the Ryugyong Hotel ’s rotting corpse .
Update : As of April 2008 , construction has sort - of resumed on the Ryugyong hotel .
It is still unclear whether it will ever be actually complete .
A teacher whose classroom PC displayed pornographic images to school children faces up to 40 years imprisonment .
The pop -up images of couples fornicating will the likely result of spyware infestation , according to defence witnesses testifying on behalf of teacher Julie Amero , 40 , Windham , Connecticut .
But the six - person jury rejected this argument and convicted the substitute language teacher on Friday of four counts of risk of injury to a minor after just two hours of deliberation , according to local reports .
The trial stemmed from an October 2004 incident when Amero was teaching a seventh - grade language class at Kelly Middle School .
Graphic images from sites including meetlovers.com and femalesexual.com were displayed on her computer in front of the ten young children in her class .
The prosecution alleged that this cycle of graphic images was the result of Amero actively visiting pornographic sites .
State Prosecutor David Smith questioned why she did n't simply pull the plug on the PC .
The defence unsuccessfully argued that computer spyware was to blame .
Amero claimed she could not control the graphic images that began circulating on the PC .
" The pop-ups never went away .
They were continuous , " she testified .
Defense computer expert W. Herbert Horner said that he found spyware on the PC , linked to a seemingly innocent hair styling website , " that led to this pornographic loop that was out of control " .
It 's easy to understood how someone , like Amero , not knowledgeable about computers , might panic in such circumstances .
The license for the school 's content filtering software , which ( if working ) would have blocked the images , had expired .
But after listening to the students testifying and a police security expert , the jury rejected these arguments and convicted Amero .
Norwich Police Detective Mark Lounsbury , a computer crimes investigator , testified that the offending sites were accessed on Amero 's watch and that users interaction was involved .
State Prosecutor Smith said : " You have to physically click on it to get to those sites .
I think the evidence is overwhelming that she did intend to access those websites . "
Based on reports that the jury had begun discussing the trial during a bar - room lunch , Amero 's lawyers applied for a mistrial .
The jurors denied these allegations and were allowed to consider their verdict .
Defence lawyer John Cocheo said he intends to appeal the guilty verdict .
Sentencing in the case is due to take place on 2 March , the Norwich Bulletin reports . ®
" False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science , for they often endure long ; but false views , if supported by some evidence , do little harm , for everyone takes a salutory pleasure in proving their falseness : and when this is done , one path toward error is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened . "
The Aquatic Ape Theory ( often referred to as the AAT or AAH -- I 'll generally refer to it as the AAT / H on this site ) says humans went through an aquatic or semi-aquatic stage in our evolution and that this accounts for many features seen in human anatomy and physiology .
Using the principle of convergent evolution , it says that life in an aquatic environment explains these features , and that a transition from ape to hominid in a non-aquatic environment cannot .
This web page offers a critical examination of the Aquatic Ape Theory , treating it as a serious scientific theory .
It is one of the few online sources that does so .
There are many other web sites which deal with it , but they do not offer the critical examination which any theory needs to be given .
Why have I done this site ?
1 ) Because AAT / H proponents ask why do n't people take their theory seriously as science , and the way you take a theory seriously as science is to examine it for accuracy and criticize it where it falls short , because ...
2 ) " Valid criticism does you a favor " Carl Sagan , page 32 of The Demon - Haunted World ( 1995 ) .
I am doing what many AAT / H proponents -- including its principal proponent , Elaine Morgan -- have repeatedly claimed they want done : treating the AAT / H as befits a serious scientific theory .
Accepting any new theory uncritically is foolish .
When doing a critique of any theory of human evolution , you check the facts the authors use to support the theory .
All scientific theories need to be examined for accuracy ; it 's an essential component of the process of science .
I 'm afraid that when the Aquatic Ape Theory is examined , it does not fare well .
The AAT / H is built on many supposed facts which , when examined , do not turn out to be true .
Perhaps the kindest thing would be to ignore it , but I am not that kind .
Instead I 've begun an ongoing response of pointing out errors of fact , errors in theoretical understanding ( which , though critically important , is more problematic because a lot of people seem to think this is waffling ) , and urging the theory 's proponents to respond to valid objections to their theory .
Examining the Facts : A necessary process of science
There are a number of claims made by AAT / H proponents , and tracking down the source material which supposedly supports these claims is not always easy .
In a dramatic departure from the way science is supposed to work , references for specific AAT / H claims are not always available ; many times the author (s ) involved simply make a claim without any reference to a source of evidence for the claim .
For instance , during the period I put together most of the evidence for this site , chief AAT / H theorizer Elaine Morgan was posting regularly in the sci.anthropology .
paleo newsgroup , and claimed to be willing to supply references for her written AAT / H claims , but she proved to be reluctant to provide these references to people who have a past history of actually reading the source and reporting back what it really says .
Others -- who did n't engage in this sort of " anti- social " behavior -- reported they have no problem getting references from Morgan .
Nevertheless , a number of the claims made by Elaine Morgan and other AAT / H proponents have been tracked down and examined .
The results are not encouraging .
Quite frankly , when I first read the work done on the AAT/H , I saw some big holes in the reasoning , but I did think that the evidence which was ( sometimes ) given was probably accurately and fully reported .
When I started looking these things up , however , I found that I was wrong on that count -- the AAT / H has proven to be a hotbed of those " false facts " Darwin referred to .
What makes me think I know what I 'm talking about here ?
I got started on this subject through reading and posting in various science newsgroups during the early days of the web .
I 've got a knack for library research and I like the detective work that 's needed to find an appropriate source of information .
I 've also had an informal background in anthropological research , helping my late wife , Nancy Tanner , with her research on human origins , matriliny , and social organization .
This entailed finding , reading , and learning to understand a lot of info that I did n't know , such as molecular studies .
In the process , I 've learned that my knack for research also includes an ability to translate some pretty heavy technical jargon into English , and explain some complicated subjects in relatively simple terms .
This ability to ferret out information sources from often obscure clues came in handy when I started to examine the evidence offered for the AAT /H .
The references for AAT / H statements , when they are given at all , are often maddeningly incomplete or misleading .
For instance , it took some hunting to find the source for a quote when the quote supposedly came from a " famous authority during a television programme " ( it was actually a 1929 book by Prof. Frederick Wood Jones ) .
Another time the source of information for a claim was said to be a 1979 book , with an author mentioned .
Finding the ref then started with finding that book , then finding the one page out of hundreds ( which was n't given ) that referred to the actual reference which contained the info ( a 1956 article ) , then finding the article which contained the info , which , it turned out , did n't actually say what the AAT / H proponent claimed it did .
To complete the critique of that one AAT / H claim ( about seal sweat ) also required finding yet another article , and a total of perhaps 6 - 8 hours of actual research time .
I 'll guarantee you the original one paragraph AAT / H bogus claim did n't take that long to churn out ... and people wonder why anthropologists do n't spend their time and meager research grants chasing down AAT / H claims .
So I guess I 'd say my qualifications for this work are 1 ) a knack for library detective work , 2 ) an ability to learn basic scientific precepts ( anyone should be able to do this one ) , and 3 ) being just a little bit nutty , cause those examples I just gave show you 've got to be a little crazy to do it .
As a note , let me state that I am not the Jim Moore who is a primatologist at UCSD , nor am I the Jim Moore who wrote and cowrote several books on Darwin , nor the Jim Moore who 's an anthropologist at CUNY .
Although I 'm not them , from what I 've seen of their work , I would n't be insulted to be mistaken for any of them .
I hope they feel the same .
I 'd like to thank the posters in the old sci.anthropology .
paleo newsgroup , in particular Phil Nicholls and Alex Duncan , for pointing out many false facts and methodological errors in the AAT / H's arguments .
Their research was helpful to me many times .
This site is a partial update and redo of a site I had up several years ago , and I will be continuing to update it whenever I have the chance .
In surfing while rewriting and adding to this site , I 've noticed several AAT / H boosters make the rather odd criticism that my previous site was old , as if that somehow made the facts therein wrong .
Although many of the facts posted on this site were first posted on my old site in 1995 , they are still valid .
The facts have not changed .
The diving reflex has been present in terrestrial mammals for centuries , it was in 1995 , and it still is , despite the AAT / H claim to the contrary .
Salt hunger has been present in humans for centuries , it was in 1995 , and it still is , despite the AAT / H claim to the contrary .
The infant swimming response has been present in terrestrial mammals for centuries , it was in 1995 , and it still is , despite the AAT / H claim to the contrary .
Hymens have been present in terrestrial mammals for centuries , they were in 1995 , and they still are , despite the AAT / H claim to the contrary .
I could go on , but you 'll see all these facts as you go through the site .
Suffice it to say that there have been valid objections to the AAT / H since its inception , and there still are .
Established facts , as opposed to the AAT / H's many " false facts " , do not change .
I 've also noticed a criticism that I simply engage in ad hominem attacks on AAT / H proponents , in particular Elaine Morgan .
This is a peculiarly funny sort of criticism , since it is in itself a variation of an ad hominem attack , that is , instead of attacking the accuracy of what I 'm saying , it attacks how I say it .
This is a classic logical fallacy , one of several that AAT / H proponents often engage in -- there 's a link to a site on logical fallacies on my links page .
The thing is , I go after the accuracy of what these people say , and , yes , I have an aggressive style .
But pointing out that someone made an error , or altered a quote , or said that a scientist said one thing when they actually said the opposite , is not an ad hominem attack .
Frankly , it 's doing them an enormous favor , as Carl Sagan stated in that quote .
( This does , of course , assume they 're trying to do a good , accurate job at what they 're saying . )
It may not sit well with everyone , but quite frankly , I find it really annoying when good science is taken to task for not accepting a theory which is so full of holes and mistruths , and which is argued for so dishonestly .
And , by the way , not only are honest scientists harder on each other than I am on Morgan , Verhaegen et al. , any honest scientist is harder on their own work than I am on Morgan , Verhaegen et al .

The discovery of the Higgs particle by the international CMS and ATLAS collaborations is the most famous discovery made to date at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN .
The scientists made the announcement on July 4 , 2012 , and it was later recognized with a Nobel Prize :
The theorists who predicted the Higgs mechanism received the award in 2013 .
NASA photographs have revealed bright new deposits seen in two gullies on Mars that suggest water carried sediment through them sometime during the past seven years .
" These observations give the strongest evidence to date that water still flows occasionally on the surface of Mars , " said Michael Meyer , lead scientist for NASA 's Mars Exploration Program , Washington .

Liquid water , as opposed to the water ice and water vapor known to exist at Mars , is considered necessary for life .
The new findings heighten intrigue about the potential for microbial life on Mars .
The Mars Orbiter Camera on NASA 's Mars Global Surveyor provided the new evidence of the deposits in images taken in 2004 and 2005 .
" The shapes of these deposits are what you would expect to see if the material were carried by flowing water , " said Michael Malin of Malin Space Science Systems , San Diego .
" They have finger - like branches at the downhill end and easily diverted around small obstacles . "
Malin is principal investigator for the camera and lead author of a report about the findings published in the journal Science .
The atmosphere of Mars is so thin and the temperature so cold that liquid water cannot persist at the surface .
It would rapidly evaporate or freeze .
Researchers propose that water could remain liquid long enough , after breaking out from an underground source , to carry debris downslope before totally freezing .
The two fresh deposits are each several hundred meters or yards long .

The light tone of the deposits could be from surface frost continuously replenished by ice within the body of the deposit .
Another possibility is a salty crust , which would be a sign of water 's effects in concentrating the salts .
If the deposits had resulted from dry dust slipping down the slope , they would likely be dark , based on the dark tones of dust freshly disturbed by rover tracks , dust devils and fresh craters on Mars .
Mars Global Surveyor has discovered tens of thousands of gullies on slopes inside craters and other depressions on Mars .
Most gullies are at latitudes of 30 degrees or higher .
Malin and his team first reported the discovery of the gullies in 2000 .
To look for changes that might indicate present - day flow of water , his camera team repeatedly imaged hundreds of the sites .
One pair of images showed a gully that appeared after mid-2002 .
That site was on a sand dune , and the gully - cutting process was interpreted as a dry flow of sand .

Today 's announcement is the first to reveal newly deposited material apparently carried by fluids after earlier imaging of the same gullies .
The two sites are inside craters in the Terra Sirenum and the Centauri Montes regions of southern Mars .
" These fresh deposits suggest that at some places and times on present - day Mars , liquid water is emerging from beneath the ground and briefly flowing down the slopes .
This possibility raises questions about how the water would stay melted below ground , how widespread it might be , and whether there 's a below - ground wet habitat conducive to life .
Future missions may provide the answers , " said Malin .
Besides looking for changes in gullies , the orbiter 's camera team assessed the rate at which new impact craters appear .
The camera photographed approximately 98 percent of Mars in 1999 and approximately 30 percent of the planet was photographed again in 2006 .
The newer images show 20 fresh impact craters , ranging in diameter from 7 feet ( 2 meters ) to 486 feet ( 148 meters ) that were not present approximately seven years earlier .
These results have important implications for determining the ages of features on the surface of Mars .
These results also approximately match predictions and imply that Martian terrain with few craters is truly young .
Mars Global Surveyor began orbiting Mars in 1997 .
The spacecraft is responsible for many important discoveries .
NASA has not heard from the spacecraft since early November .
Attempts to contact it continue .
Its unprecedented longevity has allowed monitoring Mars for over several years past its projected lifetime .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , manages the Mars Global Surveyor mission for the NASA Science Mission Directorate , Washington .

Thursday night , " The Sarah Silverman Program " debuted on Comedy Central .
If it had aired on regular broadcast TV many punch lines and entire story lines would probably have been " bleeped " or cut .
The comedian who has been called a " delightful potty mouth " certainly has a devoted fan base who has followed her from stand - up to the silver screen and now , to the home screen .
Cable television has long pioneered new frontiers in what 's funny , allowing comedians to tackle taboo subjects with reckless abandon .
That is , if they were male .
The fact that Ms. Sliverman – considered one of comedy 's rising stars with her engaging smile and bawdy humor – has been given room to run proves just how far women have come on the stand - up stage .
Yet , for every step forward , say many comics and cultural observers , when it comes to being funny , women still face many societal prejudices .
Nice girls just do n't act like that , says comedy veteran Rusty Warren , who recalls male audience members storming out of her shows .
Not much has changed today , say observers who suggest that many people , men and women , find attractive , aggressively funny women like Silverman threatening .
Witness the recent column in Vanity Fair which declared " Women Are n't Funny " ( written by Christopher Hitchens ) .
And despite the fact that his ABC comedy employed numerous funny women , comic Drew Carey says the prejudices are real .
It 's not so much that women are n't funny , he explains , as that men do n't want them to be funny .
" Comedy is about aggression and confrontation and power , " says the stand - up comic .
" As a culture we just do n't allow women to do all that stuff . "
Certain roles have been acceptable for women since the rise of mass media : the sexy vamp ( think Mae West ) or the ditzy klutz ( everyone from Carole Lombard to Lucille Ball and Debra Messing ) .
" These roles are n't threatening to men , " says actress Jennifer Coolidge who has made a career of crafting cunning but klutzy airheaded females .
She adds , " they play into men 's stereotypes of women as sexpots or stupid . "
Indeed , a pregnant Joan Rivers once worried if such a protruding reference to her sexuality , her belly , might hurt her career .
Comedy definitely mirrors the culture , says comedian Kelley Lynn , who is also an adjunct professor and teaches a comedy class at Adelphi University , in Garden City , N.Y .
She says she is amazed at the differences between her male and female students .
" The boys just seem to come in with all this confidence , whether their material is funny or not , " says Ms. Lynn , " whereas the girls come in and say , ' Is this funny ? ' " Almost always , she adds , the material is just as funny , if not more so , but the girls lack the confidence to deliver it with conviction .
" There will continue to be progress for women in the world of comedy as the world changes , " Lynn says , " but it may take generations . "
The rise of sketch comedy has helped women comics .
The collaborative form entered mainstream culture in the ' 70s with groups such as Monty Python and TV shows such as " Saturday Night Live " ( SNL ) , which has since turned it into a household term .
The form has helped nurture generations of successful women comics such as Jane Curtin and Tina Fey .
( Fey now has her own show on NBC , " 30 Rock , " based loosely on her experiences at SNL . )
" We 've been incredibly friendly to women over the years , " says SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels , who has shepherded the show from its inception .
Sketch comedy is well - suited to encourage women , says Cherie Kerr , one of the founders of the seminal comedy troupe from the ' 70s , The Groundlings .
" Suddenly , comedy was n't so much about the solo stand - up anymore , " she says .
" It was about a whole group onstage , working together to make the skit work . "
While she says with a laugh that SNL is certainly a competitive place , the cooperation and working together is much more a woman 's style than the confrontational style of stand - up comedy .
Silverman represents a generation of young comics who 've come of age in an era of few restrictions .
" I do n't think anything is off limits , if it 's funny enough , " says Silverman .
" If it 's more funny than offensive to us , then it 's fine , no matter what it is . "
Nonetheless , says comic Paul Rodriguez , Silverman still faces yet another stubborn stereotype : Pretty women are n't funny , especially when spouting vulgarities .
Men still put women on a pedestal where they expect them to behave , well , nicely – like a mother , says Mr. Rodriguez .
" If an unattractive woman tells jokes , it 's OK , we 'll cut her a break , " he says .
" It 's just a man 's world , comedy is full of prejudices , whether we like it or not , it 's true . "
But good comedy is based on truthful observation , even if it 's the painful reality that not much has changed when it comes right down to it , says Diane Salvatore , editor in chief of the Ladies ' Home Journal .
" People still tend to think of comedy as a job for men , sort of like the presidency , " she adds with a rueful laugh .
For the past three years , the magazine has run an annual spotlight on " Funny Ladies We Love . "
The next one runs in March .
Just like politics , good comedy takes courage , says Ms. Salvatore .
" We want to do our part to support that . "
Spinning Quine Update
After completing this page / project I did a web search for my spinning quine page .
It turns out , someone else had a very similar idea .
They made a " spiraling " quine in perl .
I guess great minds think alike ;-) .
Any ways , here is a link to the page with the spiraling quine .
It is a lot different than mine , because they made use of perl 's ability to evaluate a string as code .
Something you can't do in C ( unless you write your own interpreter ) .
So , the code ends up being much smaller .
Introduction After completing a simple quine , I decided to try something a bit more challenging .
The result is the following iterating quine .
An iterating quine is a program that outputs the source code of another program .
The new program can then be compiled , and it outputs the source code for another program .
This process can be continued until eventually the n'th program outputs the original program .
Here is the source code for the first program in the sequence .
If you look at the sequence of programs generated , the spiral of text in the array can be seen " spinning " clock - wise .

To sleep comfortably on a hot night , wear light cotton pajamas , which are breathable and will help wick moisture away from your skin .
If you can , find a spot to sleep that is on a lower floor , or if that ’s not possible , sleep on the floor of your room , since heat rises and the floor will stay cooler .
Then , keep the door open and run a fan facing your bed to encourage air flow .
Also , try slipping an ice pack under your neck or on your forehead as you fall asleep to make your whole body feel cooler .
For tips from our Nurse reviewer on how to make an ice towel to create a cool breeze with your fan , read on !
For many years , consumer spending on high - tech toys has been growing at a rate far faster than the relatively stagnant supercomputing industry .
By the second half of the 1990s , the sales of even a single moderately successful high - tech consumer toy such as the Tamagotchi , Playstation2 , GameBoy , or Furby greatly outstripped the revenues of all supercomputing products combined .
The competition for the consumer high - tech toy market is fierce and well - funded , and the impetus to provide ever more powerful products to maintain or increase market share has resulted in the computing power found in children 's toys making proportionately far greater strides than have been seen in even the most aggressive conventional supercomputing technologies .
FURBEOWULF
highly parallel processing system
Since the introduction of the original Cray - 1 in 1976 with a computing power of 133 million floating - point operations per second ( megaflops ) , a quarter - century of R&D efforts have only pushed the performance envelope of Cray 's current top - of - the - line SV1 ex - based systems to to the 64,000 megaflop range .
Improving performance by a factor of nearly five hundred may well be no small accomplishment , but in the same twenty - five years , the consumer toy market has gone from sub-microflop offerings like the Pet Rock , early model GI Joe action figures , and unipixel displays such as " mood rings " to the current crop of " virtual pets , " handheld GameBoy play systems , and , the subject of our research , the Furby .
The computing power of a single Furby still lags behind even Cray Computing 's mid-range 2 gigaflop supercomputers , but it is , nonetheless , infinitely more powerful than a Pet Rock and carries a somewhat lower cost - of - ownership than the Cray , particularly when you take into account the price and availability of spares and replacements .
When Linux was first ported to the Furby platform , it suffered from significant stability and performance problems , which gave the Furby an unfortunate reputation as being unsuitable for enterprise - level computing .
The conversion of the IRS and NASA computing facilities to Furby - based platforms towards the end of 1999 was seen by many as premature and may have contributed to the problems experienced by those departments during 2000 which did nothing to improve the Furby 's image in corporate America .
To be fair , however , it should be noted that Furbys placed in IRS telephone support positions received no more complaints than their human counterparts and studies showed that they provided a comparable level of accuracy in their answers to taxpayer questions .
Subsequent releases of Furby Linux have largely addressed these problems and , though the flexibility of the user interface and the support for third - party add - on hardware remains limited , this is primarily a handicap for standard desktop applications like spreadsheets or graphic design , and does not pose a problem for the back - end CPU - intensive parallel processing applications typical of cluster computing .
Inexpensive Aibo - clone running Wagtek 's MojoBARC processor
One unfortunate design flaw that did pose a problem is that the Furby 's networking interface operates exclusively in broadcast mode with no provision for collision detection and arbitration , routing , or other control features necessary to network more than two or three Furbys together effectively .
This required the use of a " watchdog " processor to manage both process allocation and network traffic ; an inexpensive Aibo - clone based on Wagtek 's powerful MojoBARC CPU was selected for this purpose .

How much can artists expect to benefit from Microsoft 's Zune MP3 player ?
Microsoft recently agreed to pay a royalty to Universal Music , which with acts like U2 and Jay - Z is the world 's most successful label , of more than $ 1 for each sale of each Zune sold .
Universal promised it would " pay half of what it receives on the devices to its artists . "
But is that really going to happen ?
Given my experience , I 'm skeptical .
Record companies pay royalties on record sales , and licensing .
Generally the royalty for sales of records is 10 to 15 per cent of the retail price , but it can be higher for established stars .
Traditionally , the split on licensing is 50 - 50 .
Licensing applies to transactions for the use of musical recordings that do not involve sales , such as the use of masters in television and movies .
For digital music distribution , iTunes pays the labels approximately 70 cents .
Although you might think iTunes is a licensing - type deal - because unlike sales to traditional retailers such as Wal - Mart , the labels do not sell individual units to iTunes - they license the catalog .
Yet the labels treat income from iTunes as sales .
The significance of this is that instead of a fifty per cent spilt , they only pay artists the 10 to 15 per cent royalty .
Plus they take standard deductions from this amount including packaging deductions of up to 35 per cent , even though iTunes does not sell packaging with downloads .
( This is actually the basis for a lawsuit against Sony BMG at the moment )
Moreover , most artists do n't even receive this amount because most Artists never " recoup " their recording costs .
So for the same reason that most artists never receive royalties from CD sales , they do n't generally receive digital royalties either .
Although this pattern of not paying artists for digital music sales is dreadful , the chances of artists seeing anything from the royalty placed on Zune is even worse .
There is nothing in the standard recording agreement that says the labels must share income derived from licensing digital devices .
Labels are only responsible for paying for exploitation of music , not licensing electronic devices .
So why would the labels share anything with the artists when they already disregard clauses in the recording agreements that would benefit the artists ?
As a matter of fact , in the United States there is a federal law , the home recording act , which imposes a royalty on " digital audio recording devices " and " digital audio recording media to be paid to copyright owners - including the record labels and artists .
In exchange for the royalty , consumers are exempt from copyright liability for personal recording .
But the law only applies to a limited range of digital tape recorders and blank digital media - the recording industry never tried to extend the Act to personal computers , CD burners or MP3 players because they were afraid that people would copy so much music that CD sales would be dramatically reduced .
Under the AHRA , royalties collected by the Copyright Office on devices and media are divided into two separate funds : the Musical Works Fund and the Sound Recordings Fund .
One third of the royalties goes to the Musical Works Fund , which splits its cut 50:50 between writers and music publishers .
These parties receive royalties according to the extent to which their recordings were distributed or broadcast .
The remaining two thirds of the royalties are placed in the Sound Recordings Fund .
Four percent of these funds are taken off the top for non-featured musicians and vocalists .
What remains is split 60:40 between featured record companies and artists , respectively .
These parties receive royalties through the Alliance of Artists and Recording Companies according to the extent to which their recordings were distributed , as calculated by SoundScan .
( Canada , German , Finland and Australia also have similar levies on digital tape recorders ) .
Under the AHRA , both the songwriter and the Artists are assured of a payment instead of paying the record companies on the artists behalf .
However , AHRA wo n't see any royalties from Zune because MP3 players are n't covered ( and for good measure , the agreement was privately negotiated ) .
I 'm personally in favor of making MP3 players subject to the AHRA so that both the artists and the songwriters are assured of sharing in these revenues .
I think that if Universal is serious about crediting the artists ' accounts with half of the Zune royalty , that would be terrific .
And it would be even better if they actually paid the artists whether or not they are recouped .
But based on how the label are treating artists already , I doubt that this will happen . ®

There are many wonderful things about golf .

A Haifa University survey investigating Arabs and Jews ' views on one another reveals disturbing results .
Disturbing Poll Poll : Israeli Jews shun Arabs Sharon Roffe - Ofir Center for Combating Racism reveals polls showing majority of respondents did not want Arab neighbors , calls made to ' end racism and prejudice '
Poll : Israeli Jews shun Arabs
The poll showed that 75 percent of Jewish students believe that Arabs are uneducated people , are uncivilized and are unclean .
On the other hand 25 percent of the Arab youth believe that Jews are the uneducated ones , while 57 percent of the Arab 's believe Jews are unclean .
Over a third of the Jewish students taking part in the survey confirmed that they are afraid of Arabs .
The poll was conducted by Dr. Haggai Kupermintz , Dr. Yigal Rosen and Harbi Hasaisi of Haifa University 's Center for Research on Peace Education .
The data was presented at a bi-lingual conference held in Haifa .
The study , titled " Perception of ' the Other ' amongst Jewish and Arab Youth in Israel " included 1,600 students studying in 22 high schools around the country .
" We have found a serious expression of stereotypical thinking on the Jewish students ' part regarding the Arab youth , " said Dr. Kupermintz , who pointed out that 69 percent of the Jewish students think that Arabs are not smart .
Willingness to meet with Jewish students
" These students come in with firm stereotypical baggage regarding the other , and in this case , this is the Arabs , " said Kupermintz .
According to the survey , the Arab youth views the Jewish society with fewer reservations : 27 percent of the Arab students believe Jews are uneducated , while 40 percent say they are uncivilized , and 47 percent believe they are not smart .
" We were not surprised with the outcome of the research , " Kupermintz told Ynet .
" Anyone who is familiar with the field knows that these warped perceptions exist , but these findings are at the most severe extreme of a disturbing phenomenon .
Also , up until now , I do n’t think such a high level amongst the Jewish students ' population – over a third – who admit that are afraid of Arabs , has ever been recorded . "
Kupermintz further stated that the survey was conducted in October 2004 , and that if it was to be held today , he believes the results would be much more extreme .
He also added that , contrary to stereotypes , the Arab public in Israel shows more willingness of integration in the Jewish sector , than Jews do in the Arab sector .
Data from the survey also showed that 75 percent of Jewish students feel Arabs are violent , as opposed to 64 percent of Arab students .
Over 50 percent of Arab students showed understanding towards the feelings of the Jewish students .
75 percent of Arab students showed willingness to meet with Jewish students as opposed to less than 50 percent willingness amongst Jewish students .
Senators from both the Labor and Democrat parties have spoken out against the changes , noting that the government is trying to push the long , complex bill through parliament before it 's been properly examined .
As the bill currently stands , even if you genuinely did n't know you were breaking the law , you could still be slapped with large fines and even taken to court , Mr Clapperton and Mr Fitzgerald said .
Section 132AL ( 2 ) of the bill provides that a person commits an " indictable offence " if they possess " a device , intending it to be used for making an infringing copy of a work or other subject - matter " .
This is the most serious offence for an individual technology user , as it means they 've intentionally broken copyright law .
It is subject to a penalty of five years in jail , a fine of up to $ 65,000 , or both .
The " device " cited could be an iPod , or any other piece of technology that could be used to infringe copyright , such as any MP3 player , a camera phone , a VCR or a DVD recorder .
Under proposed new copyright laws , loading tracks onto a music player , which have been copied from a CD , would be classified as infringing copyright .
This would apply even if that CD was legitimately purchased .
Ironically , exceptions in the bill were supposed to legalise copying music from a CD to a device such as an iPod but Kim Weatherall , law lecturer and associate director of the Intellectual Property Research Institute of Australia , said the exceptions were too narrowly drafted .
The exceptions allow users to make one " main copy " of a CD as well as " temporary copies " , but the temporary copies must be destroyed at the " first practicable time " .
Loading music onto an iPod involves having one copy on the device and another on the computer in iTunes , meaning the user has two main copies in addition to the original CD .
This is illegal even if the new bill is passed .
" We are ending up with highly qualified , detailed , legislative language , which is so specific that it fails to work , " Mr Weatherall said .
" If it does n't work on current technology , it wo n't work in the future , either .
In an attempt to get certainty , what we have instead is technology specific , useless exceptions . "
But the law does n't just apply to intentional copyright infringers .
Attorney - General Philip Ruddock 's bill introduces two new offences - summary and strict liability - making it markedly easier to charge people with a criminal offence for breaking copyright law .
The more serious of the two new offences is the " summary offence " , which applies to those who have n't intentionally made infringing copies , but were " negligent " or careless in doing so because they should have known better .
This comes with a penalty of up to two years in jail and - or a $ 13,200 fine .
But even if they can't prove you were negligent and you genuinely did n't know you were breaking the law , the strict liability provisions mean you could still be issued with a $ 6600 fine .
" What strict liability means is that a person can be liable for these offences in the absence of proof that they knew they were dealing with infringing copies or performances that were infringements , " Mr Weatherall said .
This , for example , could apply to a person who taped Sale of the Century for later viewing , said Mr Clapperton .
All of the above offences could involve the individual being taken to court and , subject to the court 's discretion , receiving a criminal record .
However , a new " infringement notice " scheme means that , instead of charging you with a strict liability offence , police could simply issue you an on - the - spot fine of $ 1320 .
If the bill is enacted , " Australia will be the only country in the world that has strict liability offences for copyright , " Mr Clapperton said .
Mr Ruddock defended the changes last Tuesday , saying that copyright offences already attracted criminal penalties .
But Mr Clapperton disagreed and said the new laws would make it " much , much , much " easier to prosecute individuals for copyright infringement .
" Under the new changes it 's lowered the standard of proof , " he said .
" They would only have to prove negligence in the case of the summary offences , or they would n't have to prove fault at all for the strict liability ones . "
Under current copyright laws , no technology users in Australia have been charged with copyright infringement .
However , thousands have been sued in the US , including " grandmothers who do n't have computers " and " dead people " , Mr Clapperton said .
" What EFA is very much concerned about is that thousands of people are being sued on the basis of inaccurate information " We 're afraid that we will see this in Australia except , instead of suing them , they will have them charged under the new criminal provisions . "
In a letter published in last Thursday 's Herald , titled " Specific aim to fines " , Mr Ruddock said that " the fines are aimed at market - stall operators selling pirated copyright material , not to ' trick ' consumers " .
To this , Mr Clapperton said the bill should then be modified to remove the criminal provisions relating to individuals .
" If they 're not planning to enforce these laws against individuals , then they should rewrite these laws so that they do n't apply to individuals , " he said .
" We should n't be relying on the police to decide who to charge and who not to charge . "
A spokesman for Mr Ruddock said the purpose of updating the copyright laws was " to take advantage of new technologies " .
The bill has already gone through the lower house , and was recently reviewed by the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs .
The committee - based on written submissions by various groups and public hearings - recommended a number of changes to the strict liability offences .
The purpose of the changes was to ensure the new laws did n't capture " innocent " consumers , who did n't have the intention of infringing copyright .
The Government is considering the recommendations .
A number of groups made submissions criticising the changes , including Apple , maker of the iPod .
" Apple submits that the current provisions of the bill will leave the [ Australian Copyright ]
Act still outdated and overly restrictive given today 's technology and the legitimate expectations of consumers , " Apple 's submission said .
" Many common everyday acts of copying to ... devices , such as an iPod , computers and even to VCRs ... would still constitute an infringement under the bill 's current form . "
Mr Ruddock 's spokesman said " it 's likely we 'll bring some amendments to the Senate " , but currently there are no plans to remove the criminal provisions relating to individuals .
MashUp Blog : Copyright crimes and misdemeanours
The Search Engine Scene In 2015
Pandia is currently celebrating its 8 anniversary ; our site is a very old one in Internet terms .
However , we are not going to mark this occasion by writing long articles about what has happened since December 1998 .
Instead we are going to tell you what is going to happen during the next eight years .
Due to a freak accident , Pandia 's newsletter mailing service opened a digital wormhole in cyberspace in January 2015 , sending us a very interesting issue of the Pandia Post .
We are going to reprint several of the newsletter articles included during the next two weeks .
An here 's the first one :
Search engine trends from 2007 to 2015
Pandia would like to wish all its readers , listeners and viewers a happy new year !
2014 was definitely an exciting year for searching , and 2015 seems to become even more important .
In this issue of the Pandia Post we will discuss the major developments in the online search sphere for the last eight years , and take a look at possible future developments .
Let us get right down to the basics :
Google still going strong , Yahoo and Microsoft tie the knot
We have seen an impressive development of search technologies during the last eight years , and we will come back to the major innovations later in this newsletter .
Still , it should be noted that the old fashioned text search we learned to love in 1990′s is still around .
Google will still feed you blue links on a white web pages , HTML style , and people continue to click on text ads .
A searcher visiting from the year of 2007 will still find most of its his or her favorites .
Google , Yahoo ! and Ask are still there , and the only major newcomers on the European and American scenes are Chinese Baidu and Scandinavian Balder.com .
However , MSN Search aka Windows Live Search is no more .
It did n't have to go that way .
When Microsoft bought Yahoo ! in 2008 , they did actually discuss making Yahoo !
a subsite of Windows Live and abandon the Yahoo ! search engine technology .
Fortunately , experts convinced them otherwise .
The experts pointed out that this would be the same mistake as Yahoo ! had done when taking over AlltheWeb and AltaVista in 2003 .
At that time Yahoo ! abandoned the best technology ( AlltheWeb ) and kept the weakest one ( Inktomi ) .
Microsoft decided to keep best search engine ( Yahoo ! ) and discontinue Windows Live Search .
The Microsoft team of search engineers became part of the Yahoo !
Search team in 2009 .
The fact that Yahoo ! was kept as a separate identity turned out to be a great success .
The new engineers and researchers from Microsoft found a new home where there was more room for creativity than in the Microsoft mastodon , and together the two teams managed to face some of the major problems search engines where facing those days : the size of the Web and the horrible amount of search engine spam .
Personalized search
Like Google , Yahoo ! started focusing on personalized in earnest around 2007 .
Any user willing to sign up for an account soon found that the search engine started to learn from his or her search behavior , identifying themes , topics and web site neighborhoods of particular interest .
Relevant pages were given a boost in his or her search engine results .
At the same time the search engines started to weed out sites and pages he or she did not find interesting ( for instance by measuring how much time the person spent on that page ) .
The information gathered from registered users was also used to influence the results for non-registered users .
Needless to say , scraper sites and pages of low quality found it hard to compete under such circumstances .
This development led to a renewed interest in so - called white hat , organic search engine marketing .
It made no sense to aim for at " top 10 ranking " anyway , for the site that ranked as No. 1 for Betty , would rank as No. 42 in Kim 's search results .
Instead the goal became to generate traffic and sales - which , of course , should have been the main objective all along .
Social search
The search engines also found other ways of identifying high quality pages that went beyond the " PageRank " methodology developed by Google in the 1990′s ( i.e. where Google calculated the quality and relevance of a page based on the number and quality of inbound links ) .
Around 2006 - 2007 Yahoo !
started in earnest to make use of information gathered from its two bookmarking services , MyWeb and del.icio.us ( they were merged into Yahoo ! del.icio.us in 2009 ) .
Sites that were favored by users of these services began to see a slight improvement in rankings .
Webmasters realized this , of course , and the black hat camp started spamming these services .
However , by 2009 Yahoo ! was getting so good at identifying " unnatural bookmarking , " that it managed to reduce the problem .
Google bought Magnolia and Simpy in 2007 ( both were immediately merged with Google Bookmarks ) , and Ask acquired Bluedot in 2008 .
Now all the big three had efficient bookmarking services that could deliver input to search algorithms .
This did not mean that they abandoned the old ways of deciding page rank .
On - page factors like keyword density and use of tags remained important , as did the link structure of the web .
However , the search algorithms had now become so complicated that it became impossible for search engine marketers to " reverse engineer " them with any kind of accuracy .
Yahoo !
managed to get through its 2006 - 2007 crisis , mostly due to its expertise in the social arena .
Yahoo !
had for a long time been better than Google in community building and Google 's acquisition of YouTube in 2006 did not change that .
Yahoo !
( now a part of Microsoft ) could use this expertise in developing and buying even more social services , making its own visitors create even more searchable content .
Moreover , Google 's acquisition of YouTube did not become the success it had hoped for .
YouTube experienced a tremendous growth in 2006 and 2007 , mainly thanks to teenagers viewing " cool " video clips .
Unfortunately , the attention span of a modern teenagers is shorter than an MTV video ( now on average lasting 1.50 minutes ) , and they soon moved over to new and more fashionable places to hang out ( triple X in 2009 , monsterSUSHI in 2011 and Pluto the Dog in 2012 ) .
Now , of course , teenagers have abandoned the Web all together , having moved over to virtual realities like 3DLife and Otherland .
YouTube has evolved into a site for news - clips , 2010 ′s comedies and live family snap shots .
Office online
Google had a tremendous success with its online office strategy , however .
Google was not the first in this arena .
As early as in the 1990′s Microsoft and Yahoo ! had presented online mail services ( Hotmail and Yahoo ! Mail ) whereby users could read their mail from any computer in the world .
Google followed up on this paradigm with a large number of online services : mail ( GMail ) , word processor ( Google docs ) , spreadsheet ( ditto ) , web site designer ( Web Creator ) , web analytics , personal discussion forums ( Orkut and Groups ) and more .
Most of these were available by 2006 , but they were improved significantly in the years to come .
Moreover , as broadband became " broader " and more ubiquitous services were added .
In 2007 Google added Gdrive ( free online storage ) , in 2008 Google Presentations ( a Powerpoint killer letting you use your browser for presentations ) , Google Podcaster in 2009 ( for recording and distributing sound files ) and Google Image and Video in 2010 ( a photo and video editor ) .
All these services were funded by advertising .
For a fee users could also upgrade to better and more advanced services and get rid of the ads .
( This development was not without controversy .
On the 2010 New Dehli Webmaster World conference a Google representative let slip that they were using the content of personal mails and files to influence the search results of Google subscribers .
This was another factor in the ongoing struggle to provide more accurate and spam - free SERPs .
Some bloggers presented this as a violation of people 's privacy : " Google is reading your mail ! "
It took some time for Google to explain that no , they were not reading anyones mail , but yes , they did use automatic software to spider the content of mailboxes and file directories in order to map the interest of the user . )
Given that all of these Google office services could be used through any browser in any operating system , Microsoft realised it was in big trouble .
Not only could you now perform nearly any regular office task without the Windows operating system .
You did not have to buy Microsoft Office either .
By 2009 several computer manufacturers had started selling cheap office LINUX PCs that hid the complexity of LINUX for the user , booting directly up in a free version of the Firefox or Opera browsers , with all the relevant Google services presented in separate tabs .
By 2011 you did n't even need a PC .
Who needed Vista ?
Microsoft tried to meet this challenge with Windows Live , but they botched it , due to a confusing use of brands , and the fact that they had given Google such a head start .
By 2011 45 percent of American small - and medium sized companies had switched to Google Tools ( as the package was called now ) , some 8 percent were using Yahoo !
Toolbox and 5 percent other competing online office services .
Search 2015 : When media equals the Internet
In part two of our foresight exercise we look at the role of new media in 2015 .
In a few years time web search expanded into these new media territories .
The merger of Internet and media
Microsoft lost the control of the office tool market to Google , who moved everything from wordprocessors to graphics software to the Web .
This development did not mean the end of Microsoft 's Internet presence , however .
In 2007 Microsoft did the right thing :
It turned the Xbox gaming computer into an advanced media station .
Microsoft had seen that the Internet , radio , TV and film distribution was on the point of merging , and decided that the Xbox was the right tool for delivering such content to the home .
They were right .
By 2012 TV and radio as we had known them were dead .
Only pensioners and neo-luddites were willing to have their lives scheduled by TV companies .
They wanted to see their TV programs and movies when it suited them , and were even willing to pay to get rid of the advertising , if needed .
As broadband became a way of life , distribution via FM or regular wireless TV distribution ( analogue or digital ) became meaningless , and by 2012 95 percent of sound and video media content was distributed via the Internet , through IP delivery .
All the major media corporations went bankrupt .
In the US NBC , ABC and CBS all died in the period of of 2011 to 2013 .
Fox survived until 2014 , mainly due to its conservative user base .
BBC survived as an online content provider in the UK , but not as a regular broadcaster .
In essence this meant that the TV set and the radio receiver had been replaced by Internet computers .
The Xbox was by 2009 the most popular media content computer in the world .
Sony came in second , with its Bravia line of TV screens ( the computer being part of the TV screen itself ) and Playstation 4 .
Apple TV came in third and Indian Krishna fourth .
The Internet is everywhere
The Xbox of today is not only a gaming console .
It is able to transfer pictures and sound to any receiver in your home , including the living room cinema , the home office work screen , the door of your fridge , your kitchen window , i.e. any flatscreen that is able to present digital information .
The Internet is everywhere , as most of us will know .
The average Chinese bathroom mirror will now identify its user and present relevant pop-up widgets or windows with daily schedules , weather reports , the latest news , web feeds from blogs and podcasts - and chances are that the mirror is powered by an Xbox .
However , while Microsoft conquered the home , Apple conquered your hand bag and pocket .
While the Windows operating system is close to irrelevant , Apples MacOS is till living strong .
But not because of the MacBook and the iMac .
Although these machines continued to sell even after most Windows machines were replaced by LINUX / Firefox constellations and later with any flat - screen , digital paper or digital surface - after all , the Macs were so much more sexy than a Dell or an HP - the MacOS survived mainly due to the iPod .
The 2007 iPod ( called iPhone for a short time ) gave the world a truly functional portable computer that combined the music and video player with an Internet computer and a voice communication device .
The big touch - screen became the paradigm for portable computing for several years , not to be replaced until 2011 , and then by yet another Apple concept .
Internet media and search
By the end of the first decade of the 21st century it became clear that Internet searching was more important than ever .
Not only was there a need for search engines for searching web pages .
Now the Internet contained :
Nearly all TV programs from all over the world .
Given the TV companies ' need to generate revenue , you could also download programs from their back catalogue at an affordable price .
Ditto for movies .
You could now download any movie you want to your living room cinema display .
Now there were millions of movies to choose from , from Lang 's Metropolis from 1927 to Coppola 's Five Carrots and a Coyote from 2014 .
Billions of radio programs and podcasts
Nearly all phonograms ( songs and albums ) from 1970 onwards , and a large number of those published before that time as well .
Many TV programs and movies contain hidden text ( close captioning ) in the local language or subtitles in foreign languages , and the search engines may make use of this text when indexing this content .
However , many older TV shows lack such text , as do most radio programs and podcasts .
By 2006 many companies had launched services that searched the content contained in the soundtrack of media files .
By 2011 most of these companies were bough by the major search engines , and by that time all of them included information from such files in their regular search engine results .
Book and magazine search
Google and Yahoo's book search services also expanded , and by 2012 all new books were automatically included in their book search databases .
By 2013 most magazines and newspapers were also added , and the indexing of old literature continued .
Now Google claims that it has scanned and indexed nearly all English Language books published in the USA , Canada , Ireland , the Kingdom of England and Wales , and the republic of Scotland since 1850 .
What made this possible was probably the success of Apples iTunes media store .
Media producers and publisher finally realised that downloading did not constitute at threat to their livelihood , but rather presented them with the possibility to distribute content for a very low price to a world wide audience .
The long tail
The existence of " the long tail " , ie .
that fact that even the most obscure topics will generate enough sales when you add up all the enthusiasts existing in the word , suddenly turned the back catalogs of record companies and book publishers into gold mines .
The enormous increase in sales also led to significant drop in prizes , restricting illegal downloads to the rooms of teenagers .
For the search engines this opened up a new source of revenue in addition to the traditional pay - per- click advertising .
Google had for several years had a special music search feature in its regular search results , linking album entries to various online music stores .
It launched its own online media store in 2008 , negotiating agreements with all the major record companies and book publishers .
Microsoft / Yahoo ! did the same , while Ask merged with Amazon.com in 2009 , offering not only media files , but also the possibility of linking book search results with the Amazon bookstore .
If you have an Ask / Amazon account , one click only is enough to bring a book into your physical mail box .
And yes , paper based books are as popular as ever .
Until someone makes a color printer that can bind books for you , the bookstore will never die .
CDs , DVDs , BlueRays and HDDVDs , however , are now history .
Who needs a physical copy when you can download a high definition , wide screen , Dolby Surround movie in minutes ?
Note :
This is an archived article published By Per and Susanne Koch , Published on 15 January 2007
Through all of these events Margaret 's parents are by her side , helping her to negotiate her excitement and her fears , congratulating her on each of the steps she makes toward womanhood .
And if they give her plenty of support when she gets her first period , by the time she 's ready — at age seventeen — to have her first sexual experience , they practically stand by the bed and take photographs to put in the family scrapbook .
For despite the fact that the protagonist in Forever is named Katherine , she is really Margaret a few years older , still living in suburban New Jersey , still a good girl with good parents .
Forever is the first mainstream novel written for American teenage girls that is not only sexually explicit but also intentionally erotic , and that gives them the exact information — practical as well as emotional — to initiate a satisfying sex life .
Again , consider what had come before .
As a teenage girl in the early 1970s who was as desperately curious about sex as Judy Blume had been in the fifties , I read everything I could lay my hands on .
I turned to novels for information about sex not because I 'm a reader but because when I was young they were among the few places a nice girl could find any .
( Love , American Style was risqué , but it was hardly explicit . )
To my parents ' dismay I read Valley of the Dolls more times than I could count , but Jacqueline Susann 's attitude toward human sexuality was of a piece with her prose : whorish and dirty .
Goodbye , Columbus commanded my attention , but you do n't turn to Philip Roth if you want to learn how to go all the way with a really nice boyfriend .
Adults were quick to stick you with The Bell Jar , which you were supposed to lap up with zesty gratitude because of its racy subject matter , but I smelled a rat from the get - go .
Even at sixteen I could tell that the book was overpraised , a stealth weapon of grownups eager to appear progressive in their literary suggestions for teenagers but secretly dying for you to get an eyeful of Esther 's first sexual experience : recovering from a suicide attempt , on furlough from a psychiatric ward , she does the deed with an older man and almost hemorrhages to death .
The only books I 'd seen that placed sex where I wanted to find it — in the middle of a committed relationship , with the boy treating the girl as if she were a fragile piece of glass , and their love so powerful that it threatened to blot them both out — were the pregnancy - scare books that had been passed from hand to hand among the girls at my Catholic junior high .
Written in the 1960s , they invariably involved a supersmart girl ( family : respectable , middle - class ) and a really neat , ambitious boy ( his people would be working - class ; their great dream would be for their son to become a college boy ) .
Always they would make a terrible mistake one night ; always it would turn out to have been one shot with a bullet : dead rabbit and hell to pay .
They would grapple with the most serious kinds of decision - making , and always ( this is why we devoured these books and dreamed about them ) the couple ended up married at sixteen , living in garage apartments or guesthouses .
Books like Too Bad About the Haines Girl and Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones were supposed to frighten us away from sex , lest we become tragic girls ourselves .
But they were so clearly built upon a commonly accepted and deeply stirring code of male honor — an almost chivalric set of principles , handed down through the centuries , and still in practice in the American suburbs of the 1960s — that we were dazzled by them , and regarded them as the greatest love stories ever told .
Which , in a sense , they were .
And then : Forever .
If Hollywood movies of the 1930s taught my parents how to kiss , Forever taught me how to have sex .
This was sex the way girls wanted to read about it , the way they wanted to experience it : immersed in romance .
Katherine and Michael are college - bound high school seniors from nice families .
Katherine 's parents are so exquisitely in tune with the physical and emotional progress of her relationship that one wonders if they 've planted a wire on her .
The grandmother who in Are You There God ?
It 's Me , Margaret ?
sent sweaters with labels that read made expressly for you … by grandma now sends Planned Parenthood brochures with a note reading , " I do n't judge , I just advise . "
Katherine 's mother leaves a New York Times article about teen sex on her daughter 's pillow one night , and they rap about it the next morning .
" A person should n't ever feel pushed into sex , " Katherine tells her mom .
" Or that she has to do it to please someone else … " " I 'm glad you feel that way , " Mom says approvingly .
Was Mom , Katherine asks , a virgin when she got married ?
No , but she 's had sex only with Dad , and she waited until they were engaged .

Due to Mozilla Firefox 's quick rise in popularity , it has become the subject of much praise and criticism .
Somewhere in the midst of it all , some misconceptions have popped up here and there .
This article will address some false claims and hot topics found in the public and media regarding the Firefox web browser .
Some claims below are partially true , partially false .
In these cases , this article will attempt to put the situation into better perspective .
This page does not mean to give the illusion that all hype or criticism about Firefox is false .
Depending on the individual , there may be very good reasons to use Firefox or there may be very good reasons to use something else , and not all reasons either way are touched upon in this article .

Features
Firefox is fully standards compliant Up Claim sources : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 No web browser is 100 % standards compliant .
The web technology standards are very extensive and it often takes many years to implement all of the features of a standard , plus additional time to fix the bugs .
In addition , the standards are always evolving and becoming more and more robust .
Firefox — along with Opera , Safari , and Konqueror — is certainly a leader in the field of standards support and is quickly adopting new emerging technologies , but it , like the others , does not yet have complete support for the current CSS , DOM , or even HTML standards .
Below is a brief summary of how well Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Opera support some of the most significant standards and emerging technologies .
A “ Y ” indicates perfect support , while a “ 100 % ” is the result of rounding .
More information is available in the Web browser standards support resource .
Although CSS 2.1 and CSS 3 are not technically web standards yet because they have n't reached the Recommendation status , the detailed sections have at some point reached Candidate Recommendation status , which is the stage during which web browsers are supposed to begin implementing support .
No browser has full support for CSS 2 either , and several sections of CSS 2 have been removed in CSS 2.1 for this reason .

Firefox often displays webpages incorrectly Up Claim sources : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 People usually make this claim when they see a webpage that looks different in Firefox than it does in Internet Explorer , and they assume that Internet Explorer is the one displaying it “ correctly ” because it looks how the author intended it .
Webpage layouts are designed by specifying sets of rules for how things should appear .
The rules are primarily written in a language called CSS , which is defined and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium .
It is up to the individual browsers to implement these sets of rules and handle them how they are defined .
Internet Explorer is far behind the competition in implementing this support , as you can see in this standards support summary .
Many CSS features are not implemented , and many are implemented incorrectly .
Since Internet Explorer usage has been so high for so long , web developers have had to make sure that their pages work as intended in Internet Explorer , or else risk losing a majority of their potential visitors .
For some time , many web developers even felt safe developing only for Internet Explorer , paying no attention to the other browsers .
Therefore , if they ran into an Internet Explorer display bug , they would simply adjust their CSS to compensate .
This compensation , if not done correctly , could actually cause display problems in browsers that do n't have that particular bug .
It would also cause display problems in future versions of Internet Explorer that have the bug fixed .
In the vast majority of webpages that do n't work as intended in Firefox , the problem is due to relying on an Internet Explorer bug , relying on non-standard Internet Explorer features that could easily be replaced with standardized cross - browser alternatives , or relying specifically on Internet Explorer 's ActiveX technology , which other browsers deliberately do not support by default due to an extensive history of security problems with ActiveX , and which will no longer be enabled by default in future versions of Internet Explorer for this reason .
As explained above , no browser has perfect standards compliance , and there are a few parts of some web standards that Internet Explorer supports and Firefox does not , so it is theoretically possible for a standards - compliant webpage to be rendered more correctly in Internet Explorer than Firefox , but this is extremely rare in practice .
Microsoft sets the standards ( or should ) Up Claim sources : 1 , 2 Some people believe that , due to Internet Explorer 's current domination in the market , Microsoft should be the one who defines the standards and other browsers like Firefox should follow Microsoft rather than the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .
This claim is often presented as if Microsoft and the W3C each think that its respective sets of rules are correct and the other 's are wrong , which is n't the case .
Microsoft is a member of the W3C and has played a role in the development of their standards .
The Internet Explorer development team admittedly strives to support W3C standards , but has simply fallen far behind due to the five - year development halt and some lack of direction beforehand .
Internet Explorer Group Program Manager Chris Wilson stated in an official blog post , “ I want to be clear that our intent is to build a platform that fully complies with the appropriate web standards , in particular CSS 2 ( 2.1 , once it 's been Recommended ) . ” .
They have lately been working closely with the Web Standards Project ( WaSP ) to direct Internet Explorer development to support the most demanded web standards in upcoming versions .
Many of the rendering aspects of Internet Explorer that some claim to be Microsoft standards are actually bugs and incomplete implementations of W3C standards , and many of these oddities are being fixed in future versions .
This means that websites that rely on Internet Explorer 's current behavior may fall apart in future versions just as they do today in more standards - compliant web browsers .
This is a fact of which Microsoft has warned web developers , and before Internet Explorer 7 was released , they called for web developers to fix their pages for the new version .
Firefox was the first browser with tabs Up Claim sources : 1 , 2
This is n't very widely believed , but every now and then someone expresses this assumption .
The first known web browser with tab support was InternetWorks , back in 1994 .
Opera made a public release with a tabbed MDI in 1996 .
NetCaptor offered tab support in 1997 , followed by IBrowse in 1999 , and finally Mozilla offered it natively in 2001 .
Firefox has supported tabbed browsing since its first release in 2002 .
Firefox was the first web browser to really make mainstream awareness of browser tabs , but it did n't invent the idea .
See the Wikipedia article on Tabbed Document Interfaces for more information .
Scientists are to decipher the genetic code of our closest relative , the barrel - chested , long - faced Neanderthal , in the hope that it will reveal how modern humans developed the formidable cognitive power to dominate the world .
With fragments of DNA from bones found in ancient caves , researchers will piece together the Neanderthal 's genome , and compare it with those already sequenced for humans and chimpanzees .
Modern humans and Neanderthals split from a common ancestor nearly 500,000 years ago , as primitive humans first harnessed the power of fire .
From a foothold north of the Mediterranean , Homo heidelbergensis steadily evolved into the Neanderthals , while in Africa , the same species embarked on a different evolutionary path , one that ultimately gave rise to Homo sapiens .
Remains of Neanderthals dating back as far as 400,000 years ago suggest a reasonably sophisticated species that crafted tools and weapons and buried its dead , but they were no match for Homo sapiens .
The last Neanderthals died out nearly 40,000 years ago , as Homo sapiens migrated to , and eventually settled throughout , Europe .
The team of scientists , led by Svante Pääbo at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig , will analyse strands of DNA preserved in a leg bone recovered from a cave in Vindija , Croatia , and an upper arm bone from an archaeological site in the Neander valley in Germany .
Contamination with microbes means only 5 % of the DNA collected from the bones belongs to Neanderthals , giving the scientists an enormous sorting problem .
The effort to reconstruct the 3 billion building blocks of the genome is expected to take two years , using a rapid sequencing technique developed by a US - based company , 454 Life Sciences .
The complete genome will be made publicly available for other researchers to study .
" If we 're really interested in what makes us truly modern humans , we need to look at the genetic changes that have happened in the past 200,000 to 300,000 years , and to identify those changes we need to look at our closest relative , the Neanderthal , " said Dr Pääbo .
While humans and chimps share 99 % of their genetic code , the remaining 1 % still amounts to around 35 million genetic tweaks that separate the species .
The difference between modern humans and Neanderthals is much smaller , making it easier to pinpoint the genes that furnished us with distinguishing characteristics such as larger , complex brains and the ability to develop sophisticated language .
" The Neanderthal genome will tell us much more about human biology than sequencing any other individual around .
The ultimate goal is to understand humans , with the real pot of gold for humanity being the genes associated with cognition .
We want to know what are the handful of genetic changes that separated modern humans from the Neanderthal ?
The most amazing thing is that we 've been able to find samples that had DNA and are now able to sequence it , " said Michael Egholm , vice - president of molecular biology at 454 Life Sciences .
Since we 've been discussing hybrid type checking , dependent types , etc. recently ...
Sage
Sage is a prototype functional programming language designed to provide high - coverage checking of expressive program specifications ( types ) .
Sage allows a programmer to specify not only simple types such as " Integers " and " Strings " but also arbitrary refinements from simple ranges such as " Positive Integers " to data structures with complex invariants such as " Balanced binary search trees . "
In addition to featuring these predicates upon types , Sage merges the syntactic categories of types and terms , in the spirit of Pure Type Systems , to express dependent types such as that of the infamous printf function .
Sage performs hybrid type checking of these specifications , proving or refuting as much as possible statically , and inserting runtime checks otherwise .
For the complete details of the theory and empirical results , we direct you to the technical report .
I had to wait until today after some morning meetings for the transcript to be available .
Let 's start there .
Now , if there were a vaccine that would protect your child from a kind of cancer that kills thousands of people every year , chances are , you would make sure your child gets it .
But the next story we 're bringing out in the open is not that simple , because it involves sex , parents ' rights , and women 's health .
The governor of Texas has just signed an order to require girls in sixth grade to get the vaccine for HPV , the virus that causes cervical cancer .
And 18 other states are considering doing the same thing .
Ed Lavandera has story tonight from Dallas .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) JULIANNE JACOBS , STUDENT :
You should do it before you 're sexually active .
LAVANDERA ( voice - over ) : Julianne Jacobs is ahead of the class , one of the first young girls in Texas to receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus .
HPV is a sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervical cancer .
The federal government says , the recently approved vaccine can prevent most types of cervical cancer .
Julianne 's parents have told her it's not a free pass to start having sex .
JACOBS : And , because , you know , that vaccine does n't guarantee -- guarantee safety .
It can still -- you can still get past it , and you could get that disease , even if you have the vaccination .
LAVANDERA : But , when Texas Governor Rick Perry signed an executive order , making it mandatory starting in September of 2008 for sixth - grade girls to receive the vaccine , many parents were angry .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
The government should let parents make their own decisions for things like this .
Oh yes ?
I beg to differ .
The school district where I live requires the following :
A physical examination prior to registration
DPT , DTaP , Td , DT ( diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus )
Tdap ( tetanus , diphtheria , and acellular pertussis )
OPV , IPV ( polio )
MMR ( measles , mumps , rubella )
Hepatitis B
Varicella ( chicken pox )
HIB ( Haemophilus influenzae type B )
PCV ( Pneumococcal 7 - valent conjugate )
Tuberculosis screening
All of the above represent an attempt by the state to safeguard students from communicable diseases that are a danger to the public health and welfare .
Should a parent be able to decide that their child receive or not receive a vaccination and place another child at risk in so doing ?
I do n't think so .
Continuing :
LAVANDERA : Dawn Richardson is lobbying Texas lawmakers against making the vaccine mandatory , and also has a daughter of her own .
DAWN RICHARDSON , LOBBYIST AND PARENT :
There 's no proof that this vaccine is going to affect the rates of cervical cancer , because the vaccine is being administered to 11 - year - old girls .
It 's only been tested for four years .
LAVANDERA : The FDA says , the vaccine is safe and effective , requiring three shots over a six - month period .
But some critics worry that making the vaccine mandatory will promote premarital sex , instead of abstinence .
PETER SPRIGG , VICE PRESIDENT FOR POLICY , FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL :
We feel it 's very important that people not be told that this is a vaccine that will make it safe to have sex .
LAVANDERA ( on camera ) : Governor Perry is a staunch conservative .
And he says this idea protects life and promotes women 's health .
And he says parents will ultimately be allowed to decide whether or not their daughters get this vaccine .
They can apply to opt out of if they object to it for religious or moral reasons .
( voice - over ) : The Republican governor is receiving support from unlikely places , Planned Parenthood and even many Democrats , who see this strictly as a public health issue .
BINGO .
It 's the sex , stupid !!
So even though researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine to prevent or lessen the instances of HIV contraction , kids should n't be able to have it because ( GASP !! ) it 's promoting SEX !!!
( cue fire and brimstone )
Now get a load of the discussion with the panel of experts :
ZAHN : There are 10,000 cases of cervical cancel -- cancer , that is , every year , 4,000 deaths .
Out in the open tonight : the controversy over requiring sixth - grade girls to get the HPV vaccine to prevent the sexually transmitted disease that can lead to cervical cancer .
Texas has just started requiring the shots -- 18 other states also considering it .
Let 's go back to tonight 's " Out in the Open , " panel , Clarence Page , with his mike on -- yes -- Tara Wall [ RNC mouthpiece ] , Rachel Maddow .
ZAHN : So , Clarence , should this be mandatory ...
PAGE : I think ...
ZAHN : ... and made mandatory by state government ?
PAGE : You know , what troubles me is making it mandatory before the public is adequately educated , because I saw what happened with Roe vs.
Wade , which I personally support as a decision .
But I saw the backlash , which we 're still feeling politically across the country , because it was imposed on the country .
This is a very personal thing .
Whenever government gets into something as personal as , say , 12 - year - olds , like -- like , my 12 - year - old niece , mandating that she has got to get a shot that many people think is connected to sexual promiscuity -- I do n't think it is .
ZAHN : Sure .
I do n't know what I think about Page 's argument .
Frankly , if the fundamentalist MINORITY in the US were n't screaming bloody murder about protecting women from CANCER for Christ 's sake , there would n't be an education issue ( as Page put it ) .
PAGE : But so many people think that , we obviously need a lot of public educating out there .
So , it troubles me to do it do it too quickly .
ZAHN : But , even with public education ...
MADDOW : Yes .
ZAHN : ... there is a strong view that you 're promoting promiscuity .
There are people think , since this vaccine has been around only for four years , that it really wo n't convincingly reduce rates of cervical cancer .
So , what difference is it going to make if there 's a time lag before you make it mandatory ?
MADDOW : It 's -- well , here 's the thing .
If we were talking about a vaccine for any other kind of cancer , as a person in your previous segment described , we would be singing hallelujah right now .
But the fact that this is a disease that is spread by sexual contact , human papillomavirus , which leads to cervical cancer , all of a sudden , we get hysterical and lose the ability to think reasonably about this .
( LAUGHTER ) MADDOW : Once you bring up sex , we lose all public health rationality about this .
And , so , I think that , really , what you need to consider is whether or not this going to be treated as a public health and safety issue , or whether this is going to be another thing about which we have a hysterical sex conversation involving teenagers , because we can't -- we have that debate .
THANK YOU Rachel Maddow .
If you would like to thank her as well , you can use this form .
Maddow nets it out - it's all about dirty nasty SEX and a vaccine somehow giving carte blanche to young women to have it .
ZAHN : But you know it will be a little bit of both of them .
( CROSSTALK ) WALL : Listen -- listen , you talk not having the buy - in , and the public not having the buy - in of the legislature .
The governor did this on his won [ sic ] .
The governor , whom I respect -- and , actually , he 's my governor .
I voted for him .
But he 's wrong .
( CROSSTALK ) ZAHN : He 's a conservative governor .
He is your governor .
WALL : He is .
He has been a very good conservative governor .
But he 's wrong on this issue .
As my mother says , a person can be sincere , but they can be sincerely wrong .
( CROSSTALK ) MADDOW : How can a vaccine for cancer be wrong ?
And here we go .
WALL : There 's -- there 's no -- there 's no -- there was no parental -- you 're usurping parental rights .
You 're usurping the legislature .
( CROSSTALK ) WALL : Make it an opt-in , as opposed to an opt - out .
There is an opt - out provision , of course .
I 'm not a legal expert - but I found this article that talks generally about the legal basis for mandatory vaccines and it states pretty clearly that the process and procedure is ALWAYS to opt - out , NOT opt - in .
What a ridiculous argument on Wall 's behalf , that flies in the face of how every other religious or moral issue with a vaccine is handled .
ZAHN : Sure .
WALL : But why not make it an opt-in , as opposed to an opt - out .
See above .
See the law .
See a bunch of cases .
But most importantly , see a shrink - because that 's the only thing that 's going to help you explain why you do n't want to protect women from contracting cancer .
MADDOW : Would you do that for measles ?
Would you do that for rubella ?
Would you do that for polio ?
Would you do that for ... ( CROSSTALK ) WALL :
This has to do with a very sensitive ...
( CROSSTALK ) MADDOW : With sex .
WALL : Absolutely -- issue ...
MADDOW : Right .
WALL : ... that is a family issue , that parents need to discuss with their children amongst themselves , and not to have the government impose upon them .
MADDOW : How has that been working so far ?
( CROSSTALK ) WALL :
That 's not for the government to decide .
( CROSSTALK ) ZAHN :
If you want to see how it 's working so far , I want you all to look at the screen right now ...
Here 's where it gets good .
Facts are a bitch , are n't they ?
ZAHN : ... because this is a staggering statistic .
This is the incidence of HPV hitting young kids in this 14 - to 19 - year - old age group .
We know that about a third of kids that are 13 to 16 are sexually active .
So , do you think parents have their heads in the sand ?
( CROSSTALK ) PAGE : Well , of course , yes .
Parents do have their head in the sands about sex and drugs .
We know that .
But there 's also the question about , do parents who want to take responsibility for their kids , should they be entitled to have opt - out or opt - in choices ?
I think that is really what at issue here .
( CROSSTALK ) PAGE :
You talk about rubella and several other contagious diseases which you can catch without having sex , I mean , there 's a reason to want to control a contagion that travels in the air , and -- and to mandate that .
Point of fact : Hepititis B is not transmitted in the air yet is mandated in ( I think ) 35 states .
MADDOW : But look at that figure .
( CROSSTALK ) PAGE :
When you 're talking about something that is more personal -- well , look at the figures ...
MADDOW : This is -- it 's endemic .
( CROSSTALK ) MADDOW :
If you 're a teenager having sex , basically , you 're going to get HPV .
( CROSSTALK ) PAGE : Just to play devil 's advocate , which I 'm very good at ...
WALL : But what if you 're not having sex ?
( CROSSTALK ) WALL :
What if you 're not having sex ?
( CROSSTALK ) WALL :
There are plenty of teenagers out there who -- who -- who have had discussion with their parents who choose to remain abstinent or virgins until they 're married , until ... ( CROSSTALK ) ZAHN : But you know what the manufacturers ...
( CROSSTALK ) ZAHN : Hang on one second .
The manufacturers of the vaccine say , that 's a good thing ...
Oooh !!
Here come those pesky facts again .
MADDOW : Yes .
ZAHN : ... because they said that the vaccine is more effective when you 're inoculated before you start having sex .
( CROSSTALK ) WALL :
Well , the other factor is -- and my mother is a nurse as well .
And some of the issues that are being raised is how new this is .
It has n't been tested and tried .
It needs to be given some time .
The other portion , again , opt - in , not make an opt - out .
Let parents decide .
This is the government assuming parents do n't know what 's best for their children .
I think that 's a little bit elitist .
Ah ...
So it ISN 'T about sex ?
It 's about the relative newness of the drug itself and the safety of the drug ?
I thought it was about family decisions and the distinction between opting in and opting out ...
Silly me .
The fundamentalist Christian groups who oppose this vaccine are essentially making this argument :
If you were n't having sex , you would n't contract HPV and possibly contract and die from cervical cancer .
And if you ARE having sex and get HPV and contract cervical cancer , you deserve to die .
How 's that for values ?
Jesus weeps .
The losses threaten beekeepers ' livelihoods
The cause of the losses , which range from 30 % to more than 70 % , is a mystery , but experts are investigating several theories .
American bee colonies have been hit by regional crises before , but keepers say this is the first national crisis .
Bees pollinate more than $ 14bn ( £ 7 bn ) worth of US seeds and crops each year , mostly fruits , vegetables and nuts .
Box after box after box are just empty .
There 's nobody home
David Bradshaw , Beekeeper
The mysterious disappearances highlight the important link that honeybees play in the chain that brings fruit and vegetables to supermarkets and dinner tables .
The crisis threatens numerous crops , from avocados to kiwis and California almonds - one of the most profitable in the US .
" I have never seen anything like it , " California beekeeper David Bradshaw , 50 , told the New York Times .
" Box after box after box are just empty .
There 's nobody home . "
Under pressure
With an industry increasingly under consolidation , some fear the disorder could prove the breaking point for even large beekeepers .
The bee losses range from 30 to 60 % on the West Coast , with some beekeepers on the East Coast and in Texas reporting losses of more than 70 % .
Beekeepers consider a loss of up to 20 % in the offseason to be normal .
Researchers say the bees are presumably dying in the fields , perhaps becoming exhausted or simply disoriented and eventually falling victim to the cold .
" The real question is why they leave , " Jerry Hayes , a bee expert for the Florida Department of Agriculture told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper .
" Bees are highly social insects .
They do n't leave their babies and the queen . "
The investigators are exploring a range of possibilities to explain the losses , which they are calling " colony collapse disorder " .
These include viruses , a fungus and poor bee nutrition .
They are also studying pesticides banned in some European countries to see if they are affecting the bees ' innate ability to navigate their way back to their hives .
In some cases , bees are being raised to survive a shorter offseason , to be ready to pollinate once the almond bloom begins in February .
This could have lowered their immunity to viruses .
Mites have also damaged bee colonies , and the insecticides used to try to kill them are harming the ability of queen bees to spawn as many workers .
Urban sprawl
Once the domain of hobbyists , beekeeping has become increasingly commercial and consolidated in the US .
During the last two decades , the number of beehives has dropped by a quarter , and is now estimated at 2.4 million .
The number of beekeepers has fallen by half during the same period .
Bees are vital for the pollination of important US crops
In addition , urban growth means that the areas where the insects can forage for nectar to stay healthy and strong during the pollination season are being squeezed .
" There are less beekeepers , less bees , yet more crops to pollinate , " said Zac Browning , vice - president of the American Beekeeping Federation .
" With so much added loss and expense due to disease , pests and higher equipment costs , profitability is actually falling . "
Sound technology turns the way you hear on its ear By Kevin Maney , USA TODAY SAN DIEGO  Rarely is an invention so unique , so visceral and so simple that in 15 seconds most people who experience it realize it could alter everyday life .
Woody Norris , inventor of ultrasound technology , holds a hypersonic sound speaker .
ATC
But that 's what happens to just about anyone who steps out to the back parking lot of American Technology Corp. ( ATC ) here for a demonstration of its invention called HyperSonic Sound ( HSS ) .
Essentially , HSS for the first time does for sound what the laser did for light — intensely focuses and channels it so it can travel great distances without dispersing .
In the demo , a technician points a speaker the size of a cereal box at someone standing 100 yards away .
Amid the din of the nearby freeway , the technician plays a recording of ice cubes clinking into a glass .
To the listener , the sound comes across as if it were through headphones , totally unlike a sound blaring from a distant speaker over oppressive car noise .
Take two steps to the side , out of the sound beam , and you hear nothing at all .
Step back in , and there it is again .
" I am certain that in time , HSS will be used everywhere , " says Dionyssis Angelopoulos of Athens , Greece .
He read about HSS , came to San Diego to hear it and went back to his Greek company to build it into commercial sound systems .
Though the technology is still years from becoming mainstream , HSS could be used to make laptop speakers that blare music to the person in front of the screen , while no one else could hear it .
It could allow a grocery store to play audio advertisements that seem to come from , say , the display of Duracell batteries , yet the ad could be heard only by the shopper in front of the display .
An HSS - equipped car could play one CD for the parents up front and another for kids in the back .
Neither would hear even a whisper of the others ' music .
The technology is winning believers from Wal - Mart to McDonald's , Fox television , the Los Angeles Police Department , Procter & Gamble , the U.S. Navy and Cirque de Soleil .
It is looking into whether HSS could be used to communicate instructions , midact , from the ground to a trapeze artist without the audience hearing .
Companies are experimenting with HSS in TVs , rock concerts , museums , war and airport gates .
Imagine hearing only your flight 's announcements .
In 2002 , Popular Science magazine awarded HSS the grand prize for inventions .
The Segway personal transporter took second .
" It offers huge benefits over your standard speaker systems , " says Sony executive Simon Beesley , who is working on HSS in commercial settings , such as stores or restaurants .
" The technology is in its infancy , but I am sure it will very quickly expand . "
As it does , HSS will probably rattle the speaker industry , which has been selling a variation of the same technology for nearly 80 years .
The impact could be like that of the jet engine on propeller planes or the PC on the mainframe — a major shift that ushers in an era .
Another hit for inventor
The ideas behind the technology have been around for decades .
But HSS - style speakers had never been more than lab experiments — too costly and unwieldy to become a product .
ATC is the first to make it practical , industry experts say .
Actually , ATC 's technology pops from the mind of Woody Norris , a throwback to old school tinkerers like Thomas Edison or Ben Franklin .
He did n't go to college and instead learned basic electronics while in the Air Force .
Often boastful about his capabilities , he claims to be something of an inventor savant .
On his Web site ( www.woodynorris.com), he says , " You know how some people can play the piano , they just pick out notes ?
I 've always had that ability with electronics . "
Norris , 64 , has had some major successes .
In the 1960s , he worked out the basic technology behind the sonogram , eventually selling it to a medical company that turned it into the devices used to give expectant mothers a first glimpse of their babies .
In the 1980s , Norris created a microphone that picks up a person 's voice through the vibrations in the bones in his or her head .
He sold that for $ 1.5 million , and it became the Jabra all - in - one cell phone headsets now on the market .
The microphone is actually in the earpiece .
Norris formed ATC in 1980 as a vehicle for marketing his inventions .
Around 1995 , he began working on HSS .
" I had the idea probably 20 years ago , " he says .
Norris got it from color television .
A color TV screen has only three colors — red , blue and green — but tricks the eye into seeing other colors by mixing those three in the air as the light travels from the set .
That led Norris to consider making sounds by mixing other sounds .
He also knew that the waves of ultrasonic sound — a far higher pitch than the ear can detect — can travel farther and stay more focused than waves at lower pitches .
So , Norris found a way to make two slightly different ultrasonic waves carry information about a sound , somewhat the way radio waves carry music from an FM station .
When the waves encounter a solid object or person , they slow , distort and crash together .
The result is the ultrasonic waves re-create the original sound in the air around the object , so humans can hear it .
So , sound from a distant HSS speaker seems like it 's right at your ears because it 's actually being created right at your ears .
If you step out of the beam , the waves have nothing to distort and mix them , so the inaudible ultrasonic waves slide silently past .
The wave - mixing characteristic of HSS has another effect :
Aim an HSS speaker at a solid object like a wall , and the two waves mix at the object .
In an ATC demo room , CEO Jim Irish plays music on an HSS speaker and aims the speaker at a back wall .
The music seems to come from the wall , not the speaker .
Point it at a door , and the music seems to come from the door .
Unlimited possibilities
The last key property of HSS is its ability to focus sound .
The ultrasonic waves do n't dissipate , traveling pretty much straight ahead .
So sound from an HSS speaker can travel 150 yards without distortion or loss of volume , while anyone outside the path hears nothing .
Traditional speakers work very differently .
They send out audible sound waves that quickly disperse , filling a room with sound and weakening as they go .
So the sound fades as you get farther from the speaker .
The properties of HSS are so fundamentally new that Norris predicts " an explosion of invention " around the focusing of sound .
How about an HSS megaphone ?
A beach lifeguard could warn a swimmer who was too far out .
Over the crashing of waves , the swimmer would clearly hear the lifeguard 's instructions .
Norris mischievously warns that such megaphones would have to be banned from pro sports games .
" Someone in the stands could use it to razz one player he did n't like , " says Norris , who has used HSS to spook neighborhood kids on Halloween .
More seriously , the Navy is trying HSS on an aircraft carrier , where the noise of jets can otherwise drown out orders coming from ordinary speakers .
Police SWAT teams are interested in the technology 's ability to make sound seem like it 's coming from a far wall or window .
They might be able to project sounds that fool suspects into thinking a raid is coming from another direction , then storm in by surprise .
In hospitals , an HSS TV could allow one patient to watch a show without bothering the other patient in the room .
In restaurants or clubs , music could be focused at patrons but remain unheard outside the building .
Wal - Mart is interested in HSS for store advertising , Sony for everything from TVs to industrial sound systems .
Investors attuned to profits
As HSS wins converts , ATC is trying to turn it into a business .
The company spent the past seven years and $ 44 million developing the technology .
When Irish was hired as CEO earlier this year , he found the company had no sales organization , no ability to mass - produce products , and a long history of not making money on its inventions .
It has only 30 employees in a generic office park on San Diego 's outskirts .
A public company , ATC also has a long list of shareholders who have been losing patience .
The stock bounced above $ 10 a share in 2000 but now lingers around $ 3 .
" I 'm bringing business standards to a company that needed some reining in , " Irish says .
He has cut costs , hired a sales staff , cut a deal with a contract manufacturer in Mexico and rushed the prototype R220A HSS speaker into production while developing more refined models .
Each R220A — targeted more for industrial use — costs about $ 600 , and ATC expects prices to drop quickly .
The company is also beginning to market a couple of other sound technologies , including one called High Intensity Directed Acoustic ( HIDA ) , which can generate sound waves so intense that they can instantly incapacitate a human .
The military is interested .
At first , ATC plans to sell HSS for niche applications and other uses that do n't directly challenge the conventional speaker industry .
" Later , we 'll go after mainstream speakers , " Norris says .
HSS speakers wo n't challenge conventional speakers for all uses .
In many cases — such as a home stereo , rock concert or movie — the point is to fill the room with sound .
HSS makes sense only where focusing sound makes sense .
Help for the blind Nobody is debating whether the technology works — it does .
And given the enthusiasm at Sony and other companies , HSS will make its way into products of all kinds .
In the meantime , suggestions pour into ATC daily .
" I just got an e-mail from a blind man , " Irish says .
The e-mail said HSS could improve the chirping sounds used in crossing signals to guide blind people through intersections .
The sound could be channeled only along the crosswalk .
" Then you 'd know that if you walked out of the sound , you 'd walked out of the crosswalk , " Irish says , quoting the e-mail .
Simplicity is n't easy to achieve , and John Maeda 's short book , The Laws of Simplicity , provokes a lot of thought on the topic .
Programmers swim in a sea of unending complexity .
We get so used to complexity as an ambient norm that we begin , consciously or unconsciously , projecting it into our work .
Simplicity is tough in any field , but in ours , we exacerbate the problem .
Impossibly complex applications are the default deliverable for new programmers .
Only seasoned software development veterans are capable of producing applications that are easy to understand and troubleshoot .
Simplicity is n't achievable as a passive goal ; it 's a force that must be actively applied .
You can read most of the book online via John 's excellent blog , including abbreviated versions of the ten laws of simplicity .
One of my favorite sections is about the evolution of the iPod 's controls .
Keep it Simple , Stupid .
If only it was that easy .
It feels more like back - breaking work to keep things from inevitably devolving into complexity .
writing your own language is bad , m’kay ?
September 13 , 2006
Posted by Imran Ghory in Software development
Joel Spolsky ‘s been at the centre of some recent controversy over his VBScript extending language Wasabi — what really shocks me is not that he wrote his own language , but the appalling lack of ability of those attacking his decision to give a coherent argument against it .
Forget C – universities obviously need to go back to teaching students rhetoric .
Even some generally intelligent high - profile bloggers such as Jeff Atwood attacked it without giving any justification other than a vastly over - simplistic “ writing your own language is bad , m’kay ? ” .
Out of the hundreds of people who have commented on it I ’ve not seen one person suggesting a reasonable alternative for Joel ’s business problem .
So I ’d like to throw out the question what would you do in the following situation :
You have a product which is deployed to client web - servers and is written in VBscript , your market research has indicated that having your product work under more web environments ( i.e. non-VBscript ones ) would bring in significantly more sales .
Having looked into it you find that getting the clients to install a new run-time environment or language is unviable – too many are unwilling to do this .
So you have to use something that ’s already installed almost everywhere ( or at least everywhere you ca n’t deploy VBScript ) – a quick look at Netcraft will tell you that the answers PHP .
So now you know you need to port your app to PHP , how would you do it ?
You could do it by hand and then forever after have two codebases you ’ld have to keep in sync .
Anyone who ’s ever tried to do that before will know down that path lies years of pain and maintenance nightmares .
You could make a framework in both languages which is data driven , trying to move as much of your application code as possible into the data .
But this is essentially the same as coming up with a new language and writing an interpreter for it in both PHP and VBscript .
You could write a program which turned your VBScript into PHP .
This seems essentially the route Joel took ( adding some extra functionallity while he was at it ) .
Anyone have any other suggestions for how you would solve this problem ?
Because frankly Joel ’s solution is the best programming solution to his business problem that I can think of .
Illusions and Paradoxes : Seeing is Believing ?
This page illustrates that our visual perception cannot always be trusted .
The components of an object can distort the perception of the complete object .
Our mind is the final arbiter of truth .
Most optical illusions are the result of 1 ) incongruent design elements at opposite ends of parallel lines , 2 ) influence of background patterns on the overall design , 3 ) adjustment of our perception at the boundaries of areas of high contrast , 4 ) afterimages resulting from eye movements or from kinetic displays , or 5 ) inability to interpret the spatial structure of an object from the context provided by the picture .
The Parthenon The Parthenon
Optical illusions have been studied for millenia .
The ancient Greeks used a technique known as entasis which incorporates a slight convexity in the columns of the Parthenon to compensate for the illusion of concavity created by parallel lines .
Many of the following illusions have been popularized by psychologists and artists like Hering , Ehrenstein , Meyer , Zöllner , Müller - Lyer , Poggendorf , and Escher .
Perpetually ascending staircase .
How can the man go up all the time ?
Can such a staircase be built as a real object ?
The red squares are the same color in the upper part
and in the lower part of the " X "
The diagonal lines are parallel .
( Zöllner illusion )
There are no gray spots at the corners of the squares .
Stairway between corners of a flat square .
The rows of black and white squares are all parallel .
The vertical zigzag patterns disrupt our horizontal perception .
Children 's Activity Project

Impossible triangle .
This triangle cannot be built as a real object .
The triangle with dice is an illusion by Japanese artist Shigeo Fukuda
Can you find a relationship between this triangle and a Möbius strip ?
( Hint : Assume that the thickness of the strip is the same as the width of the strip ,
and that instead of twisting 180 degrees before joining , there is only a 90 degree twist . )
The radiating lines influence our perception of the parallel lines .
The center circles are both the same size .
The circle and the squares appear distorted by the background patterns .
The Vertical lines are both the same length .
The diagonal lines A - B and B - C are equal in length .
The pillars are identical in size .
Our intuition about perspective influences what we see .
Three - prong fork and two sticks ?
Incongruous design elements on opposite ends of the parallel lines create confusion .
Ambiguous cubes
Without depth clues , this line drawing has two different three - dimensional interpretations .
The shade of the center dot is the same in all the squares .
The shade of the background influences how we perceive it .
All squares are uniformly shaded ,
but each square seems lighter on its left edge than on its right edge .
There are only white circles at the intersections
All the bumps are identical .
You can go from cornerto cornerby climbing the stairs or by going around a level plane .
The image in the lower right corner is upside - down , and the image to the right is rotating .
Our interpretation of bumps and indentations is conditioned by the fact that objects are generally illuminated from the top .
The rotating image may be interpreted as a wobbly elongated object viewed from the end ( like a finger pointed in your direction ) or as a ball rotating inside a washing machine viewed through the porthole .
The ambiguity is caused because we do n't have any clues to decide whether the bright portion of the image is above or below the display plane .
Three Streams .
Apparent movement of the streams is created by afterimages
as our eyes shift to examine the picture .
Blue - Green Illusion .
This image has only three colors .
What appears to be blue and green is actually the same color .
The RGB values of the colors are : orange ( 255,150,0 ) , pink ( 255,0,255 ) , blue / green ( 0,255,150 )
The altered perception is caused because the eyes combine adjacent colors .
Wavy Squares ?
No !
The background of concentric circles makes the squares appear distorted .
Rotating Wheels
The circles appear to rotate when you move your head closer and further away from the screen while looking at the dot in the center .
Our peripheral vision interprets the relative increase or decrease of the image in the retina as rotational motion of the slanted lines .
Warped Squares ?
There are no curved lines in these figures .
You can use a ruler to check it out .
The diagonal patterns created by the tiny squares distort the perception of the pictures .
Blind Spot Experiment
The retina is the part of the eye covered with receptors that respond to light .
A small portion of the retina where the optic nerve connects to the brain has no receptors .
An image that falls on this region will not be seen .
Close your right eye .
With your left eye , look at the L below .
Slowly move your head closer or further away from the screen while looking at the L .
The R will disappear when your head is approximately 50 cm ( 20 in ) from the screen .
You can repeat the experiment with your right eye by looking at the R .
Afterimage
An afterimage is a visual impression that remains in the retina after the initial stimulus is removed .
The afterimage always has colors that are complementary to those of the original image .
Look steadily at the cross in the center of the picture to see an afterimage .
Jeremy L. Hinton ca. 2005 , " Lilac Chaser "
Pinhole Experiment
Take two pieces of heavy paper .
On one of them make three holes with a pin spaced about 2 mm apart ( 1/16 inch ) from each other forming a triangle .
On the other one piece of paper , make a single hole with the pin .
Place the card with the three holes next to your eye and look through the holes at the card with one hole .
You will see three holes instead of one , and the pattern of holes will be upside down .
Stereoscopic Vision Stereoscopic vision makes depth perception possible .
By crossing your eyes while looking at these pictures , the brain perceives a combined three - dimensional image .
( Hint : Keep your eyes level with the pictures .
Place your fingertip between the pictures just below the sun and look at your fingertip while you bring your finger toward your eyes .
When your fingertip is approximately 7 inches ( 20 cm ) from your eyes , the pictures in the background will combine into a 3 - dimensional picture . )
Two - keyboard Pipe Organ
Leaning Tower of Pisa Illusion
Which of the following two images of the tower of Pisa seems to be leaning more ?
The images are actually identical , but the tower on the right seems to lean more because the human visual system treats the two images as one scene .
Our brains are conditioned to expect parallel towers to converge toward a common vanishing point , but because the tower on the right does not converge , our visual system interprets that it is leaning at a different angle .
Below is a perspective drawing with three vanishing points of what our eyes expect .
Disappearing Dots
Hold your head steady and fix your eyes on the dot in the center of the picture .
The colored dots will seem to disappear in a few seconds .
The effect is due to retinal fatigue which occurs when the afterimage of an object cancels the stimulus of the object on the retina .
The effect is most pronounced when the objects do not have well - defined edges that are detectable by small eye movements .
Josephine sitting on the bleachers
This is another example of incongruous design elements on opposite ends of parallel lines .
Deformed Circles
Design patterns make the circles appear to be distorted .
The circles above appear distorted due to the black and white designs which are at various angles relative to the tangent of the circles .
The image below consists of circles formed from alternating black and white squares angled at 15 degrees relative to the tangent of the circles .
The circles appear to form helical patterns because the squares in each of the adjacent concentric circles incline in opposite directions .
Checkerboard with shadow
The squares labeled A and B are the same shade of gray .
This can be verified by joining the squares marked A and B with two vertical stripes of the same shade of gray .
The illusion that B is lighter than A is caused by the relative contrast of the surrounding dark squares and by the fact that our vision compensates for the shadow of the cylinder .
Created by Edward H. Adelson , Professor of Vision Science at MIT .
Illusory Contours
Although there are only circles with sections taken out of them , our eyes strive to see triangles .
The sides of the triangles may appear curved when the angles of the sections do not add up to 180 degrees .
A portion of misplaced lines can be clearly identified as forming a circle , even when there is no outline of a circle .
Our ability to reconstruct an image enables us to recognize a face even when half of the image has been blocked , including parts of the eyes , nose and mouth .
Camouflage
Animals which blend with the color and texture of their environment are more likely to survive either as prey or as predators .
Camouflaged prey have a greater chance of surviving by avoiding detection , whereas camouflaged predators can hunt more successfully if they can approach the prey without being seen .
The coloration of zebras makes them very conspicuous in the African plains , but the pattern of black and white stripes makes it very hard for predators to distinguish one individual in the middle of the herd .
Do you see eight or nine zebras ?
Ambiguous Art
In the 16th century , Giuseppe Arcimboldo became known for his portraits of human heads made entirely of fruits , vegetables and flowers .
Some of his paintings of bowls of vegetables had to be inverted in order to see the bowl become a hat for the human head .
This whimsical art form is still popular today .
The following drawing of a frog turns into the head of a horse when the image is rotated .
Place the cursor on the images to see the alternate interpretations .
Cube or Corner ?
The figure in the top can be interpreted as a cube or as a corner .
The darker shading of the bottom section reinforces the interpretation of a cube illuminated from the top .
The figures below it add some elements that help us to disambiguate .
Shifting gears
Afterimages of complementary colors create apparent movement in our peripheral vision
as our eyes shift across the page .

Silhouette
Rotating Silhouette Pirouette
Color Vision Test
Silhouettes may have ambiguous interpretations .
In this example , the silhouette of the lady may be interpreted as a front view or as a back view .
On what leg is the dancer standing ?
The direction of rotation of silhouettes may be ambiguous .
This dancer created by Nobuyuki Kayahara stands on her left leg when she appears to be rotating clockwise , but on her right leg when she appears to rotate counter - clockwise .
People with normal color vision can perceive numbers formed by patterns of colored dots in every circle .
If you do not see some of the numbers , you should have your eyes checked and consider working in a job where color discrimination is not critical .
Approximately 6 % - 8 % of people of European descent , 4 % - 6 % of people of Asian descent , and 2 % - 4 % of people of African descent have some type of defective color vision .

As an experiment , look at these circles with blue - red 3D glasses , first with one eye , and then with the other .
Some of the numbers will not be visible !
Also , use the glasses to look at the word color test below and explain the results .
Word Color Test
In this test DO NOT READ the words , say aloud the COLOR of each word .
YELLOW BLUE ORANGE
BLACK RED GREEN
PURPLE YELLOW RED
ORANGE GREEN BLACK
BLUE RED PURPLE
GREEN BLUE ORANGE
This is a type of psycholinguistic test that poses some difficulty because the portion of the brain that handles language has the conflicting tasks of verbalizing the color of the written words while ignoring the meaning of words representing colors .
Amsler Grid
Dr. Marc Amsler developed the use of a grid of horizontal and vertical lines to monitor a person 's central visual field .
The test is performed by first covering one eye and looking at the center dot .
The test is repeated by covering the other eye .
Any distortions , wavy lines , blurred areas or blank spots may be an indication of macular degenertion .
Hypnotic eyes ← Pikachu
On December 16 , 1997 hundreds of Japanese children suffered seizures and convulsions following their viewing of a " Pocket Monsters " cartoon on television .
Most children said they felt sick and had vision problems during a scene where the entire background was flashing red and blue .
Additional children ended up in the hospital after the cartoon segment was replayed in the evening news .
Neurologists believe that the children suffered photosensitive epilepsy induced by the flashing .
Abnormal EEG can be triggered by flickering lights in a small percentage of persons when the flickering frequency is 5 - 10 hertz for children and 15 - 20 hertz for older people .
Excessive TV watching can damage a child 's development and education .
Warning :
Do not place your mouse cursor here if you are subject to seizures .

Moiré Patterns
Moiré patterns are formed when two grids or line drawings are superimposed .
The intersections of the lines create new patterns not present in the originals .
This figure is created by overlapping two drawings consisting of lines radiating from a point .
The interference pattern creates circles that cross both points .
The Mysterious Square
The colored pieces of this puzzle can be rearranged to form two " 13 by 5 right triangles " that have different surface areas .
This is a visual paradox that can be explained mathematically .
The Great Wall
Humpty Dumpty is about to take a great fall because he just found out that the two red lines are equal in length .
Take a ruler and connect the tops or bottoms of the red lines .
The brain interprets the converging lines as providing perspective .
This interpretation is so powerful that it is virtually impossible to overcome its influence .
Fraunhofer diffraction
Fraunhofer diffraction is a type of optical wave diffraction that occurs when field waves are passed through an aperture or slit , causing the size of an observed aperture image to change due to the far - field location of observation .
This image shows how the slits of vertical blinds in a window bend the rays of the sun and influence the shapes of the shadows projected on the wall .
As the ears approach the shadows of the vertical blinds , the shadow of the ears stretches toward the shadow of the vertical blind to produce elongated ear shadows .
The shadow of the head seems to grow horns at the points where the shadows of the blinds intersect the head .
Sneaky People
These people are shifting places trying to hide .
Sometimes you can count 13 people and sometimes 12 .
Who is missing when the count is 12 ?

Special Effects
Subliminal Effects
A subliminal effect is a sensory stimulus that is beneath the threshold of consciousness which causes us to respond instinctively in some way .
Subliminal effects are exploited in horror films that use creepy music which builds up gradually to maximize the effect of an unexpected visual surprise , e.g. , Jaws ( 1975 ) , Psycho ( 1960 ) .
Marketing campaigns sometimes use subliminal visual effects that tantalize or excite us to counteract negative attitudes about a product or to increase the appeal of a product .

Data Recovery : What is Data Recovery ?
Data Recovery : What is Data Recovery ?
Definition : Data recovery is the salvaging of data originally stored on media such as magnetic disks and tapes and which has become corrupt or inaccessible .
Data is stored on media like hard disks , RAID configurations of hard disks , magnetic disks , tapes , CDs , DVDs , floppy disks and other storage media .
Data gets damaged or missing in a variety of ways from virus attacks to improper storage of the media to accidents like floods .
It could also have simply just been erased .
Very often a large percentage of this data can be recovered using a variety of techniques .
Recovering or salvaging the data from such media can sometimes be performed using simple hardware or software but may occasionally require the assistance of data recovery specialists .
Some examples of data recovery :
- With optical drives there are options to repair the small nicks and scratches on the underside of your CD / DVD .
Some consumer level repair products are available from your local PC shop .
They often involve a two stage process of filling the nicks and then sealing the surface .
Done correctly this will sometimes allow reading of data that was previously inaccessible .
- With hard disks the fault could be either mechanical / physical or logical .
If the motor or PCB ( Printer Circuit Board ) of the hard disk is damaged but the platters themselves ( where the data is stored ) are intact then the motor / PCB could be replaced with another one .
If the mechanics are undamaged but the data has been deleted / written over or the " index " of the files has been damaged a Hex Editor will facilitate the viewing of the drive in absolute sector mode i.e. one sector of 512 bytes at a time .
The first sector of your hard drive is used as a partition block providing information on disk size / partitions / file system etc .
And , from there , markers to the previous " location " of your data can be found .
Note : Both of these are jobs best left to people who specialise in data recovery .
- With errors in RAID configurations e.g. , RAID 0 where data is striped ( split ) over two different physical drives it is possible to recreate the RAID array and or recover the data from each drive separately and " merge " them back to their original state .
( See RAID data recovery )
Can erased data be recovered ?
Yes , usually .
When you delete a file the file is not actually deleted .
It 's just the entry in the index pointing to the file 's actual location that is deleted .
The file itself is left untouched but subsequent work you do on the PC could overwrite the location where the file was so it 's important to minimise any amateur attempts at data recovery .
How can I completely erase a hard disk ?
You can't .
Any data you 've deleted can probably be recovered later .
Formatting does n't remove the data beyond recovery .
Neither does low - level formatting or " shredding " .
Even when every single byte of information on your drive has been written over a lot can still be recovered by extra sensitive recovery systems in use by the local plod ( well , maybe not him but his peers in their hi-tech departments ) .
But , always seek assistance at the earliest signs of trouble rather than relying on the assumption that everything can be recovered .
Prevention
Prevention is , of course , better than finding a cure .
Have a disaster recovery plan , do frequent backups .
Keep your backups in a different location .
Test that your backups work and can restore your systems to a fully working condition .
What you can do wrong :
1 . When you think you have experienced some data loss STOP .
Make a note of the last things you did including what software was last installed on the PC , the last application you ran , the last upgrade you did etc .
It would be useful to the data recovery team .
DO NOT attempt to make changes to your data / your drive .
2. DON'T open the drive to see if you can " repair " it .
These drives are usually worked on in environments stricter than a hospital operation theatre .
The smallest spec of dust getting into the drive could render it useless .
3 . Spend some time to research a good data recovery firm .
Just as with any other industry there are some cowboys around .
4 . If you have a desperate need to work on whatever other data you still have on the drive you could make a mirror ( depending on the circumstances ) .
But DON'T work on the original drive .
5 . Treat the drive with kids gloves .
Pack it and double pack it even more than you would a new born baby ( if you ever pack new born babies ) .
Hard disks are sensitive to shock .
A faulty one is several times more sensitive to the smallest knock .
Free Data Recovery Software
Some data recovery software is freeware i.e. , you do not need to pay for it .
Much of the rest of the industry offers free trials but with limited program functionality ( other functions are unlocked on payment of a fee ) .
Whatever the software , though , a potent point to remember is that when you download the program it is best saved on a disk other than the one you hope to recover data from or you could be permanently erasing otherwise recoverable data .
Why you should pay an annual credit - card fee In a Senate hearing targeting credit card practices , one consumer advocate suggests an annual fee might lighten the load on those who pay high penalties .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In most instances today , it would be silly to pay an annual fee for a credit card simply because most cards do n't have them anymore .
But in a Senate Banking Committee hearing examining credit card practices this week , one consumer advocate suggested those who pay their balances in full every month ( about half of all cardholders ) should pay a small annual fee to credit card companies .
Credit Card Rates
Find the best credit card for you among thousands of issuing banks .
Select a card type from the pulldown menu and click on the arrow to begin .
Select a card type Standard Gold Platinum
Why ?
To pay their fair share .
Say you charge $ 1,000 at the beginning of every billing period and pay it off in full by its due date a month or so later .
That 's essentially an interest - free loan from the credit card company to you .
The affectionate term of art for those of us who do this is " deadbeat " because we 're not that profitable for the credit card companies .
Sure , issuers make money off of you through fees paid by merchants whenever you charge a purchase .
And you 're deemed a " valued customer " because you make an issuer 's portfolio look better when they show it to the securities markets .
But let 's face it , such model behavior on your part is n't going to plow record profits into an issuer 's pockets .
Credit card fees charge higher A recent report from the Government Accountability Office estimated that about 70 percent of the credit card industry 's revenue comes from interest and penalty rates , with penalty rates accounting for a growing portion .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , meanwhile , noted that for 2006 , banks are expected to collect a record $ 17.1 billion in credit card penalty fees , up 15.5 percent from 2004 and up 906 percent from the $ 1.7 billion it collected in 1996 .
When it comes to the bottom line for issuers :
Bad is good .
Those who carry balances on which they pay interest and fees are subsidizing cardholders with no revolving balance who may even be in rewards programs , said lawyer Michael Donavan of Philadelphia - based Donavan and Searles .
He represents those who have unwittingly fallen into many of the sandtrap fees and penalties embedded in hard - to - understand credit card agreements .
Restoring small annual fees on cards used by " non-revolvers " would bolster revenues for card issuers , who then in turn might not make life so expensive for those with revolving balances .
See why being good can be bad for your credit score A lot of time at the Senate hearing , which included witness testimony from representatives of three credit card issuers -- JP Morgan Chase , Capitol One and Barclays -- was spent discussing ( and agreeing about ) the need to improve the disclosure of the terms of the credit card agreement -- to make it more straightforward and easier to understand .
But , Donovan testified , " it 's not a question of financial literacy and never will be . "
The problem as he sees is it is the ability of credit card issuers to change the terms of the agreement with just 15 days ' notice .
" The credit card is one of the only contracts in common law anywhere in which the superior bargaining entity can change its terms at anytime for any reason , " Donavan said .
" If they can change the contract on an existing balance , then they will always have an unfair advantage . "
His suggestion : Issue cards with shorter expiration periods .
So , instead of five years , make it one , he said .
When the card comes up for renewal , then the issuer would be free to change its terms .
Other consumer advocates at the hearing testified that consumers deserve more than just better disclosure .
They called for the prohibition of what they classify as deceptive and abusive practices .
Harvard professor and bankruptcy expert Elizabeth Warren , who considers some credit card pricing practices " the tricks and traps that keep [ card customers with balances ] on the financial ropes , " said thanks to safety standards , " no one has to be an engineer to buy a toaster .
No one has to be a crash test expert to buy a car .
It 's time for safety regulations in credit card products as well . "
Among the practices she and others at the hearing said they 'd like banished : Universal default pricing :
With this policy even if you have a sterling payment record on your card account , your issuer may jack up your rate if you 're late on bills on other accounts or if your credit score falls .
The number of issuers with this policy has gone down recently .

Double - cycle billing :
If you charge $ 1,000 one month , and pay off $ 900 , a bank may charge you interest on the full $ 1,000 in the next month and beyond until the remaining $ 100 is paid off .
Carter Franke , executive vice president of marketing at JP Morgan Chase , said that due to customer confusion , the bank decided very recently to end its practice of double - cycle billing .
She did say , however she did n't feel it was an unfair practice , likening it to a bank loan , where you start paying interest immediately on the full amount , not just a portion of the principal .

Zero-tolerance late payment policies : Tamara Draut , director of economic opportunity programs at Demos , noted that customers who may be a day late or even an hour late in their payment are often hit with the same $ 35 late fee as customers who might be three months ' late .
Being subject to a couple of late fees may also result in a penalty rate imposed on your account , which can top 30 percent .
And that punitive rate may then be applied not only to future purchases but to an existing balance as well , effectively boosting the cost of the cardholders ' past purchases .
Sen .
Dodd noted that Thursday 's hearing would be the first of several to examine credit card practices .
It 's not clear whether any legislation would result from the effort or whether lawmakers and the credit card industry might try to come to an agreement on best practices .
But Dodd did issue a warning to credit card companies during the hearing : " If you currently engage in any business practice that you would be ashamed to discuss before this Committee , I would strongly encourage you to cease and desist that practice .
Irrespective of the current legality of such practices , you should take a long , hard look at how you treat your customers . "

BETHESDA , Md.--Scientists at Harvard University have identified key compounds that stimulate stem cell growth in the brain , which may one day lead to restored function for people affected by Parkinson 's disease , strokes , multiple sclerosis , and a wide range of neurological disorders .
These findings , which appear in the September 2006 issue of The FASEB Journal , provide important clues as to which compounds may be responsible for causing key brain cells , neurons , to regenerate and ultimately restore brain function .
The research study focused on two compounds -- LTB4 and LXA4 .
Both play a role in inflammation and are regulators of proliferation of several cell types .
When stem cells isolated from the brains of mouse embryos were exposed to LTB4 they proliferated and differentiated , giving rise to additional stem cells and to differentiated neurons with limited or absent capacity to divide .
When exposed to LXA4 , these cells experienced decreased growth and apoptosis .
" This study opens doors to new therapeutic approaches for a wide range neurological disorders and injuries that were once considered incurable , " said Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
The study also provided so insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved when LTB4 stimulates neuronal stem cells .
According to the study , cells generated as the result of LTB4 exposure had high levels of LTB4 receptors , whereas the level of LTB4 receptors was considerably lower in similar cells not generated by LTB4 stimulation .
The investigators were further able to show that LTB4 up - regulated several molecules involved in cell cycling and growth , such as cyclins and epidermal growth factor receptor , and decreased those such as caspase 8 which play a role in apoptosis .
LXA4 had the opposite effects .

Darjeeling 's Land Rovers have stood the test of time despite old - age and overloading
Enlarge Image
The north - eastern Indian hill area of Darjeeling is renowned throughout the world for the quality of its tea .
But now Darjeeling is being noted for the quality of another of its enduring assets : a collection of Land Rovers driven by locals for the last 50 years .
Many of the vehicles have been used and abused for the last half - century without locals being aware of their value in the West .
Experts say that some used as taxis could be worth in excess of $ 38,000 .
Taxis
" Darjeeling is a Land Rover lover 's dream , " says expert Les Roberts .
" Some of the long - wheel base models being driven around the streets of the town are series one vehicles manufactured in the UK in between 1956 and 1958 .
" Only around 100 or so exist in Britain , and only around 500 worldwide .
Of these only a few are in working order , which is why they would be worth so much money in the West . "
We did not realise our Land Rovers may well be valuable collectors ' items
Darjeeling Land Rover driver Suman Gorkha
Yet it seems the owners of the Darjeeling Land Rovers may be unaware just how valuable their vehicles may be .
" We use them as taxis to earn a living , " said driver Suman Gorkha .
" Obviously we keep them well - maintained because they provide us with a living , but it has never occurred to us that outside of Darjeeling they could be worth a lot of money . "
Experts say that the vehicles were exported to Darjeeling throughout the late 1950s .
Mr Roberts - who writes for Land Rover Monthly - says that they are not seen much in India apart from the hilly areas of the north - east .
' Consumer society '
Old foreign vehicles are a rare sight in India because of import restrictions imposed by successive governments in the years following independence .
Land Rovers were allowed to be imported because they were classified as commercial vehicles rather than cars .
The series one long wheel base vehicle is a rare sight today
Mr Roberts says that the explanation for their longevity is because they are well maintained by capable local mechanics .
Many have new engines and some have been specially adapted to take fuels other than diesel and petrol .
" In India the consumer society culture is not so strong , so the vehicles are not discarded as soon as they break down as perhaps they would have been in the West , " he said .
" Another important factor is the lack of road salt and agricultural chemicals which damages the bodywork of so many of the vehicles in the West .
" It is often said that 75 % of Land Rovers manufactured are still on the road , " Mr Roberts said .
" In India they are kept going by a combination of knife and fork mechanics using Land Rover spare parts - or pattern parts - which are copied and are therefore far cheaper .
" There is no reason why these vehicles can not go on for ever . "
‘ Impossible . ’
Thus spake Martin Amis at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in October : ‘ Very few writers have got anywhere with sex . ’
Nominees for the Bad Sex in Fiction Award seem to have viewed this long history of failure more as a challenge than an admonition .
Andrew Motion , chairman this year of the equally prestigious Man Booker Prize , was disappointed by the lack of action in the novels submitted to him and remarked that ‘ the Bad Sex Prize has probably put a lot of people off ’ .
The award was founded in 1993 to discourage poorly written , tasteless and extraneous descriptions of sex in the literary novel ( erotic and pornographic fiction does not qualify ) .
Judging by the rickety piles in Literary Review ’s offices , many still require deterring .
Tony Blair ’s memoir A Journey , though not technically eligible as non-fiction , was this year ’s early frontrunner .
‘ I needed that love Cherie gave me , selfishly .
I devoured it to give me strength .
I was an animal following my instinct , ’ Blair wrote of things that went bump on the night that John Smith died .
The passage is certainly crude ( one of the award ’s criteria ) , not least in its projection of voracious masculinity – perhaps to counter all those poodle jibes .
Blair was ultimately squeezed off the shortlist by his sometime praetorian guardsman Alastair Campbell .
Campbell has previous : his debut novel , All in the Mind , was nominated for the award in 2008 .
This year saw the publication of Maya , a tale of ‘ one of the world ’s biggest movie stars ’ who , in the climactic scene , offers herself to a childhood friend :
Her pleasure was now my sole ambition .
She brought her mouth back to mine , then tugged on my shoulder , and I was lying on top of her , the outside of my thighs touching the inside of hers .
I felt her calves on mine as she locked her legs around me , our tongues danced around each other once more , and she was wriggling beneath me , her hands on my hips , then she was pulling me towards her , directing me to everything I had ever hoped for .
I thought the walls were going to fall down as we stroked and screamed our way through hours of pleasure to the union for which my whole life had been a preparation .
The class of 2010 also contains a number of multiple offenders .
Craig Raine , Christos Tsiolkas , Rowan Somerville and Annabel Lyon were all nominated for more than one passage .
Raine offered up limp humour ( ‘ she kissed his half - cocked cock ’ ) , bizarre metaphor ( ‘ Francesca ’s fanny was a glorious irrepressible Afro pompon ’ ; ‘ the arsehole ’s café au lait .
Its spicy Lebkuchen taste’ ) as well as the queasy sensation that he himself was not entirely ungratified :
Steph was a trembling temple slave , kissing the icons in their filthy corners , getting smacked for her trouble .
She was literally the underling .
But Assia had no real interest in being the dominatrix .
She felt miscast and envious of Steph .
She might prefer to be degraded , subservient herself .
How could she tell ?
Steph had taken the part .
‘ Smack me .
Smack me .
I ’m dirty . ’
An overly flamboyant imagination is often at the root of bad sex writing .
But in the case of Christos Tsiolkas ’s The Slap ( also longlisted for the Booker Prize ) , it was repetitiveness that caught the attention of the judges : ‘ His lips closed over a stiffening , obliging nipple , then he was sucking it , biting it , till Aisha let out a small whimper of pain and reluctantly he stopped ’ ;
‘ He pulled at her nipple , twisting it till she slapped his hand away . ’
Cocks are predictably salty ; desire is a ‘ ravenous animal ’ ( sound familiar ? ) .
The following is indicative of the carelessness of both Tsiolkas ’s prose and his metaphysics :
They fucked for ages .
When he came he could not help crowing out his rapture and Aisha , laughing , placed her hand across his mouth .
He left his softening cock inside her , thrusting gently , whispering he loved her , whispering her name .
He heard her gasp , then she was kissing him hard , almost biting his lip .
His eyes were still closed , he wanted to stay inside her .
He had banished all thoughts of Connie – now that he had come .
Not before , he could n’t before .
He had merged them in the fantasy of his exertions , fucking his wife , fucking the girl , all at the same time , their bodies , their c**ts , their skins both one and distinct for him .
Rowan Somerville ’s The Shape of Her recounts at length the couplings of two twenty - somethings while summering on a Greek island .
There is an uneasy marriage of exhaustive mechanical detail and stretched , often unnecessary simile :
He caught her rhythm , pulling and releasing , cradling and crushing ; pushing up through his fingers with each swing , mining up , like an otter through wet sand .
Her sounds shifted from moans to grunts , insistent , almost desperate cries from the throat .
[…]
He rested his hands on her hips and paused , turning her to him , kissing and climbing his hands up her back , drawing her to his torso and squeezing until he could feel the light give of her ribs .
He covered her mouth with his and she sucked at him , the smell of him filling her .
He unbuttoned the front of her shirt and pulled it to the side so that her breast was uncovered , her nipple poking out , upturned like the nose of the loveliest nocturnal animal , sniffing in the night .
He took it between his lips and sucked the salt from her .
He hooked his fingers into her waistband , caught the elastic of her underwear and began pulling down .
The knot on her light cotton trousers held fast as the fabric reached the curve of her backside .
She twisted from him and stepped back .
‘ I want to suck you , ’ [ … ]
She loosed his trousers , pulled away his underwear and gripped him with fingers tender enough to hold a tiny bird .
As he felt her mouth ’s engulfment , he acquiesced , disappointment melting like ice in hot cream .
The judges lost the thread at this point : ‘ Like a lepidopterist mounting a tough - skinned insect with a too blunt pin he screwed himself into her . ’
Jonathan Franzen ’s Freedom , acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic , was nominated for a tenderly rendered phone sex scene marred by a predilection for innuendo : ‘ let him go ’ , ‘he was gripped ’ and ‘ sucked into ’ were all , furiously winking , deployed straightforwardly .
And the culmination not so much baffling as ludicrous :
One afternoon , as Connie described it , her excited clitoris grew to be eight inches long , a protruding pencil of tenderness with which she gently parted the lips of his penis and drove herself down to the base of its shaft .
Another day , at her urging , Joey described to her the sleek warm neatness of her turds as they slid from her anus and fell into his open mouth , where , since these were only words , they tasted like excellent dark chocolate .
Perhaps youthful exuberance led to the nomination of the three debut novelists who round off the list .
Annabel Lyon ’s excellent novelisation of the life of Aristotle , The Golden Mean , showed us the philosopher instructing his wife ‘ harder … like grinding meal ’ and coming ‘ like a monster ’ .
Neel Mukherjee ’s A Life Apart includes , alongside an instructive disquisition on the art of cottaging , this cramped encounter in a car :
He starts to moan , ‘ Oh , yeah … oh yeah … come on then , come , come , shoot your load … ’ the movement of his hand becoming more and more furious .
There seems to be a restless animal in his devouring eyes .
Ritwik finds his exaggerated porn - speak so ridiculous that he has to make an effort to subdue the laughter bubbling up from inside , it ’s in his throat now , it has to be pushed down down , no he ca n’t let it come out , ca n’t come out as he comes all over himself , the little opal pools pearlescent on his dark skin even in the darkness inside and around .
Are they opals ?
Are they pearls ?
Does it matter ?
Finally Mr Peanut by Adam Ross made the rookie error of trying far too hard .
He buried his face into Hannah ’s c**t like a wanderer who ’d found water in the desert .
She tasted like a hot biscuit flavoured with pee .
She grabbed his scruff and pulled his face to hers .
They kissed , and she took his cock – it felt as thick as a Louisville Slugger – and guided him in .
When he exploded – and he exploded quickly – he felt as if his heart had liquefied and then been shot out of him up through her vagina and uterus and her ovaries and up over her diaphragm and somehow down the vena cavity to her heart , his own now coating hers .
Sometimes you should just say it with flowers .
Movies projected digitally are bright , and blemish - free .
Yet they feel … odd .
Digital projection supplies a different experience than
photochemistry - based projection .
The image is clear — eeriely so .
But
it ’s also less dense , less nuanced , and far less sensual than a
good - quality traditional film image .
Digital projection seems to suit
thwacky - slammy pictures just fine .
Action - adventure pix ,
computer - animated films , blockbusters , and dumbo comedies should do
fine projected digitally .
But quieter films , and especially films that
deal in mood , poetry , and tactility — movies like " Swimming Pool "
and " Last Tango in Paris " — would lose a lot .
As far as I ’ve been able
to tell , movies projected digitally do n’t feel like what they ’re sold
as : movies perfected .
They feel like ultrabigscreen TV .
It seems to me that running library code in an iframe is the way forward .
You can create global properties and functions and extend the built - in objects , all without affecting code in the main browser window .
Libraries and user scripts clashing with each other might be a thing of the past .
If we want to create iterable arrays we use the Array2 constructor instead of the Array constructor :
We can now extend Array2 without affecting our core Array object :
We now have a clean copy of the core Array object ( called Array2 ) but it is not the same object as the one defined in our environment !
Every JavaScript environment ( i.e. a browser window or iframe ) has its own copy of the core JavaScript objects and classes .
What if we “ borrow ” one of those objects ?
Most library authors would love to extend the Array object ( especially for those tasty iteration methods ) but shy away from doing so for fear of breaking other scripts .
So nearly all ( with the noteable exception of Prototype ) leave Array and other built - in objects alone .
Ultimately we are left with only two choices :
Well , there is one problemo .
Quite a big problemo in fact .
You see , every developer ’s favourite browser ( Internet Explorer ) , refuses to maintain the length property of a subclass created like this .
I mean point blank refuses :
It seems easy does n’t it ?
Just do this :

It ’s going to sod up people who think that they know how many frames there are on their page because they designed the page , though .
It might be worth removing the created frame from the frames array .
Looks to me like you can assign to the frames array ’s length after you ’ve created it , so you can steal its objects and then remove it from the array .
In fact , you can even assign null to frames [ frames.length - 1 ] and it still works .
So the iframe maybe only needs to exist for long enough for you to steal its objects , and then it can be destroyed , which means that it does n’t hang around to pollute the page …
Comment : # 2 @sil – I tried removing the iframe but the code choked .
I think that the host environment still has to exist for the constructors to work .
Maybe just removing it from the array as you suggest is the solution ?
Not that I think this is a very big problem compared to namespace and prototype pollution .
Comment : # 4 Wow , that ’s ingenious .
I wonder if there are any performance / memory leak implications .
Really smart and useful trick .
Comment : # 5 I wonder if there are any performance / memory leak implications ?
Maybe .
I ’ve only just started experimenting with running code in iframe s. I was trying to solve a real - world problem with sandboxing JavaScript .
After messing with iframe s for a bit , a dozen light bulbs went off in my head .
Comment : # 6 Oh , this is totally brilliant !
Have you tried it across a range of browsers and OSes yet to probe its portability yet ?
You know , this ought to work both ways — similarly , code run inside that frame should be similaryly protected from Prototype poisoning .
A big hug to you , Dean ! ^_^
Here I used to think all the OO magic of javascript came wrapped in one perverted form of the function object or another , and then you go showing off there ’s one hidden in the cooling shadow of a frame .
Amusingly beautiful !
Comment : # 7 Good stuff .
There ’s one leak I know of with iframes , read about it ( warning : shameless plug ! ) at novemberborn.net/javascript/edgvl .
I ’ve heard this specific leak was fixed in IE7 , but I have n’t verified this myself .
P.S. If you leave an http colon slash slash inside a real HTML link , the preview will convert it to invalid XHTML .
Comment : # 9 Love it .
Looks like you can also remove the iframe after you ’ve made the Array2 copy and still be able to use Array2 afterwards .
Associative arrays and for .. in — here I come .
Comment : # 10 Excellent , an associative array not considered harmful : window.onload = function ( ) { Object.prototype.ignore = " Dictionary should ignore this " ; Function.prototype.ignore = " Dictionary should ignore this " ; var iframe = document.createElement ( " iframe " ) ; //iframe.style.display = " none " ; //safari does n't seem to know about frames with a display : none iframe .
height = 0 ; iframe .
width = 0 ; iframe .
border = 0 ; document.body.appendChild(iframe ) ; window.frames[window.frames.length-1].document.write ( " [ script ] parent .
AArray = function ( ) {return this} ;[\/ script ] " ) ; document.body.removeChild( iframe ) ; aa = new AArray ( ) ; Object.prototype.ignore2 = " Dictionary should ignore this too " ; Function.prototype.ignore2 =
" Dictionary should ignore this too " ; Array.prototype.each = function ( iterator ) { // iterate } ; aa.thing = " 1 " ; aa.nextThing = " 2 " ; for ( i in aa ) alert ( " aa property : " +i ) ; obj = {} ; for ( i in obj ) alert ( " obj property : " +i ) ; arr = [ ] ; for ( i in arr ) alert ( " arr property : " +i ) ; } ( You ’ll need to adjust the square brackets around the script tags I had to use to post this comment )
Comment : # 11 How To Subclass
The JavaScript Array Object Dean Edwards shows an incredibly clever hack for subclassing the Array object in Javascript .
Comment : # 13
This is very interesting .
Until now I had been using nested closures ( quite irresponsibly ) for my library to keep it encapsulated :- I.e. in very simple terms :- function MyLibrary ( ) { function closure ( source ) { eval ( source ) ; } this .import = closure ; } MyLibrary .import ( " source code for a module " )
Your iframe suggestion effectively does this through a separate window .
Have you tested it for performance ?
Comment : # 14
One other thing with this :- parent .
Array2 = Array ; if you are implementing your suggestions using a “ .hta ” file , then one needs to rember to do the following in IE :- iframe .application = " yes " ; to enable the iframe to access its parent .
Comment : # 16 alert( list2.constructor==Array2 ) ; // => Safari false ; Firefox true alert ( list2.constructor==Array ) ; // =>
Safari false ; Firefox true Tricky business …
Comment : # 17 @Doekman – it ’s true I never tested on Safari .
I hope that we can hack around it because this is kind of important to library authors .
Comment : # 18 I ’d be interested in a different approach : using an iframe as an “ intrinsic ” namespace ( similar to what ’s being implemented in JS2 ) .
It ’d be useful to have a “ clean slate ” at your disposal whenever you need it .
Comment : # 19 @ Dean : to generically determine the object - type , I used “ object - sniffing ” ( from a real world used library , see URL ) : function Function_getName ( o ) { var a=o .toString ( ) .match(/ function\s *([a- zA - Z$ _ ] [ a - zA - Z0 - 9$ _ ] * ) ?\(/ ) ; if ( a&&typeof a [ 1 ] =='string '&&a [ 1 ] !='') return a [ 1 ] ; // Method inspection for Safari ( with inter - frame javascript the following problems occur : // ( Date.constructor!=parent.Date.constructor ) // ( new Date ( ) instanceOf parent .
Date==false ) // and Safari returns the string " ( Internal Function ) " for all internal functions if ( o.prototype.toGMTString ) return ' Date ' ; if (o.prototype.splice ) return ' Array ' ; if(o.prototype.compile ) return ' RegExp ' ; if(o.prototype.arguments ) return ' Function ' ; return null ; // anonymous function }
But maybe it ’s better to test each constructor in all frames available .
Ie : for ( subframe in all_frames ) { if(o.constructor==subframe.Date ) ...

Comment : # 22
In order to use this , do n’t you need to wait until onload to append the new iframe ?
That means your new Array2 wo n’t be available to any included libraries until the page is loaded , and any libraries wanting to use this approach all have to wait until page load to initialize .
Is n’t this a problem ?

Comment : # 28 Instead of an iframe , how about experimenting with IE ’s XML data islands or with the Document object that is returned with XMLHttpRequest.responseXML.ownerDocument.parentWindow , which may or may not ( I do n’t know ) return a Window object that is separate from the current one .
Comment : # 29 Andrea , the declaration of the Array2 variable is always executed before the code in a popup window .
Maybe it ’s by design .
However , I think it ’s more intuitive to put it before the call to createPopup ( ) because it ’s a bad practice to depend on any implementation specific behaviors .
Comment : # 30 I am interested in finding a way to add methods to the XML Element objects returned by XMLHTTPRequest .
I ’m working on the OpenLaszlo runtime ( www.openlaszlo.org), our data model is a superset of the DOM API , we have some additional methods which our data nodes support .
For IE we are forced to deep copy the entire DOM tree for a data set into a tree of our own data nodes , whereas in Firefox we can just add the new methods to the native XML node class prototype .
Comment : # 31 Clever idea !
However , it appears to me a little bit of waste .

Comment : # 33
Interesting observation but to me this seems like a lot of potentially buggy hackery for some sugar you want but do not need .
In order to get the sugar , reduce your for loops by a couple characters and also decrease performance , how much code will you need to hack around the browser bugs ?
When a new browser is released and the code breaks then what ?
Were n’t we all happy when we could stop using iframes and could start using XMLHttpRequest objects ?
Comment : # 34 you can also use new ActiveXObject ( ” htmlfile ” ) ; in IE instead of an iframe ( I know the popup method has been discuss for IE too ) .
A link discussing the ActiveXObject ( “ htmlfile ” ) can be found here : http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=538
Comment : # 35 Peter , there are many useful things that can be done with IFRAMES , they where not meant to transport data , but I see you already have come to know they are good also for this …
@ Dean , you are on the right lane , this is a good use of IFRAMES , I would add that they were meant for it …
They provide a level of abstraction while beeing child of the same window , they are new native ‘ scope ’ ( that may be extended or not ) .
I repeat myself once more , Web Applications need IFRAMES … and this method adds another reason to use them , also a bit naif it ’s better than loosing native Javascript funcionality forever .

Dean Edwards : How To Subclass
The JavaScript Array Object ( tags : javascript prototype programming ) [… ]
Comment : # 37 Dean ,
I can actually SCOPE different API this way without one affecting the other and using both of them in the same page / document .
I have seen on jQuery docs that some tricks and modifications are needed to load jQuery and Prototype at the same time .
I have them both running , and I tested adding Mootools also …
I still have n’t setup any text for it , but you may view the sources in the JsCOPE example .
Unfortunately all these API where not designed to work this way …
I should fiddle and adjust some ‘ top ’ , ‘ self ’ and ‘ parent ’ references to window and document here and there … but most of it works … I tested it live with JShell bookmarklet .
I do n’t think this will be practical for everyday use , but just in case some developer whish to have a peek at it I will post some more examples and documentation as soon as I find more time …
Tested in Mozilla / Firefox and IE , should work on Safari and Konqueror if the API are supported but only minor tests has been done on these browsers .
Please report .
Comment : # 38 I may be missing the point , but why not just do something like this ?
function XAArray ( ) { var a = [ ] ; a.constructor = XAArray ; for ( var i in XAArray.prototype ) { if ( ! Object.prototype[i ] ) { a [ i ] = XAArray.prototype[i ] ; } } return a ; } XAArray.prototype.newMethod = function ( ) { alert ( '!' ) ; } var myArray = new XAArray ( ) ; myArray.newMethod ( ) ;
It seems to me a much more straightforward solution .
Of course , you ’d probably want to make sure that arguments passed to the XAArray constructor were passed on to the “ a ” array .
Comment : # 39 Actually length==0 is not the only problem in IE .
The push method does n’t work either so x=new Array2 ( ) ;x.push ( 1 ) //x[ 0 ] returns undefined in IE
And in no browser I tested in does this work : x=new Array 2 ( 1,2,3 )
But ( iframe approaches aside ) I think this will work in all browsers : // create the constructor var Array2 = function ( ) { // initialise the array var x= [ ] , a=arguments ; for ( var i=0;i< a.length ;i++) {x. push ( a [ i ] ) } ; for ( var i in this ) { x [ i ] = this [ i]} ; return x ; } ; // inherit from Array Array2.prototype = [ ] // add some sugar Array2.prototype.each = function ( iterator ) { // iterate } ;
Comment : # 40 @ Thomas / Matthew – two tips :
It is usually a good idea to read the original post before commenting .
It is always a good idea to test sample code before posting .
Comment : # 41 @ Dean :
You ’re in a happy mode this Saturday My code is tested .
You ’re post is drifting from the original subject towards iframes , I know .
However I chose to comment on the original subject .
Comment : # 42 @ Thomas / Matthew – Apologies .
Your posted code does indeed work .
I should follow my own advice and read and test things properly !
Although your posted code works it is not a true subclass and will certainly perform pretty badly .
That said , I still should have tested it before bashing it .
Sorry !
Comment : # 43 @ Dean : Apologies accepted !
“ certainly perform pretty badly ” – please elaborate : have yo observed it perform badly , sir ?
do you think it would be slower ?
eat more memory ?
slow down the upcoming iframe world domination ?
Comment : # 44 @ Thomas :
As I mentioned in an email to Dean , the drawback to the method that you and I proposed is that the methods have to be added to each Array instance at the time of instantialization .
In normal “ subclassing ” ( or prototype extension ) the methods only have to be added once ( to the prototype ) when the script is loaded .
So , like Dean implied , it ’s possible that this could add quite a bit of overhead , depending on the number of methods you ’re adding .
However , I do n’t think it ’s as bad as it sounds .
I did a quick test ( using FF and IE5.0 ) and found that creating an instance of Dean ’s Array2 is approximately twice as fast in IE5 and six times as fast in FF , when 10 methods are added .
( The more methods one adds , the greater the benefit of using Dean ’s technique . )
Of course , these numbers should be kept in context : creating 1000 XAArrays ( with ten extra methods ) still only takes ~ 187 ms .
In the end , it ’s up to the user to weigh the drawbacks and benefits of each method .
My first reaction was to agree with Linan Wang ’s comment : the solution posed here seems bigger than the problem .
However , I think using an iframe in place of a vanilla object for a namespace is a great idea that shows some real promise .
And if you ’ve already got the iframe sitting around , why not borrow its Array prototype ?
Comment : # 45 I think using an iframe in place of a vanilla object for a namespace is a great idea that shows some real promise .
Me too .
Comment : # 46 @Dean and Matthew I think using an iframe in place of a vanilla object for a namespace is a great idea that shows some real promise .
Oh to h— with false prudence , me too :-D , I proposed it in september 2006 in a comment to my article Object prototype is erlaubt … but I do n’t think anyone noticed
Thanks for taking the time to speed test a bit , Matthew !
Comment : # 47 @ Thomas –
If you create your own namespace with an iframe then Object .
prototype is indeed erlaubt .

A week ago Joe Walker posted a note on the insecurity of JSON .
I ’m using JSON for almost anything so I was shocked a bit by his findings .
Sleepless nights went by and then I thought of a counter hack so one could secure his JSON again .
I remembered a post by Dean Edwards ( yeah , the packer guy ) about subclassing Array objects .
In this article I ’ll present a way to take over the hacked Array object , and secure it again . [… ]

Comment : # 52 Just got into it myself and looked for a more “ easy ” approach .
How about the following : var Array2 = function ( ) { var temp = new Array ( ) ; temp.each = function ( ) { // iterate } return temp ; }
Comment : # 53 [… ]
Another nifty usage of the iframe ( others are fake AJAX Uploading , subclassing the Array object , … erm , is there any other ? ) : print only contents of a specified element .
I feel a Prototype rewrite coming up Spread the word ! [… ]
Comment : # 54 I ’m afraid every object created as var obj = new Array2 ( ) ; as suggests Ofir Herzas will occupy memory with the body of the method “ each ” .
There will be as many “ each ” methods as are instances of the Array2 .
With prototype property of the constructor you have the advantage that the body of the method is in memory only once and is shared by all other objects created as instances through that constructor .
Comment : # 55 @Vlado – Agreed .
Prototype methods are fastest .
Comment : # 56
If you use an iframe to transport a native constructor this will uses its prototype as expected .
What is less expected is that if you use some native prototype method that return a new instance of the native constructor ( i.e. slice ) this will be an instanceof Array , and not an instanceof Transported Array .
This means that you loose all your stuff and you have to convert each time every returned variables .
For this reason , and many others , why do not use directly an ArrayObject ?
Comment : # 57 Ooops , wrong link , I am sorry .
The page to visit has this title : Sorry Dean , I subclassed Array again Kind Regards
Comment : # 59 I see that the original article is quite old , so I do n’t know if Dean ’s opinion on using iframes as a namespace for your own library would still hold .
While this would be a perfect solution for extending the native JavaScript objects , you would have to avoid the use of ‘ window ’ and ‘ document ’ in your library code .
( Something that you would always encounter when writing a ui-library and working with iframes . )
Also type - checking and instanceof - checking will be more complex .
Comment : # 60
That is a great way to make your hacks unobtrusive .
It has always bothered me the way some libraries like jQuery / Prototype do n’t attempt to stay inside their own namespace . “ $ ” anyone ?
Comment : # 61 Does n’t work on Safari .
It probably has global constructors and not document specific ones .

Comment : # 63 Hi Dean .
Nice article .
But i have couple of question .
What ’s happen if i iterate over Array2 instance with : for .. in
The attached property and method of the Array2 is visible in loop .
Just like associative arrays and just like Array.prototype.someProperty .
What is performance of this hack ?
If i want clean copy of Array , i need to load new JavaScript machine with clean Array .
prototype and everyone else object in JavaScript .
Why the article title is “ How To Subclass The JavaScript Array Object ” ?
This is not subclass of Array Object .
This is clean copy .
If i have code like this : Array2 instanceof Array // false
This break object oriented concept .
For my more clean is static member of Array .
If i want each , i will make : Array.each
No confused for me , and my reader .
Array . each is more simple .
Only disadvantage of this technique is allocation memory for one pointer to array object in arguments of each .
With big respect !
Comment : # 64 Nevermind my last comment … just ran into the fact that this .
pop.self does not behave as expected in a multilevel hash array because it is referring to the prototype and not to the actual array .

Comment : # 67
At some point several weeks ago I started thinking about building a Collections framework for JS that would mimic the feature set that we have in Java Collections .
I started out with a class that used Arrays as storage repositories .
I then realized that I was still leaving the door open to unintended copies of this object , getting passed around even if the core data repo was reference based .
I found this tutorial and started weeks of experimentation sub-classing Array .
Heres what I found , 1 . A subclassed Array ( obj.prototype = new Array ) is many many orders of magnitude slower than obj = Array ; that stands to reason .
2 . so now I need to get Array as an assignment for the collection .
ok… sub frame to extract for all browsers .
Not Safari actually .. ok .. window to extract for all browsers .. not for FF 3.6 , ok … a combination , carving out the best method for the browser at hand .
Let me tell ya , I ’ve never had so much frustration as I did that week .
When all was said and done : 3 . An object that encapsulated the array , was just as fast as the obj=Array , and much faster than prototyping Array .
That was a bit supprising at first , not so much once you think about what happens when you call “ this ” on an object ’s prototype ( V8 engine is the exception ) .
if the user wanted array functionality for direct iteration over large data sets he / she / i could get it at obj.array .
It ’s an interesting idea , in the end though , It ’s more trouble than its worth .
That is , unless you have to have an object that has the special properties of Array .
If that ’s the case .
obj = Array ; is your best bet

Comment : # 74 @ Dean ,
consider the following : frames === window frames [ frames .
length – 1 ] is also a window object , but of a newly created frame thus your code can be simplified like this : var iframe = document.createElement ( ' iframe ' ) ; iframe.style.display = ' none ' ; document.body.appendChild( iframe ) ; var Array2 = frames [ frames.length - 1 ] .Array ; which also eliminates the need for Array2 to be a global variable

Jimmy Carter is without doubt one of the most active and influential ex-presidents in American history .
After leaving office , he established the nonprofit Carter Center , tasked with advancing human rights around the world .
Through his and the center ’s work , Carter has helped monitor more than 60 democratic elections , worked with governments in sub-Saharan Africa to develop sustainable agriculture , negotiated for peaceful conflict resolution in various countries , and worked to eradicate diseases such as Guinea worm and river blindness .
For these and other efforts , he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 .
Carter — whose presidency was highlighted by achievements in international diplomacy such as the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel , the Panama Canal treaties , and the arms - reducing SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union — is also the author of 20 books .
The most recent , Our Endangered Values : America ’s Moral Crisis , is a wide - ranging critique of how fundamentalism , both religious and political , is influencing American policy at home and abroad .
President Carter recently spoke with Mother Jones from his office at the Carter Center in Atlanta .
MotherJones :
In your book , you talk about the intersection in recent years of religious and political fundamentalism .
What is the origin of this merger ?
Jimmy Carter : I think it was in 1979 , when future fundamentalists took control of the Southern Baptist Convention , which is a very important religious and political factor in this country .
After that , the Southern Baptist Convention had almost diametrically opposite basic principles than it had previously followed , and there ’s been an evolution within the Convention toward a more and more rigid and strict creed that embodies the fundamentalist principles that I mention in the book .
Now , I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that the elementary principle of fundamentalism has existed for ages , and it obviously permeates other religions as well , such as Islam and Hinduism and others .
But this trend continued and , parallel to it , there was in effect a merger of the fundamentalist Christian leaders and the more conservative elements of the Republican Party .
And for the last 25 years or so , that merger has become more pronounced and more evident .
MJ.com :
Which of the two strains of fundamentalism do you see as leading the other ?
JC : I would n’t say leading , but both are influencing each other .
In the past , there have been two parallel premises for the separation of church and state .
One obviously is what Thomas Jefferson declared , stating that he was speaking on behalf of the other founding fathers , when he said we should build a wall between the church and state .
And in the Christian faith , we all remember that Christ said , “ Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar ’s , and unto God the things that are God’s . ”
This also indicates that there should be a clear separation .
But those premises have been publicly disavowed or challenged by Pat Robertson on the religious side , and even by the former chief justice of the Supreme Court [ William Rehnquist ] .
But nowadays , with the allocation of billions of dollars through what President Bush calls a faith - based initiative , taxpayers ’ money is distributed to churches and other religious institutions that will comply with the basic principles of the present political administration .
And there ’s no doubt that in public conventions and in individual church speeches and sermons , there ’s been a prevalent inclination to endorse candidates , primarily Republican candidates .
MJ.com :
At this point , 25 years in , do you expect this to remain a permanent situation ?
JC : In the last few months at least , I would guess , there has been a reconsideration by many American citizens that that trend was not advisable for our country .
This is indicated , at least to some degree , by public - opinion polls .
And obviously the popularity in polls of some Republican leaders has deteriorated as well .
So there ’s been a re-thinking in many ways .
I think part of it has been caused by some of the practical political decisions that were ill advised and were supported by the religious fundamentalists .
All of us Christians worship the Prince of Peace , but the fundamentalists I referred to earlier publicly supported what I consider the unjust and unnecessary invasion of Iraq .
That was one indication of a very radical departure .
The reception of public funds to go into the religious activities of a church is almost unprecedented , at least within the Baptist faith , which I share .
Other aspects are the almost complete refusal of the fundamentalist Christian leaders to condemn even the torture of prisoners and the intrusion on Americans ’ privacy and rights as protected under the U.S. Constitution .
On those kinds of issues , formerly characterized by a separate opinion on public events between the religious community and the political community , the difference has been eliminated .
MJ.com :
The definition of fundamentalism you provide in the book includes the unwillingness to cooperate or negotiate with others .
Where do you see that tendency as most dangerous at the moment ?
JC : The danger comes when those kinds of principles are applied on the international scene .
That brought about a whole gamut of things .
One , obviously , is the unprecedented preemptive war that President Bush has declared to be a policy of our country .
Another is the total abandonment , and often the derogation , of every nuclear - arms agreement that has been negotiated by previous presidents , beginning in the time of Dwight Eisenhower .
At home , it brought about the deterioration of our commitment to environmental quality .
Another [ effect ] is the enormous preference that has been given in tax laws recently to the extremely rich at the expense of working - class and poorer people .
Then there ’s the implied melding of science and religion , where even the president himself has expressed the opinion that religious beliefs should be taught in scientific classrooms .
That ’s unprecedented .
And there is a unique and special emphasis — which is a recent development too — within the religious community , an obsession with the condemnation of homosexuality .
Now , in the bible homosexuality is condemned , but along with divorce and greed and callousness toward poor people .
So its elevation to a highest priority among some religious groups has been very disturbing to me .
One point I believe is important , looking at the political side once more , is that this is not a Democratic - versus - Republican or a liberal - versus - conservative concern .
This is a departure in all those points , compared to all previous Republican presidents — compared to George Bush Sr. or Ronald Reagan , compared to Gerald Ford or Dwight Eisenhower , as well as the Democratic presidents .
It ’s a radical departure .
MJ.com :
As you know , the Bible stresses the need to help the poor , and yet the government appears to have moved away from that notion in recent years .
JC : I do n’t think there ’s any doubt about that .
And one point that is made openly by some so - called neoconservatives is that we need to drive the nation into debt – which they ’ve done grossly – to prevent future administrations from having the funding flexibility to increase government services to the poor .
Whether in the field of housing or education or health care or social services , there ’s a deliberate idea there that is quoted quite freely in some of the right - wing political periodicals .
MJ.com :
Do you think the Hurricane Katrina disaster has changed that dynamic at all ?
JC : If it is , I have n’t seen the results of it .
There has been some verbal recognition of the plight of the poor , but when you look at the total commitment and the sending out of the poorest people in the Katrina region , help has been pretty well absent .
I think this has been a scandalous thing for the Bush administration , something that has been acknowledged not just by critics like me but by the Congress itself .
The reaction of FEMA – which used to be a sterling organization – and the neglect of the poorest people suffering in New Orleans and other places has been a complete embarrassment .
MJ.com :
You mentioned the Iraq war , and you were an early critic .
Given the situation as it stands now , are you at all hopeful about the prospects for a stable democracy emerging ?
JC : Well , I ’m hopeful .
I pray that there will be a successful democratic system established in Iraq that can keep the country together and avoid further violence .
I think what we should do is get out of Iraq as quickly as possible , and this can be done in a number of ways .
I think one of the best ways would be for us to surreptitiously ask the new leaders of Iraq to publicly request that the U.S. troops withdraw .
Then , instead of taking the initiative and saying we have failed in Iraq , we could say that we are honoring the new democracy established in Iraq .
That ’s one scenario that could lead to a withdrawal of U.S. troops within a year .
But my own belief is that no one in the top levels in Washington now intends to ever pull all the American troops from Iraq .
I think there was a strong motivation to go into Iraq to establish a permanent military presence there of some kind .
And I do n’t believe there ’s anyone in the top levels in Washington who ’s willing to relinquish the privileged position we have in the acquisition and marketing of Iraqi oil , to open it up to France or Russia or China .
So I think there ’s still a strong feeling in Washington to retain a strong permanent military and economic presence in Iraq .
My belief is that a lot of the violence that continues in Iraq right now between different religious groups is caused in part by the continued presence of American troops .
I believe that if American troops withdrew , almost immediately the level of violence would decrease .
MJ.com : Having monitored many elections yourself , what other conditions do you think must be in place for a viable democracy to work in Iraq ?
JC : I do n’t think we can start the election procedure all the way over .
Now I think the decision is going to be up to the Shiites and the Sunnis and the Kurds to try to work out some sort of arrangement among themselves based on ethnic and religious backgrounds , similar to what has existed for several generations in Lebanon .
There the president comes from one group , the prime minister comes from another group , and you have some degree of autonomy depending on whether people live in a certain place or have a certain ethnic or religious background .
That ’s what we still hope for .
Based on the previous election held in Iraq last December , that ’s still a hopeful possibility , and it would certainly be my preference .
MJ.com :
As you note in your book , the situation in Iraq poses a conflict of American values , in the sense that promoting democracy could , for example , lead to an elected government that takes away things such as women ’s rights .
How does America walk that line ?
JC : We ca n’t completely control what the Iraqis prefer in their social policies .
Obviously , we saw the terrible circumstances in Afghanistan when the Taliban made women almost complete servants and debased them .
Under Saddam Hussein of course , and even under the former Shah of Iran , there was a more enlightened treatment of women , as there is in Egypt and some other Muslim countries .
What I understand , though , is that the strong inclination of the Shiite plurality – they do n’t quite have a majority – in the new government is to implement sharia law as far as women ’s dress is concerned and the subjugation of women to an acknowledged male domination .
From what I understand , that ’s under consideration in the draft of the new constitution .
Unfortunately , we ca n’t just go in and order the Shiites to change their basic beliefs that women should wear veils or should n’t be educated and so forth .
I deplore this , but it ’s not something the United States can control .
MJ.com :
There ’s been a somewhat similar conflict in the Palestinian territories , where a democratically held election led to the victory of Hamas , which the United States lists as a terrorist organization .
What can the United States do in this case ?
JC : The Carter Center monitored that election , as well as the two previous Palestinian elections .
They ’ve been open and safe elections , as good as any we ’ve seen in the world .
[ The Palestinian election in January was the 62nd one the Carter Center had monitored . ]
We ’re familiar with the situation there , and most of us expected that Hamas would win a plurality , but the fact they won a majority was a surprise to everyone .
Now , I do n’t believe it ’s even possible under U.S. law for the United States to deal directly with a government where the ministers and parliament are Hamas members .
That ’s illegal under our laws .
However , the president of the Palestinian government is still Mahmoud Abbas , who represents the Fatah Party .
He is a moderate , respected , honest — and was anointed a couple years ago by the United States and Israel as their main interlocutor .
He is still in charge of the PLO ; since Arafat died , he ’s the head of it .
The only political organization that Israel has ever acknowledged is the PLO .
And I noticed recently that Abbas was in Norway , calling strongly for peace talks to begin immediately with Israel and saying , accurately , that he has the legal authority to speak for the Palestinians as president and as head of the PLO .
So there ’s nothing that happened in January that prevents the initiation or resumption of peace talks .
MJ.com :
In previous interviews you ’ve proposed that the United States continue to give aid to the Palestinian people while not dealing with the Hamas government .
JC : That ’s what I think the United States should do .
We ca n’t deal directly with the Hamas government .
But I think we should have the same degree of generosity to the Palestinian people who are suffering horribly in their own land .
This could be done through UNESCO , through the United Nations Human Rights Organization , through UNICEF , or even through the government of Jordan .
Just to finance the payment of schoolteachers or nurses or ambulance services or food distribution to people .
This could be done almost completely independently of who is in parliament and who the ministers might be .
That ’s what I ’ve advocated , not just for the United States but also for Europe .
I hope there will be some modification in the present actions , which will cause Palestinians to suffer even more than they have in the past and maybe even ultimately create a violent reaction from their hopelessness .
MJ.com : Even looking back at Iraq in the 1990s , the sanctions there seemed to hurt public opinion about the U.S. more than they did Saddam Hussein .
JC : That ’s true .
That was ostensibly focused on Saddam Hussein , but we make the same mistakes in other places .
Unfortunately , we do the same thing in Cuba .
The animosity against Fidel Castro means we have an embargo against travel , commerce , tourism , and the sale of food and medicine to the Cuban people .
This does n’t hurt Castro ; in fact , it hurts the people who are already suffering under his dictatorship .
And it tends to make him a hero , where he can blame all of his own self - induced economic problems on the United States .
So I think whenever we have a bludgeon to economically use sanctions against people in an attempt to hurt the dictator in charge , it ’s counterproductive .
MJ.com :
On the flip side , you note in the book that the American public thinks the country spends much more money on international aid than it actually does .
JC : Polls show that Americans think we spend 10 - 15 percent of our gross income to help other people , and we spend much less than one half of one percent .
And we spend less on a per-capita basis , compared to our income , than any other industrialized nation in the world .
And in addition to this stinginess with which we allocate government funds to help humanitarian assistance to needy people , we put horrendous restraints on how our own dollars are expended .
For example , we ’re very interested in trying to control AIDS in Africa , but the Congress puts strings on the money , such as you ca n’t spend it on family planning or the use of condoms .
Anybody in his right mind knows that one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of AIDS is for people who have sex to use condoms .
Another thing is that in the last 20 years or so , beginning with President Reagan , we have shifted to letting almost all the USAID [ United States Agency for International Development ] funds go to American contractors .
It used to be that within USAID , we had experts employed by the U.S. government who made sure the money was spent wisely and efficiently .
Now that money goes almost exclusively to American contractors who set up offices in foreign countries .
They receive the money and dole it out with enormous waste .
MJ.com :
By comparison , what have you found effective in your own work that other organizations could learn from ?
JC : One thing is that , since I have been president , I ’m able to deal directly with the leaders of African governments .
I go into the country and let it be known what we want to do in advance , and I ask the president to meet with me and to have his prime minister there as well as his whole cabinet .
I negotiate a contract between the Carter Center and , for example , the government of Uganda or Mali or Burkina Faso .
That ’s the first thing .
Whereas if the World Health Organization or UNICEF wanted to do this , they would probably – through no fault of their own – be limited to dealing with the minister of health .
That ’s one advantage we have .
A second is we have a policy of not sending a large bureaucracy into a country .
We usually send in one expert who represents the Carter Center .
And all of the workers are local people , Kenyans or Nigerians or Tanzanians .
They are the ones who actually do the work in the villages , with us teaching them and providing assistance .
And a third thing we do that makes our work effective is I do n’t put my name on anything when we deal with these diseases .
In Africa for instance , we generally call it Global 2000 , so the local village leader can say , “ My Global 2000 program eradicated Guinea worm . ”
Or increased the production of corn or wheat .
And the president can say the same thing .
I think those three things – dealing with the top leadership , depending on local people we train to do the work , and we do n’t try to take credit for it .
Il pettine per barba è uno strumento fantastico quando la lunghezza della barba inizia a superare i 2,5 – 3 cm , per dare spazio ai peli della barba di crescere e modellarla con fantastici stili di baffi e pizzetto .
E’ importante il pettine perché ti consente di stirare e disciplinare la barba , ovviamente subito dopo averla lavata per bene con uno shampoo da barba ed averla ammorbidita con un balsamo o un olio da barba .
Ci sono diverse tipologie di pettini per barba , tra le quali troviamo quelle che espongono i seguenti compiti :
Disegnare la barba : permettendo di utilizzare dei colori delebili
permettendo di utilizzare dei colori delebili Sagomare la barba : definirne i contorni , donando uno stile di barba e baffi precisi e per la cura della barba in generale , dando una sagoma specifica alla tua barba
: definirne i contorni , donando uno stile di barba e baffi precisi e per la cura della barba in generale , dando una sagoma specifica alla tua barba Regolare la barba : ti consentono di radere la barba lunga a mano libera , sfruttando anche la tecnica di taglio della barba a mano libera .
Questo ti permette di avere un pettine per accorciare la barba in qualsiasi momento della giornata ne hai la possibilità .
ti consentono di radere la barba lunga a mano libera , sfruttando anche la tecnica di taglio della barba a mano libera .
Questo ti permette di avere un pettine per accorciare la barba in qualsiasi momento della giornata ne hai la possibilità .
Stirare la barba : di solito viene utilizzato un pettine elettrico lisciante , riscaldato per modellare la barba .
Se vuoi approfondire l’argomento dei pettini per barba , ti consiglio caldamente di leggere questo articolo , dove in pochissimo tempo avrai maggiori informazioni su come scegliere il migliore pettine per barba presente .
Come usare il pettine per barba
E’ fondamentale conoscere tutte le dritte sulla barba , se ne desidera una hipster o una a manubrio più francese alla Aramis dei Tre Moschettieri , tutto dipende dalla scelta di un buon pettine per barba ed una buona spazzola .
In genere i principi per un corretto utilizzo del pettine per barba sono gli stessi da seguire nel caso dovessimo usare una spazzola per barba .
Assicurarsi di avere una barba lavata e profumata con uno shampoo delicato , e poi di asciugarla in maniera approfondita , in modo da non lasciare eventuali residui di bagnato che generano umidità e proliferazione di batteri .
Una volta asciutta con un panno e rimosso l’eccesso di umidità , aiutandoti anche con un asciugacapelli potrai applicare dell ’ olio o del balsamo per ammorbidire la barba .
E’ il momento di pettinare la barba , verso il basso , direzionandola in maniera naturale , in caduta libera , ossia seguendo il verso fluido e libero dei peli della barba .
Pettine o spazzola per barba : quale preferire tra i due
Entrambi , sia il pettine che la spazzola per barba , sinteticamente assolvono allo stesso compito : districare , disciplinare e regolare la barba , dandole una forma .
Tuttavia , il tipo di materiali utilizzati , nel pettine solitamente la plastica o il legno , mentre per la spazzola diverse qualità di legno , e le setole o dentini fanno tutta la differenza nel mondo .
Il pettine di legno per barba è dotato di dentini rigidi ma morbidi a contatto con la barba , che servono a regolare le lunghezze e solitamente va bene per barbe lunghe e distribuire l’olio naturale della barba su tutta la sua lunghezza .
Sotto determinate lunghezze è inutile il pettine , in quanto per la barba corta neanche viene presa tra i dentini del pettine e risulta totalmente inadeguato .
Invece per la spazzola da barba abbiamo le setole , che possono essere di plastica rigida o in setole di maiale per facilitare la distribuzione di lozioni , balsami o anche oli specifici per barba .
Solitamente la spazzola lavora meglio su barba sia corta che lunga .
Inoltre la pettinatura della barba della spazzola ha anche una funzione esfoliante , infatti rimuovere i residui di cellule epidermiche morte e inquinanti ambientali .
Pettine per barba : prezzo e curiosità
Il prezzo medio per un buon pettine per barba di una discreta qualità di legno si aggira intorno ai 10 - 15 euro , per i migliori della categoria invece possiamo giungere anche fino a 25 - 30 euro .
Esistono anche pettini per barba con una forma curva , che segue la linea naturale della barba , e ti permettono di sagomare il contorno della stessa con estrema facilità , lavorando quasi da righelli per barba .
Con l’aiuto di un rasoio per barba e del pettine potrai avere la linea che desideri senza necessariamente rivolgerti al tuo parrucchiere di fiducia .
Il pettine caldo per barba serve invece per lisciare e domare i peli che tendono ad avere molteplici versi di caduta , e di utilizzare anche delle forbici nell ’eventualità tu voglia togliere le puntine che escono fuori in eccesso .
Prende il nome di pettine stira / liscia barba e lo trovi per una trentina di euro su internet .
Puoi comprare un pettine per barba sia in supermercato che su internet , ma il mio consiglio di acquistarlo online per comparare decine e decine di modelli in un tempo relativamente bassissimo .
Previous drafts described actions by the United States government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement , like the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay and the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal , and some policy makers argued that the intelligence estimate should be more focused on specific steps to mitigate the terror threat .
It is unclear whether the final draft of the intelligence estimate criticizes individual policies of the United States , but intelligence officials involved in preparing the document said its conclusions were not softened or massaged for political purposes .
Frederick Jones , a White House spokesman , said the White House “ played no role in drafting or reviewing the judgments expressed in the National Intelligence Estimate on terrorism . ”
The estimate ’s judgments confirm some predictions of a National Intelligence Council report completed in January 2003 , two months before the Iraq invasion .
That report stated that the approaching war had the potential to increase support for political Islam worldwide and could increase support for some terrorist objectives .
Documents released by the White House timed to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks emphasized the successes that the United States had made in dismantling the top tier of Al Qaeda .
“ Since the Sept. 11 attacks , America and its allies are safer , but we are not yet safe , ” concludes one , a report titled “ 9/11 Five Years Later : Success and Challenges . ”
“ We have done much to degrade Al Qaeda and its affiliates and to undercut the perceived legitimacy of terrorism . ”
That document makes only passing mention of the impact the Iraq war has had on the global jihad movement .
“ The ongoing fight for freedom in Iraq has been twisted by terrorist propaganda as a rallying cry , ” it states .
The report mentions the possibility that Islamic militants who fought in Iraq could return to their home countries , “ exacerbating domestic conflicts or fomenting radical ideologies . ”
On Wednesday , the Republican - controlled House Intelligence Committee released a more ominous report about the terrorist threat .
That assessment , based entirely on unclassified documents , details a growing jihad movement and says , “ Al Qaeda leaders wait patiently for the right opportunity to attack . ”
After years of refusing to enable Blackberries to work in Japan , DoCoMo finally let the technology loose a couple of months ago .
Although there is still only one model available , after reading Wasabi Green ’s writeup on stippy .com I could n’t resist but giving one a test - drive .
So what is the verdict ?
Is it really worth lashing out a couple of men ( 万円の複数形 , plural of “ 万 ” ) to buy a blackberry ?
The short answer is “ not yet ” .
Read on for Stippy.com ’s field review of Japan ’s blackberry friendliness .
For those of you who have lived in Japan so long that you have n’t seen a blackberry , let me take away some of the mystery .
The blackberry , designed by a Canadian company called Research in Motion ( RIM ) , enables you to access most of the mod cons of your office PC from your mobile .
Not only can you check emails that arrive to your work address , you can also send emails using the same address .
After a quick adjusting of the standard signature settings to delete the free ad for blackberry , no - one would even know that you were n’t in your office .
You can also access your work calendar and address book , but better yet , any update you make to these is automatically saved on your work computer ( including scheduling of events with other work colleagues ) .
Recently the blackberry has been equipped with a web browser ( a few actually ) which enables you to browse the web on your 3 ” LCD screen with relative ease .
You ca n’t quite play final fantasy like you can on a DoCoMo handset , but there is a decent selection of games that you can download from the Blackberry website .
My favorite so far is meteor crusher , but I ’m quickly getting addicted to Ka-Blom !
( Yes , I know , I ’ve been in Japan too long ) .
The great thing about the blackberry games is that you can send your high score into the blackberry database and see where you rank out of all of the global blackberry users who ’ve played that game .
I ’m proud to say that I regularly rank in the top 10,000 or so .

More importantly , security is said to be extremely high quality at RIM and this is generally quoted as the reason that it has been so popular amongst US corporates ( it seems that almost every senior manager in America uses one these days . )
Equipped with a full QWERTY keyboard , the 8707g ( the only model available in Japan ) is very user friendly for the average gaijin .
The entire operating system is in English which means you do n’t have to press the “ 6 ” key five times to type the word “ no ” .
The flipside of this is its ability to handle Japanese .
While you can read Japanese that is written in emails ( if you install the Japanese language font ) , and on homepages ( if you install the right Internet broswer – the preinstalled “ BlackBerry Browser ” and “ WAP Browser ” are useless ) , the blackberry does not offer any support for inputting Japanese at all .
A service called Namimail is available from Namikiteru , a subsidiary of DoCoMo USA ( for a fee ! ) which enables you to input Japanese characters in a new email , but despite being difficult to use , it does n’t enable you to use Japanese when replying to or forwarding existing emails ( let alone input on a webpage ) .
Even when you are writing a new email , namimail takes over your address - book and makes searching for names near a very complicated process )
I ’ve been paying the monthly fee ( US$ 35 !! ) for the last few months now but have used it about twice so am currently working out how to cancel my contract .
I think DoCoMo made a mistake when they decided the name of this sub , I ’m sure they meant to call it “ Nameteru . ”
More important than the user interface is mobile reception .
Given that 3G has been in Japan for so long , I ( and I think most other people ) had assumed without a second thought that reception would be near perfect in central Tokyo – especially as my blackberry is set up to switch between the DoCoMo and Softbank networks as appropriate in order to guarantee the best possible reception .
Amazingly , this turned out to be a huge leap of faith as quite often I struggled to get reception from either .
Domestic FOMA users do n’t notice as most phones these days are dual - chip ( ie equipped with 2G and 3G chips ) but the blackberry is only compatible with 3G in Japan so the naked truth hits home .
Besides having trouble inside buildings , one of the most frustrating dead spaces was at Narita airport .
While the concept of a blackberry is good , it does n’t help much if you ca n’t call people !
( This also makes it hard to download applications like games etc unless you stand still )
For budding Yoso - guys out there out there , you ’ll be pleased to hear that I was pleasantly surprised by the number of times that my little blackberry automatically switched over to the Softbank network for better reception .

Docomo Blackberry finds that Softbank has a better connection :
One final tip before I go .
If you are keen enough to try a blackberry without perfect reception ( or you want to keep a separate phone for voice use anyway ) there are a bunch of great applications out there that you can down load .
My favorite at the moment is Gmail .
For the first few weeks I was accessing Gmail via the blackberry web browser until I noticed some small words down at the bottom of the screen inviting me to optimize Gmail to my blackberry .
Low and behold , the Gmail website detects that you have a blackberry and allows you to download a plugin that makes emailing as easy as accessing your regular outlook account .
( You can even review a handful of old emails without reception as it remembers your most recent inbox for you . )
If anybody else knows any interesting applications out there then we ’d love to hear about them .
Oh , and needless to say , you can view www.stippy.com without a problem on your blackberry .
With thanks to our sleepless Webmaster , Stippy.com released its first mobile version last month .
All you need to do is access the usual URL and it will recognize that you are accessing from a blackberry ( or mobile phone , or any PDA for that matter ! )

Recursion is a simple and powerful technique that makes solving many problems very simple , but this comes at a price .
Normally we prefer to have normal looping constructs in our software instead , but not for the obvious reason .
A Javascript file is available that contains all of the examples together with a few functions for performing timing and making sure they all give the same answers .
The file expects to be run from the command line .
On Windows open a command prompt and type : CScript “ path\powers.js ” Replace path with the full path you saved the file to .
If you use some other platform then hopefully you already know how to execute the script .
For those not on Windows you will also need to change all occurrences of WScript .
Echo ( there are n't very many ) to whichever function displays output on your platform .
I do n't know if Jack Altiere is right when he says many programmers are afraid of recursion , but if it 's true I expect they fall into two categories :
Those who have not learned what recursion is yet .
Those who have learned that it is often better not to use it .
Jack 's short introduction is probably good for those in category one , but if you want to ever consider yourself an experienced programmer you should be trying to get into category two .
This article is intended to help you get to category two as quickly as possible .
Some simple recursion
Recursive functions are easy .
The only thing that you have to do to write a recursive function is to have it call itself .
That 's pretty easy and you may think that there is n't much reason to use it , but it can be very powerful .
It turns out that there are all sorts of things that we might want to do that are easier to think of in terms of recursion .
We wo n't go into all of them here , but if you look through your code you 'll probably find that you have plenty of examples of them .
We 're going to study a mathematical function that can be handled in all sorts of interesting ways — integer power calculations .
I 'm going to use Javascript ( even though it would n't normally be my first choice for this sort of testing ) because more people are likely to be able to run the tests themselves if I do so .
power ( v , n ) = vn
For those that have forgotten your basic maths notations this means that we take some number v and multiply it by itself n times .
If we take v as 4 and n as 2 we get 16 because 4 × 4 = 16 .
We also need to be aware of a couple of special rules .
Anything multiplied by itself no times is one .
This seems counter - intuitive , but it makes all the maths work out .
Another rule is that anything multiplied by itself once is just the same as itself .
We can write these as :
power ( v , 0 ) = 1
power ( v , 1 ) = v
We should put these together to get a complete definition :
power ( v , 0 ) = 1
power ( v , 1 ) = v
power ( v , n ) = vn
Let 's take a look at an extended example whilst we remember that our notation means we are multiplying a number by itself :
n = 0 ≔ 1
n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4
n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16
n = 3 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 = 64
n = 4 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256
n = 5 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 1024
There is a rather striking pattern here which we can express quite simply in an improved program :
power ( v , 0 ) = 1
power ( v , 1 ) = v
power ( v , n ) = v × power ( v , n - 1 )
It is this last part of our definition that makes it recursive .
We have defined power ( ) in terms of itself and that 's all that a recursive function is — a function that calls itself .
We can write this in Javascript pretty simply too :
function power_recurse( value , power ) { if ( power == 0 ) return 1 ; else if ( power == 1 ) return value ; else return value * power_recurse ( value , power - 1 ) ; }
The three parts to the if statement correspond perfectly to the three parts of our definition of power ( ) .
The first two are called base cases because they do not involve any extra call to power_recurse ( ) .
The last is the recursive call because , well I 'm sure you can work it out .
There 's a couple of things that we should notice about this :
We have to have the base cases in there .
Without the base cases the function would continue on forever with power becoming a steadily larger negative value .
When we call the recursive function we must alter the arguments in some way .
Specifically we have to alter the arguments that are involved in the base case .
If we do n't do this then the base cases can never trigger and we 'll also end up in an infinite loop .
For every recursive function that you ever write these two items must always work together , although the interaction is n't always so obvious .
If you want to see an example where finding the base case is hard take a quick look near the end of this article .
Converting to a for loop
In the jargon of computer science the recursive version of power ( ) is written in a functional style and the for loop version is in a procedural style .
The difference between the two terms is more than just a change in how iteration ( that is looping ) is done .
In ( pure ) functional programming looping is always done recursively by defining functions in terms of themselves ( either directly or indirectly ) .
Procedural programming on the other hand uses looping constructs ( for , while or do / while in Javascript — goto is also a form of looping construct but it's not mentioned in polite company any more ) .
The more general terms for how these sorts of programs are constructed are declarative programming ( of which functional is a sub - type ) and imperative programming ( for which procedural is a close synonym ) .
The main difference between them is that the recursive / functional / declarative viewpoint is concerned with what is being computed whilst looping constructs / procedural / imperative programming is concerned with how the computation is performed .
Procedural programming is much more common than pure functional programming partly because most procedural programming languages also support functional idioms .
The most famous declarative language that you 're likely to use from day to day is SQL .
In case you 're wondering object - oriented programming is yet another way of structuring software .
As you can probably imagine there is much difference in opinion about where exactly to draw the lines between all of these terms ( and the myriad more in use ) .
If we re-examine the pattern we can see that there is another solution that we should n't overlook too .
Here is the pattern again :
n = 0 ≔ 1
n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4
n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16
n = 3 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 = 64
n = 4 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256
n = 5 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 1024
We can see that we 're just multiplying n times .
Writing this in Javascript is a breeze :
function power_for ( value , power ) { var result = 1 ; for ( var i = 1 ; i <= power ; i++ ) result *= value ; return result ; }
The base cases here are a little more subtle to spot and when you go through how it works you will notice that the second base case is missing altogether .
We do n't need it and skipping it makes the function much easier to work with .
The other thing to notice is that whereas the recursive version was a single statement , this one uses three .
To start with there does n't seem to be much to choose between them .
Functional purists would argue that the recursive function is more elegant , whilst many other programmers would probably argue that the for loop more clearly expresses how the calculation is done .
It turns out though that there is a good reason to prefer the for loop over the recursive function in Javascript .
Below is a table of execution times ( n is the power that we are requesting be calculated ) .
I 've had to repeat the calculations many thousands of times in order to be able to measure the time with any sort of accuracy .
Even so there is a lot of noise in the data , but the pattern is still clear enough .
power_recurse power_for 0 235ms 282ms 1 203ms 343ms 2 515ms 360ms 3 547ms 375ms 10 2078ms 485ms 20 4375ms 703ms 30 6672ms 875ms 100 22875ms 3407ms
The first question is why did I choose to plot the times against n and not v ?
The answer is that n is the control variable .
That is , the execution pattern of both functions depends on n and not v .
Try working out how they would run with a few different values for v and n and you will see that it does n't matter what v is , the number of times the recursive function calls itself or the number of times the for is executed never changes .
Both change dramatically with any change in n .
The second question is why are the times so different ?
To answer that we need to think about what the Javascript interpreter is doing .
For power_recurse( ) , each time the function is called it must copy the two variables value and power .
When we request a power of zero then this function call overhead is about the same for both versions and because of the way we have structured the recursive function ( with two base cases ) then this is the same for a power of one .
But once we ask for a power of two then there are twice as many function calls in the recursive version as compared to the for loop .
So , although both versions are doing essentially the same amount of work in the same way the extra work in the function call overhead makes the for loop much faster .
Now , interesting as this is there are two reasons for this result :
The operation at the heart of the calculation , the multiplication , is practically free compared to everything else we 're doing .
This skews the results dramatically .
If we slowed the multiply down by a factor of a hundred then I doubt we would see any difference between them .
The Javascript interpreter is n't all that smart ( more on this later ) .
What this means is that although the recursive function incurs an overhead in the function calls and this takes longer this is not the reason why we prefer for loops !
Stack space and heap space
The memory that your computer program uses comes in two flavours and they behave quite differently ( actually there are three if we include the memory that the program code sits in , but let 's ignore that as it is n't important for this discussion ) .
The first , and the biggest , is the heap .
This is where nearly all of the data that your programs use live .
The stack on the other hand is small and is used for remembering where to return to after function calls , the function call parameters and the function 's local variables .
I 'm sure you can see where this is leading .
The for loop version is only ever going to use one function call no matter how big the power we ask for is .
The recursive version on the other hand has to remember function return points and variables on each call .
For a power of one hundred that 's one hundred times as much memory !
If the power is big enough we can get Javascript to run out of memory using a recursive function which the for loop could never do .
And this is the reason why we normally prefer to write a loop rather than a recursive function when we can .
Even if the Javascript interpreter uses its heap for the Javascript stack the principle still holds — it just means that the power needed to blow the program up has to be bigger .
On my machine power_recurse ( ) exhausts the stack somewhere between n = 1,000 and n = 10,000 .
These are not high numbers .
Even if the stack frame for each function call was one kilobyte ( and it 's probably actually a few hundredths of that size ) then this represents only between one and ten megabytes .
For programming languages like C , C++ and Java though the stack is normally tiny in comparison to the heap .
My computer at the moment has a gigabyte of RAM and a further 1½ gigabytes of swap space .
My C++ compiler though has a default stack size of only one megabyte ( which is still a lot larger than I was expecting ) , but still represents over three orders of magnitude .
This memory usage overhead of recursive functions is the real reason why recursive functions are often replaced with loops wherever possible .
There are two circumstances under which recursive functions have to be very carefully controlled :
In library code , especially low - level libraries , the function call and stack overhead are probably completely unacceptable .
If the control variable is under user control ( either the programmer using your function , or even worse the end user sitting at the computer running the program ) then you have not only a software crash waiting to happen but , for server software , a potential vector for attack .
It may be possible to inject code ( similar to buffer overruns ) or to use it for denial of service .
Of course recursive functions are n't all doom and gloom and there are good reasons to use them anyway .
In many circumstances recursive functions are the simplest way to express an algorithm and for many recursive functions we can see that we have to pay the extra memory overhead anyway .
The other sort of recursion
What we 've seen so far is a special type of recursion , one where only a single recursive call is made .
The way that they are used is very almost tail recursion , and some compilers will be able to turn these functions into proper tail recursive forms in order to use a technique called tail call optimisation .
This is n't the place to go into this in any more detail , but the outcome is that a good compiler is able to convert these into a for loop .
There is however another type of algorithm that is very easy ( almost trivial ) to implement recursively but is extremely hard to write as a loop and even when we do manage it we find that the memory overhead is about the same .
I 'm going to stick to the example we 've been using so far in order to show the form of the recursive calls even though a bit of even more clever maths will enable us to turn the algorithm into a loop .
Divide and conquer
Let 's look at our pattern of multiplication again .
n = 0 ≔ 1
n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4
n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16
n = 3 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 = 64
n = 4 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256
n = 5 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 1024
If you look carefully you can see that we can split each of these in two .
Let 's start at n = 2 and go from there :
n = 0 ≔ 1
n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4
n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 ≔ ( n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4 ) × ( n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4 )
n = 3 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 ≔ ( n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4 ) × ( n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 )
n = 4 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256 ≔ ( n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 ) × ( n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 )
n = 5 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 1024 ≔ ( n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 ) × ( n = 3 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 )
Each of the powers can be expressed as powers of about half half their size .
Can we make use of this in our program in any way ?
It turns out that this is pretty easy to do with our functional version , especially if we first put in a slight twist :
n = 0 ≔ 1
n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4
n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 ≔ ( n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4 ) × ( n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4 )
n = 3 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 ≔ ( n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4 ) × ( n = 1 ≔ 4 = 4 ) × 4
n = 4 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256 ≔ ( n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 ) × ( n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 )
n = 5 ≔ 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 1024 ≔ ( n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 ) × ( n = 2 ≔ 4 × 4 = 16 ) × 4
What we 've done is to split it into symetric calls of half the power with odd versions taking an extra factor of ×
4 .
Written functionally this gives us :
power ( v , 0 ) = 1
power ( v , 1 ) = v
if ( modulus ( n , 2 ) = 0 ) power ( v , n ) = power ( v , n / 2 ) × power ( v , n / 2 )
if ( modulus ( n , 2 ) = 1 ) power ( v , n ) = power ( v , n / 2 ) × power ( v , n / 2 ) × v
I 'm assuming that there is a modulus function that performs the standard mathematical operation and that the division by two is an integer division so it throws away the fraction .
Can we implement this in Javascript ?
Actually it 's pretty easy to do so recursively .
Again this is the natural way to turn our insight into working software and we end up with this new version :
function power_recurse_quicker ( value , power ) { if ( power == 0 ) return 1 ; else if ( power == 1 ) return value ; else { var r = power_recurse_quicker ( value , Math.floor ( power / 2 ) ) ; if ( power % 2 ) return value * r * r ; else return r * r ; } }
Let 's see what this does .
The two base conditions are identical to our earlier version so that 's pretty easy .
As in the functional re-write above the only change is in our implementation for larger powers .
We do our recursive call to calculate the answer for half the power and then use this , maybe with an extra factor of our value ( if the power is odd ) to calculate the requested result .
Does it work out any faster ?
If we think about what it will do now then it will recurse a lot less .
If we start at n = 64 it will go to n = 32 , then n = 16 , n = 8 , n = 4 , n = 2 and finally hit the base case at n = 1 .
The other recursive version would go from n = 64 to n = 63 then n = 62 etc. until it also hit the base case at n = 1 .
The for loop would work up from n = 1 to n = 2 and then n = 3 etc. until it got to n = 64 , but both of these would need to do 64 calculations to work out a sixty fourth power .
This new version only does seven calls and six multiplications !
Let 's look to see how that translates into the timings .
power_recurse power_recurse_quicker power_for 0 235ms 203ms 282ms 1 187ms 203ms 343ms 2 469ms 515ms 360ms 3 547ms 641ms 375ms 10 2078ms 1453ms 485ms 20 4375ms 1562ms 703ms 30 6672ms 1547ms 875ms 100 22875ms 2297ms 3407ms
We can see that it is slow at the lower values ( they 're all pretty quick on the base cases ) .
By the time we get to n = 10 though it is beating the speed of the old recursive version and by the time we get to n = 100 it is about ⅓ faster than the for and a whopping ten times faster than the old recursive function .
I have a procedural version of this algorithm that I 'm saving for another article .
Have a think about how you might implement it .
A special prize if you manage to come up with a non-recursive implementation of this algorithm that does n't require any extra storage — it is not easy ( and using logarithms does n't count — it's of this algorithm ) .
Summary
Recursion is a very powerful tool and it often enables us to spot algorithms that we would n't otherwise see .
We should however be very careful of using it in production software , especially where the parameters for the recursion ultimately derive from user input , or any other non-trusted source .
As well as a vector for certain types of denial of service type attacks it could also allow the propogation of worms .
Even where we have an algorithm that is very hard to express without recursion it may still be worth it in some circumstances simply because the heap is normally so much larger than the stack .
And finally here is a non-obvious recursive program .
Try to work out what it does and how it does it .
There is a clue in the the function name .
function gcd ( value1 , value2 ) { if ( value2 == 0 ) return value1 ; else return gcd ( value2 , value1 % value2 ) ; }
The download file ( see top of article ) includes this as gcd.js which will show you a table of results to help give you a clue .

An example of recursion on Reddit .
Scheme requires tail - recursion to be automatically handled by the compiler .
Note a subtle point here : the compiler must handle it not because of the function call overhead but in order to guarantee that the memory overhead is the same for any call depth .
This amounts to a guarantee that you cannot run out of memory and in turn this means it needs a mechanical way to convert the tail recursion to a loop .
An example of the sort of procedure you may have to go through in order to get your compiler to convert your tail recursion into a loop ( or if you 're lucky your compiler does it for you ) .

The European Space Agency's ( ESA ) Demonstrator - 2R spacecraft is still missing after disappearing last week during re-entry into the Earth 's atmosphere .
The Demonstrator , the latest model of the agency 's Inflatable Re-Entry and Descent Technology ( IRDT ) , is a system that uses an inflatable cone - shaped heat shield and parachute to return cargo from orbit .
The Demonstrator was launched into space aboard a Russian Volna rocket from a submarine in the Barents Sea on October 7 at 10:30 am .
Expected to land in Russia 's eastern Kamchatka peninsula half an hour later , the craft never made it .
Claus Reimers , the IRDT project manager , said that initial telemetry data revealed that the Demonstrator 's trajectory may have been more shallow thus extending its flight .
If true , then the device may have overshot Kamchatka and landed in the Pacific Ocean , Reimers told SPACE.com .
The Demonstrator was the first IRDT test in over five years .
The last test was in February , 2000 , when two IRDT devices managed to re-enter the Earth 's atmosphere but were damaged in the process .
The Demonstrator was built by the Russian space design company Lovochkin under contract with ESA .
The Demonstrator 's IRDT system was supposed to be a cheaper and lighter alternative to the bulky and expensive heat shields and brittle ceramic tiles that are traditionally used to protect spacecrafts during atmospheric re-entry .
An IRDT device consists of a blunt - nosed capsule coated with an ablative material that disintegrates when heated .
This carries away excess heat while at the same time slowing the device down .
The IRDT 's inflatable heat shield is made from multiple layers of a silica - based fabric saturated with an ablative material and can be quickly filled with nitrogen gas during the early stages of re-entry .
Once safely inside the atmosphere , the IRDT 's parachute inflates , slowing the device down further and bringing it in for a soft landing .
When both the heat shield and parachute are inflated , the IRDT resembles a much larger version of the shuttlecocks or " birdies " used in badminton and it works in a similar way as well .
The conical shape of both the IRDT and the shuttlecock create drag as they fly through the air , and this helps both objects remain stable .
IRDT is not a new idea ; similar concepts have been around since the earliest days of spaceflight .
" In the 1960s , ideas were developed for similar concepts for the purpose of astronaut rescue , " said Eike Kircher , head of Basic Technology Research at ESA .
One example was General Electric 's Man Out Of Space Easiest emergency bailout system , otherwise known as " MOOSE . "
The idea was that an astronaut would leave his ailing spacecraft in a space suit and cannonball back to Earth inside a giant bag that could be filled with foam .
Fortunately , the idea did n't catch on with either NASA or the Air Force and MOOSE was abandoned by the late - 1960s .
An early precursor to IRDT was carried aboard the Russian spacecraft Mars '96 .
It was intended to ferry two modules to that planet 's surface , but the mission was lost due to a launcher failure .
The IRDT 's primary task will be to return payloads from low Earth Orbit but it 's designers also envision it being used as an atmospheric research tool or as a descent capsule for science missions on other planets .
Current designs allow the IRDT capsule to carry payloads ranging between 220 - 240 pounds , but Kircher said it 's possible that future models could be scaled up to accommodate larger payloads .
For now , IRDT will only be used to transport non-human cargo but the ESA is developing a similar technology for use an emergency escape system from skyscrapers .

And the best part ?
Congress and the Executive branch have known about this problem for half a year or more and no one did a damn thing to fix it .
In a nutshell , the Chicago Sun - Times ran a story two days ago about a Web site that sells phone records , for cells and land - lines , for $ 110 a pop .
The company boasts on its own Web site :
Give us the cell phone number and we will send you the calls made from the cell phone number .
1 . Are you an FBI agent with confidential sources ?
To test the service , the FBI paid Locatecell.com $ 160 to buy the records for an agent 's cell phone and received the list within three hours , the police bulletin said .
2 . Are you a police officer with confidential sources ?
The Chicago Sun-Times paid $ 110 to Locatecell.com to purchase a one - month record of calls for this reporter 's company cell phone .
It was as simple as e-mailing the telephone number to the service along with a credit card number .
The request was made Friday after the service was closed for the New Year 's holiday .
On Tuesday , when it reopened , Locatecell.com e-mailed a list of 78 telephone numbers this reporter called on his cell phone between Nov. 19 and Dec. 17 .
The list included calls to law enforcement sources , story subjects and other Sun - Times reporters and editors .
3 . Are you a journalist with confidential sources ?
4 . Are you a Democratic or Republican member of Congress ?
5 . Are you a Bush administration official ?
6 . Are you a special prosecutor by the name of Patrick Fitzgerald ?
7 . Are you an Al Qaeda terrorist ?
8 . Are you a regular old American criminal , a member of the Mafia for example ?
9 . Are you someone who 's being abused by your spouse ?
10 . Got AIDS , cancer or any other disease you might want to keep private ?
11 . Are you a woman who ever has , may , or will get an abortion ?
So I went to their site , plopped down $ 110 , and within a day I had a list of every single phone number that called my cell , or that I called from my cell , for the month of November .
I even had the dates the calls were made , and for a premium I could find out how long the calls were .
I called Cingular and they were shocked by what I told them - yeah right .
And the best part ?
The article from the Sun - Times makes clear that the FBI is aware of this problem , the Chicago Police Department , one of the top two electronic privacy groups in the nation ( EPIC ) , and even the office of Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) .
EPIC apparently has known about this problem for a long time , and Schumer did n't seem very surprised either .
So , tell me why our government and our privacy groups have known forever about this problem ( the Washington Post wrote an article about this last July ) , yet no one has done anything to fix it ?
Oh sure , Schumer " introduced legislation " to fix it and is waiting .
Gee thanks Chuck .
At least you got your face in front of a camera .
This is the kind of story that gets legislation passed in a day , it 's so outrageous .
Either you do n't care or you 're incompetent if you introduce legislation on something this outrageous and you have sit back and wait for it to be considered .
But hey , at least Schumer tried , so to speak - where were the other Senators and House members ?
Where is our president ?
Now , before you write this off as just another sad story , let me explain to you just how serious the situation really is - not just to your own personal privacy , but to law enforcement , every politician in DC and around the country , and to national security .
Again , I quote the Sun - Times : Do you think anyone in Washington , DC would like to know who James Risen of the New York Times , the reporter who broke Bush 's domestic spying scandal , has been talking to over the last year ?
Well , just plop down a few hundred bucks and buy his phone records .
Kiss his sources goodbye .
Or how about Bob Novak ?
Be fun to find out who he was talking to , oh , around the spring of 2003 ...
Or the phone records of any US reporters - imagine the fun the Bush administration could have LEGALLY getting a record of every single phone call you 've ever received or made .
Spying on Christiane Amanpour ?
Who needs to !
Her phone records are available for $ 110 and the click of a button .
Imagine the fun should some rich Democratic or Republican donor plop down $ 1 million to get the phone records of every single member of Congress from the other party .
Who have they been talking to ?
George Soros ?
Pat Robertson ?
Their mistress ?
Did any of them talk to any reporters on or around the day that any big leak came out of Congress ?
Did you ever have a phone conversation with Jack Abramoff ?
I do oppo research for a living - I would give my right thumb to have a list of every phone call made or received by a member of Congress from the other party on their cell phone .
Go ahead , make my day .
Imagine the fun should someone get Karl Rove 's phone records , or Dick Cheney 's , or President Bush 's .
Love to see who HE 's been talking to ?
Do n't you think they'd love to pull up the phone records of FBI , CIA , and Homeland Security officials to find out if any other Al Qaeda " affiliates " are snitches , or at least to see who they 're talking to .
Or pull up the records of their own people to see if they 've been talking to reporters or FBI agents ?
Think they 'd find it useful to check who among their associates has been talking to reporters , politicians , or law enforcement ?
Would n't it be great to have your partner find out you 're talking to an abused women shelter or to the police ?
Imagine the fun should your employer find out you call the AIDS hotline every week , or the women 's breast cancer clinic .
My point here is that this is incredibly dangerous , our government has known about it for a good half year or longer , and no one has done a damn thing about it .
Do you want everyone knowing you made a few too many phone calls to the Planned Parenthood clinic ?
The list goes on and on and on .
What 's most infuriating to me is that our government , both Congress and the executive branch , has known about this since at least last July when the Washington Post story ran , and they did n't do a damn thing about it .
Congress could have easily passed legislation to make this illegal .
But they did n't .
Hell , Bush could have evoked his apparently all - powerful divine right of kings and simply outlaw the damn practice - a much better use of his dictator police - state powers than spying on innocent Americans .
But Bush did nothing .
Republicans and Democrats in Congress did nothing .
And the FBI and the privacy groups have known about this for a long time , and they did nothing .
This is the kind of issue that you could get fixed on Capitol Hill IN ONE DAY .
But that would require someone who actually understands politics , who understands how to get things accomplished , and who gives a damn .
It also takes someone who is n't in the pocket of the telecommunications industry , the telemarketers , and the direct marketing lobbyists .
And finally , let 's not forget the biggest criminals of all in this affair .
The phone companies .
There is no way that these online services are outright stealing this information , if they 're able to get in just a few hours consistently .
They 've got access to the info , and from the reading I 've done it seems the cell and land - line companies are selling our info for profit .
So , the biggest slap in the face should be to any phone company out there who has ever sold one big of information about you to anyone else .
Not only is it unethical , but they just might have helped Al Qaeda .
Congrats .
So , anybody got Bill Frist 's or Harry Reid 's phone numbers ?
Or maybe the phone number of the FBI tip line ?
Shakespeare uses a linguistic technique known as functional shift that involves , for example using a noun to serve as a verb .
Researchers found that this technique allows the brain to understand what a word means before it understands the function of the word within a sentence .
This process causes a sudden peak in brain activity and forces the brain to work backwards in order to fully understand what Shakespeare is trying to say .
Professor Philip Davis , from the University ’s School of English , said : “ The brain reacts to reading a phrase such as ‘ he godded me ’ from the tragedy of Coriolanus , in a similar way to putting a jigsaw puzzle together .
If it is easy to see which pieces slot together you become bored of the game , but if the pieces do n’t appear to fit , when we know they should , the brain becomes excited .
By throwing odd words into seemingly normal sentences , Shakespeare surprises the brain and catches it off guard in a manner that produces a sudden burst of activity – a sense of drama created out of the simplest of things . ”
Experts believe that this heightened brain activity may be one of the reasons why Shakespeare ’s plays have such a dramatic impact on their readers .
Professor Neil Roberts , from the University ’s Magnetic Resonance and Image Analysis Research Centre , ( MARIARC ) , explains : “ The effect on the brain is a bit like a magic trick ; we know what the trick means but not how it happened .
Instead of being confused by this in a negative sense , the brain is positively excited .
The brain signature is relatively uneventful when we understand the meaning of a word but when the word changes the grammar of the whole sentence , brain readings suddenly peak .
The brain is then forced to retrace its thinking process in order to understand what it is supposed to make of this unusual word . ”
Professor Roberts and Professor Davis together with Dr Guillaune Thierry , from the University of Wales , Bangor , monitored 20 participants using an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) as they read selected lines from Shakespeare ’s plays .
In this initial test electrodes were placed on the subject ’s scalp to measure brain responses .
Professor Roberts said : “ EEG gives graph - like measurements and when the brain reads a sentence that does not make semantic sense it registers what we call a N400 effect – a negative wave modulation .
When the brain reads a grammatically incorrect sentence it registers a P600 effect – an effect which continues to last after the word that triggered it was first read . ”
Researchers also found that when participants read the word producing the functional shift there was no N400 effect indicating that the meaning was accepted but a P600 effect was observed which indicates a positive re-evaluation of the word .
The team is now using magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( FMI ) to test which areas of the brain are most affected and the kind of impact it could have in maintaining healthy brain activity .
Professor Davis added : “ This interdisciplinary work is good for brain science because it offers permanent scripts of the human mind working moment - to - moment .
It is good for literature as it illustrates primary human thinking .
Through the two disciplines , we may discover new insights into the very motions of the mind . ”

先日のライブドアのテクノロジーセミナ ー( http://d.hatena.ne.jp/naoya/20061214/1166063145)でも少し触れたのですが、はてなのサーバーは今後さくらインターネットのiDCでホストすることになりました。
複数の iDC を検討しましたが、最終的にさくらインターネットに決めた理由は回線品質の高さと回線が低価格である点でした。
はてなのようなコミュニティ中心のサービスは、お金の面では、どうしても回線コストと収益の間にアンバランスが生じがちです。ショッピングサイトや各種メディアのようなコンテンツに比べてマネタイズが難しい、というのがその主な理由です。
例えばはてなのトラフィックの多くははてなダイアリーの日記へのアクセスで占められていますが、基本的に個人の日記にははてな側からは広告を掲載しないポリシーでいます。そのためトラフィックを多数必要とされる箇所で収益をあげることができず、なんとかそのコストを他のページであがった収益でまかなう必要が出てきます。商売指向のサイトでないことの皺寄せは、こういったところに来るというのがおそらく同業者の共通認識でしょう。
同じようにコミュニティサービスをやっている
Mixi や
Gree がさくらインターネットを選択しているのには、おそらくこういった懐事情も結構あるのではないかなと思います。昨今ウェブで流行しはじめたサービスはどれも似たような傾向を持つものが多いので、さくらインターネットのような回線価格で勝負している業者の需要は今後も増していくのではないかと予想しています。
あと、さくらインターネットの社長の笹田さんが
MMORPG の EverQuest ( 以下EQ ) オタクで、同社の主なメンバーは EQ のギルドで一緒にやってた仲間から集めたとか言ってまして、同じくヘビーに
EQ にはまっていた僕とシンパシーを感じまくったというのも選定の理由です。いや、選定の理由だったのは嘘。
さて、 「移行」と一言で言ってもシステム作業的には結構な労力を必要とします。その作業をつい昨日行ってきました。本格的な iDC の利用開始という意味ではてなにとって非常に大きな意味をもった一日だったと思います。せっかくなので、写真撮影の許可もいただいたことだし、その様子をちょっとレポートしてみようと思います。データセンターの裏側を見れる機会ってのもそんなにないことですしね。サービスの裏側ってどうなってるのかなー、という方は是非写真と一緒に想像を働かせてみてください。
まずはオフィスで事前準備。以前京都から東京に引っ越してきたときとは規模も違うので、いきなり既存サービスを止めつつごっそり移行というわけではなく、今回は少しずつやっていく方針です。
最初の1ラックで使うサーバーを用意します。サーバーは例によって自社製フレームに収まったこんな見てくれのもの。
これだけの台数が並ぶと結構壮観です。OS
をインストールしたり、稼動させるサービス用の各種サーバーをセットアップしたりを行います。最近僕がしきりに言ってる
LVS も VRRP で冗長化して、ばっちりです。
今回持っていくサーバーは台数がそれほど多くないので、自分たちで車で運ぶことにしました。あくまで自分たちで、それがはてなクオリティ。車内の振動でサーバーが壊れないように梱包します。
と、全部自作とみせかけておきながら、本格的 iDC の利用開始ということで、いわゆる 1U サーバーもちょっと使って使用感を試したいと思い、2台ほど持っていくことにしました。写真は
Sun Fire X2200 M2 と X2100 M2 です。CPU は Opteron で、OS は Linux です。はてなサーバーに比べるとえらくかっこいい。萌える。いや、比べる対象が間違ってる。
社用車のインプレッサにみんなで積み込む。普段あまり車は使わないはてな社ですが、この日は大活躍でした。
幹事マン運転のもと、いざ出発! ほかメンバーは交通機関で追いかけます。
で、到着 (早)
後続組みが追いかけた過程もご報告といきたいところですが、iDC
はその性格上通常は場所とかは秘密なんです。すいません。適当に想像してください。
にやけながらラックの扉をあけます...
これがおれたちの新しい城じゃーーー!!!!
と盛り上がる一同。いや、ほんとに。ここ盛り上がるとこですから!
旧サーバールー ムLANと新iDC LANの間での通信が移行が完了するまでしばらく必要なので、内部ネットワーク同士を
VPN で結んであります。あらかじめさくらさんで設置してくださった
VPN 関連のスイッチがマウントされています。
ラックの底はこんな具合で空洞になってます。
遊ぶ場所間違ってますから、社長。
気を取り直して、まず は Sun Fire をマウントします。レールを先に取り付けます。iDC
での作業経験者が一人もいなかいこともあって、結構苦戦。レールの取り付けはおそらく手馴れても一人だと難しそう。二人で両脇から作業をすると効率がよさそうです。
苦労してレールを取り付けて、いざ Sun Fire をマウント ...
ぬおおお、かっこええー ! と大騒ぎになりました。が、ここで事件発生。裏表間違ってます、先輩。工工エエｴｴ（´Д｀）ｴｴエエ工工。ということで気を取り直してやり直し。
レールを付け直し、慎重に一台ずつマウントしていきます。レールにそって
1U サーバーが収まっていく瞬間はなんとも言えない爽快さがあります。
ぬおお、かっこいい ...。というかこれがサーバーだよね。自社製サーバーしかみたことない id : kiyohero がはじめて Sun Fire をみたときに 「 これ何ですか !?
もしかしてサーバーですか?!
これほんとに動くんですか!」と言い放ったのは歴史に残る一コマだったと思います。動くっちゅうねん。
裏から見るとこんな感じ。改めて萌えますね。
サーバーもマウントできたところで、ネットワークの設定もはじめます。あらかじめ高速回線とつながった
Ethernet ケーブルが配置されているので、自分たちのルーターにそれをくっつけつつ設定などを行います。
手分けして、自社製サーバーもラックに積んでいきます。力仕事、がんばれおまいら。
なんか写真ばっか撮ってて仕事してないように見える僕ですが、ちゃんとやってますよ。これ証拠写真ね。
途中いくつかトラブルもありましたが( LVS
設定ばっちり !
と思ってたけど例によって LVS の設定ではまりましたｗ )
、無事全サーバーの搭載を完了し、ネットワークの疎通を確認中。iDC
に設置したけどネットワーク疎通してないよ!
とかなるとまた戻ってこないといけませんからね。この辺りは慎重に。ちょっとケーブルが絡まってますが、ご愛嬌。この辺はおいおい整理していきます。
ネットワーク開通を確認して、iDC 立ち上げ第一段階完了。広い iDC でみんなで大騒ぎして帰ってきました 。
自社製のへんてこなサーバーを持ち込みも
OK でしたし 、VPN の構築とかもかなりスムーズにやってもらって、さくらインターネット++
でした。当日、自社製サーバーを置く棚板が、本来想定していたものと違っていたのですが、すぐに別の iDC から希望通りのものを持ってきてくれたりもしました。
そんなこんなで iDC の立ち上げ1ラック目が完了しました。いまはこのラックで動かすサービスの最終調整をリモートから行っています。
今後も気が向いたら、更にラックが増えて拡大していく様子もレポートしてみたいと思います。お楽しみに。
The beat goes on in the world of file - sharing litigation .
Earlier this week , the case against Patti Santangelo was dismissed without prejudice and refiled , this time naming two of her children as defendants .
In another closely followed case , UMG v. Lindor , a federal judge has ruled that the RIAA will have to show that Lindor actually shared music , a higher burden than demonstrating that she made the files available for download .
Judge David G. Trager ruled that when the case goes to trial , " plaintiffs will have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant did indeed infringe plaintiff 's copyrights by convincing the fact - finder , based on the evidence plaintiffs have gathered , that defendant actually shared sound files belonging to plaintiffs . "
In Electra v. Perez , another judge held that making files available for distribution was enough to prove infringement .
Since that case was dismissed without prejudice , there is little likelihood that the ruling in that case will be precedent setting .
UMG v. Lindor appears headed for trial next year unless one of the parties blinks .
With today 's ruling , it appears that the record labels will have to demonstrate that someone actually infringed on their copyrights by downloading music from Lindor 's computer .
That 's a step beyond the RIAA 's argument that making files available for download constitutes infringement .
Keep in mind that since none of the file - sharing cases have actually made it to trial , there is little indication of how a judge will respond to the arguments put forth by both sides .
1 ) What is this controversy about ?
2 ) How is this film inaccurate ?
3 ) Why is this significant ?
4 ) What are you looking for ?
5 ) Why would ABC do this ?
6 ) Why would Tom Kean lend his reputation to such a film ?
7 ) Who are you ?
On September 10 and 11 , ABC Television is planning to run a historically inaccurate film called ' The Path to 9/11 ' depicting the events leading up to the 9/11 attacks .
The film was written by a conservative activist who has called Michael Moore an ' out of control Socialist weasel ' , and who has an avowed conservative agenda .
' The Path to 9/11 ' largely places the blame for failing to prevent the attacks on the Clinton administration while whitewashing the failures of the Bush administration .
One key scene involves Clinton National Security advisor Sandy Berger refusing to order the CIA to take out bin Laden , a frequently cited right - wing fabrication that has been discredited , most recently by Richard Clarke
We would document other inaccuracies , but preview copies of the film have not been sent to left - wing bloggers .
As copies trickle out , we will put a blogroll up on the side of this side linking to inaccuracies that have been uncovered .
Aside from the tragic dishonesty surrounding 9/11 inherent in the film , there is a massive marketing push to turn this film into an established version of what happened .
The film is being marketed as 'an objective telling of the events of 9/11 , and promos for the film are claiming that it is largely based on the 9/11 Commission report .
Republican Tom Kean
Sr has been a prominent and public advisor to the project , but no Democratic members of the 9/11 Commission have been represented .
While marketed aggressively through advance copies among right - wing bloggers , radio hosts , and pundits , no left - wing bloggers have been given access to the film until this week , and left - wing bloggers were nearly prevented from attending a press conference with Tom Kean Sr advocating on behalf of the film .
Finally , ABC is planning to distribute this film free through iTunes and ABC.com , with a letter from Tom Kean Sr. to 100,000 educators encouraging the use of this film for educational purposes .
We are looking for ABC to take the following steps .-
ABC needs to remove outright fabrications in the film , or refuse to air it .
We will try to catalogue link to those debunking errors in the film .
So far , Thinkprogress is the most comprehensive site - Prior to airing the film , ABC should explicitly call this a work of fiction , and say that this does not represent the findings of the 9/11 Commission .
ABC should stop using any and all promotional material linking the film to the 9/11 Commission findings .-
ABC should publicly list the marketing operators responsible for hiding this film from left - wing opinion leaders . -
ABC should not send 100,000 letters to educators , or should send follow - up letters warning educators about the inaccuracies in the film .
Honestly , we 're not sure .
Disney / ABC is either unaware of the political ramifications of airing this fabrication , or is willfully and maliciously producing and distributing false propaganda .
We hope that Robert Iger , President of Disney , considers his reputation and that of Disney and ABC before allowing this to be aired .
We assume it 's because Tom Kean Sr 's son , whose name is also Tom Kean , is running for Senate in New Jersey , largely based on his father 's reputation .
Tom Kean Jr. has for instance droppd the ' Jr ' from his campaign 's website .
We 're not entirely sure why Tom Kean Sr. decided to throw away his reputation on such a sordid propaganda piece , but that 's our best guess .
We are a group of activists that are trying to provide one place for content about the controversy over the film ' Path to 9/11 ' .

Here ’s what happens when this irresponsible Congress railroads a profoundly important bill to serve the mindless politics of a midterm election :
The Bush administration uses Republicans ’ fear of losing their majority to push through ghastly ideas about antiterrorism that will make American troops less safe and do lasting damage to our 217 - year - old nation of laws — while actually doing nothing to protect the nation from terrorists .
Democrats betray their principles to avoid last - minute attack ads .
Our democracy is the big loser .
Republicans say Congress must act right now to create procedures for charging and trying terrorists — because the men accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks are available for trial .
That ’s pure propaganda .
Those men could have been tried and convicted long ago , but President Bush chose not to .
He held them in illegal detention , had them questioned in ways that will make real trials very hard , and invented a transparently illegal system of kangaroo courts to convict them .
It was only after the Supreme Court issued the inevitable ruling striking down Mr. Bush ’s shadow penal system that he adopted his tone of urgency .
It serves a cynical goal : Republican strategists think they can win this fall , not by passing a good law but by forcing Democrats to vote against a bad one so they could be made to look soft on terrorism .
Last week , the White House and three Republican senators announced a terrible deal on this legislation that gave Mr. Bush most of what he wanted , including a blanket waiver for crimes Americans may have committed in the service of his antiterrorism policies .
Then Vice President Dick Cheney and his willing lawmakers rewrote the rest of the measure so that it would give Mr. Bush the power to jail pretty much anyone he wants for as long as he wants without charging them , to unilaterally reinterpret the Geneva Conventions , to authorize what normal people consider torture , and to deny justice to hundreds of men captured in error .
As many of you know , I used to develop a XUL browser extension known as the Preferences Toolbar .
The original idea for such a thing was not mine , but as the person who thought of it lacked either the knowledge , time , or will to actually implement such a thing , I took it upon myself to do so .
The original preferences toolbar had ten or so built in preferences , displayed as checkboxes on the toolbar from which the corresponding mozilla preference could be enabled or disabled .
I was completely taken back by how successful it was .
I started getting dozens of emails every week telling me how great the toolbar was .
I heard from not only programmer and mozilla hackers , but also from PhDs and corporate executives , people who called the PrefBar things like “ the best extension ever written , ” and “ this is what I have been waiting for since the Internet was invented . ”
The PrefBar was even featured on the cable network TechTV during a show about new technological trends .
This was , needless to say , the closest I ever got to being famous .
The second version of the PrefBar was a complete rewrite .
This time the toolbar was completely customizable , with dozens of checkboxes , buttons , links , menus and other widgets configurable to do just about anything .
In addition to the over two dozen built in buttons , users could add their own through an easy to use graphical interface .
( This was , I should point out , before customizable toolbars existed in what would later become the Firefox web browser ; that made the PrefBar the first fully customizable XUL toolbar ever built ) .
If the response to the original PrefBar had been big , the reaction to version two was huge .
I believe it was , for a time , the most downloaded XUL extension in existence .
Although plagued with naming problems , the Phoenix ( later Firebird , then Firefox ) project was starting to take shape , mozilla ’s market share was creeping up , and it looked like everything we had been working for for so long was about to become a reality .
As luck would have it , it was right about that time that I had to take an extended hiatus from mozilla and XUL work .
It was in the Spring of 2003 , and I had just found out that I would shortly be leaving for Brazil , where I would be living until the latter half of 2005 .
I do n’t need to go into the details here , other than to say that I knew that I would be unable to do any work on any of my then existing projects ( including the PrefBar ) during all that time .
Knowing how popular the extension was , and how many people relied on it for everyday web browsing , I wanted to try to make sure that PrefBar development continued in my absence .
I understood then , as I understood now , that if I were to put the PrefBar in anyone else ’s hands , it probably would still be around when I got back , but it would n’t by mine anymore .
Still , I felt that , for the good of the world , that was the right thing to do .
I did not , however , feel comfortable leaving the tool in the hands of any single other person that I knew .
Instead , I created a mozdev project called prefbar .
mozdev.org , moved the PrefBar source over to it , and then began asking around to see if I could find someone who wanted to be the project leader in my absence .
With only a few days left before my departure ( from the US and from the mozilla world ) , I found someone willing to fulfill that role .
I do not know his real name , but he went by the screen name clav .
I also found one other individual ( although I have since forgotten who it was ) who was interested in working on the project .
In one of the last emails I sent him before I left , I told clav that he need not consider that the PrefBar was still mine .
I knew how difficult it would be to maintain a project always wondering if the person who started it would like or agree with the decisions you were making or the direction you were taking , and I came to the conclusion that having such issues would be detrimental to the PrefBar project .
Rather , I told him to do what he saw fit until I returned , at which point we could ( if he still wished to help with the project ) work on it as a team .
Clav thanked me for my sencerity , and I left for South America hoping that all none of the thousands of PrefBar users out there would be disappointed or left without a compatible update during my absence .
Now , fast forward two years .
Upon returning from Brazil , I looked up the PrefBar project , and was pleased to see that several new versions had been released .
It appeared that things were going exactly as I had wanted them to .
I did not , however , immediately attempt to contact clav or the other developers , because I was still in the process of getting things setup in my new house , new computer , new job , etc .
I had plans to return to PrefBar work as soon as possible , my goal being the first part of 2006 .
Now , here ’s where it gets interesting .
About a month ago , I started getting emails and comments on my blog asking when I would have an updated PrefBar that was compatible with Firefox 1.5 .
Even though I had not yet attempted to get back into the PrefBar project , people had apparently remembered that I was the one who started the tool and sought me out to ask about future updates .
One individual even said that his wife , who is visually impaired , cannot normally use the Internet without the PrefBar ’s ability to quickly turn on and off website defined colors .
I returned to the prefbar mozdev page and saw that there had not been a prefbar update since September .
I also noticed that clav was no longer listed on the project members page .
Instead I found only my own name , and one Manuel Reimer ( who I did not know ) .
Not being in contact with Mr. Reimer , and not knowing if he was even working on the PrefBar anymore , I grabbed the latest PrefBar build from mozdev and set out to make the changes necessary to achieve compatibility with Firefox 1.5 .
This was n’t as easy as it would have been two years ago , since even though the PrefBar functionality had remained mostly unchanged , much of the backend code had been rewritten .
However , I was able to come up with a version that worked , even though it was very much a hack , not a real quality release .
I then sent an email to Manuel Reimer , using an address that I found on mozdev , telling his who I was , how I had hacked together Firefox 1.5 compatibility , and asking that we get together some time to talk about the status and future of the PrefBar , in order that I might be able to get back onto the development team .
Three days after having posted my PrefBar update hack , I still had not received a reply to the email I had sent to Mr. Reimer ( although he later said he sent one , so it ’s possible it got lost somewhere ) .
I also noticed ( when someone pointed it out to me in the blog comments ) that there was now an official PrefBar release for Firefox 1.5 on the mozdev project page .
Realizing that this release was likely of much higher quality than mine , I posted to my blog again suggesting that everyone download that build instead of mine .
I also sent another email to Manuel Reimer , letting him know that I wanted to start working on the PrefBar again ( hopefully in cooperation with him , and anyone else that might have been working with him ) , and suggesting that we get together on IRC to talk about it .
This time , I got a reply from Mr. Reimer .
In response to my saying that I wanted to work on the PrefBar team with him , he wrote the following :
… If there is one thing I do n’t need now , then it is someone who wants to get credit for the work I did .
This was the biggest fear I had the whole years when I did many hours , days , weeks ( months ? ) of work for PrefBar .
Currently anything works well and PrefBar development has beenalways fun .
( I hope those sentences do n’t sound too hard .
I ’m german and my english is n’t perfect .
And I want to be frank with you ) .
Currently I ’m the only one who works on PrefBar .
With update to 3.x I had rewritten nearly every line of PrefBar code .
This is also the reason why my name is on most files as “ Initial developer ” . …
Through this email and a very long conversation IRC later in the day , I learned a bit more about Mr Reimer and the PrefBar project .
I seems that shortly after I left , Manuel found the mozdev project and contacted clav asking to join in as a developer .
This was done , and he started fixing bugs and adding features .
Shortly thereafter , clav ( for reasons I do not know ) left the project , leaving Manuel Reimer as the sole and only developer .
For at least the last year and a half , Mr. Reimer was serving as the owner of and only person on the PrefBar project .
As such , he had during this time full power and control over all new features and code that went into the tool .
Manuel , of course , had not been involved in the conversations that clav and I engaged in when I first started the mozdev project .
He had not heard my promise to not attempt to forcefully “ take back ” the prefbar upon returning , nor had he made clav ’s promise to work on it with me as a team when I eventually did so .
He likely knew very little about me other than the fact that I had started the project , developed it for several years , eventually left , and that I was due to return in the fall of 2005 .
Through conversing with him on IRC , I learned that Mr. Reimer had gotten the idea that when I returned I was going to attempt to do exactly what I had ( in reality ) explicitly promised not to do , that is , attempt to kick out other developers and run the PrefBar myself .
His comments to me about not wanting someone ( that is , me ) trying to “ take credit for the work he did ” was based on this belief and opinion about me .
I must say explicitly that I am not the person Manuel thinks I am , nor am I trying to do what he ( apparently still ) thinks that I wish to do .
I am not trying to “ steal back ” the PrefBar for myself , nor am I trying to get credit for any of the work that he had done on it in the last few years .
I intend to retain my side of the bargain , but I expected that the other side of the deal would be maintained as well .
The problem , however , is that Manuel Reimer , I now know , has no interest in working on a team with anyone .
After almost two years of having full power and control over the program , he does not wish to give up any of that power to anther team member .
He suggested that I could work on the PrefBar project , as long it remained clear that the PrefBar was “ his ” now , and that he would have full authority to make all decisions regarding any and all important issues .
In other words , I have been invited to return to my old project , as long as I do so under complete subjection to the will and ways of Mr. Manuel Reimer .
My suggestion that , with a little empathy and humility on both sides , we could work as equal partners , 50 - 50 if you will , was rejected , with him insisting that someone had to be in charge ( ” every project needs an owner ” ) and ( obviously , since he ’s had it to himself for so long ) that owner should be him .
I am now in somewhat of a difficult place , not knowing what would be the best or correct thing to do in this situation .
I find the way I have been treated by Mr. Reimer to be more than a little bit impolite and inconsiderate .
I understand and appreciate the much work he has put into the Preferences Toolbar in the last few years , and am in no way attempting to take credit for this work , nor prevent him from continuing to do so in the future .
I am aware also that his lack of advanced English skills makes it more difficult for him understand the points I am trying to make , and easier for him to misinterpret what I say so that it falls in line with the idea of me that he currently has in his head .
However , I do not think it should be so difficult for him to understand that as the creator of the program and of the mozdev project , I do have some right to expect that the agreement under which the latter was originally organized be maintained , the which agreement created a project comprised not of one totalitarian ruler and his subjects , but a team of equal partners .
I maintain my belief that , with a little respect , empathy , and humility on all sides , such an arrangement is not only practical , but the best way of so working .
I appeal therefore to the wise readers of this blog for opinions and suggestions .
What would be the correct thing to do in this situation ?
Should I continue my attempts to convince Mr. Reimer to accept work as a team , agree to work under his authority , or initiate a fork of the project , allowing myself and Mr. Reimer to go our sperate ways and develop two different tools according to our own skills and priorities ?
The last option is one that I wanted ( both two years ago and today ) to avoid at all costs , but it seems that it may soon by the only one left .
I will say , however , that if there is a fork , I will insist that the name “ PrefBar ” and the prefbar mozdev project I started two years ago remain with me ( along with any other developers that wish to work on the team ) .
In saying all this , I do not wish to appear rude , power hungry , or false in any way .
It is still my hope that this situation can be resolved in a way that wo n’t leave anyone feeling left out or cheated .
However , because of the large number of inquires I have received regarding the current status of the PrefBar , I thought it only fair that interested parties know the current situation .
I will post an update when I have one .
Until then , your ideas are welcome ( and requested ) in the comments section .

10 Jahre Telepolis Michaela Simon
Ein Rückblick
1
Auf Parties immer gern gestellt : Die Frage , wie man Telepolis auszusprechen habe ?
Mit der Betonung auf der ersten Silbe wie Teelicht oder Telenovela ?
Oder auf der zweiten - Telépolis wie Gelée ?
Humanistisch , gleichsam auf der dritten Silbe den derrière betonend : TelePOlis ?
Oder auf der vierten Silbe , auf dem lis , so wie in " Ich muss noch meine Versicherungspolice bezahlen " .
Das erste Logo
2
Die Wahrheit - zumindest unsere - hat viele Gesichter .
In jedem der zig Büros der Telepolisredaktion - welche ja außer unseren Räumen in der Truderingerstrasse auch aus den deren Computer beherbergenden hochinteressanten Büros , Arbeits - Schlaf - und Wohnzimmern unserer über 100 Autoren besteht , prononciert man den Namen nach Lust und Laune .
Und wer sind wir , dass wir einander Vorschriften machten - außer wenn es um Abgabetermine geht .
3
Florian Rötzer selbst nennt Telepolis " T'lepl 'is " .
Das spart Zeit .
Seit er Telepolis erfand , hat er nur noch wenig davon .
4
Man schrieb November 95 und Florian Rötzer , studierter Philosoph , zum damaligen Zeitpunkt Journalist , Kurator , Suhrkampautor und Herausgeber kluger Bücher , war mit seinen Kollegen beim Medienlabor München gebeten worden , einen Beitrag zum Programm " Luxemburg Kulturstadt Europas ' 95 " zu leisten .
So ersann er sich ein " Gesellschaftliches Labor " nebst Webjournal und überlegte den Namen dafür : " Ich dachte an die ferne Stadt , Telefon , Telebeamen , Tele ...
Eine virtuelle Stadt als Metapher für die Möglichkeiten des Cyberspace . "
5
Die Folgen dieses virtuellen Städtebaus : Begeisterung , die sich auf verschiedene Weisen ausdrückte .
Kollegenlob .
Pressehymnen .
Viele , die mitmachen wollten .
Ein paar , die versuchten , sich den Namen zu stehlen .
In Spanien und Belgien gibt es seitdem auch ein Telepolis .
Und dann der renommierte Heise - Verlag , welcher sich , aufgrund des Engagements von Jürgen Fey und des Wagemuts von Steven Steinkraus , Ende 1995 entschloss , eine Telepolis - Redaktion zu gründen , die auch schon Anfang 1996 ihre Arbeit aufnahm .
Mit Florian Rötzer und Armin Medosch am Steuer .
Hinzu kamen Michael " Schubi " Schuberthan als künstlerisch äußerst anspruchsvoller Grafiker und der genialische Webmaster Joachim Schlesener .
" Es geht darum , die Faszination an der Virtualität und der Tele - Existenz aufzugreifen , ohne ihr zu verfallen " , so die erste Selbstbeschreibung von 1996 , " Jenseits der üblichen Sparten und ohne Suggestion von großartigen Versprechungen und katastrophalen Ängsten diskutiert Telepolis die gesellschaftlichen , künstlerischen und politischen Herausforderungen und Chancen der Informationsgesellschaft . "
6
Telepolis erscheint im ersten Jahr - nicht unbedingt webgemäß - ohne Forum und in unregelmäßig aufeinander folgenden Ausgaben .
Die Artikel haben , wie Aufsätze , einen Vorspann und einen Schluss ; jedes einzelne Kapitel will auch einzeln angeklickt werden - eine Form von Klicksummierung , die schnell wieder aufgegeben wird .
Früh werden Hypes wie die kalifornische Ideologie oder " The Long Boom " - euphorisch aufgegriffen etwa von Wired - Kollegen - analysiert und kritisch bewertet .
Die ersten Themenschwerpunkte sind Telepolis , die Stadt am Netz , sowie " Agenten und Artificial Life " .
Die Redaktion schwingt sich zu philosophischen Höchstleistungen auf , und schließlich wird auch die Große Müdigkeit diskutiert , ein Thema , das uns auch heute noch jeden Morgen beschäftigt .
7
Etwas anderes wird in dieser ersten Zeit ausprobiert , trainiert , vervollkommnet : Das kalkulierte Spiel mit dem Leser .
Unvergessen , ein Hoax , der aufschreckte :
Als nämlich Telepolis sich wie eine Abozeitung gerierte : " Als zahlender Abonnent unseres Magazins erhalten Sie Zugang zur deutschen und englischen Ausgabe mit allen Artikeln !
Sie können die beiden vorausgegangenen Ausgaben kostenlos nach Artikeln durchsuchen , die Sie verpaßt haben ! "
Die Empörung der Leser war groß , bis sie begriffen , dass das ein Witz war .
8
Denn die Macher von Telepolis glauben allen Ernstes an die Freiheit der Information .
Dass das Internet eine Brücke sei , die aus lauter kleinen Brücken bestehe .
Weshalb in Telepolis alle Quellen miteinander verlinkt werden - hinführende wie weiterführende Informationen .
Ganz ehrlich :
So exzessiv wie wir machen das nicht viele .
Dass wir damit und mit dem frei zugänglichen Archiv einen Service bieten , der in so Manchem die Vorstellung weckt , wir wären ein kostenloser Recherchedienst , kann uns nur schmeicheln .
Immer wieder erreichen uns Emails von Studenten und Schülern , die uns höflich , aber dringend auffordern , Informationsmaterial ( etwa zum Thema Kopierschutz ) zusammen zu tragen und ihnen zuzuschicken .
Vielleicht gibt es demnächst bei Telepolis einen virtuellen Agenten , der bei Bedarf auch ganze Seminararbeiten verfasst ...
9
Die Goldgräberzeit der Endneunziger : Berühmtheiten wie Science - Fiction - Guru Stanislaw Lem , Mark Amerika , Douglas Rushkoff , Howard Bloom , Michael Goldhaber ( Theorie der Aufmerksamkeitsökonomie ) sowie Architekturtheoretiker Martin Pawley raufen sich für Telepolis die Haare .
Nicht zu übersehen : Jene neuralgischen
Themen , welche , bevor sie von allen anderen aufgegriffen wurden , bereits in Telepolis sehr unhysterisch und besonnen verhandelt werden :
Als einer der ersten schreibt Florian Rötzer im Februar 1998 ausführlich über das globale Überwachungssystem Echelon Der Große Bruder hört mit .
Zudem veröffentlicht Telepolis in Kooperation Christiane Schulzki-Haddouti und Erich Möchel 1998 ein Arbeitspapier der EU , das die aktuellen und zukünftigen Entwicklungen im Bereich der Überwachungstechnologien vorstellt .
In einer Aufsehen erregenden Artikelserie werden die Enfopol - Pläne zur flächendeckenden Überwachung von TK - Systemen enthüllt .
Es erscheint der erste Band der Telepolis - Buchreihe : " Vom Ende der Anonymität .
Die Globalisierung der Überwachung " wird von Christiane Schulzki - Haddouti herausgegeben .
10
Im Sommer 2000 kam Unterzeichnete als drittes Redaktionsmitglied dazu .
Telepolis hatte für seine Enfopol - Berichterstattung soeben den Europäischen Preis für Online - Journalismus der Medien - Konferenz Net - Media 2000 in der Kategorie " Investigative Reporting " bekommen .
Der unregelmäßige Erscheinungszyklus war bereits einer täglichen Aktualitätspflicht gewichen , eine Pflicht , die sich bald auch auf das Wochenende ausdehnte .
Der TP - Wissenschaftsteil sollte nun erweitert und intensiviert werden .
Von den Printmedien kommend , machte ich schnell überwältigende Erfahrungen mit der Kraft und Unmittelbarkeit des neuen Mediums .
Die Stimmung in manchen Redaktionen wird oft mit der in einem Haifischbecken verglichen .
Bei Telepolis beginnt das Haifischbecken am Ende des Artikels .
Im Forum .
Ich fand mich beschimpft , zerkaut und sämtlicher Gliedmaßen beraubt .
Hierbei läuft , man merkt es mit der Zeit , auch eine Art Initiationsritus ab , bei welchem neue Autoren stets erstmal " ihr Fett abkriegen " .
Ein gut Teil unserer Redaktionsarbeit besteht darin , irritierte , fassungslose und tödlich beleidigte Autoren zu besänftigen .
So mancher hat nach seinem Debüt sofort wieder die Segel gestrichen .
Andere wiederum sind beglückt über die Aufmerksamkeit und machen sich einen Sport daraus , ihre Leser zu provozieren .
( vgl. Ein Ring , sie zu knechten , sie ewig zu binden .. ) .
Bis zum Tag , an dem wir das Modell des Heise - Tickers übernahmen , waren die Foren ohne Registrierung zugänglich .
Was den Übermut förderte und auch zu internen Streichen führte .
Grafiker Schubi Schuberthan erzählt gerne , wie er sich einen Nachmittag damit vergnügte , unter falschem Namen Gemeinheiten in das Forum eines tadellosen Artikels von Armin Medosch zu schreiben und sich über dessen gequälte Rechtfertigungen zu freuen .
Aber von all den vielen Ärgerlichkeiten und Flames abgesehen , die uns immer im Trab halten und ob mancher ideologischer Scheuklappen ächzen lassen : Die Foren sind das A und O von Telepolis .
Und immer wieder ein Beweis für die große Klugheit unserer Leser .
Sie sehen jeden noch so kleinen ( oder auch noch so großen ) Fehler und Schludrigkeiten , wodurch immer mal wieder der Ruf nach einem Lektor ertönt .
Sie ertappen uns bei jeder Denkfaulheit .
Sie geben weiterführende Hinweise .
Sie verteidigen uns .
Sie nehmen uns und einander ernst ( meistens ) .
Die heftigen Diskussionen im TP - Forum sind oft ein Marker für Themen , die in unserer Gesellschaft schwelen - und eben nach einem Forum verlangen .
Wir löschen sehr selten Beiträge , nur in Fällen , in denen deutliche Drohungen oder rassistische Beleidigungen formuliert werden .
Es ist nicht selten , dass bis zu 1000 Beiträge unter einem Artikel stehen , rekordverdächtig ist dieser Kandidat mit mittlerweile 95 Forenseiten .
11
2001 : das Jahr der Lebenswissenschaften , der Internetkrise und der Anschläge auf das WTC .
Sie verändern auch das Netz.
Start - Ups krachen ein , mit ihnen die Anzeigenkunden - und viele Onlinezeitungen verschwinden so schnell , wie sie gekommen sind .
Telepolis bleibt - sagt den Ruf nach mehr Überwachung voraus und berichtet : " Bereits wenige Stunden nach den Angriffen hatten Sicherheitskräfte etlichen US - Providern einen Besuch abgestattet . " ( vgl. Verunsicherung bei Big Brother - Gegnern ? )
Das ohnehin schon fragile Gleichgewicht zwischen Freiheit und Sicherheit wird mit neuer Verve in Frage gestellt .
Telepolis macht kritische Beobachtungen im Umfeld der US - amerikanischen Realitätsbewältigung : " Do n't trust authorities !
Think for yourself ! " , fordert Mathias Bröckers in seiner viel beachteten - und auch viel geschmähten - Artikelreihe The WTC Conspiracy .
In diesem Jahr verdoppeln sich die Klickzahlen auf 3 Millionen im Dezember 2001 .
Die Entwicklung der Klicks lässt sich übrigens bis zum Mai 1997 zurückverfolgen .
Stolze 50.000 waren es in diesem Monat , ein Jahr später liegen sie bei 240.000 , im Dezember 2000 waren es bereits 1,5 Millionen .
Im Januar 2006 liegen die Zugriffe bei 11,2 Millionen .
Gute Zahlen , die nicht darüber hinwegtäuschen können , dass die Krise des Internet auch heute noch andauert .
12
Telepolis geht 2002 in das schmerzlichste Jahr seiner Existenz .
Die Freude über den Grimme Online Award in der Kategorie Medienjournalismus wird durch einen dramatischen Einschnitt überschattet : Betriebsbedingt muss der Verlag das Budget drastisch kürzen und Armin Medosch verlässt die Redaktion .
Die Autoren arbeiten nun für deutlich kleinere Honorare - viele bleiben dennoch bei uns .
Härtestes Fachwissen , elegante Theorien , teuflisch guter Geschmack , Medienkompetenz , und eine nahezu fanatische Gründlichkeit .
Das alles noch gepaart mit Humor , Persönlichkeit und einem unverwechselbaren Schreibstil - so darf man sich den typischen Tp - Autor vorstellen .
13
Was in Telepolis immer noch fehlt : regelmäßige Fernsehtipps , chinesische Horoskope , leckere Rezepte , Modestrecken , Agenturmeldungen .
14
Woran Thomas Pany und Wolf - Dieter Roth in der Redaktion nichts ändern werden ( auch wenn sie Fußball im Visier haben ) : Seit 2001 widmet sich Pany verstärkt den neuen Öffentlichkeiten in islamischen Ländern und der wachsenden Bedeutung des Internet für den Islam .
Wolf - Dieter Roth baut 2004 das erfolgreiche und werberfreundliche Special Geek Tools auf .
2004 erhält Telepolis den Lead - Award in der Kategorie " Special Interest " .
Weitere Telepolis - Stärken : Weltraum , Bio-Wissenschaft , Copyright , Informationsfreiheit , Memetik - und natürlich " Schubi " Schuberthans legendär schweres Rätsel .
15
Florian Rötzers unheimliche Produktivität ist für seine Mitarbeiter immer wieder Anlass zu neidvoller Verzweiflung .
Rufe wie " Würde es nicht reichen , wenn du EINEN Artikel am Tag schriebest ? " verhallen ungehört .
Dabei ist er vom
Typ her aufgeschlossen und freundlich und lässt sich jederzeit gerne ablenken , sei es um über Politik , Hunde , das Wetter oder den schlechten Wein in Griechenland zu plaudern .
16
Wie es weitergeht ?
Im Web 2.0 , mit ausgelöst durch die Blogger - und die OpenSource - Bewegung , sollen die Stärken des WWW wieder wichtig werden .
Offenheit , leichter Datenaustausch , Freiheit und Interaktion zwischen verschiedenen Systemen .
Die nächste Runde aktiver Start - Ups steht schon bereit .
" Revving the Web " war die Devise einer Web 2.0 Konferenz im Oktober letzten Jahres .
Das Web voll aufdrehen .
Doch auch in der Euphorie für die neuen Webentwicklungen ist nicht alles Gold .
Der in Telepolis vorhergesagte Einbruch der Google - Aktie ( vgl. Google - Crash ante portas ? ) erinnert an das Get - Rich - Quick - Syndrom des vergangenen Internet - Bubble .
Dennoch : Die Hoffnung auf mehr Einnahmen durch Online - Werbung scheint sich langsam , aber stetig zu erfüllen .
Das hängt sicherlich auch damit zusammen , dass die Online - Angebote zunehmend angenommen werden .
Printjournalisten etwa , die sich ausschließlich durch Printmedien informieren , gehören einer aussterbenden Spezies an .
All jene aber , die heute von sich sagen , dass sie " lieber trommeln als mailen " und nur Zeitungen lesen , die " rascheln " , all jene dürfen wir dann eben in fünf Jahren bei uns begrüßen .
Einstweilen können sie sich über unsere astrein raschelnden Bücher freuen und das erstaunlich schnell ausverkaufte Special " Aliens " - herausgegeben von Harald Zaun .
17
Anlässlich des Jubiläums gibt es zwei neue Telepolis - Bücher .
In Angriffe aus dem Netz beschreibt Alfred Krüger die neue Szene des digitalen Verbrechens .
Wer schreibt Schadprogramme und warum ?
Mit welchen Mitteln werden sie verbreitet ?
Wer pustet Phishing - Mails und Spam ins Internet ?
Wie arbeiten digitale Nepper , Schlepper , Bauernfänger ?
Wer spioniert den Nutzer mit welchen Mitteln aus ?
Die Szene hat sich gewandelt , ist härter geworden .
Im 2001 von Armin Medosch und Janko Röttgers herausgegebenen und sehr erfolgreichen Band " Netzpiraten " erlebt man das elektronische Verbrechen noch als " Kultur " .
Doch die Hoffnung , dass Hacker irgendwie die Avantgarde einer neuen apolitischen sozialen Klasse seien , ist erloschen .
Den Hacker als Piraten , der für Freiheit und Abenteuer kämpft , ihn gibt es heute kaum noch .
Telepolis - Leser konnten mitverfolgen , wie eine zunehmend hysterische Industrie Labeling - Kampagnen und " Law - and - Order - Parolen " erfand , welche zur endgültigen Kriminalisierung der Szene führten .
Bis hin zum legalen Gegenangriff , dem Ausspionieren des normalen Bürgers als vermeintlichem Dieb .
Außerdem steht eine aktualisierte Neuauflage der heimlichen Medienrevolution von Erik Möller ins Haus :
Er beschreibt , " wie Weblogs , Wikis und freie Software die Welt verändern " und kommt zu einem erfreulichen Schluss : Das revolutionäre Potenzial des Internet , das erst übertrieben , dann belächelt wurde , nimmt Konturen an .
18
Worauf Telepolis sich sehr freut - auf die nächsten zehn Jahre .
Mit Ihnen , aber auch mit der aufmerksamen Schar an Autoren .
Beides zusammen ergibt die Dynamik einer gemeinschaftlichen Intelligenz , die gelegentlich auf die Themen stößt , die im Mainstream kaum auftauchen .
( Michaela Simon )
The future is in South Korea
Smart investments in broadband there have paid off in the form of a hyperconnected society -- here 's how we can start reaping the benefits .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Business 2.0 Magazine ) - I , for one , welcome our South Korean overlords .
Ninety percent of the country has blazingly fast , 3 - megabits - per - second broadband at home , and similarly high - speed wireless connections on the road .
The telecom market is fiercely competitive , and broadband service costs the consumer less than $ 20 a month .
There are 20,000 PC baangs , or Internet cafes , where you can rent a superfast machine for $ 1 an hour .
Online gaming has become a way of life , with nearly 3,000 South Korean videogame companies boasting combined revenues of up to $ 4 billion .
As a result , South Korea has become the world 's best laboratory for broadband services - and a place to look to for answers on how the Internet business may evolve .
Smart bet on broadband
How did this come about ?
In 1995 , the South Korean government made what must rank as one of the most shrewd and far - sighted investments in business history .
It spent big on a nationwide high - capacity broadband network that any telecom operator could offer service on , and offered subsidies so that 45 million Koreans could buy cheap PC's .
Cost : a mere $ 1.5 billion .
Fast - forward 11 years : Korea is now the most connected and Net - addicted country on Earth .
There are a few American companies who have benefited from the South Korean broadband boom : Blizzard , for example , makes a popular online game called Starcraft which is so widely played in South Korea that two TV channels broadcast Starcraft matches between professional players .
But the most popular services are homegrown .
Cyworld , for example , is a social network owned by a subsidiary of SK Telecom , the country 's largest wireless provider .
To an American eye , the Cyworld service looks like a mixture of some of the hottest US properties : it 's MySpace meets Flickr and Blogger and AIM and Second Life .
Users have avatars that visit and can link to each other 's " minihompy " - a miniature homepage that 's actually a 3 - D room containing a users ' blog , photos , and virtual items for sale .
Cyworld 's digital garage sales include music , ringtones , clothes for your avatar and furnishings for your own minihompy .
Cyworld has penetration rates that would make Rupert Murdoch , CEO of MySpace parent News Corp. ( Research ) , green with envy :
An astonishing 90 percent of South Koreans in their 20s use the service .
Celebrities and politicians set up their own minihompies , and the way to get ahead in twentysomething Korean society is to found a popular Cyworld club , or chat room .
Printing money
Most importantly , Cyworld is a license to print money .
The service itself is free ( and available on cellphones as well as online ) , but to buy all the extras - like ringtones and virtual furnishings - will cost you " acorns , " the service 's virtual currency .
Cyworld sells its users $ 300,000 in acorns every single day .
With such a proven revenue stream , Cyworld is expanding fast .
It launched in China and Japan last year , and a US launch is slated for later this year .
Some might dismiss it as a Korean novelty , but all of Cyworld 's elements , individually , have been successful on these shores .
And teens and twentysomethings who use social networks tend not to have much brand loyalty to one service if another offers cooler features .
SK Telecom 's ace in the hole is its experience with running a social network on mobile devices .
" Every social network is going to have to have a mobile component over the next year , " predicts Jill Aldort , an analyst at Yankee Group .
" It gives more stickiness to the service .
There 's going to be a social networking fatigue factor - users need novelty .
And Cyworld clearly has more functionality than MySpace . "
Whether or not Cyworld succeeds in the U.S. , South Korea is going to continue aggressively targeting American Internet users .
Its government has set a target of $ 1 billion a year in online game exports by 2007 .
NCSoft , the company that runs Korea 's most popular multiplayer online role - playing game , Lineage , has found a string of successes in the U.S. by learning quickly what Americans love : its City of Heroes and City of Villains online games were both number one hits here .
Lost in translation ?
To be sure , there is much about South Korean culture that does n't translate well .
The country 's love of cuteness is a little too saccharine for American tastes .
And part of Cyworld 's success can be chalked up to users ' incessant message - swapping - not answering a missive from a friend with all due speed is considered a faux - pas in Korean society .
There is a chance that the rise of broadband and the rise of online gaming will not be so interlinked on this side of the Pacific ( though the runaway success of World of Warcraft suggests otherwise ) .
There 's a chance that US social networkers may prefer a stripped - down service with no avatars , bells or whistles .
But do n't forget that US wireless operators used to dismiss Japanese advances in mobile phones in much the same way .
Do users really want to send text messages , watch video on their phones , or buy ringtones , they mused , or is that something peculiar to Japan ?
Well , as it turned out , they do , and companies that bet early on the notion that technology can cross cultural boundaries , like Sprint Nextel ( Research ) and Cingular , won out .
So think twice before ignoring what 's going on in Seoul .
That shrewd government investment a decade ago may just have created a broadband hothouse that can give us a glimpse of the Internet culture 's future .
