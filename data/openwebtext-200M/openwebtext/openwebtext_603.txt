North Korea is threatening to turn South Korea into " debris " unless it stops activists sending anti-North propaganda leaflets across the border .
Activists from the South have been sending the leaflets into North Korea attached to balloons .
But recent leaflets speculating on the health of the North 's leader , Kim Jong Il , have prompted an angry response from Pyongyang .
The North 's military used cross - border military talks to warn the South it would strike pre-emptively and reduce South Korea to " debris " in a " just war " .
Separately , Japan 's Prime Minister says his government has information that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is in hospital .

What are the similarities and differences between Bill Maher ‘s Religulous and Ben Stein ‘s Expelled ?
I have n’t seen either one yet ( hopefully seeing Religulous soon ) , but the Orlando Sentinel ‘s Roger Moore compares the two films .
First , the similarities :
Both use mockery , sometimes droll , sometimes nakedly hostile , to ridicule their foes .
Both travel far and wide to find interview subjects , sometimes apparently hiding their purpose from those they ’re chatting with .
Both mix in some pretty comical straw - men for their stars to humiliate in interviews .
Both use editing to create mocking laughs at the expense of the folks they ’re interviewing .
The differences , however , are huge and striking :
I hated Expelled , found it sneaky , dishonest and cynical .
You can question evolution , test it , make fun of what you see as holes in it .
But you ca n’t question it as a “ belief . ”
It is n’t a belief .
It is time - tested and evolving science .
Expelled seems blatantly pro-ignorance .
I honestly wonder if Ben Stein , star of it , actually believes the drivel he ’s trying to sell here .
Bill Maher of Religulous , which I really enjoyed , never claims persecution , that his “ freedom ” is being infringed upon , as the disingenuous Ben Stein does in Expelled .
…
Unlike Stein , Maher is in the room doing all his own interviews .
He may have couched his approach to the religious folks of various stripes as a movie about “ doubt ” and questioning religion to get them to talk .
But virtually none of them back down when he comes straight out and questions their faith .
…
And unlike Stein , Maher freely showed his movie to critics , not hiding it from potentially angry reaction , fact - vetting and protest .
His movie is anti-religion , anti-“ irrationalists , ” his name for people make decisions on belief rather than fact .
Also , — and I know this will make you think twice about seeing it — Christianity Today did n’t like Religulous :
Honestly , it ’s not the hardest thing in the world to make a religion look silly when you only focus on the kitschiest , most grimace - inducing practitioners of it .
Sure , we have to own up to these unfortunate ( but fortunately fringe ) elements within our ranks , but Maher shores up little credibility for his cause by refusing to talk with any opponent with an ounce of nuance of theological rigor . …
Maher ’s biggest problem with this movie is not that it is reckless or condescending ( which it is ) , but that it espouses a point of view that , quite simply , is not shared by many people in the world .
Maher ’s ideology has no room for the miraculous or supernatural .
Such things are all hocus pocus to him and cannot be believed by anyone with a brain .
Faith of any kind ( i.e. , believing in something that ca n’t be proved ) “ makes a virtue out of not thinking , ” according to Maher .
Right there he loses about 98 percent of the world ’s population .
Maher could have spent the movie looking at the inside of a megachurch and Christianity Today would be embarrassed all the same .
There ’s little difference between the religious kooks and the religious liberals in Maher ’s eyes , and many Christians have a nasty habit of dismissing everyone who is n’t part of their own brand of faith .
And who would have “ an ounce of nuance of theological rigor ” ?
What arguments would CT like to have seen made ?
They do n’t elaborate .
They never say exactly what is wrong with the “ weird ” practitioners of their faith — I imagine that ’s because you ca n’t dismiss them without dismissing so many others who act the same way .
CT says the movie suffers because it “ espouses a point of view that , quite simply , is not shared by many people in the world ” — it ’s true that atheism is a minority belief , but that ’s precisely why Maher made the film .
That number needs to increase .

A financial analyst for Countrywide Home Financial , one of the world 's biggest and most troubled mortgage lenders , has been arrested and charged with stealing personal information concerning a breathtaking number of the company 's customers .
Rene Rebollo , 36 , of Pasadena , California , downloaded 20,000 customer profiles including names and social security numbers just about every week for about two years , according to documents filed in federal court in Los Angeles .
He would then sell the purloined information for about $ 500 per 20,000 profiles to various buyers .
He netted as much as $ 70,000 through the scheme , prosecutors alleged .
Although Countrywide had technology in place to disable flash drives on employee computers , Rebollo was able to circumvent the safeguard by making use of a PC that did n't have it installed .
Countrywide is one of the biggest providers of subprime mortgages , which offered people with bad credit housing loans .
In many cases , the loans came with low introductory interest rates that would eventually reset to much higher rates .
Attorneys general from Illinois and California have sued the lender for practices that were allegedly unfair and deceptive .
Earlier this year , Countrywide was acquired by Bank of America .
Subprime loans are one of the key causes of the current mortgage debacle rocking the US economy .
Rebollo was able to obtain specific types of Countrywide customer data thanks to his access to many of the company 's different databases .
He typically accessed the information on Sunday evenings from his workplace .
He downloaded the information onto thumb drives .
He would then physically sell the drive to people claiming to be data thieves or would email the data , usually in Excel spreadsheets , from a computer at a Kinko 's shop .
He has been charged with exceeding authorized access to the computer of a financial institution and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison .
He was arrested Friday and released on an $ 85,000 bond .
Rebollo 's attorney did n't return a message seeking comment for this story .
A second person , 25 - year - old Wahid Siddiqi of Thousand Oaks , California , was also arrested in the case and accused of purchasing some of the Countrywide data .
Siddiqi is charged with fraud and faces 15 years .
Siddiqi is scheduled to appear in court on Monday afternoon , California time . ®
European Union officials are studying plans for an international wind power grid in the North Sea that could provide energy generated from renewable sources to 70 million European homes .
The proposed offshore grid would be more than 3850 miles long , and connect more than 100 wind farms , containing a total of 10,000 turbines to seven countries , including Britain , Denmark , France , Norway , Germany , Belgium and the Netherlands .
The plans , based on a report written by Greenpeace and environmental consultants 3E , assume that 68.4 gigawatts of capacity , across 118 identified wind farms , will be in place across the North Sea within 10 - 20 years , and could meet an impressive 13 % of the annual energy needs of the countries involved .
In the past , the variability of wind speeds has been a limitation of wind power since it threatens continuity of supply .
The report ’s authors used scientific data on wind speeds to suggest that this variability could be stabilised within a grid system and supplemented by hydropower from Scandinavia .
Senior European energy officials have given the plans a positive but guarded reaction , calling them “ ambitious but realistic . ”
Further talks on EU renewable energy policy are due in November , and it is now likely that the proposals will form a key part of discussions on how Europe can meet its target of sourcing 20 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 .
Greenpeace say the plan would cost between € 15bn and € 20bn , but would promote cost efficiency and opportunities for power trading , thus eradicating the need for planned EU investment in ‘ clean ’ coal and nuclear .

The Hubble Space Telescope is back in business .
After overcoming a few glitches in bringing the orbiting Hubble back online , engineers and scientists aimed the telescope ’s prime camera , the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 ( WFPC2 ) , at a pair of gorgeous - looking interacting galaxies called Arp 147 .
Scientists say the image demonstrates the camera is working exactly as it was before going offline , thereby scoring a “ perfect 10 ” both for performance and beauty .
And the two galaxies are oriented so they look like the number 10 !
How cool is that !
Two anomalies in Hubble ’s restart caused the B- side of the Science Instrument Control and Data Handling System ( SI C&DH - B ) and the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) Solar Blind Channel ( SBC ) to return to a ‘ safe hold ’ status on October 16 .
Engineers worked through the problem , and on Oct. 25 , the telescope ’s science computer began to send commands to the WFPC2 .
What a relief !
Additional commanding allowed engineers on the ground to assess the instrument ’s state of health and verify the contents of the camera ’s microprocessor memory .
And so , this first “ post - recovery ” image shows the two interacting galaxies .
The left - most galaxy , or the “ one ” in this image , is relatively undisturbed apart from a smooth ring of starlight .
It appears nearly on edge to our line of sight .
The right - most galaxy , resembling a zero , exhibits a clumpy , blue ring of intense star formation .
The blue ring was most probably formed after the galaxy on the left passed through the galaxy on the right .
Just as a pebble thrown into a pond creates an outwardly moving circular wave , a propagating density wave was generated at the point of impact and spread outward .
As this density wave collided with material in the target galaxy that was moving inward due to the gravitational pull of the two galaxies , shocks and dense gas were produced , stimulating star formation .
The dusty reddish knot at the lower left of the blue ring probably marks the location of the original nucleus of the galaxy that was hit .
Arp 147 appears in the Arp Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies , compiled by Halton Arp in the 1960s and published in 1966 .
This picture was assembled from WFPC2 images taken with three separate filters .
The blue , visible - light , and infrared filters are represented by the colors blue , green , and red , respectively .
The galaxy pair was photographed on October 27 - 28 , 2008 .
Arp 147 lies in the constellation Cetus , and it is more than 400 million light - years away from Earth .

Time critical is approaching for the Rosetta spacecraft and it ’s flyby of the asteroid 2867 Steins .
Closest approach is expected on September 5 , at 20:58 CEST , ( Central European Summer Time ) , 2:58 pm EDT ( US Eastern Daylight Time ) .
To help the public follow the flyby , the Rosetta team now has a blog available , and a timeline has also been posted .
At the time of closest approach , Rosetta is planned to be 800 km from the asteroid , passing by at a speed of 8.6 km /s relative to Steins .
Both Rosetta and Steins will be illuminated by the Sun , providing an excellent opportunity for science observations .
Although most scientific observations will take place in the few hours around closest approach , several instruments will be switched on for a longer time around the event .
Between 40 and 20 minutes before closest approach , Rosetta will be flipped and the spacecraft will switch to a specially designed asteroid fly - by mode , an optimal configuration that supports the intensive observation and tracking activity of the on - board instruments .
The first images and results will be available for presentation to the media during a press conference on Saturday , September 6 at 12:00 CEST .
The timeline is as follows ( more details are available in the Rosetta Blog — all times CEST ( Central European Summer Time ) :
1 September
02:20 Instruments switched on ( except OSIRIS which was already on for the navigation campaign )
4 September
07:20 - 11:20
Slot for possible trajectory correction manoeuvre ( 36 hours before closest approach )
13:20 - 18:20
Last opportunity to acquire images for optical navigation campaign
5 September
07:20 - 10:20
Slot for possible trajectory correction manoeuvre ( 12 hours before closest approach )
10:20 Navigation cameras switch to tracking mode – initially both used , then use CAM ‘ A ’ only ( to be decided )
11:00 Uplink fly - by commands for asteroid fly - by mode ( AFM )
Includes an update to the command profile already on board & the final updated AFM commands ( only if 1 CAM at least is tracking )
20:18 -20:38 Spacecraft flip over

Wife offered hip - hop band ' Dem Boyz ' £ 200 to murder her husband , court is told
A wife paid a gang of thugs just £ 200 to savagely attack her estranged husband before she drove at him like a woman ' possessed ' and killed him , a court was told yesterday .
Faria Khan , 28 , planned the attack on Nawajid , 31 , and recruited four members of a local rap band to help her carry it out , the jury heard .
She had filed for divorce only weeks earlier .
Armed with axes , a hammer and a
knife , the gang ambushed the father of two as he walked to work , it is claimed .
The scene shortly after Nawajid Khan was killed as he walked to work in Heeley , Sheffield , on January 27
Mrs Khan was introduced to the aspiring rappers , who called themselves Dem Boyz , by close friend Neelam Kauser , 18 .
Miss Kauser was dating one of the men and was described in court as the ' go - between ' .
A text sent by Miss Kauser to her boyfriend Brian Yorachi , 19 , in the weeks before the killing read : ' Babe , ask for £ 200 because this is some serious mission .
It is involving a man 's life . '
Nawajid Khan , 31 , was run down in the street
Peter Kelson QC , prosecuting , told the jury that the message suggested that a price had been placed on Nawajid Khan 's life and that it was no more than a few hundred pounds . .
He said : ' She ( Khan ) hired these men , she orchestrated the attack upon her husband , she drove them to the scene of the attack and she was the driver of the vehicle which killed him . '
He told the court that the Khans ' marriage had been on the rocks for quite some time .
Mr Khan , a chef , had walked out on his wife in May last year claiming that the marriage had simply broken down .
Months later , on January 9 , his wife began divorce proceedings , claiming he had been abusive while they were together .
He was murdered as he walked to work at Milan 's takeaway restaurant in Heeley , Sheffield , on the afternoon of Sunday , January 27 .
Abdiquadar Mohammed , 18 , and Daniel Moore , 22 , waited for Mr Khan to appear before they launched the brutal assault .
As he received ' quite a beating ' his wife arrived with the two other band members who joined in , the jury heard .
Unable to keep his balance Mr Khan staggered into the road and was mown down by the 4x4 driven by Mrs Khan , Sheffield Crown Court was told .
Group members Kanu ' Chaps ' Kangi and Daniel ' Conkera ' Moore
The group called themselves ' Dem Boyz ' with the motto ' Rap or Die '
Group founder Brian ' Db Sque ' Yorachi and , right , a picture posted byDem Boyz on their mySpace page
She allegedly crashed the car before fleeing in a taxi - leaving her husband dying in the road from multiple injuries .
Police later searched the car , a Frontera , and found a bandanna belonging to one of the gang , a knife which matched a similar set at Faria Khan 's house , two axe head covers and number plates from a car which she had sold .
When arrested by detectives she admitted setting up the attack on her husband but said it was only to ' frighten and scare ' him .
She had met the men in Rotherham and accepted their offer to ' sort it out ' .
She denied being at the scene despite mobile phone records showing she was .
Miss Kauser said she witnessed the assault and the car being driven at speed by Mrs Khan .
' She was behaving like a woman possessed , chuckling at herself , ' she told police .
Faria Khan , Kauser , Yorachi , Mohammed , Moore and Kanu Kangi , 20 , all from Sheffield , deny murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm with intent .
The trial , which is expected to last eight weeks , continues .
Usually I like fashion editorials with a story but I was pleasant impressed by these pictures from Avantgarde magazine featuring fresh face Dutch model Valerie Van der Graaf from SPS Model Management Amsterdam .
She recently joined Viva Models - Paris so we 'll be seing more of her .
These pictures have something wintry about them without showing any cold weather décor or fashion ( like fur or knits ) .
Instead they make a short trench and a pair of slim jeans ( 7 For All Mankind ) look very couture by teaming them with the wonderfully crafted Jan Taminiau corset top / mini dress and shoes .

Mr. Obama ’s hands have not always been clean in this regard .
He was called out earlier for saying , incorrectly , that Mr. McCain supported a “ hundred - year war ” in Iraq after Mr. McCain said in January that he would be fine with a hypothetical 100 - year American presence in Iraq , as long as Americans were not being injured or killed there .
More recently , Mr. Obama has been criticized for advertisements that have distorted Mr. McCain ’s record on schools financing and incorrectly accused him of not supporting loan guarantees for the auto industry  a hot topic in Michigan .
He has also taken Mr. McCain ’s repeated comments that American economy is “ fundamentally sound ” out of context , leaving out the fact that Mr. McCain almost always adds at the same time that he understands that times are tough and “ people are hurting . ”
But sensing an opening in the mounting criticism of Mr. McCain , the Obama campaign released a withering statement after Mr. McCain ’s appearance on “ The View . ”
“ In running the sleaziest campaign since South Carolina in 2000 and standing by completely debunked lies on national television , it ’s clear that John McCain would rather lose his integrity than lose an election , ” Hari Sevugan , a spokesman for the Obama campaign , said in a statement .
At an event in Dover , N.H. , a voter asked Mr. Obama when he would start “ fighting back . ”
Mr. Obama , who began his own confrontational advertising campaign Friday , said , “ Our ads have been pretty tough , but I just have a different philosophy that I ’m going to respond with the truth . ”
“ I ’m not going to start making up lies about John McCain , ” Mr. Obama said .
The McCain advertisements are devised to draw the interest of bloggers and cable news producers  but not necessarily always intended for wide , actual use on television stations  to shift the terms of the debate by questioning Mr. Obama ’s character and qualifications .
Mr. Sipple , the Republican strategist , voiced concern that Mr. McCain ’s approach could backfire .
“ Any campaign that is taking liberty with the truth and does it in a serial manner will end up paying for it in the end , ” he said .
“ But it ’s very unbecoming to a political figure like John McCain whose flag was planted long ago in ground that was about ‘ straight talk ’ and integrity . ”

MONROE , Michigan ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama said firmly that families are off - limits in the campaign for president , reacting to news that GOP running mate Sarah Palin 's 17 - year - old daughter is pregnant .
" Let me be as clear as possible , " Obama said .
" I think people 's families are off - limits , and people 's children are especially off - limits .
This should n't be part of our politics .
It has no relevance to Gov. Palin 's performance as governor or her potential performance as a vice president . "
Obama said reporters should " back off these kinds of stories " and noted that he was born to an 18 - year - old mother .
" How a family deals with issues and teenage children , that should n't be the topic of our politics , and I hope that anybody who is supporting me understands that 's off - limits . "

Bristol Palin , a senior in high school , is about five months pregnant , according to an aide to Sen .
John McCain who asked not to be named .
iReport.com :
Were you married at a young age ?
The aide said the Palins and the McCain campaign decided to reveal the information now because of rampant Internet rumors that Sarah Palin 's 4 - month - old baby , who has Down syndrome , was actually Bristol's .
Obama became annoyed when asked about a Reuters news service report that quoted an unnamed senior McCain aide saying that Obama 's name appears in liberal blogs speculating about Trig 's parentage " in a way that certainly juxtaposes themselves against their ' campaign of change . ' " Watch analysts weigh in on the Palins ' announcement »
" I am offended by that statement , " the Illinois senator retorted , not letting the reporter finish his question .
" There is no evidence at all that any of this involved us .
" We do n't go after people 's families ; we do n't get them involved in the politics .
It 's not appropriate , and it's not relevant , " he added .
" Our people were not involved in any way in this , and they will not be .
And if I ever thought that there was somebody in my campaign that was involved in something like that , they 'd be fired . "

How Anne Frank 's wartime hiding place was nearly torn down because it ' was n't historically important '
The Diary of Anne Frank become one of the most important historical documents of the Second World War
The most famous shrine to Holocaust suffering in the world – the attic where Anne Frank hid with her family in Amsterdam – was nearly torn down by the Dutch government after WW2 because it was ' not an historical monument ' .
Now the house is visited by millions each year and the foundation that supports it has become central to rebutting the lies of Holocaust deniers wherever they are .
Anne Frank hid with her family in the Amsterdam apartment from 1942 to 1944 .
Betrayed , the family were carted off to concentration camps where all died except her father .
He returned in 1945 to find Anne ’s poignant diary among the few possessions the Nazis left behind .
Her book has been published in dozens of languages and has sold over 100 million copies .
Now a letter released in Holland show that the Dutch government in the 1950s had no objections to tearing down the house where the diary was written .
Joseph Luns , the foreign minister at the time wrote that her house was " not an historical monument of the Netherlands and unremarkable from an architectural point of view . ”
The letter was sent to the Dutch ambassador to the United States , informing him of the official position of the Ministry of Education , Art and Science towards the Anne Frank House .
The letter was discovered recently when the part of the ministry 's=2 0 archives was being moved to a new home .
According to the Anne Frank Foundation , it was apparently written in response to questions by Americans why the house was not declared an historic building .
Located on Amsterdam 's Prinsengracht , the house began attracting its first visitors shortly after the book was published in 1947 .
In the mid-1950s , a real estate firm proposed knocking it down to make way for a modern building , but dropped the idea after a series of protests .
The firm signed over the rights of the house in 1957 to the Anne Frank Foundation , which collected donations and turned it into a museum three years later .
Anne Frank was deported to the German concentration camp at Belsen where she died in March 1945 at the age of 16 .
What will be the lasting impression made by mankind - 100 million years hence ?
Jan Zalasiewicz , a lecturer in geology at the University of Leicester , has published a new book looking at the lasting impression likely to be made by mankind .
He takes the perspective of alien explorers arriving on earth - their geologists study the layers of rock , using the many clues to piece together its history over several billion years .
A story unfolds of moving and changing continents , rising and falling oceans , ice ages , and evidence of life going back many millions of years .
They grow familiar with its phases of change , the rise of great new ecosystems , and occasional catastrophic collapses of life .
But then they stumble on something quite different in a thin layer of rock : a striking signal of climate changes , extinctions and strange movements of wildlife across the planet .
Following this trail , decoding clues in the rocks takes them to the petrified remains of cities , and finally to the fossilized bones of those , long dead , who built them .
Dr Zalasiewicz said : " From the perspective of 100 million years in the future – a geologist 's view – the reign of humans on Earth would seem very short : we would almost certainly have died out long before then .
What footprint will we leave in the rocks ?
What would have become of our great cities , our roads and tunnels , our cars , our plastic cups in the far distant future ?
What fossils would we leave behind ?
" My study shows how scientists put together clues from the rocks to understand the past , its landscapes and climate , and the nature of the creatures that inhabited it .
A thin layer of silt here , a trace formed by a crawling worm there –the clues are often subtle and difficult to read .
But by such clues would future geologists – whether hyper - evolved rat or alien visitor – work out our story .
My study explores which of our structures are likely to leave traces , and what future explorers might make of us and the impact we made on our environment .
" Looking to the distant future gives us a warning for the present : our activities have already left a significant footprint on the planet , and not a flattering one .
It is not too late to limit it .
We would not wish to be dubbed by future explorers the ' amazingly clever and utterly foolish two - legged ape ' . "
Zalasiewicz 's book " The Earth After Us : What Legacy Will Humans Leave In The Rocks ? " is published by Oxford University Press .

TOPIC : Shutdown of the LHC , by Kevin Black [ refresh ]

The authors argue that these sorts of time - violating interactions could be associated with whatever new particles we create at the LHC .
For example , the production of a large number of Higgs particles in the future could have a backwards - in - time causal effect on the machine that produced them , stopping the machine from ever running .
As possible “ evidence ” for such a backwards - in - time effect , the authors cite the now - canceled Superconducting Super Collider ( SSC ) — a particle accelerator that was meant to hunt the Higgs and was partially constructed in Texas before Congress pulled the plug on the project .
As the authors write in their paper : “ Such a cancellation after a huge investment is already in itself an unusual event that should not happen too often .
We might take this event as experimental evidence for our model in which an accelerator with the luminosity and beam energy of the SSC will not be built . ”
It ’s as though the Higgs plays the role of the time traveler who goes back to the past and murders his grandfather , thus preventing his own birth .

As the LHC supposedly gears up , Harvard physicist Kevin Black , based at CERN , investigates rumors that the particle accelerator may , in fact , soon be shut down — by ripples from the future .
From Kevin Black : I came across a bizarre paper recently suggesting that the LHC might be shut down .
Not because of the funding cuts that have been threatening particle physics projects around the world , nor because of law suits accusing the LHC of threatening life on Earth .
( Not even because we at the LHC have recently been accused of having far too much fun rapping . )
No , the paper suggested that future effects caused by the production of particles , such as the Higgs , could ripple backwards in time and prevent the LHC from ever operating .
If it had n't been written by two very well respected and accomplished theoretical physicists , I would have stopped reading at the title alone : " Test of Effect from Future in Large Hadron Collider ; A Proposal " .
To be completely honest , the title reads like titles that occasionally appear in my inbox — “ Relativity Principle Untenable , " " Quantum Mechanics a Hoax , " and other nerdy versions of the emails from the supposed attorney of my long - lost Nigerian uncle who apparently has died and left me millions of dollars , if I can only send him $ 50,000 so that he can get it to me .
But I did n't stop .
I read the article .
I read it for another reason other than the somewhat awkwardly sounding title and not just because the authors , Holger Nielsen , of the University of Copenhagen , and Masao Ninomiya , of Kyoto University , are somewhat famous .
I read it because when I come across such things it tends to remind me of the first time I learned about quantum mechanics .
To be honest , if it had n't come from a professor at a university and a published text book I would have thought that the whole thing was some sort of a scam as well .
I mean , really ?
Sometimes it acts as a wave and sometimes it acts as a particle ?
The first time I heard about wave / particle duality I was expecting to be asked to send the authors money ( perhaps to Nigeria ? ) .
So what did the article say ?
Well , it started out with a reasonable enough point .
One of the basic assumptions of classical physics is that time flows in one direction and that when describing a physical system one needs to know the equations of motion and the initial conditions in order to predict the future behavior of a classical system .
However , quantum mechanics changes this a bit .
Classical mechanics can be formulated in such a way that one sets up an “ action ” integral .
The solution to the physical system can be expressed as the path that minimizes the action integral .
It turns out that in quantum mechanics one needs to not simply take one path — but take the sum over all possible paths .
For example , if you want to work out how a photon gets from a lightbulb to your eye , you need to take into account not just its straight - line trajectory , but contributions of all possible paths it could have taken , including paths where the photon bounces round the room .
It 's a bit strange , but it seems to work and 60 years + of detailed experiments have confirmed this description over and over again to remarkable quantitative precision .
The authors of this paper claim to show that other terms can be added to the quantum mechanical action that are consistent with current theory and experiment .
However , some of these possible terms include conditions in the future that need to be taken into account and summed over .
That is to say , what happens in the future could ( according to this paper ) affect what happens in the present .

But I read on nonetheless , becoming a little bit more amused and a lot more confused as I tried to finish the paper .

You are confusing the world wide web ( websites ) with the Internet , and CERN with the LHC project .
CERN built and operates the LHC , but that is not the only thing they do or have done .
A guy at CERN invented the first " website " back in 1989 before the LHC was even an idea .
The Internet is n't just websites and already existed as ARPANet which was a joint effort between universities / academic institutions and the U.S. Department of Defense .
As for whether or not the 10 billions dollars is wasted or not , it really depends on what else they find when they crank up the collisions .
Right now they have the Higgs boson discovery and that 's pretty much it .
Is that a $ 10 billion dollar answer ?
If they discover what dark matter is made up of or some additional details on dark energy , then I think it 's easy to say that $ 10 billion was not a waste .
But that remains to be seen .
Either way it 's not a total waste of money , but if the Higgs boson is all they get out of it , then you have to wonder if they could 've found that with just a $ 5 or $ 6 billion dollar project which means that $ 4 or $ 5 billion was wasted .

Well , one way to do it is to conduct the experiment more than once .
If there 's only one shutdown card and you pull it out of a deck of 52 cards 10 times in a row , that would be a pretty good indication that it 's not just random chance .

report post as inappropriate Both interesting ideas - but again I am stuck on the scientific proof issue .
I guess the crux of the problem is that the way that I am used to thinking of scientific proof means essentially providing a reproducible causal link between two events .
No doubt the experiments that you propose could be reproducible - but do they prove a causal link .
I think the heart of the matter is what you define to be causal .
Its hard for me to imagine proving that something in the future caused something in the present to occur .
To start with - how do you know what did or did n't happen in the future if something that happens then stops it from ever happening ??

It sounds crazy to use a time machine to go back in time and prevent the machine from being built .
But what happens is that as soon as you go back you go to a version of the " then where you went back " .
Which is different from the " then where you did not go back " .
( The then you remember . )
The idea that there is a loop is just an illusion .
In reality there is a continuous consistent time line for the observer involved .
The other observer , the experimenter experiencing his machine being wrecked apparently by himself from the future is also continuous .
No laws are broken by this .
Something appears from another place and stops him from building a time machine .
Then it leaves again .
There is no problem if you consider this two superpositions of the same universe .
Which is perfectly acceptable in quantum mechanics .
Our normal mode of thinking would have one exclude the other .
But there is no actual physical exclusion .
The fact that something appears out of nowhere sounds like a law broken .
But quantum mechanics allows for this .
The odds against it are astronomic .
But its theoretically possible for complete objects to appear out of nowhere .
No matter how unlikely the odds .
This allows for a time line to cross itself without forcing the whole system into an infinite loop .
There would be a law broken if the experimenter who 's machine is destroyed before being finished would later use that machine to go back to the past .
That would be impossible since it was broken .
He can not get from that position to the point where he travels back in time in it .
It 's a bit complicated because it requires another way to look at the problem .
But you can easily do it by just imagining being the experimenter and allowing for multiple possibilities .
Do n't observe the bigger picture just stick close to the locality of the experimenter and note that there is no contradiction .
This is like Einsteins relativity .
Implications of that allow us to theoretically go faster than light seemingly breaking the laws of physics .
Unless you look at it locally and realize no laws are actually broken .
I think most problems people have with time travel are directly related to their instinctive response to consider space and time independent of the observer .
Which is not accurate as Einstein patiently explained to us :)

It 's like those illusion drawings where they depict impossible 3d shapes on a 2d bit of paper .
There is no problem because the actual illusion is only 2d .
The mind invents the third dimension .
And that contradicts .

perhaps this could be used for a proof of causality .
The idea is write a program that waits for some effect sent back from the future .
Next , perform a calculation ( like solving some np - hard problem ) such that not solving it would result in a paradox based on the event or message from the future .
Therefore , if the universe is paradox - free , you would always solve the calculation .

So , we start calculating , iterating over possible paired primes .
When we find one , we immediately use our device to create a higgs particle ( thereby breaking our device at some prior time ) .
Meanwhile , we monitor our device to see if it ever breaks .
If it breaks ( and we havent used it yet ) , we know we must have used it at some point in the future .
Therefore , we must have found a really large prime - pair .

Such things as radioactive decay rates could be measured for example as a function of distance and orientation from the core as a function of time till the experiment is suppose to take place .

My theory about time travel is that if someone does an experiment that alters things in the past , the new past would slightly change the experiment , because even small things like breaking a twig in a forest , cause exponential growth of perturbations in the resultant future .
Any experiment that changes the past will be altered in the alternate time - line ... therefore the alternate experiment will cause a slightly different affect on the past , which in turn alters the experiment more , changing the past again etc ... in a loop .
To break out of the loop , the changes to the past will need to stop .
What we see in our reality is the final outcome , when the past stops changing .
So I agree with the authors of the paper , that if in the future you do an experiment that alters something in the past , it 's likely that machine from the future has already caused a reality for us that prohibits the past - altering machine to exist .
Even if you could do a test with a " shut - down card " , is it more likely that our reality will change to pick the " shut - down card " instead of being changed to have a faulty component in the machine ?
I think that the machine is more likely to have a faulty component in our reality , given that it 's the closest thing to the past - changing particles created .
So I think the tree in the forest will burn down in our reality , just to stop you from going back in time to break one of its twigs .
Since small changes in the past cause many iterations of changing the past ( because the machine is changed each time ) , and since those changes grow exponentially , I like to call my theory the ' Chaos Theory of Time Travel . '

So I agree with the authors of the paper , that if in the future you do an experiment that alters something in the past , it 's likely that machine from the future has already caused a reality for us that prohibits the past - altering machine to exist .
Even if you could do a test with a " shut - down card " , is it more likely that our reality will change to pick the " shut - down card " instead of being changed to have a faulty component in the machine ?
I think that the machine is more likely to have a faulty component in our reality , given that it 's the closest thing to the past - changing particles created .
So I think the tree in the forest will burn down in our reality , just to stop you from going back in time to break one of its twigs .
Since small changes in the past cause many iterations of changing the past ( because the machine is changed each time ) , and since those changes grow exponentially , I like to call my theory the ' Chaos Theory of Time Travel . '

The definite predictions are " you will choose the shut down card . "
And the falsifying result is : " You will not pull out a shut down card . "
If it 's not a 1/50 card you 're pulling but a whole object pulled out of quantum theory at odds of 1 / a lot , you do n't need as many expirements .

But what is the connection between the LHC , the Higgs - boson , and the deck of cards ?
Printing a variety of possible outcomes on otherwise ordinary cards does not make them special .
You absolutely need to prove causality , which I just can't see as within the realm of possibility .
Otherwise every card game in the world has been running this experiment since the dawn of card games , possibly the largest base of experimental ( and , unfortunately , mostly unrecorded ) data ever .
And if that is the case , then I could use this principle , in theory , to cheat on every card table in Vegas .
I 'm Not sure I understand the problem at all .
You do n't need an experiment to prove causality .
You need a theory that makes definite predictions and is falsifiable .

Ok , so a single draw of cards is problematic because random chance could make the shutdown card pop up .
Another problem is if such a card poped up , no one would seriously even consider shutting down the plant so the backwards causality would work on that anyways .
What you have to do first is to come up with a test that will be so convincing as to shut down this many billion dollered investment .
One possible way to retain the card idea is to make the option to shut down the plant much much more unlikely .
Say , 10 decks and you have to draw all 520 cards in a specific order ...
TWICE !!!
lol
Then you would have an order of improbability so high as to be quite impossible for it to be chance , and while it might not lead to the shutdown of the LDC it would certainly freak people out enough to put it on hiatus to figure out the physics behind what the hell just happened .
Interestingly if this worked you might be able to harness the improbability to do fantastic things .

One issue is that you can't just build a highly improbable shut down test , because something more probable will cause the LHC to fail first ( like a broken part ) .

Meaning , what if the future production of the Higgs created a field of energy / radiation / dark energy / whatever in and around the LHC site here in the past , and this field of whatever in turn created an environment that made the operation of the LHC , as it is intended , impossible ?

The problem with the card test is that it assumes the particles will use the path of least resistance to shut down the LHC .

All fo the " thens " do not fall into nonexistance just because we can't access them .

I put my money on the hypothesis that each possible progression from each given state does , in fact exist .

The move towards higher energy levels was only felt necessary after the particle was n't found at the operating levels of fermilabs and CERN .

What about spacial location ?
To my understanding the earth is zipping around inside a galaxy that is zipping around .
So , if I created an apple at my current location and moved it backwards in time only even a few seconds , would it not end up frozen in space somewhere along earth 's orbit ?
And if you grant that a paradox can occur , IE a future event stopping a past event , then why halt that causation in the normal direction ?
In other words , if the Higgs particles stop the collider then the collider would n't produce Higgs particle to stop itself , would it ?
Thats the real reason you can't safe JFK , because if you did , he'd be saved and you 'd have no reason to go back in time to save him .
Does this work both ways ?
QM seems like crap to me , but crap very close to the mark .
I just do n't like the touchy feely anything is possible feel , given that our existence proves that to be untrue .
For example I know that all existence ( pluralmultiomnieverything - a- verse ) was n't destroyed 5 minutes ago .
QM : OH but there 's also a pluralmultioptimegaversic multidimensional fold - twist - weave where every “ thing ” was destroyed except us , so naturally we 're giant flying purple zombie Lincolns .

The main problem I have with this so - called " hypothesis " is that I do not see any reason to suppose it .
What evidence are they basing it on ?
It seems quasi-religious and mystical .
Why would the creation of the Higgs mean that the Higgs would have to go back in time and nullify its own creation ?
Or is this just a grand justification of why the Higgs has not been found yet ?

It may be possible to make an experiment as follows : Immagine an experiment you would run to test forward causation .
Say , unstable atom , when it decays a swich flips over .
( This example will not work , of course , we know atoms have forward causation , not backward ) .

On display were ' Worlds smallest Trinitron Color TV '. 2.5 " or so diagonal CRT .
About 10 " to 12 " long with the screen on the end .
Shaped something like a loaf of Italian bread with 20 % cut off one end .
Garishly colored .
Large battery compartment , with detachable stand for tilt / swivel .
I thought it would make a nice prop .
Two side by side to make electronic binoculars !
I was just a little better than broke at the time and did n't buy any .

I remember the TV I saw years ago and wonder if any are on eBay .
No. I go to the Sony site .

I contact a vintage TV collector .
He assurres me it never existed .

No , it was n't LCD !
A similar sized TV from Panasonic appeared in the film ' Tootsie ' and I can find information about that one .

You 're forgetting the fact that time does indeed exist .
Following your example of ' time as a measurement of movement , ' is illogical .
Otherwise an object that does not move or has never moved would have a measurement of 0 .
Such an object would not be able to exist , otherwise it would be a physical 2 Dimensional object .
The thing with 2 Dimensional objects is that they cannot exist within a 3 Dimensional universe .
A timer would only simply measure how long it takes one to move , but if you altered a non-moving object from it 's 0 location , you would be creating a paradox .
You can not create from nothing .
You can not un -create something .
Such a theory of these being possible must break the laws that man has set for energy .
If these laws can be broken , than how are you judging how the machine will react ?
If it did indeed alter the timeline , do n't you think it would have altered the past already ?
Thus providing evidence that it did , we would have to activate it for this past event to occur , but it has already occured , therefore it has been activated in the future .
This is false , as if you did n't activate it EVER , this time fluctuation would have never existed , yet it has already .
If something 's position is always at 1,1,1,0 than the object is always at the same spot , and has never changed , but because the 4th measurement is there , it must change eventually , because it 's at 0 , it cant .
All these theories cause paradoxes , and the card idea would n't work because it 's random chance and has nothing to do with the actual machine running as it would .

Just a thought ...
If I were a theoretical physicist
In order to run an experiment of this nature I would most likely do something simple like send a post card to myself in the past saying that the experiment was a success and to proceed as planed .
Of course maybe my past self has no clue what the post card is .
To take this a step further lets say the LHC ( 1 ) the one in the future runs a test to see if exotic particles ripple into the past .
So as a precautionary measure they try and " float " , if we can call it that , a certain particle along the ripple of time distortion ( we will call this particle anomaly ( 1 ) ) in the hope that the particle is detected by the LHC ( 2 ) ( the LHC in the past ) .
The LHC ( 1 ) 's reasoning is That their past selves should be able to pick up on the idea that anomaly ( 1 ) should n't be there , when the LHC ( 2 ) decides to run a test to check for that sort of thing , and that it was put their puposefuly .
Of course how can they know this right away ?
They ca n't so LHC ( 2 ) runs their own test to check to see if they can float anomaly ( 1 ) across a time ripple .
Of course when they decide to do this they get smart and decide to add Anomaly ( 2 ) in the other direction ( future ) because now LHC ( 2 ) has figured out that the anomaly ( 1 ) was purposeful .
So LHC ( 2 ) runs the new test .
So now the LHC ( 1 ) and the LHC ( 2 ) now are seeing anomaly ( 1 ) and anomaly ( 2 ) coming at the same time .
Infact now all The LHC's ( if you believe in the multiple worlds theory ) should have all have the same anomalies coming in .
This would indicate the experiment to have a success on past causality .
Of course the viewer initially would have no clue to this as they are inside the system and not on the outside looking in , or the anomaly might be misinterpreted as something that maybe considered dangerous when first viewing it .
just get to the second experiment as fast as possible so you can figure out that you put it there in the fist place .
Interesting stuff indeed .
Ca n't wait to see what the future holds .

report post as inappropriate I would like to put my 2 cents in .
What if the LHC does n't find the Higgs boson ?
I believe that the gist of the posts above are correct , a singe particle is way the hell to unlikely to cause Congress to cancel some huge project .
However , it seems theoretically possible for a particle to have reverse causality that cannot be noticed .
As I understand quantum physics , anything is possible but observation itself is a key element of the effect .
To continue the above supposition , what if the reverse causality effect of creating a Higgs boson is that we cannot see the Higgs boson that had just been created ?
If there was a reverse causality such that the Higgs boson was never created , we never would have known .
Every time the LHC fired up , it could create any number of the things but because of their very existence we would n't be able to see them or their instant annihilation .
In my very jumbled up head , this could get around the paradox of time travel .
It can happen backwards if no one knows it happens .
What causes the paradox is that the backwards traveling whatever has an effect on things other than itself .
If the LHC creates a Higgs and the Higgs causes its past self to never have been created , we would never know -- we would never have seen the thing .
Perhaps stranger things that quantum physics exist , but we will never know ?

Perhaps the particles travelling backwards in time has an effect such that certain universes they have travelled from can not exist .
If they have travelled back in time , then the situation seems distinctly paradoxial .
Consequently , it could be that quantum physics does not just suggest that particles can travel backwards in time , but also that the universe these particles came from can no longer exist .
That 's what I got from this anyway , and in a mind bending way it makes sense , but is still based on assumptions .

Even if there are an infinite number of universes , splitting off for every possible event that could occur , you would still not expect to be in a universe inwhich you are in france one second , then a fraction of a second later in Canada .
It just does n't happen ( and of course relativity would n't allow it - even quantum physics would not allow a whole person to go faster than the speed of light , regardless of what causes it ) .
This effectivly means that no universe inwhich we are in Canada wondering what happened to France exists , atleast in the absence of loss of sanity or use of drugs .

Still , the thoughts were n't intended to be apocalyptic ; my point is that destroying matter is a waste of energy - both literally and figuratively .
By the way , the LHC is still in a ramp - up phase , so the possibility remains .
Can you or another reader prove that a catastrophic event has zero probability ?
In a much weaker sense , can you prove that increasing the collision energy does not increase the measurement uncertainty ?

Regarding the black hole concern ...
Think on a few things which may alleviate your fears :
1. Conservation of energy : we do n't expect to get out more than we put in , so the micro black holes ( MBHs ) should simply be the consumption of high energy particles with the emission of radiation ( " particles , " " virtual particles " ) in proportion .
By creating such non-equilibrium states as MBHs , we have a lot of science indicating they will be ephemeral .
We do n't have sufficient energy to crush galaxies together , but protons , sure .
2 . Black holes and white holes may be more common than we all suspect .
We observe blackbody radiation but say we have n't observed Hawking radiation .
We observe shock waves and various forms of event horizons in many natural phenomena .
While higher energies seem to admit more intricate and therefore unpredictable outcomes , it is nice to know CERN is taking incremental steps toward collision at the goal energies .
We 'd expect early data to provide some signs of danger before we 'd reach a hypothetical tipping point creating some metastable and omnivorous singularity .
There will be a lot of data to process ( 300 MB / s counting only " interesting " events ) .
Hopefully CERN will " stop to smell the flowers along the way . "
3 . The anthropic principle applied in the context of some modern concepts of a harmonic universe seems to suggest that we will not destroy ourselves in the future because here we are today .
You would likely agree the past determines the present by causality .
In this assumed universe ( agrees with Peter Lynds 's view ) the balancing term is phase reversed ... that is , the future also determines the present state .
I 'm optimistic , thinking we 'll figure this stuff out and find some physical basis for optimism . :-)

report post as inappropriate Neil , Regarding the black hole concern ... Think on a few things which may alleviate your fears : 1. Conservation of energy : we do n't expect to get out more than we put in , so the micro black holes ( MBHs ) should simply be the consumption of high energy particles with the emission of radiation ( " particles , " " virtual particles " ) in proportion .
By creating such non-equilibrium states as MBHs , we have a lot of science indicating they will be ephemeral .
We do n't have sufficient energy to crush galaxies together , but protons , sure .
2 . Black holes and white holes may be more common than we all suspect .
We observe blackbody radiation but say we have n't observed Hawking radiation .
We observe shock waves and various forms of event horizons in many natural phenomena .
While higher energies seem to admit more intricate and therefore unpredictable outcomes , it is nice to know CERN is taking incremental steps toward collision at the goal energies .
We 'd expect early data to provide some signs of danger before we 'd reach a hypothetical tipping point creating some metastable and omnivorous singularity .
There will be a lot of data to process ( 300 MB / s counting only " interesting " events ) .
Hopefully CERN will " stop to smell the flowers along the way .
" 3 .
The anthropic principle applied in the context of some modern concepts of a harmonic universe seems to suggest that we will not destroy ourselves in the future because here we are today .
You would likely agree the past determines the present by causality .
In this assumed universe ( agrees with Peter Lynds 's view ) the balancing term is phase reversed ... that is , the future also determines the present state .

Back on topic , though , the helium leak that has shut down the collider for the next two months is interesting .
Perhaps , as the article you read suggested , that by operating in the future the machine prevented itself from working now ?
It certainly seems like an odd coincidence .
( Though , being a spoilsport , the problem is n't that surprising when you consider that one of the most complicated machines in history is being tested . )

An ' HIV - test ' equivalent for the early detection of lung cancer
A team of researchers led by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center reports online today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology the validation of a potential " HIV - test " equivalent for the early detection of lung cancer .
The test , which relies on immune - system signals , much like an HIV test , can detect the presence of lung cancer a year prior to diagnosis , long before symptoms appear .
Samir M. Hanash , M.D. , Ph.D. , and colleagues at the Hutchinson Center and University of Michigan found that just as the immune system reacts to the presence of HIV by producing an antibody response , which indicates a person is HIV positive , it also mounts a response against specific antigens , or proteins , produced by cancerous lung tumors in their early stages of development .
" This kind of immune response wo n't necessarily kill the tumor , but it can act as a canary in a coal mine , signaling lung cancer at an early stage , before actual symptoms emerge , " said Hanash , head of the Molecular Diagnostic Program in the Public Health Sciences Division at the Hutchinson Center .
" It is an important step toward developing a biomarker - based blood test for the early detection of lung cancer . "
The validation study tested the sensitivity and specificity of three biomarkers linked to early stage , pre-symptomatic disease : two previously identified antigens , known as annexin1 and 14 - 3 - 3 theta ; as well as a newly identified lung - cancer antigen called LAMR1 .
For the study , the researchers conducted a blinded analysis of blood samples from 85 current or former smokers collected within a year of lung - cancer diagnosis and blood samples from 85 current or former smokers who did not go on to develop lung cancer .
When combined , the sensitivity of the three - biomarker panel was 51 percent , meaning that autoantibodies to these antigens were present in the blood of more than half of the people who later developed lung cancer .
The specificity , or " false - positive , " rate of the biomarker panel was 18 percent , meaning that about one - fifth of the comparison group tested positive for the autoantibodies , even though they did not develop the disease .
" The fact that we got a signal like this with just three biomarkers is very significant .
If we can enlarge this panel by adding a few more , we could develop a blood test with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for detecting lung cancer much earlier than current screening methods allow , " Hanash said .
The initial goal is to use such a blood test in conjunction with imaging techniques , such as CT scans , to improve the early detection of lung cancer in those at high risk .
Hanash envisions such a test could be in clinical use within five years .
To this end , Hanash and colleagues next hope to further validate this biomarker panel by securing funding for a retrospective multi-center study of patients who undergo lung CT scanning .
" We want to see how much we could improve the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans with the addition of the blood test .
For example , could the blood test detect early lung cancer in someone who tested negative on a CT scan ?
Or , could we use it to shed light on a suspicious lesion to help determine whether it may be cancer ? "
Ultimately , Hanash foresees extending this approach to improve the early detection of other common forms of cancer .
" If we could identify those antigens that provide the best signature for not only lung cancer , but also for cancers of the colon , breast , prostate , ovary and the like , then with the tiniest drop of blood we could have a screening test for all the common types of cancer to catch them at their earliest stages , when cure rates are high , " he said .
" That would be phenomenal . "
Why I wo n’t vote for John McCain and why I believe you should n’t
T he economy has become the priority issue for voters .
But my principal reason for refusing to vote for John McCain has nothing to do with his admitted lack of knowledge of economics , although I did not realize the extent of his ignorance prior to his comments regarding the re-distribution of income .
Since presidents encounter considerable constraints on their freedom to control economic programs and policies , this shortcoming is not critical .
It is , rather , the fields of foreign and national security policies , generally regarded as Senator McCain ’s strengths , that in my view are his disqualifying weaknesses ; and a president has considerable leeway to operate in these areas to the detriment , or benefit , of the United States .
I deeply respect John McCain ’s service to our country ; and I admire his bravery as a prisoner of war , described by a fellow prisoner as similar to that demonstrated by hundreds of other U.S. prisoners in North Vietnam who also obeyed the code of declining release before those captured earlier .
Unfortunately , however , Senator McCain has demonstrated clearly that he is a dedicated ideologue in the foreign / security policy area , unwilling to consider opinions or even credible evidence contrary to his preconceived notions .
In addition , his temperament , marked not only by impatience but also by rude and sometimes hostile behavior , would discourage advisers from bringing to his attention views that might not be consistent with his preconceptions .
A president with this combination of significant shortcomings would be a dangerous commander - in - chief , posing an unacceptable risk to the security of the nation .
Senator McCain has adopted , promoted and sustained the position of the so - called neo-conservatives and ultra-nationalists who believed that the United States should capitalize on American military superiority to spread democracy abroad .
Overthrowing the Iraqi government was seen as the first step in transforming the politics of the Middle East by converting governments in the region to democracies friendly to the United States and its interests .
Senator McCain reportedly has bragged in private conversations that he was the first neocon .
Since Senator McCain has made his positions on U.S. policy and military operations in Iraq a central theme in his campaign , it is useful illustratively to examine his stated views on this central national security issue .
Iraq and Related Matters
Consistent with the Project for a New American Century ’s open letter to the President , Senator McCain co-sponsored the 1998 Iraq Liberation
Act that changed the policy of the U.S. government from containing Iraq to overthrowing its regime .
The Act also provided funds to Iraqi exile groups seeking regime change in Iraq .
In September 2000 , the Project for the New American Century published a manifesto entitled Rebuilding America ’s Defenses .
It advocated expanding democracy in seven countries in a five - year period : Iraq , Iran , Syria , Lebanon , Libya , Somalia and Sudan .
Randy Scheunemann , then a director of the Project , is Republican candidate McCain ’s chief foreign / national security adviser .
Immediately following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack , well in advance of the Bush administration ’s campaign to sell the American public on the invasion of Iraq , Senator McCain began a repetitive drumbeat promoting that course of action .
On the day of the 9/11 attack , during an interview with Dan Rather of CBS , he said : “ I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that there are other countries — Iraq , Iran , — who … involve themselves in state - sponsored terrorism . ”
The next day , 12 September 2001 , he said “ It is n’t just Afghanistan ; we ’re talking about Syria , Iraq , Iran , … and others . ”
He added : “ There ’s a network [ of states sponsoring terrorism ] that is going to have to be attacked . ”
Six days later , he said : “ I think very obviously Iraq is the first country , but there are others – Syria , Iran , … who have continued to harbor terrorist organizations and actually assist them . ”
On 20 September 2001 , the Project for a New American Century sent a letter to the President , signed by Randy Scheunemann , urging expansion of the war on terrorism beyond Al Qaeda to Iraq , Iran , Syria and other countries .
It stated that failure to make a determined effort remove Saddam Hussein would be “ the equivalent of decisive surrender . ”
On 3 October ’01 , less than a month after 9/11 , while speaking of military operations against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan on the Letterman Late Show , Senator McCain declared : “ The second phase is Iraq . ”
Senator McCain advanced misleading and even false assertions not only on Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction but also Iraqi ties to international terrorists , including those who committed the 9/11 attacks .
On 29 October , he stated : “ The evidence is very clear ” that the claim made by “ Curveball , ” an exile discredited by U.S. intelligence , was valid : the alleged meeting of an Iraqi intelligence agent with Mohammed Atta , the leader of the 9/11 attack .
In December 2001 , Senator McCain joined five other senators in signing an open letter to the White House stating : “ In the interest of our own national security , Saddam Hussein must be removed from power . ”
Addressing the crew of a U.S. warship on 2 January 2002 , he said : “ Next up , Baghdad ; ” the following month , he warned : “ A terrorist resides in Baghdad .
A day of reckoning is approaching . ”
Along with Senator Joseph Lieberman , he agreed to serve as honorary co-chair of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , a lobbying organization formed in 2002 by the chair of the Project for a New American Century to promote the overthrow of Saddam Hussein by military force .
The president of the Committee was Randy Scheunemann .
Senator McCain actively supported Ahmad Chalabi , head of the Iraqi National Congress exile group , who had been exposed as a charlatan not only by the CIA but also the Defense Intelligence Agency .
In voting for the use of force against Iraq , he called Saddam Hussein “ a threat of the first order . ”
He spoke in favor of removing all members of the Baath party from the Iraqi government and the Iraqi military , decisions generally recognized as disastrous errors .
Demonstrating a simplistic misunderstanding of the profound differences , he went so far as to predict that the U.S. occupation of Iraq would be remembered in much the same way as the liberation and rebuilding of Germany and Japan after World War II .
Speaking of the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , Senator McCain said : “ There is no doubt in my mind … that we will be welcomed as liberators . ”
This despite dire warnings to the contrary from the National Intelligence Council and reports from the CIA , the Department of State ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research and even from organizations within the Department of Defense : the National Defense University and the Army War College , both having held conferences of experts on the likely results of an invasion .
He had “ no doubt , ” because he was unwilling to give any weight to evidence that did not support his ideological commitment .
He assured Wolf Blitzer during an interview on CNN : “ We ’re not going to get into house - to - house fighting ; ” a flat assertion , without any reservation or qualification of probability , despite authoritative opinions of the likelihood of an insurgency .
Underscoring his ideological commitment , Senator McCain said in retrospect that even had there been no claims of Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction or of Iraqi connection to Al Qaeda , “ there ’s no question ” that he would have voted to authorize the use of military force against Iraq .
This nation cannot run the risk of electing a commander - in - chief who wo n’t listen and is unwilling to consider persuasive evidence that is contrary to his ideological preconceptions .
Senator McCain has highlighted his credentials to deal with national security in general , as well as the conflict in Iraq .
Yet his public statements reveal that he does not understand the basic nature of counter - insurgency operations , that he lacks knowledge of critical elements of the conflict in Iraq , and that he does not comprehend the basic precept that military force has its own grammar but not its own logic .
He has said that we did not prevail in the Vietnam war because “ we lost the will to fight . ”
Yet we had U.S. troops in South Vietnam from the late 1950 ’s until the early 1970 ’s , for some 15 years .
He apparently does not understand that there are some conflicts that American military power cannot resolve .
As recently as 17 March 2007 , Senator McCain walked through a Baghdad market while being guarded by some 100 American troops , with three Blackhawk helicopters and two Apache gunships overhead .
He declared : “ The neighborhood is safe .
We walked down the streets with no body armor on . ”
He stated that General Petraeus went out every day “ in an unarmed Humvee . ”
A television film showed that the Senator was wearing an armored vest during his tour , and General Petraeus ’ staff responded that the general always rode in an especially armored Humvee vehicle .
On three occasions , Senator McCain asserted that members of Al Qaeda in Iraq were being trained in Iran .
After being coached by Senator Lieberman , he finally corrected that basic misunderstanding of the political realities in the region .
In 2008 , Senator McCain claimed that the surge of U.S. combat forces in the late winter and spring of 2007 “ began the Anbar awakening ” of Sunni tribesmen turning against Al Qaeda in Iraq .
This , he said , is “ a matter of history . ”
Yet in January 2007 , he had referenced the awakening that had its beginnings in the summer of 2006 as a justification for the decision to surge .
The purpose of the surge , as announced by the President in January 2007 , was to provide breathing space for political accommodation between and among contending Iraqi factions .
There indeed has been a reduction in violence in Iraq due to a combination of factors , including the presence of U.S. troops in Baghdad .
Yet military operations are not an end in themselves , but are conducted to achieve a political outcome .
The purpose of the surge , political accommodation , has not been achieved ; in fact , the surge has widened the split among political factions .
The some 100,000 Sons of Iraq , mostly Sunnis , armed and paid by the U.S. to provide security , do not support the central government led by a Shiite consortium .
Also , the surge of U.S. troops in Baghdad resulted in a substantial increase , estimated at 500,000 , in the number of Iraqis displaced into segregated neighborhoods .
Yet on the 21st of July 2008 , Senator McCain declared “ We ’ve succeeded ” in Iraq , apparently failing to understand what all U.S. senior military commanders in Iraq have stated : there is no military solution to the conflict in the complicated and insecure situation in that devastated country .
Without a government that earns the loyalty of the majority of Iraqis , and resultant public cohesion , the reduction in violence will continue to be “ fragile and reversible , ” in the words of Ambassador Crocker , General Petraeus and even the President .
Senator McCain has expressed his determination to sustain the U.S. military presence in Iraq until we achieve “ victory . ”
As recently as September 2008 , President Bush repeated his ambitious current goal for Iraq as a unified , democratic and stable society that could defend , sustain and govern itself , while becoming a reliable ally in the global war on terrorism .
Senator McCain has declined recently to define what he means by “ victory ; ” but in the spring of 2008 , he related victory to an Iraq that is “ a peaceful , stable , prosperous , democratic state , ” clearly decades away at best .
Senator McCain , along with others fixed on regime change in Iraq , did not object when the administration fought the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan without the commitment of U.S. ground troops , other than special forces , and turned its attention prematurely to the invasion of Iraq while allowing the majority of the Taliban and the Al Qaeda cadre to escape across the border into the tribal areas of Pakistan .
Despite the deterioration of security in Afghanistan , on 2 March 2005 Senator McCain said on CNN : “ So far it ’s a remarkable success . ”
The following October , while speaking on Afghanistan , he stated on the Charlie Rose show : “ It ’s succeeded . ”
Before mid-July 2008 , there was no mention of Afghanistan on Senator McCain ’s campaign web site .
As late as 15 July 2008 , however , after having argued that no additional forces were needed in Afghanistan because we had succeeded there , he finally recognized the deteriorating situation and advocated sending 15,000 more troops to Afghanistan .
He did not specify how the additional troops might be generated , given his advocacy of maintaining current U.S. troop levels in Iraq .
Not long before , he had stated : “ Afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq . ”
In April 2007 , when asked by a voter at a town - hall meeting about U.S. policy toward Iran , Senator McCain responded by singing “ bomb , bomb , bomb Iran , ” which would place U.S. troops in Iraq in jeopardy as well as inciting attacks against U.S. interests in the region and probably elsewhere .
Senator McCain has been a consistent advocate of employing military force , as well as diplomatic and economic measures , to overthrow the governments of non-democratic states .
In his 2000 presidential primary campaign , he promoted a strategy of “ rogue state rollback . ”
He has served as a long - term chair of the Republican Institute , an organization dedicated to promoting democracy in closed societies , even though most experts agree that viable democratic reforms cannot be imposed but must be generated locally .
Consistent with his ideological predispositions , Senator McCain also has suggested establishing a League of Democracies to coordinate foreign policies .
He has gone so far as to advocate expelling Russia from the G - 8 , an organization of leading industrial nations established to coordinate international economic policies , in order “ to improve their behavior , ” while adding Brazil and India to the organization but excluding China .
This obviously would result in the alienation of China and Russia , resulting in a confrontational foreign policy rather than encouraging their cooperation on vital issues of international security and their integration into the international community .
Temperament
The importance of Senator McCain ’s temperament , should he become President , is apparently regarded as too politically incorrect to discuss .
By his own admission , however , Senator McCain has “ a temper , to state the obvious , which I have tried to control with varying degrees of success because it does not always serve my interest or the public ’s . ”
Of greater significance , he also has written : “ Often my haste is a mistake , but I live with the consequences without complaint . ”
In matters of national security and foreign policy , however , it is the nation that will have to live with the consequences of Senator McCain ’s temper and haste should he be elected President of the United States .
The issue of a president ’s temperament cannot be ignored because of its relevance to the national security of the United States .
James A. Thurber , director for Congressional and Presidential Studies , has observed : “ sometimes somebody ’s temperament can get in the way of aides telling him the truth , which happened [ during the Vietnam war ] with LBJ .
His temper scared some away , which was not good for anyone ….
that ’s part of the risk with a strong temper … and so it ’s always relevant . ”
For the purposes of credibility , the evidence below on Senator McCain ’s temperament is from only fellow Republicans or other normally supportive sources , some of whom have endorsed Senator McCain for the presidency .
John Heintz , executive director of the Arizona Republican Party , reflected on Senator McCain ’s outburst following arrangements for a broadcast in 1986 , by asking : “ What happens if he gets angry in crises ” as president ?
“ It ’s the president ’s job to negotiate and stay calm .
I do n’t see that he has that quality .
That temper , the intolerance : it worries me . ”
Senator McCain has admitted that during his first term as a senator in 1989 , he strongly berated Senator Shelby for failing to vote for the confirmation of John Tower as Secretary of defense .
He wrote that he brought “ my nose within an inch of his as I screamed out my intense displeasure …. ”
In 1992 , during a subcommittee gathering , Senator McCain employed profanity to admonish Senator Grassley and refused to apologize .
Some shouting and shoving resulted .
Former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson has said that he thought Senator McCain was “ in the area of being unstable . ”
As recently as 2007 , during a closed - door meeting on immigration , Senator McCain shouted a profanity at Senator John Cornyn ( R- TX ) in the presence of about 40 other people .
Karl Rove said of Senator McCain : “ Things are personal with him .
He sometimes lets his emotions overrule his judgment . ”
Speaking of Senator McCain , Senator Domenici ( R - NM ) said he does n’t “ want this guy anywhere near a trigger . ”
Senator Thad Cochran ( R - Miss ) has said : “ The thought of McCain as president “ sends a cold chill down my spine He is erratic .
He is hotheaded .
He loses his temper and he worries me . ”
Former Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire has observed : “ I ’ve witnessed a lot of his [ Senator McCain ’s ] temper outbursts .
It raises questions about stability … .
It ’s more than just temper – a sneering , condescending attitude .
I ’ve seen it up close .
His temper would place this country at risk in international affairs , and the world perhaps in danger .
In my mind , it should disqualify him ” from the presidency .
On 23 September 2008 , conservative columnist George F. Will wrote : “ It is arguable that McCain , because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes , is not suited to the presidency . ”
While it is even more politically incorrect to mention , there is also the question of Senator McCain ’s age and health .
Should he be elected president , at age 72 he would be the oldest person to assume the office .
At age 72 , I was in at least as good health as Senator McCain is now .
Now that I have passed my 80th birthday , Senator McCain ’s age should he complete a second term as president , I can attest that one ’s stamina recedes during this eight year period .
Should Senator McCain as president have to pick up the phone at 3:00 am at the beginning of a prolonged crisis , there is a legitimate question as to whether he could remain sufficiently vigorous , alert and focused for a sustained period to deal effectively with it .
While Senator McCain currently appears healthy , the life expectancy of Vietnam era prisoners of war is below the national average .
Moreover , he has suffered three invasions of melanoma cancer , and the possibility of a recurrence with swift and fatal consequences cannot be ignored .
As Senator McCain has warned us repeatedly , the nation is at war .
Under these circumstances , one would expect that a candidate who professes to put the country first would select a vice presidential running mate already well qualified to step into the roles of commander - in - chief and leader in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy .
Instead , Senator McCain selected Governor Palin , obviously for her appeal to the conservative base of voters and women disenchanted over Senator Clinton ’s defeat as the nominee of the Democratic Party .
Whatever her other attributes , it is evident that Governor Palin is not prepared to lead the foreign and security policies of the United States .
So much for Senator McCain ’s claim to put country ahead of politics .
No president can be conversant with all the problems and issues he or she will face .
More important than a specific set of experiences are high intelligence , good judgment , a steady and even temperament , and a willingness to consider options presented by advisors who have been selected for their expertise .
A few months ago , I met in a small group with Senator Obama in his office to discuss a contentious security issue .
People with different , even opposite , views had been invited to attend .
Senator Obama listened carefully and asked penetrating questions , confirming my observations concerning his intelligence and temperament .
Despite his relative lack of experience in the field national security , I believe that Senator Obama possesses the requisite qualifications to serve far more effectively as President of the United States and commander - in - chief of the U.S. military than his opponent , Senator McCain .

Speech given at the Walbrook Club , London , England , May 3 , 2005 :
“ Distinguished business leaders , representatives of the media , ladies and gentlemen :
Recently , I have often found myself cornered at various functions , especially here in London , and pressured to explain how and why daring Icelandic entrepreneurs are succeeding where others hesitate or fail , to reveal the secret behind the success they have achieved .
It is of course tempting to let it remain a mystery , to allow the British business world to be perplexed .
This mystery would give my Icelandic friends a clear advantage , a fascinating competitive edge – but when my friend Lord Polumbo asked me to speak on this subject at the distinguished Walbrook Club , I could not decline the challenge .
It is indeed an interesting question how our small nation has in recent years been able to win so many victories on the competitive British , European and global markets , especially because for centuries we were literally the poorest nation in Europe , a community of farmers and fishermen who saw Hull and Grimsby as the main focus of their attention , a nation that only a few decades ago desperately needed to extend its fishing limit in order to survive , first to 12 miles , then to 50 and finally to 200 miles .
Each time Britain sent the Navy to stop us but each time we won – the only nation on earth to defeat the British Navy , not once but three times .
With this unique track record , it is no wonder that young entrepreneurial Vikings have arrived in London full of confidence and ready to take on the world !
Yes , it is indeed a fascinating question , not just with respect to Iceland , but also because it throws light on some fundamental trends in modern business .
It touches on the new nature of success , and why some fail where others triumph .
Globalisation and information technology have given small states opportunities on a scale never witnessed before .
Obstacles to their growth have largely been abolished and replaced by an open and wide field where talent , imagination and creativity determine what is harvested .
Innovations can now emerge from any direction ; individual initiative can lay the foundation for companies which establish a global presence in a short time .
In recent years Iceland has shown how a small state can make an organised and successful response to globalisation and thus boost its own business success .
Every company in our country now has a unique opportunity to profile itself .
Indeed , new companies can now emerge into the global market regardless of where their home base is and soon have the whole world as their market region .
There is much to suggest that in the new economy , a small state can be a very profitable basis for business innovations because in a small state it is easy to see how different elements link up , how to establish cooperation between different fields , how to gain access to information and experience and grasp solutions to difficult tasks .
A small state can serve as a kind of laboratory or research station in precisely those sectors that are increasingly coming to dominate the economy of our times .
Many examples can be cited to illustrate how our business leaders have managed to establish themselves on foreign markets .
In previous decades we saw the success of our seafood marketing companies through their sales networks in Europe , the U.S.A. and Asia , and the remarkable achievements of our airline companies from the 1960s onwards when Loftleiðir – now Icelandair – became the first low fare airline in the world , enabling the hippy generation to cross the Atlantic cheaply .
These experiences provided an important training ground , but no one could have predicted the extraordinary success in recent years , a success which does indeed raise challenging questions about prevailing business strategies , theories and training in modern times .
Let me mention a few success cases .
Baugur is indeed well known here in Britain , playing a major part in the retail sector , not only in London but also in Denmark and Sweden .
Avion Group , the specialised airline , is now the largest of its kind in the world .
It recently opened its European headquarters in Crawley , close to London .
Actavis has become the fastest growing pharmaceutical company in the world , with production facilities in Bulgaria , Malta , Serbia , India and elsewhere .
Össur , the largest prosthetics company in the world , was created by an unknown Icelander who worked on his innovations in small rooms in the oldest part of Reykjavik .
Kaupthing Bank , which only six years ago opened the first branch of an Icelandic bank abroad , is now among the largest financial institutions in the Nordic countries , with operations in Europe and America .
Bakkavör , which a decade ago started in a garage in my home municipality , is now the largest producer of fast food in Britain .
It recently acquired Geest , so expanding the scope of its operations .
I could go on to mention many other examples : companies in transport and food processing , machinery and software production , telecommunications and other fields .
How has it been possible to achieve such success in so many different fields and in such a short time , in areas where we definitely had no prior competitive advantage , areas such as pharmaceuticals and prosthetics , banking and finance , retail and fashion – to name only a few .
Of course , many factors have contributed to the success of this voyage , but I am convinced that our business culture , our approach , our way of thinking and our behaviour patterns , rooted in our traditions and national identity , have played a crucial role .
All of these are elements that challenge the prevailing theories taught in respected business schools and observed in practice by many of the big American and British corporations .
We are succeeding because we are different , and our track record should inspire the business establishment in other countries to re-examine their previous beliefs and the norms that they think will guarantee results .
The range of Icelandic success cases provides a fertile ground for a productive dialogue on how the modern business world is indeed changing .
Let me offer you a list of a dozen or so elements that I believe have been crucial to Iceland ’s success story .
I am not listing them in any particular order , but taken together , I am convinced that they amount to a significiant framework of business success – a guide to the ground in which achievements are rooted .
First comes a strong work ethic .
This is a heritage from the old society of farmers and fishermen , where necessity dictated that the fish catch had to be brought ashore and processed immediately when the boats came in to harbour and that hey had to be turned and collected when the weather was favourable .
When Kaupthing Bank beat the other bidders for the Danish FIH Erhvervs Bank , the disappointed English representative returned to London and informed his boss that the Icelanders had won because , as he put it : “ When we go home these guys are still working . ”
Second , we tend to focus on the results rather than the process : to go straight to the task and do the job in the shortest time possible ; to ask when it can be done rather than how .
Third , Icelanders are risk takers .
They are daring and aggressive .
Perhaps this is because they know that if they fail , they can always go back to Iceland where everyone can enjoy a good life in an open and secure society ; the national fabric of our country provides a safety - net which enables our business leaders to take more risks than others tend to do .
Fourth , there is absence of bureaucracy in Iceland and a lack of tolerance for bureaucratic methods .
Perhaps it is because there are so few of us that we have never really been able to afford extensive bureaucratic structures ; when we encounter them , we prefer other means .
Fifth , there is a strong element of personal trust , almost in the classical sense of “ my word is my bond . ”
This enables people to work together in an extraordinarily effective way because they are fostered in communities where everyone knows everyone else .
This trust also contributes towards :
The sixth element .
This is the formation of small groups of operators who work closely and strategically together , creating a fast - moving network of key decision makers who can close a deal quicker than those who are used to working within larger and more bureaucratic corporate structures .
Seventh , we have entrepreneurship – old - fashioned entrepreneurship where the boss himself or herself stands in the front line , taking responsibility , leading the team , giving the company a visible , personal face .
This style of entrepreneurship breeds leaders who know they are responsible , aware that their initiative will make or break the deal .
As an Asian business executive once told me : “ The reason why I like to do business with Icelanders is that the bosses themselves come to the table ; they do n’t hide behind an army of lawyers and accountants like they do in the big European and American companies ” .
Eighth on my list is the heritage of discovery and exploration , fostered by the medieval Viking sagas that have been told and retold to every Icelandic child .
This is a tradition that gives honour to those who venture into unknown lands , who dare to journey to foreign fields , interpreting modern business ventures as an extension of the Viking spirit , applauding the successful entrepreneurs as heirs of this proud tradition .
Ninth is the importance of personal reputation .
This is partly rooted in the medieval Edda poems which emphasise that our wealth might wither away but our reputation will stay with us forever .
Every Icelandic entrepreneur knows that success or failure will reflect not only on his or her own reputation but also on the reputation of the nation .
They therefore see themselves as representatives of a proud people and know that their performance will determine their reputation for decades or centuries to come .
Tenth , there is the fact that the Icelandic market , although small , has turned out to be an effective training ground because it is so competitive , perhaps more so than many other European markets ; therefore what succeeds in Iceland is likely to succeed everywhere else .
Eleventh , because of how small the Icelandic nation is , we do not travel the world with an extra baggage of ulterior motives or big power interests rooted in military , financial or political strength .
No one is afraid to work with us ; people even see us as fascinating eccentrics who can do no harm and therefore all doors are thrown wide open when we arrive .
Twelfth , the strong interaction which characterizes the Icelanders offers opportunities for people from different sectors to launch cooperative ventures without difficulties or major bureaucratic hindrances .
The extensive knowledge that our business leaders have of the capabilities of others in different fields has made it easy for them to draw people into promising projects .
And finally , there is creativity , rooted in the old Icelandic culture which respected the talents of individuals who could compose poetry or tell stories , who were creative participants in companionship with others .
These attitudes have been passed onto the business community , as is demonstrated by the Icelandic term used to describe a pioneer or an entrepreneur , – “ athafnaskáld ” , which means literally “ a poet of enterprise ” .
Admiration for creative people has been transplanted from ancient times into the new global age , and originality has turned out to be a decisive resource in the global market .
Taken together , these thirteen elements have given the Icelandic business community a competitive edge , enabling us to win where others either failed or did not dare to enter .
Our entrepreneurs have thus been able to move faster and more effectively , to be more original and more flexible , more reliable but also more daring than many others .
The track record that Icelandic business leaders have established is also an interesting standpoint from which to examine the validity of traditional business teaching , of the theories and practice fostered and followed by big corporations and business schools on both sides of the Atlantic .
It enables us to discuss the emphasis on entrepreneurial versus structural training , on process versus results , on trust versus career competition , on creativity versus financial strength .
I have mentioned this morning only some of the lessons which the Icelandic voyage offers , but I hope that my analysis has helped to clarify what has been a big mystery to many .
Let me leave you with a promise that I gave at the recent opening of the Avion Group headquarters in Crawley .
I formulated it with a little help from Hollywood movies :
‘ You ai n’t seen nothing yet . ' ”
First use of Taser stun gun in NI
It is the first time the weapon has been used in Northern Ireland A Taser stun gun has been used by police in Londonderry for the first time in Northern Ireland .
It was used to subdue a father who had locked himself in a house in Galliagh with his two young children at about 0300 BST on Saturday .
Police said it was used " as an appropriate and tactical option to bring the matter to a safe conclusion " .
A 37 - year - old man was later arrested .
The children were safely returned to a family member .
The man was detained under the Mental Health Act .
The Police Ombudsman is investigating the incident .
Taser guns fire two wires which attach to the body and carry an electric shock .
The police were given permission earlier this year to buy 12 Taser guns despite opposition from human rights groups and some members of the policing board .
The Foyle MP Mark Durkan said his party remain opposed to the use of Tasers .
" Doubtless the officers involved will be saying that , based on them using the means at their disposal , they went for the use of the Taser in this situation as appropriate .
" It 'll be for the Police Ombudsman to decide that , but whatever is decided in this case , it does not make the SDLP any more comfortable about the wider use and deployment of Tasers , " he said .

What are these ?
By Ann Ivins
Mr. Donohue :
The Catholic League ’s request to Leah Daughtry to ban the blogs BitchPhD and Towleroad from the Democratic National Convention came as something of a shock to those of us here at Scholars and Rogues .
Frankly , Mr. Donohue , we are hurt .
Our offices contain no balloon figures of Jesus , with or without genitalia ( you say â€œapparently albino penis , â€  I say â€œloinclothâ€ â€ “ oh wait !
There ’s the penis !
Or should it be Penis ? ) .
Our site features no links to intensely homoerotic coverage of the hottest Olympic athletes , despite insistent lobbying from at least two of our staff members .
Our humble blog , unlike Daily Kos , may never become the Internet apotheosis of evil radicalism .
We know our place .
We are what we are .
What we are , Mr. Donohue , is a blog at least ten times as offensive to the Catholic League as the so - called â€œpatently obsceneâ€ publications to which you so vehemently object .
Had you bothered to do any in - depth research , were you the watchdog of God you claim to be , your list of blogs to be summarily uncredentialed would have been headed by the proud though lesser - known name of … Scholars and Rogues .
Perhaps it is not too late ; in this hope , I offer you the following information about our staff , practices and standards .
May you use it for the greater glory of the League , ignoring in your righteous wrath the craven tolerance and despicable humanity of the vast majority of Catholics worldwide .
If , as you quote Peter Viereck , “ Catholic baiting is the anti-Semitism of the liberals , â€ editor - in - chief Dr. S has raised that pastime to an art by installing an actual Catholic baiting pit in the basement of S&R headquarters .
Unlucky male representatives of the Faith are routinely chained to steam pipes and taunted for hours by voluptuous Wiccans bearing wine , condoms and the latest issue of Lesbian Vampire Nuns of Sodom .
Oddly , many former victims later return voluntarily and must be chased away by special guilt - sniffing Rottweilers .
Dr. W , senior editor and sexuality expert , has divorced at least nine wives , four of whom are practicing Catholics .
With a callous disregard for the traditions of their faith , Dr. W has refused to apply for annulments on the grounds of antecedent and perpetual impotence , thereby dooming these poor women to a lifetime of lesbian vampire sex behind convent walls .
Mr. W , editor , is an official lapsed Catholic and has been heard to loudly profane the name of the Holy Virgin while locked alone in his office for several hours at a time .
Repetitive slapping noises and an impressive collection of leather flagellation devices may or may not be related to these obscene outbursts .
Ms. I , token female and possessor of the Moist Pink Gates to Hell , is an outspoken pro-choice advocate ; like most of her fellow succubi she has used repeated casual abortions to facilitate her whorish lifestyle and prominently displays a series of commemorative post - D&C â€ œthumbs - upâ€ photos along one wall of her cubicle .
Ms. I also personally fucked Jesus at least twice , possibly three times if oral counts .
She stated that although the Savior pronounced his name â€œhay - ZOOS , â€  she got a look at his driverâ€™s license in the bar and is confident in her identification .
Mr. L , token homosexual or â€œquoken , â€ also claimed to have had carnal knowledge of that same Son of God .
In the resulting bitchfight , Mr. L produced as evidence a semen - stained t- shirt bearing an eerie resemblance to the lower half of the Shroud of Turin .
Challenged as to its authenticity , Mr. L casually dropped two words : Baby .
Jesus .
( NSFW ) Ms. I ran from the room in tears , only to discover Hayzoos had given her a fake cell number .
Mr. O emphatically denies any unhealthy preoccupation with plaid skirts , knee socks or white cotton panties .
He was , however , unable to explain to the S&R site administrator the near - constant traffic between his workstation and here ; his excessive Kleenex and hand lotion consumption is also under investigation .
Finally , Mr. Donohue , virulent ad hominem attacks on the defenders of the Faith are an everyday occurrence at S&R , and you yourself are a favored target .
A typically bigoted exchange :
Is it me or is he the pervy uncle who wants you to sit on his lap while he talks about the miracle of womanhood ?
I donâ€™t know , but heâ€™s apparently obsessed with Jesusâ€™s penis …
I would be , too .
Shut up , you smug bitch !
HEY , weâ€™re ripping the Catholofascist right now , you two .
Whatever .
So what does he say about fucking choirboys ?
Who , King Powerbottom Donohue ?
Nothing .
No comment .
Heâ€™s like the Switzerland of the Catholic world .
Yeah , if by â€ œSwitzerlandâ€  you mean â€œhysterical misogynistic homophobic paranoiac.â€ 
Just an affectionate nickname , bless his heart .
I can only hope , Mr. Donohue , that you will reconsider your choice of obscene and inappropriate blogs and add Scholars and Rogues to that roll of honor .
Thank you ,
The Staff of S&R
Ukraine 's Vitali Klitschko celebrates after winning his WBC World Heavyweight Championship fight against Nigeria 's Samuel Peter in Berlin , October 11 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Tobias Schwarz
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Vitali Klitschko used his son’s wet diapers to keep his fists from swelling up after winning his WBC heavyweight title bout against Nigeria ’s Samuel Peter , the Ukrainian told a German newspaper on Tuesday .
Klitschko said he wrapped them around his hands and it helped him recover .
“ Baby wee is good because it ’s pure , does n’t contain toxins and does n’t smell , ” the 37 - year old boxer told Bild after he won back the WBC title on Saturday .
“ I wrap nappies filled with my three - year - old son Max ’s wee around my fists , ” he said , adding he got the idea from his grandmother .
“ The nappies hold the liquid and the swelling stays down . ”
Klitschko said Peter should try the diaper trick as well .
Police have cordoned off the bank 's headquarters in New York Lehman Brothers , the fourth - largest US investment bank , has filed for bankruptcy protection , dealing a blow to the fragile global financial system .
The news led to sharp falls in share prices around the world , and officials took measures to reassure markets .
Lehman had incurred losses of billions of dollars in the US mortgage market .
Merrill Lynch , also stung by the credit crunch , has agreed to be taken over by Bank of America , the latest twist in a dramatic turn of events on Wall Street .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended more than 504 points lower on Monday , marking its biggest fall since the September 11 attacks .
The Nasdaq composite index shed 3.60 % to 2,179.91 and the Standard & Poor 's 500 index lost 4.71 % to 1,192.70 .
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the US was " working through a difficult period in our financial markets right now as we work off some of the past excesses " .

But he added : " The American people can remain confident in the soundness and resilience of our financial system . "
However he warned that uncertainty remained and it was likely that there would be further " rough spots " ahead before the market was corrected .
Turmoil would continue in financial markets until the housing correction was completed , he added .
Mr Paulson said he was committed to working with regulators in the US and abroad , as well as policymakers in Congress to take the necessary steps " to maintain the stability and orderliness of our financial markets " .
But he gave no details of what such steps might mean .
Earlier in the day President George W Bush said : " In the long term I am confident that our financial markets are flexible and resilient and can deal with these adjustments . "
Tumbling bank stocks Lehman 's demise is being felt around the world : Stock markets and the US dollar have tumbled in reaction to Lehman 's collapse , with banking shares hardest hit .
HBOS shed 17.6 % .
Central banks have moved to reassure markets .
The US Federal Reserve has broadened its emergency lending scheme and the UK and European central banks have injected a total of about $ 50 bn ( £ 28bn ; 35bn euros ) into the financial system .
There are fears AIG , once the world 's largest insurer , could also face collapse .
It is taking steps to raise money after reportedly seeking a $ 40 bn emergency loan from the Fed .
Bank of America 's move to buy Merrill in a $ 50bn deal means that three of the top five US investment banks have fallen prey to the sub - prime crisis within six months .
In the UK , accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PWC ) have been appointed as administrators for Lehman .
' No cash ' PWC told a news conference in London that it is unclear whether Lehman 's UK staff will get paid the $ 75 m ( £ 42 m ) that they are owed in wages this month .
" When we took over this morning , there was no cash in the company , " said Tony Lomas from PWC .
" We still do n't know what the position is - we will tell staff as soon as we know if we can , or if it is appropriate to pay staff on Friday . "
In response to a question from a journalist he agreed it was extraordinary for a company like this to collapse .
" What it underlines to me is the importance of market confidence , " Mr Lomas said .
" If no one wants to trade with you ... there 's no way back . "

An end to bank bail - outs ?
Stock markets in Europe and Asia have dropped sharply and the dollar tumbled against the yen , the euro and the Swiss franc as Lehman 's failure raised fears about the strength of the global financial system .
The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares ended down 212.6 points or 3.9 % to 5,204.2 .
To help stabilise the money markets , the Bank of England and the European Central Bank pumped in £ 5bn and 30bn euros respectively .
In addition , the Federal Reserve said that for the first time it would accept stocks owned by banks as collateral for short - term cash loans , broadening its emergency lending programme .

" I think the whole history - 150 years of effort and hard work - that 's the most saddening part for me , " said one Lehman employee as she left the building .
The bank , which employs about 25,000 staff worldwide , including 5,000 in the UK , was founded in 1850 by three brothers .
Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , which allows a company time to reorganise and devise a plan to pay creditors over time .

Sarah Palin has NO FUCKING CLUE what she ’s talking about .
I ’ve heard homeless schizophrenics whose barely verbal raving made more sense AS ANSWERS TO KATIE COURIC’S QUESTIONS than this .
On Alaska ’s proximity to Russia as foreign - policy experience :
Couric :
You ’ve cited Alaska ’s proximity to Russia as part of your foreign policy experience .
What did you mean by that ?
Palin : That Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country , Russia , and on our other side , the land — boundary that we have with — Canada .
It — it ’s funny that a comment like that was — kind of made to — cari — I do n’t know , you know ?
Reporters — Couric : Mock ?
PALIN : Yeah , mocked , I guess that ’s the word , yeah .
COURIC : Explain to me why that enhances your foreign policy credentials .
PALIN : Well , it certainly does because our — our next door neighbors are foreign countries .
They ’re in the state that I am the executive of .
And there in Russia — COURIC :
Have you ever been involved with any negotiations , for example , with the Russians ?
PALIN : We have trade missions back and forth .
We — we do — it ’s very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia as Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America , where — where do they go ?
It ’s Alaska .
It ’s just right over the border .
It is — from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation , Russia , because they are right there .
They are right next to — to our state .
On the $ 700 billion bailout :
Couric :
If this doesnt pass , do you think theres a risk of another Great Depression ?
Palin : Unfortunately , that is the road that America may find itself on .
Not necessarily this , as its been proposed , has to pass or were going to find ourselves in another Great Depression .
But , there has got to be action - bipartisan effort - Congress not pointing fingers at one another but finding the solution to this , taking action , and being serious about the reforms on Wall Street that are needed .
Couric :
Would you support a moratorium on foreclosures to help average Americans keep their homes ?
Palin :
That s something that John McCain and I have both been discussing - whether that is part of the solution or not .
You know , it s going to be a multi- faceted solution that has to be found here .
On middle - class Americans and the economy :
Couric :
Why is nt it better , Governor Palin , to spend $ 700 billion helping middle - class families who are struggling with health care , housing , gas and groceries ?
Allow them to spend more , and put more money into the economy , instead of helping these big financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess ?
Palin :
That s why I say I , like every American I m speaking with , were ill about this position that we have been put in .
Where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out .
But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy .
Um , helping , oh , its got to be about job creation , too .
Shoring up our economy , and getting it back on the right track .
So health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions , and tax relief for Americans , and trade  we have got to see trade as opportunity , not as , uh , competitive , um , scary thing , but one in five jobs created in the trade sector today .
Weve got to look at that as more opportunity .
All of those things under the umbrella of job creation .
On specific ways McCain has pushed for oversight of the banking industry :
Palin : I think that the example that you just cited , with his warnings two years ago about Fannie and Freddie - that , that s paramount .
That s more than a heck of a lot of other senators and representatives did for us .
Couric :
But hes been in Congress for 26 years .
Hes been chairman of the powerful Commerce Committee .
And he has almost always sided with less regulation , not more .
Palin :
Hes also known as the maverick though , taking shots from his own party , and certainly taking shots from the other party .
Trying to get people to understand what hes been talking about - the need to reform government .
Couric :
But can you give me any other concrete examples ?
Because I know youve said Barack Obama is a lot of talk and no action .
Can you give me any other examples in his 26 years of John McCain truly taking a stand on this ?
Palin : I can give you examples of things that John McCain has done , that has shown his foresight , his pragmatism , and his leadership abilities .
And that is what America needs today .
Couric :
Im just going to ask you one more time - not to belabor the point .
Specific examples in his 26 years of pushing for more regulation .
Palin : Ill try to find you some and Ill bring them to you .
Bonus # 1 : Watch tonight for Part 2 of the interview , in which Palin warns against planning for withdrawal in Iraq — apparently unaware that the Bush administration has already agreed on a date for withdrawal — and calls for a surge in Afghanistan :
Katie Couric :
Why is it much more challenging there ?
Can you explain that ?
Sarah Palin :
The logistics that we are already suggesting here , not having enough troops in the area right now .
The things like the terrain even in Afghanistan and that border between Pakistan and Afghanistan , where , you know , we believe that — Bin Laden is — is hiding out right now and and is still such a leader of this terrorist movement .
There there are many more challenges there .
So , again , I believe that a surge in Afghanistan also will lead us to victory there as it has proven to have done in Iraq .
And as I say , Katie , that we cannot afford to retreat , to withdraw in Iraq .
That ’s not gonna get us any better off in Afghanistan either .
And as our leaders are telling us in our military , we do need to ramp it up in Afghanistan , counting on our friends and allies to assist with us there because these terrorists who hate America , they hate what we stand for with the the freedoms , the democracy , the the women ’s rights , the tolerance , they hate what it is that we represent and our allies , too , and our friends , what they represent .
If we were were to allow a stronghold to be captured by these terrorists then the world is in even greater peril than it is today .
We cannot afford to lose in Afghanistan .
Bonus # 2 : In an off - the - cuff response to a reporter ’s question about Islamic extremists , Palin linked Iraq to 9/11 :
Reporter :
Do you think that our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan — our continued military presence there — is inflaming Islamic extremists ?
Palin : I think our presence in Iraq and in Afghanistan will lead to further security of our nation .
Again , because the mission is to take the fight over there , do not let them come over here and attempt again what they accomplished here .
And that was some destruction .
Terrible destruction on that day .
But , since September 11th , Americans uniting and rebuilding and committing to never letting that happen again .
The video is too cringe - inducing for me to link , but it ’s available basically everywhere on the Internet .

Samsung Demonstrates World 's First Carbon - Nanotube Based Display
October 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Samsung unveiled the world ’s first carbon nanotube color active matrix electrophoretic display ( EPD ) e-paper recently at a conference in Korea .
The 14.3 inch e-paper display is the product of a partnership between Samsung and Unidym , the company that developed the carbon nanotubes used by the device .
The display has a variety of advantages over traditional flat panels .
Since the EPD does n’t require backlighting , it uses minimal energy and is visible under direct sunlight .
Additionally , the image on the display is retained without the need to constantly refresh .
The EPD is n’t just limited to e-paper devices — it ’s also a low - energy display option for cell phones and other mobile devices .
And a display that promises superior lighting combined with battery conservation is sure to be embraced by technophiles everywhere .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
As up to a million Texans flee the wind and rain of hurricane Ike , the federal government has imposed a " hurricane amnesty " for the state 's estimated 1.6 million unauthorized immigrants .
That means no ID checks at shelters , no border patrol checkpoints , no Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents scouring the highways , says Dan Martinez , spokesman for the Austin - based Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
He calls the massive evacuation a " humanitarian mission " to save lives ahead of what may become an 18 - foot storm surge pushing against the vulnerable continental shelf of Texas .
Such assurances would normally be enough to convince the tens of thousands of illegal immigrants in seven coastal counties to get their families out of harm 's way , says Frank Bean , director of the Center for Research on Immigration , Population and Public Policy at the University of California in Irvine .
But with the intensification of crackdowns and raids in recent years , evacuation may prove a tough sell to some Hispanics in the storm 's path .
" There 's a contradiction here – the government is between a rock and a hard spot , " says David McEntire , an emergency response expert at the University of North Texas in Denton .
" They want to enforce immigration laws , and another priority is to protect people and save lives .
It 's not going to be an easy task to reconcile them . "
As mandatory evacuations begin today , the Red Cross has begun handing out leaflets across the region , informing illegal residents of the amnesty .
Harris County officials have also informed Mexican Consulate General in Houston of the amnesty to help get the message out .
But in some areas , local emergency officials have not targeted the Hispanic community specifically .
For one , authorities say they do n't have a good handle on the exact number of undocumented workers living in the storm zone .
" We know there 's a significant number , " says Marco Bracamontes , a Harris County spokesman .
In nearby Matagorda County , emergency officials are equally unsure .
" I do n't know how many are here , " says James Gibson , a Matagorda County commissioner .
In Brazoria County , where the coastal city of Freeport could take the brunt of the hurricane , officials have told everybody to get out but have n't done any special outreach to undocumented communities .
" We 've done just about all we can do , " says Marie Beth Jones , a spokeswoman for the county .
" If they decide to stay , there 's not a whole lot we can do about it . "
The Bush administration stepped up immigration enforcement in the US interior in part to assure opponents of immigration reform that laws will be enforced , says Mr. Bean .
The idea has been to win support for a political solution to how to deal with the up to 20 million undocumented immigrants living in the US , most of them from Central and South America .
About 14 percent of them are believed to live in Texas .
Nationwide , ICE has stepped up its enforcement , making some 3,900 immigration arrests and 1,000 criminal arrests in the past 10 months .
Texas has been the site of several major ICE raids , including the Swift and Company raids in 2006 .
Whatever political advantage that tactic might have – so far , no comprehensive immigration reform has been passed – it's resulted in a " chilling effect " on the willingness of illegal workers to come out in the open , says Bean .
The extension of immigration control powers to local police forces is also playing into growing fear in the undocumented community .
More critically , the government has also sent mixed messages about storm evacuations .
While Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said in May that illegals who evacuate wo n't be targeted by federal authorities , a vanload of illegal workers who fled the Rio Grande Valley ahead of hurricane Dolly this summer were stopped and apprehended by the border patrol .
According to the patrol , as no mandatory evacuation orders were given , checkpoints stayed open .
" There 's definitely a trust issue , " says emergency response expert Mr. McEntire .
Meanwhile , emergency officials are hammering home the point that politics and fear should not be playing into evacuation efforts for a storm that has the potential of shaping up much like the 1900 hurricane that destroyed Galveston , Texas , and killed 6,000 Americans .
" I would hope very strongly , and I suspect , that all people are more interested in their family 's safety than whether or not an ID might be checked somewhere along the line , " says Joe Stinebaker , a spokesman for Harris County Judge Ed Emmett , who ordered a mandatory coastal evacuation of some 60,000 people at noon on Thursday .
" Nobody has any interest in using this as a law enforcement round up .
This is an attempt to save lives and avoid catastrophe . "
Earlier this month Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , warned that time is running out in Afghanistan .
Though emphasizing the need for reconstruction and noting that " we can not kill our way to victory , " he also announced that a new strategy would have to be pursued that would essentially consist of sending more soldiers , drawing them down from Iraq and sending them to Afghanistan .
Both Barack Obama and John McCain have endorsed sending two more combat brigades to Afghanistan , less than the three that the Pentagon is seeking .
The strategy for victory assumes , of course , that more soldiers alone will remedy what ails Afghanistan , turning the country around and making it into a stable , pluralistic democracy .
No one questions that security is a fundamental issue if Afghanistan is to be stabilized , but the assumption that 10,000 more soldiers will make the crucial difference can and should be questioned by the American public , which is providing the soldiers and paying the costs of the war .
Reading history books may not be required at the Naval Academy , but Adm .
Mullen should consider some historical analogies .
Afghanistan has been the graveyard of empires ever since Alexander the Great had trouble crossing the Khyber Pass in 326 B.C.
He wisely decided to pretty much leave the tribesmen alone and moved south to India .
From the Middle Ages on , waves of invading Mongols , Moghul rulers of India , and Persians have swept through the area , but the Afghan tribes have always proved fractious and hard to rule .
Foreign domination ended in 1747 when the Persians were expelled from the western part of the country and a local dynasty was established that survived into the 20th century .
For the following two centuries Britain and Russia vied to control the area because of its vital trade routes across Asia but found it largely indigestible .
An entire British army was annihilated in the First Afghan War of 1839 - 1842 .
Britain did not trouble the Afghans again until 1878 , when a modern army advancing on Kabul was ambushed and nearly overwhelmed at Ahmed Khel before British firepower gave the advantage to the invaders .
The British chose to leave the Afghans alone , paying a large subsidy in gold to the country ’s rulers while only stipulating that a British minister would have veto authority over Afghan foreign policy , a move designed to keep the Russians out .
In 1919 , the Afghans rose up , invading India before being driven back and defeated inside Afghanistan by an expeditionary force armed with field artillery and machine guns .
The British wisely withdrew and , by the Treaty of Rawalpindi in 1919 , the British Empire accepted complete Afghan independence .
The next great power that tried to occupy Afghanistan was the Soviet Union from 1979 to 1992 .
Moscow eventually sent 110,000 soldiers supported by tanks and helicopters to Afghanistan before withdrawing in failure with at least 10,000 dead .
A Soviet - backed puppet regime survived for a short time before being replaced by the Taliban .
Now there is a U.S. - backed puppet regime in Kabul headed by Hamid Karzai , sometimes referred to as the " Mayor of Kabul " because of the limits of his authority , who reportedly became president in the first place because he spoke good English .
His government is largely ineffective and is extremely corrupt , with much of the corruption coming from drug money , which makes up the bulk of the country ’s economy .
There have been numerous attempts to kill Karzai , who is protected from assassination by a praetorian guard from Blackwater International .
In short , invaders who seek to control Afghanistan either directly or by proxy become involved in long , bloody wars , and they eventually decide the best choice is to depart and leave the Afghans to their own devices .
That might be good advice in the current situation also .
Afghanistan is as big as the state of Texas .
It has nonexistent - to - poor roads , and its terrain is forbidding , with mountains in many parts and deserts in others .
Its richest agricultural regions in the south are also the areas where the Taliban are dominant and where poppies are grown that provide more than 90 percent of the world ’s heroin .
Washington is alarmed because violence in Afghanistan has been increasing dramatically over the past two years in all areas and by every metric .
The Taliban now control or move freely in nearly a third of the country , mostly in the Pashtun - dominated south and along the border with Pakistan .
In those areas , travel conditions are regarded as extremely hazardous and civilians from the UN or from NGOs cannot normally enter without large military escorts , which are themselves frequently attacked .
In another third of the country there is a high and increasing level of violence , though some NGOs continue to operate in the better - protected areas .
In the rest of the country , mostly in the Tajik - and Uzbek - dominated north , the situation is relatively secure .
Kabul is on a fault line between relatively safe and unsafe areas and has recently seen a number of bombings and assassinations .
Foreigners normally do not move around the city without an armed escort .
Because of the country ’s size and geography , it has been estimated that something like 400,000 soldiers would be required to effectively secure Afghanistan .
Lacking anything near those resources and given the profile of where the violence is concentrated , one would expect that there would be an intensified military effort to deal with the violence in the south and along the border , but that is only somewhat true .
There are 54,000 NATO and U.S. soldiers in the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) .
Most are in and around Kabul or engaged in reconstruction and training in relatively safe areas .
Of all the NATO troops , only the Canadians , British , and Dutch are allowed to operate in the dangerous south and actually fight .
And even for those nations , the NATO mandate on Afghanistan expires in 2010 , and there is every indication the parliaments in Europe , where the cause of Afghanistan is very unpopular , will refuse to extend the commitment , leaving only the U.S .
Washington currently has 31,000 soldiers in Afghanistan , half with NATO and half under independent command , and it might well add an additional three brigades or 10,000 soldiers by next year .
That might seem like a large number of soldiers , but there are four times that many in Iraq , a much smaller country and one that does not have a second war to contend with .
Neighboring Pakistan is both a safe haven for the Taliban and al - Qaeda and also itself a major front in the war in Afghanistan , because fighting along the border spills over into both countries .
Also , the numbers of U.S. soldiers are deceptive as the Pentagon deploys far more support and staff soldiers than it does combat units .
For example , the United States has 146,000 soldiers in Iraq but only 15 combat brigades .
Brigades are roughly 3,000 soldiers , meaning that slightly less than one third of the Iraq deployment consists of soldiers who are actually trained in fighting .
Of that one third , soldiers work in shifts and have administrative and training duties , and even combat units have their own staffs .
That generally means that less than a quarter of the number of combat soldiers are actually operational at any given time .
If you assume that the numbers for Afghanistan are roughly proportionate to those in Iraq , a surge of 10,000 more soldiers up to a 41,000 soldier total translates into 14,000 combat troops , only 3,500 of whom are patrolling or operating at any given time .
To continue with the Texas analogy based on the size of Afghanistan , consider what 3,500 soldiers would be able to do if they were deployed to fight an insurgency and also maintain order in a geographic area as big as Texas , where the city of Houston alone has more than 4,000 policemen , if the population were hostile and heavily armed .
A few thousand soldiers would be overwhelmed , which is precisely why in Afghanistan U.S. forces have had to rely on air power to maintain themselves , killing many civilians in the process .
One might also return to the historical analogy , noting that the Russians had 110,000 soldiers , backed a regime that had considerable resources , and still lost .
Finally , there is the political argument for considering giving up Afghanistan as an unwinnable cause .
The U.S. has occupied Afghanistan for seven years .
Pacification of the country , which might have taken place if the Iraq war had not intervened , did not occur , and the security situation is now worse than it has been at any time since December 2001 .
Reconstruction has been mismanaged and plagued by corruption .
Many potential donor countries have reasonably enough refused to give aid because the security situation is so bad .
The U.S. persists in supporting President Karzai even though his government is corrupt and ineffective .
Staying in Afghanistan to stop international terrorism is a fiction , as the presence of U.S. forces has , if anything , served as a magnet and recruiting tool for the insurgents .
If it is being argued that an enhanced U.S. presence in Afghanistan will suddenly turn things around and make the world a better and safer place , it is the right of the American public , which is sending its sons and daughters into the meat grinder , to demand an explanation of why that is so .
I do not believe that such a case has been or can be made .
It is time to consider leaving Afghanistan .
Nearly a quarter of the world 's land mammal species are at risk of extinction , and many others may vanish before they are even known to science , according to a major annual survey of global wildlife .
At least 1,141 of the 5,487 known species of mammal are threatened , with 188 listed in the highest risk " critically endangered " category .
One in three marine mammals are also threatened , according to the five year review .
The " red list " assessment , conducted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , involved more than 1,700 experts in 130 countries , and confirms the devastating impact of forest clearing , hunting , fisheries , pollution and climate change on the populations and ranges of the world 's most studied class of animals .
Jan Schipper , the director of the global mammals assessment , a partnership between Conservation International and the IUCN , called for countries to be held responsible for the fate of fauna within their borders and the establishment of an international coalition to save species that cross national boundaries .
" We 're looking at a 25 % decline over the long term , yet for mammals there is no bail out plan .
There is no long term conservation strategy that is going to prevent species extinction in the future , " he said .
" As human beings , we should be ensuring that we do n't cause other species to go extinct . "
Disturbingly , the figures are likely to be a conservative estimate , because scientists have insufficient data on 836 species to even classify how threatened they are .
If these are all at risk , it would mean 36 % of the world 's mammal species are in danger of becoming extinct .
Among the critically endangered species is the Iberian lynx ( Lynx pardinus ) , with only 84 to 143 adults remaining .
Experts believe 29 others may already have become extinct , including the Baiji or Yangtze river dolphin , and the little Earth hutia , a small rodent endemic to islands off Cuba , which has not been seen in nearly 40 years .
Two species , the Scimitar - horned oryx and Père David 's deer are extinct in the wild , and only live on in captivity .
Many species , such as the grey wolf and brown bear , have experienced substantial population declines and seen their ranges contract as their natural habitats have been destroyed .
More than half of the world 's mammal species for which trends are known are in decline , the report found .
" We are getting far too used to seeing these reports bemoaning the fate of the planet or the decline of animals .
I am really concerned that we have become deadened to this sort of depressing information and now simply ignore it without stopping to think about the implications , " said Mark Wright , chief scientist at WWF .
" The IUCN report shows that , with our ill - considered management of the Earth and its resources , we are threatening the future of wildlife and nature and denying our children the chance to experience what we have experienced . "
The survey , which is published by the journal Science today , identifies extinction hotspots where vast numbers of species are under threat .
Typically , these are regions with a rich diversity of species that all face a similar threat to their environment .
Threatened land mammals are concentrated in south and south - east Asia .
There , a staggering 79 % of monkeys and apes face extinction .
Other hotspots include the tropical Andes , the Cameroonian highlands , the Albertine rift and the Western Ghats in India .
" Often , there is habitat loss from deforestation , either for farming or timber , and that leaves the animals living on small patches of land .
Then , on top of that , you have hunting , with an enormous number of people who are entirely reliant on natural resources to feed themselves .
That has really set up a perfect storm over south - east Asia , " said Schipper .
The greatest threats to marine mammals are being caught in fishing nets or being struck by shipping vessels , although for the Yangtze river dolphin , pollution is a major contributor .
Climate change is already having an impact on amphibians and plant life , but it is expected to put increasing pressure on mammals too , either by destroying their environment , such as the Arctic ice sheets that are home to polar bears , or by forcing their prey elsewhere .
Among the most threatened mammals are those only recently discovered .
Since 1992 , 349 new mammal species have been identified , but 51 % of these face extinction , compared with 23 % of species known prior to 1992 .
" Species may be vanishing even before they are known to science , " the scientists write in the journal .
There is a glimmer of hope among the bleak assessment .
At least 5 % of the currently threatened species now have stable or rising populations , many of which are the focus of huge conservation efforts .
Populations of the European bison and black - footed ferret are both recovering .
" The problem we face is that without the political and public will to spend money on species conservation we are pressed up against the wall , " said Schipper .
" By making this data public , we 're hoping it 'll reach the people who make decisions about where money is spent . "

Alphamine Reviews - What Is It ?
Author : Eric Lander | Last Updated Date : 02.03.2020
WARNING : DO NOT BUY Alphamine Until You Read This Review !
Is it a Scam ?
Does It Really Work ?
Check Ingredients , Side Effects and More !
Alphamine is a thermogenic product that claims to boost your energy levels , physical performance and endurance .
It is manufactured by a company known as Physique Enhancing Science , which is based and operates in Florida in the USA .
The official website also offers some other products mainly for active people , however , it provides minimal information on the ingredients in the supplements .
Alphamine is produced with the goal to help athletes to improve their physical condition .
The company uses all possible ways to popularize itself through sponsorships of high - rate body builders , fitness models , and bikini models .
However , Alphamine has not been scientifically proven to be safe and effective .
Physique Enhancing Science claims on their website that the product possesses strong thermogenic properties .
They even mention that some studies have been conducted on the active components in Alphamine and demonstrated some promise for weight loss benefits .
However , studies conducted on yohimbe contained in the product are inconclusive and contradicting from study to study .
In general , results vary , so it cannot be stated that Alphamine always brings positive effects .
Ingredients of Alphamine - Does It Really Work ?
Is It a Scam ?
Physique Enhancing Science provides a picture of the product 's label on their official website .
one serving of Alphamine ( one scoop of 2.9 g ) contains Alphamine Proprietary Blend 1,590mg , L - Leucine , L - Carnitine , L - Tartrate , Choline Bitartrate , L - Theanine , Ferula Asafoetida ( seed ) Extract ( 95 % Ferulic Acid ) , Caffeine Anhydrous 125mg .
Other ingredients include Natural and Artificial Flavors , Citric Acid , Silicon Dioxide , Acesulfame Potassium , Sucralose , Beet Juice Concentrate .
It is recommended to add one scoop of the supplement to water and drink it 15 - 30 minutes before breakfast .
This beverage is supposed to boost metabolism and increase fat loss .
By looking at the major ingredients of the product , it is obvious that most of them are meant to improve cognitive function , focus and mental activity .
At the same time , there is a Ergothermogenic System which includes Higenamine HCl , Caffeine Anhydrous ( 125mg ) , and Pausinystalia Yohimbe ( Bark ) Extract ( SA2 - A ) .
These components are meant to enhance physical performance .
Some people may experience negative reactions because of the caffeine content , however .
The same can be said about yohimbine which is often associated with side effects .
Choline is supposed to give extra focus , however , little is known about theanine .
One of the key ingredients in Alphamine is the SA2 - A , also known as Alpha Yohimbe .
It is responsible for supplying more force and energy , however , it can be associated with negative side effects .
It is n't suitable for everyone , but if you respond well to it , you can use the supplement .
Many users continue complaining about adverse reactions .
The product seems to contain questionable ingredients , as there were some reports of the potential health issues .
If you taka a close look at the supplement 's label , you will see that it contains higenamine which could cause a number of adverse reactions .
One user told that his 18 - year old son suffered from an anxiety attack for two days after taking this product .
According to the Department of Health and Sport Science , University of Memphis , higenamine can increase heart rate .
Let us have a look at some other side effects of Alphamine .
Customer Reviews - Does It Have Any Side Effects ?
The manufacturer of Alphamine does n't mention anything about possible side effects of this supplement on the official website .
They only inform their potential clients of some warnings .
The product should not be used in combination with caffeine or other stimulants .
I think the reason is that the supplement itself possesses powerful stimulant properties and you may experience side effects .
The product should not be used under the conditions of heat , dehydration or sleep deprivation .
It can be taken only by healthy adults .
If you have any health conditions , consult your physician before using Alphamine .
Also talk to your doctor if you are taking any prescription medications on a regular basis .
Remember that caffeine contained in the supplement can be harmful for people with cardiovascular disease , psychic illnesses , as well as for pregnant or nursing women .
Some users complain of experiencing nausea and light - headedness .
One man said that he experienced a frequent desire to pee .
You are not protected from jitters , too .
That is why avoid taking Alphamine before sleep .
There is no science behind the product that would confirm its effectiveness and safety .
Let us have a look at the testimonials left by real users online .
" I just started using Alphamine and I have to confess that I am disappointed with its taste and flavor ( Strawberry Pina Colada ) .
It has a too chemical flavoring , so I have to force myself to drink it .
I have n't noticed any boosting effect yet .
I would not recommend this product to my friends . "
" I have tried alphamine with Iced Tea Flavor .
The taste is a little bitter and chemical .
I have n't noticed a higher mental focus , weight loss or intensity in my workouts .
I think I have to stick to a more consistent diet . "
" I have heard that PEScience is a good company but Alphamine leaves much to be desired .
After taking it two times , I noticed something strange with my vision but I continued taking the supplement .
After using it on the fourth day , my vision became hazy for a few hours and then cleared out .
I was scared and stopped taking this product . "
Where To Buy Alphamine ?
Alphamine is available on the official website and through some retailers .
GNC sells the product for $ 35 ( 84 servings ) , A1 Supplements offers it for $ 36 , Amazon sells the supplement for $ 40 , while Walmart offers it for $ 40 .
My Final Summary
Alphamine has a number of cons .
I am concerned about its major ingredients - yohimbe and caffeine .
These can be really dangerous for some users .
The official website does not provide details on possible side effects of the product , as well as on money - back guarantee .
The ingredients of the supplement have not been proven to help with weight loss .
Many people find Alphamine ineffective .
What I like about the product is its low price and availability online .
But because of numerous concerns I would not recommend Alphamine to usage .
Affordable Alternative
I study a lot of different supplement designed for boosting endurance , physical performance and muscle growth .
And I can say that there is one worthy alternative on the market .
It is called CrazyBulk Winsol ( Winidrol ) .
It is one of the best supplements for body builders available in present day market .
This supplement claims to build lean muscle in a short period of time and without any side effects which usually occur when using similar products .
The best part about it is that you do n't have to take it too excessively but still you will be able to achieve the desired body shape with better stamina faster .
Winsol also improves vascularity and blood circulation , provides a lot of energy and decreases the recovery time after a workout .
I recommend reading my review about Winsol .

Albright slams Palin for misquote RAW STORY
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Alaska Governor and vice presidential hopeful Sarah Palin is the recipient of harsh criticism from former Secretary of State and UN Ambassador Madeleine K. Albright after Albright was misquoted at a Saturday rally in Carson , California .
" What advice do you have for women who want respect from their male colleagues ? "
Dana Philbin of Chicago asked Albright for a January piece in Time Magazine .
" Women have to be active listeners and interrupters , " she responded , " but when you interrupt , you have to know what you are talking about .
I also think it is important for women to help one another .
I have a saying :
There is a special place in hell for women who do n't . "
" There 's a place in Hell reserved for women who do n't support other women , " Palin said on Saturday , rewording a version of the same quote on another source : a Starbucks coffee cup .
" Though I am flattered that Governor Palin has chosen to cite me as a source of wisdom , " Albright told the Huffington Post , " what I said had nothing to do with politics .
This is yet another example of McCain and Palin distorting the truth , and all the more reason to remember that this campaign is not about gender , it is about which candidate has an agenda that will improve the lives of all Americans , including women .
The truth is , if you care about the status of women in our society and in our troubled economy , the best choice by far is Obama - Biden . "
A clip of Palin 's speech appears below .
One of the criticized " features " of the iPhone since day one has been the lack of a user - swappable battery .
For any heavy user , the fact that you can no longer rely on being able to carry a spare battery for a long day of use , but rather , a charger , has been a sore point .
Of course , with the device 's amazing popularity , many have overlooked that flaw , or worked around it with external battery extenders .
However , the EU will likely not be so kind .
Current regulation , introduced with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive ( RoHS ) in July of 2006 , primarily sought to prevent the unnecessary use of toxic metals in batteries as well as making it easier to recycle and dispose of used batteries .
The updated " New Batteries Directive , " as written about for New Electronics by Gary Nevision (
. PDF
) , would go much further .
Article 11 of the Directive , as currently written , would :
Article 11 of the New Directive affects the design of electrical equipment , which must be made in such a way as to allow batteries , either for replacement or at end of life for disposal to be ' readily removed ' - although this term is not yet defined .
The requirement is clearly intended to ensure that users can remove batteries by opening a cover by hand or after removal of one or two screws .
The producer will also have to provide the user with details on how to remove the battery safely .
Of course , Apple 's iPhones and iPods would n't meet this requirement , as it stands .
An iPhone battery replacement program could be considered a cash cow for Apple ( $ 79.95 + 6.95 shipping ) .
After all , if we want a replacement battery for a Samsung Blackjack II , we can look on eBay and find knockoffs from Asia for a few dollars at most .
As AppleInsider
notes
, however , this Directive would not be so much about a feature , but a way to keep used and toxic batteries out of landfills .
So , would Apple lobby for a change ?
Maybe , but Europe has n't been all that receptive to such an approach by Apple , at least to this point , on things like
i Tunes ' DRM
.
We all know there will be newer iPhones coming out , so we would think it 's likely that Apple would at least consider user - swappable batteries for new models .
They wo n't do anything for the current ones of course .
So let 's hope this Directive passes , because it would be a boon to the user , though not for Apple 's bottom line .
Of course , Uncle Steve needs to think about being " green " too , especially if RoHS compliance eventually stands in his way .

The moment a grey heron catches a baby rabbit by the ears , drowns it , then swallows the thing whole
These amazing pictures show how cruel nature can sometimes be as a grey heron snacks on a rabbit .
Herons mainly eat fish but will also take birds and small mammals .
This one was searching for a meal when it spotted the baby rabbit emerging from a hole .
Swooping down it grabbed its prey by the ears , took it to water and drowned it - then swallowed the rabbit whole .
What a catch :
The heron grabs hold of the unsuspecting baby rabbit
Time for the kill :
The hungry bird takes its catch to the waterside
Wildlife photographer Ad Sprang captured the dramatic images in Vianen , Holland .
' I was trying to get some nice shots of this grey heron , ' said the 56 - year - old Dutchman .
' After taking several shots , a little rabbit appeared out of a hole .
' The heron was interested in it and slowly approached the little rabbit .
You could feel the tension . '
Death throes :
The heron holds its prey under the water to drown it
Big gulp :
As the rabbit disappears down the heron 's throat only the legs can be seen
Obviously hungry , the adult bird , which averages about 100 cm ( 3ft ) in height and has a 1.95 m ( 6ft ) wingspan , made its move .
' In a split second , the bird caught the rabbit , ' said Sprang .
' I managed to take two photos and the bird flew away with its food in its bill . '
Sprang followed the bird by car .
He added : ' It landed in some water and I took several photos of the rest of the story .
' I have often seen herons catching prey like mice and fish but catching a rabbit was a surprise . '
In the Netherlands , the grey heron has become very common and has moved into urban environments in great numbers .
There , the herons hunt as they usually would but also make use of food discarded by humans and even visit zoos at feeding times .

Last Friday afternoon , the FCC issued a report putting to rest worries about interference from a free wireless broadband service using the AWS - 3 spectrum , paving the way for an auction sometime next year .
However , opponents of the auction , including T - Mobile , are n’t going to give up without a fight .
The original proposal for the spectrum , put forth two years ago by a Kleiner - backed company called M2Z Networks , had asked the FCC for use of the spectrum in the 2155 - 2175 MHz band to create a wireless broadband service .
M2Z offered the FCC 5 percent of its revenue in exchange for the spectrum .
It also pledged 25 percent of its network for free broadband service at lower speeds .
The company would charge more for faster speeds and would build out 90 percent of its network in 10 years at a cost of $ 2 – $ 3 billion .
In June the FCC issued its own rulemaking proposal , which hewed closely to the M2Z proposal .
The FCC proposal would also restrict material that could be deemed obscene and “ harmful ” to children between ages 5 and 17 ( i.e. , porn ) on the resulting wireless broadband network .
Update :
An FCC spokesman says that aspect of the proposal will likely get tweaked during the rulemaking process to allow adults to opt - out of such filters .
T- Mobile had argued against the potential auction and use of the spectrum on the grounds that it would interfere with services deployed on the neighboring AWS - 1 spectrum , which T - Mobile leased for $ 4 billion .
But it appears that FCC Chairman Kevin Martin , is n’t buying into the argument now that T - Mobile ’s filters have proven to be ineffective at keeping out content from the nearby spectrum .
“ You should n’t have equipment that reads spectrum you do n’t own , ” Martin told Dow Jones .
Damn !
Who is this reasonable , carrier - smacking FCC chair ?
It ’s nice to see a potential wireless broadband competitor making it out into the world , but the content limitations should give everyone pause .
A whole mess of litigation will stand between this network and real use , as any government - created wireless broadband network should probably be free of censorship .
Meanwhile , a mess of litigation might still stand between an AWS - 3 auction and the creation of a network , as T - Mobile seems inclined to release the lawyers if the FCC goes forth with its proposal .
The company issued a statement from Kathleen Ham , VP of federal regulatory affairs , via email , but did n’t answer my question about suing to protect its interests directly .
The statement read :
While we are glad the FCC engineers finally put their observations on the record , we have serious concerns that their analysis is flawed and relies on factors that were not the subject of the testing , while ignoring other important data in the record .
In light of this , we are concerned that the result was predetermined unfairly .
We and the multiple parties concerned about interference will strongly urge the FCC to provide for sufficient time for comment on their report before any FCC action on these rules .
I may have to eat my words about the unliklihood of wireless broadband competition , but I ’ll wait until the networks are up and devices are out before admitting defeat .

" We knew there would be a bloodbath as soon as the market opened , " said the trader .
" We knew the price would rocket , widening the exposure of lots of hedge funds – they would be offering their daughters in return for the stock , just to get out of it . "
Jacqui Smith 's announcement yesterday of tougher measures to exclude " preachers of hate " is the latest in a series of initiatives to prevent young British Muslims turning to violent extremism .
A mushrooming array of guidelines for schools , colleges and councils emphasises the need to challenge the narrative al - Qaida uses to attract recruits .
These guidelines do nothing to challenge the dominant narrative by which violent extremism is commonly explained , a narrative that sees even peaceful groups as transmission belts on which insecure Muslims are shuffled towards violence .
However , there is a very different narrative of British Islam , which the government is less keen to talk about .
There is a reason for that .
The dominant story is of a second generation who grew up in the Paki- bashing 80s and suffered a profound identity crisis on reaching adulthood .
Torn between the culturally based Islam of their families and the pressures of contemporary society , these Muslims proved easy prey for radicalisation by exiled clerics from hardline groups , who presented a narrative of historical oppression going back to the Crusades .
With variants , that model is put forward by rightwing thinktanks , Conservative ideologues , former Hizb ut - Tahrir activists and erstwhile leftwingers .
At its core is the idea that even non-violent organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain and those connected with groups like the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood are on what the former left commentator Nick Cohen calls " a continuum whose terminus is pathological hatred " .
Or , as Newsnight 's Richard Watson puts it : " Today 's suicide bombers are yesterday 's Islamists . "
That narrative is powerfully countered in Race & Class , the journal of the Institute of Race Relations ( on whose board I sit ) .
Arun Kundnani's article starts from the identity crisis of second - generation Muslims - but takes it in a very different direction .
He explains the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood ideologue Sayyid Qutb , not in terms of his ( undoubted ) social fundamentalism , but of his insistence that it 's up to individual Muslims how to interpret their religion .
Echoing the Protestant reformation , Qutb advocated a global Islam , liberated from national forms .
His vision gives Muslims an attachment to a world community ; it is compatible with many aspects of modernity ; and , on a personal level , it gives Muslims an Islamic excuse not to marry their cousins .
For some , this blend of globalism and individualism explains the attraction of political Islam to the 7/7 bombers .
But it also explains the trajectory of other Muslims , who have moved from youthful militancy towards a very different kind of engagement , a trajectory of which involvement in the anti-Iraq war movement is an obvious example .
For Cohen , the Stop the War Coalition is an unholy alliance of a demoralised , morally relativist left and an " Islamist far right " .
If that were true , you would expect the left to sell out to Islamism on issues such as women's and gay rights , free speech and antisemitism , while the Islamists remained ideologically steadfast .
In fact , far from dragging duped progressives towards a hardline Islamist agenda , much of the intellectual movement has been the other way .
So , as Catholics picketed parliament for the right to discriminate against gay couples , the MCB issued a statement supporting the legislation on the grounds that , despite Islam 's opposition to homosexuality , it " stands opposed to discrimination in all its forms " .
Rightly , and not before time , the MCB has lifted its boycott of Holocaust Day .
In a Guardian article last year , the former Young Muslim student activist Inayat Bunglawala ( now of the MCB ) reiterated the importance of the anti-Satanic Verses campaign , but said that he was wrong to call for it to be banned .
Similarly , the MCB did n't call for the banning of Fitna , the anti-Islam film by the Dutch MP Geert Wilders , on the grounds that ( as Bunglawala put it ) , the " same freedoms which allow Wilders to taunt Muslims so openly are also the ones which allow Muslims and others to spread the teachings of their faith " .
The co-chair of the February 2003 Iraq war march , Anas Altikriti of the British Muslim Initiative , points out that the Qur'an says nothing about homosexuality beyond relaying the Biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah .
The Birmingham Respect councillor Salma Yaqoob has consistently opposed bans of and protests against anti-Muslim material .
Influenced by Abdelwahab El - Affendi ( author of Who Needs an Islamic State ? ) and the international scholar Tariq Ramadan , these Muslims are seeking to build a distinctly European Islam that sits easily with western pluralism and its political processes , without having to sacrifice the essentials of their beliefs .
So why is this narrative not trumpeted in the myriad guidelines on combating extremism ?
It 's not Muslim views on halal meat or the hijab that bother the government , but their views on other matters .
All these activists oppose the government 's attacks on civil liberties .
Like the 7/7 bombers , they were politicised not by Afghanistan or Iraq but by the Bosnian war , and the sight of western countries standing by while Muslims were dispossessed , raped and murdered on Europe 's eastern doorstep .
They see no reason to keep quiet about their views of western foreign policy now .
As Yaqoob puts it , the huge support for the February 2003 march - particularly from middle England - led many Muslims to feel they belonged to Britain for the first time .
On these pages , Ziauddin Sardar has argued that the problem with the ex-Islamist Quilliam Foundation is not that it is anti-fundamentalist or anti-segregationist , but that it is anti-political ; it wants Muslims to keep quiet .
In fact , as Kundnani argues , a whole generation of British Muslims has rejected " the folkoric religio - cultural practices of their parents " in search of new ways of being Muslim , in public , in contemporary Europe .
What could be more welcome ?

If the first winner of the “ $ 1 million a year for life ” scratch - off game seemed less than ecstatic yesterday , it ’s because he was n’t exactly struggling to scratch out a living .
Keenan Altunis , 33 , a banker raised on Long Island and now living in London , accepted his prize with a smug shrug , noting he ’s already a multimillionaire .
“ Is it going to materially change my life ?
No , ” he told The Post .
“ I have been a very blessed and fortunate person . ”
And if that is n’t an argument for spreading the wealth around , how about this :
Since he lives in Britain , Altunis , an executive at the European banking firm Unicredit , will have to pay New York but not federal taxes on his winnings , which means he ’ll net $ 931,500 a year for the rest of his life .
Under a US treaty with Britain , income from lottery winnings and several other sources is not subject to taxation for British residents .
Altunis is not an American citizen .
The first grand prize in the $ 30 - ticket drawing comes with a minimum payout of $ 20 million , should something unforeseen happen to Altunis , who just celebrated his fourth wedding anniversary and has a 1 - year - old daughter .
Altunis and his family emigrated from Turkey when he was 5 years old and he graduated from Massapequa HS and the University of Pennsylvania before moving to London for a career in finance .
On a trip home to New York last month for a wedding , he gave his mother $ 100 to buy him tickets for the newly advertised game before heading to the airport .
His mother tossed in another $ 20 and bought four .
“ I knew there would n’t be time that weekend to buy tickets for myself , so I left enough money with my mother to buy three before leaving for the airport , ” said Altunis .
“ It turned out to be the best return on any investment I ’ve ever made . ”
After discovering she had a winner , his mother kept the ticket under her mattress for days until Altunis could make the trip home .
“ She called me up and said , ‘ You ’re not going to believe this , ’ ” he said .
“ At first , I did n’t . ”
Since the scratch - off games are “ bearer devices , ” it does not matter that he did not buy the tickets himself , officials said .
In fact , it makes sense in this case to give the prize to a younger relative to maximize the award .
“ I am in fine health , ” he said .
“ I also do n’t do anything risky – I do n’t do bungee jumping or stuff like that . ”
Altunis said that part of his desire to downplay his winnings is the current economic crisis , which has caused his industry and many of his friends a great deal of strife .
“ It ’s very unfortunate to see friends losing their jobs , ” he said .
“ We are all feeling the pinch a bit .
This has been one of the toughest times in the world , so the win for me is bittersweet . ”
Lottery winners often say that they will not allow their newfound fortunes to change who they are , but in Altunis ’ case , that is n’t such a stretch .
“ Do n’t get me wrong , no matter how rich anyone is , a million a year is a lot of money , ” he said .
“ But I do n’t expect this to change my life very much at all . ”
The family left New York yesterday for a vacation in the Caribbean – one that had already been planned and paid for prior to his winning ticket .

e Bay is a buyer this morning .
The company announced that it will buy Bill Me Later for $ 945 million .
As if that were n’t enough , eBay will also acquire both Danish classifieds specialist Den Bla Avis and Danish vehicle site BilBasen for approximately $ 390 million in cash .
But the San Jose , Calif . - based eBay also laid off 1,000 people , or 10 percent of its employees , and said that revenues in the third quarter were lower than expected .
e Bay ’s cutbacks had been expected .
The layoffs will result in a pretax restructuring charge of $ 70 million to $ 80 million in the fourth quarter .
The company is also laying off several hundred temporary workers , and its stock is off 60 percent from its peak a few years ago .
e Bay , due to report earnings on Oct. 15 , said in July that it expected net revenues of between $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.15 billion for the third quarter .
Its non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be between 39 cents and 41 cents per share .
This morning eBay stock is down 8 percent to $ 17.40 a share .
It is trading far below its 52 - week high of $ 40.73 a share .
Like PayPal , which eBay already owns , Bill Me Later is an alternative payment e-commerce firm .
It lets consumers pay for goods at more than 1,000 online sites without using a credit card .
You supply your name , birth date and Social Security number ( last four digits ) .
Then it bills you later .
Bill Me Later ’s largest shareholder is Azure Capital Partners .
This deal adds to other big exits for Azure , which include VMware ( bought for $ 635 million by EMC in 2003 , WorldWide Packets — bought for $ 300 million earlier this year — and TopTier , bought by SAP for $ 400 million in 2001 ) .
Bill Me Later raised about $ 200 million in venture funding and it said that it would hit $ 150 million in revenues next year .
That means that eBay paid about 6.5 times revenues , a pretty good valuation in a turbulent market .
Michael Kwatinetz , general partner at Azure Capital , said that Bill Me Later was one of the first companies to use the web as a platform .
That means that it uses a variety of web services in order to verify a buyer ’s identity and to run a credit check on that person within the course of three seconds .
Normally , credit card companies may take a week to do such verification for first - time buyers .
Bill Me Later has a system where it bills most of its customers electronically and most of those customers pay electronically .
That keeps its costs low .
VIENNA ( Reuters ) - North Korea on Monday restored access for U.N. monitors to its atom bomb complex following a deal with Washington to salvage a denuclearization process endangered by disputes over verification , diplomats said .
“ The ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) inspectors can access all facilities at Yongbyon again , including the reprocessing plant , ” said one diplomat , referring to the site that made plutonium fuel for Pyongyang ’s atomic bomb program .
The diplomats were familiar with IAEA operations but were not allowed to discuss such confidential information publicly .
There was no immediate comment from the U.N. nuclear watchdog ’s headquarters in Vienna .
But one official said fresh information on the monitors ’ status could come later in the day .
North Korea had barred the inspectors from Yongbyon last Thursday in anger over Washington ’s refusal to remove it from a sponsors - of - terrorism blacklist in a dispute over the extent of verification measures required for denuclearization .
The U.S. State Department announced on Saturday that it had delisted the Stalinist state after Pyongyang agreed to a series of verification steps .
On Sunday , North Korea said it would resume disablement work and re-admit IAEA monitors .
A diplomat said the three inspectors ’ first job would be to reassess the status of Yongbyon ’s facilities , since Pyongyang had taken steps in recent weeks to reactivate them .
The IAEA was also likely to require details of the verification deal to smooth the task of re-establishing regular safeguards inspections in North Korea , which walked out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003 .
NO NEW DISABLEMENT WORK SEEN
South Korea said on Monday it had seen no signs of the North restarting work to take apart Yongbyon , a Soviet vintage complex including a fuel fabrication facility and a 5 - megawatt reactor .
Under a February 2007 disarmament deal with five powers , North Korea was to have been removed from the U.S. blacklist once it provided a full accounting of its nuclear programs and accepted a system to check its claims .
The isolated , impoverished North has longed to be delisted so it can draw from international finance , see a myriad of trade sanctions dropped and use global settlement banks to send money abroad instead of relying on cash - stuffed suitcases .
But the deal threatened to unravel after Pyongyang signaled it had no intention to let foreign monitors scour the nation at will and poke into any military or other high - security site .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Washington ’s decision to delist North Korea was made after the North agreed to access for experts to all declared nuclear facilities and , based on “ mutual consent , ” undeclared sites .
Experts from the six nations handling the North Korean dossier -- the two Koreas , Russia , China , Japan and the United States -- could participate in verification , and the IAEA would have an “ important consultative and support role . ”
Measures would encompass the plutonium bomb program as well as “ any uranium enrichment and proliferation activities . ”
Slideshow ( 4 images )
But the deal has yet to be formalized , and implementation almost certainly remains a treacherous challenge .
First , North Korea has reported producing less plutonium than the United States has estimated , which is about 50 kg ( 110 lb ) , or conservatively enough for six to eight nuclear bombs .
Second , Washington wants to be able to check on suspicions that the North has a covert program to enrich uranium for weapons -- giving it a second pathway to atom bomb capability -- and that it exported the proliferation - prone technology .
Most of the dismantling steps , begun last November , had been completed and were supposed to take at least a year to reverse .
As a part of the 2007 disarmament deal , North Korea began receiving 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil , or aid of equal value such as steel , when it froze operations at Yongbyon last year and allowed in nuclear inspectors .
South Korea is likely to send 3,000 tonnes of held - up steel aid to the North once it was clear dismantling work had resumed , Yonhap news agency quoted multiple sources as saying on Monday .
Facebook employees are in an enviable position : Each of them owns a small piece of a company that 's worth billions of dollars , which means each of them is looking at the prospect of a windfall -- one day .
But until Facebook sells or goes public -- and neither prospect looks imminent -- it 's hard for them to do much with their paper wealth .
Solution : Create a way for employees to sell a small portion of their shares at a pre-determined price .
That 's what VentureBeat 's Eric Eldon says Facebook intends to do :
He says workers will be able to sell up to 20 % of their vested equity , at a $ 4 billion valuation this fall .
Facebook has declined to offer any comment to us , at least for now , so we 'll assume that there 's at least some truth to Eric 's report .
But Eric does n't have any details about how the plan will work , so for the time being all we can do is speculate wildly .
With that caveat , we can think of several different options Facebook may be considering :
Allow employees to arrange transactions themselves , and sign off on each one .
Unlikely given paperwork and other logistical headaches .
And Facebook will want to control the number of equity shareholders it has -- if they hit 500 , they essentially become a public company *
( A reader tells us this rule has changed ; can anyone confirm ?
We believe the relevant SEC rule is Exchange Act Section 12 ( g ) .
Thanks . )
Arrange for a single buyer to hoover up all the shares in a single transaction .
Much more likely , given the reasons above .
Borrow the money itself to buy back the shares in a single transaction .
Pro :
It should be relatively easy for Facebook to borrow money at a higher valuation -- somewhere between the $ 4 billion its employees are selling at , and the $ 15 billion preferred deal that Microsoft got -- and reacquire equity it 's already distributed .
Con : Borrowing money to pay for anything other than servers , real estate and the like may be a hard sell to Facebook 's exec team , board and investors .
In any event , this is n't going to be a huge financial transaction :
Assume that the employee option pool makes up no more than 15 % of Facebook 's equity -- 20 % of that would mean that 3 % of Facebook 's total equity could theoretically be in play .
At a $ 4 billion valuation , that 's $ 120 million .
.
But the numbers will likely be much smaller than that : Startup options typically vest over a 4 - year period , and Facebook is barely 4 years old .
And most employees have joined in the last two years ; if Facebook follows a typical " cliff vest " structure , where none of your shares vest until you 've been at the company for a year , that means that very few of their shares are eligible for the deal .
So even if every employee who was able to sell shares decided to do so , our best guesstimate would be that at most , perhaps 0.05 % to 1 % of equity , valued at $ 20 to $ 40 million , will trade hands this fall .
Divided up between the company 's 600 + employees , that 's a significant amount of money -- perhaps enough to cover down payments on a Silicon Valley starter home , or to swap a Prius for a Tesla .
But it 's unlikely that any of the Facebookers are going to cash in and drop out .

At the Linux Plumbers Conference Thursday , Arjan van de Ven , Linux developer at Intel and author of PowerTOP , and Auke Kok , another Linux developer at Intel 's Open Source Technology Center , demonstrated a Linux system booting in five seconds .
The hardware was an Asus EEE PC , which has solid - state storage , and the two developers beat the five second mark with two software loads : one modified Fedora and one modified Moblin .
They had to hold up the EEE PC for the audience , since the time required to finish booting was less than the time needed for the projector to sync .
How did they do it ?
Arjan said it starts with the right attitude .
" It 's not about booting faster , it 's about booting in 5 seconds . "
Instead of saving a second here and there , set a time budget for the whole system , and make each step of the boot finish in its allotted time .
And no cheating .
" Done booting means CPU and disk idle , " Arjan said .
No fair putting up the desktop while still starting services behind the scenes .
( An audience member pointed out that Microsoft does this . )
The " done booting " time did not include bringing up the network , but did include starting NetworkManager .
A system with a conventional hard disk will have to take longer to start up : Arjan said he has run the same load on a ThinkPad and achieved a 10 - second boot time .
Out of the box , Fedora takes 45 seconds from power on to GDM login screen .
A tool called Bootchart , by Ziga Mahkovec , offers some details .
In a Bootchart graph of the Fedora boot ( fig. 1 ) , the system does some apparently time - wasting things .
It spends a full second starting the loopback device — checking to see if all the network interfaces on the system are loopback .
Then there 's two seconds to start " sendmail . "
" Everybody pays because someone else wants to run a mail server , " Arjan said , and suggested that for the common laptop use case — an SMTP server used only for outgoing mail — the user can simply run ssmtp .
Figure 1
Another time - consuming process on Fedora was " setroubleshootd , " a useful tool for finding problems with Security Enhanced Linux ( SELinux ) configuration .
It took five seconds .
Fedora was not to blame for everything .
Some upstream projects had puzzling delays as well .
The X Window System runs the C preprocessor and compiler on startup , in order to build its keyboard mappings .
Ubuntu 's boot time is about the same : two seconds shorter ( fig. 2 ) .
It spends 12 seconds running modprobe running a shell running modprobe , which ends up loading a single module .
The tool for adding license - restricted drivers takes 2.5 seconds — on a system with no restricted drivers needed .
" Everybody else pays for the binary driver , " Arjan said .
And Ubuntu's GDM takes another 2.5 seconds of pure CPU time , to display the background image .
Figure 2
Both distributions use splash screens .
Arjan and Auke agreed , " We hate splash screens .
By the time you see it , we want to be done . "
The development time that distributions spend on splash screens is much more than the Intel team spent on booting fast enough not to need one .
How they did it : the kernel
Step one was to make the budget .
The kernel gets one second to start , including all modules .
" Early boot " including init scripts and background tasks , gets another second .
X gets another second , and the desktop environment gets two .
The kernel has to be built without initrd , which takes half a second with nothing in it .
So all modules required for boot must be built into the kernel .
" With a handful of modules you cover 95 % of laptops out there , " Arjan said .
He suggested building an initrd - based image to cover the remaining 5 % .
Some kernel work made it possible to do asynchronous initialization of some subsystems .
For example , the modified kernel starts the Advanced Host Controller Interface ( AHCI ) initialization , to handle storage , at the same time as the Universal Host Controller Interface ( UHCI ) , in order to handle USB ( fig.3 ) .
" We can boot the kernel probably in half a second but we got it down to a second and we stopped , " Arjan said .
The kernel should be down to half a second by 2.6.28 , thanks to a brand - new fix in the AHCI support , he added .
Figure 3
One more kernel change was a small patch to support readahead .
The kernel now keeps track of which blocks it has to read at boot , then makes that information available to userspace when booting is complete .
That enables readahead , which is part of the early boot process .
How they did it : readahead and init
Fedora uses Upstart as a replacement for the historic " init " that traditionally is the first userspace program to run .
But the Intel team went back to the original init .
The order of tasks that init handles is modified to do three things at the same time : first , an " sReadahead " process , to read blocks from disk so that they 're cached in memory , second , the critical path : filesystem check , then the D - Bus inter - process communication system , then X , then the desktop .
And the third set of programs to start is the Hardware Abstraction Layer ( HAL ) , then the udev manager for hot - plugged devices , then networking .
udev is used only to support devices that might be added later — the system has a persistent , old - school / dev directory so that boot does n't depend on udev .
The arrangement of tasks helps get efficient use out of the CPU .
For example , X delays for about half a second probing for video modes , and that 's when HAL does its CPU - intensive startup ( fig. 4 ) .
Figure 4
In a graph of disk and CPU use , both are at maximum for most of the boot time , thanks to sReadahead .
When X starts , it never has to wait to read from disk , since everything it needs is already in cache .
sReadahead is based on Fedora Readahead , but is modified to take advantage of the kernel 's new list of blocks read .
sReadahead is to be released next week on moblin.org , and the kernel patch is intended for mainline as soon as Arjan can go over it with ext3 filesystem maintainer Ted Ts'o .
( Ted , in the audience , offered some suggestions for reordering blocks on disk to speed boot even further . )
There 's a hard limit of 75 MB of reads in order to boot , set by the maximum transfer speed of the Flash storage : 3 seconds of I/O at 25 MB / s .
So , " We do n't read the whole file .
We read only the pieces of the file we actually use , " Arjan said .
sReadahead uses the " idle " I / O scheduler , so that if anything else needs the disk it gets it .
With readahead turned off , the system boots in seven seconds , but with readahead , it meets the target of five .
X is still problematic .
" We had to do a lot of damage to X , " Arjan said .
Some of the work involved eliminating the C compiler run by re-using keyboard mappings , but other work was more temporary .
The current line of X development , though , puts more of the hardware detection and configuration into the kernel , which should cut the total startup time .
Since part of the kernel 's time budget is already spent waiting for hardware to initialize , and it can initialize more than one thing at a time , it 's a more efficient use of time to have the kernel initialize the video hardware at the same time it does USB and ATA .
X developer Keith Packard , in the audience and also an Intel employee , offered help .
Setting the video mode in the kernel would not let the kernel initialize it at the same time as the rest of the hardware , as shown in figure 3 .
The fast - booting system does not use GDM but boots straight to a user session , running the XFCE desktop environment .
Instead of GDM , Arjan said later , a distribution could boot to the desktop session of the last user , but start the screensaver right away .
If a different user wanted to log in , he or she could use the screensaver 's " switch user " button .
Figure 5
In conclusion , Arjan said , " Do n't settle for ' make boot faster . '
It 's the wrong question .
The question is ' make boot fast ' . "
And do n't make all users wait because a few people run a filesystem that requires a module or sendmail on their laptops .
" Make it so you only pay the price if you use the feature . "
Distributions should n't have to maintain separate initrd - based and initrd - free kernel packages , he said later .
The kernel could try to boot initrd - free , then fall back if for whatever reason it could n't see / sbin / init , as might happen if it 's missing the module needed to mount the root filesystem .
PowerTOP spawned a flurry of power - saving hacks from all areas of the Linux software scene .
The combination of Bootchart , readahead , and a five - second target looks likely to set off a friendly boot time contest among Linux people as well .
At the conference roundup Friday , speaker Kyle McMartin announced that both Fedora and Ubuntu have fixed some delays in their boot process , and there was much applause .

Guido Gybels , the group director , told the Guardian : " If you could have a fairly intelligent system in the hearing aid that uses metadata to pick up only the information which is relevant to you then that would be helpful . "
We knew good and well it was on the way , but now we 're bubbling over with excitement .
The forthcoming Model S -- an all - electric , five passenger sports sedan that will ride on a platform developed entirely by Tesla -- has apparently been revealed .
Of course , there 's still a real possibility that the image you 're drooling on above is n't a finalized look , but Road & Track has a pretty good record to fall back on .

When the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) begins smashing protons together this fall inside its 17 - mile - ( 27 - kilometer - ) circumference underground particle racetrack near Geneva , Switzerland , it will usher in a new era not only of physics but also of computing .
Before the year is out , the LHC is projected to begin pumping out a tsunami of raw data equivalent to one DVD ( five gigabytes ) every five seconds .
Its annual output of 15 petabytes ( 15 million gigabytes ) will soon dwarf that of any other scientific experiment in history .
The challenge is making that data accessible to a scientist anywhere in the world at the execution of a few commands on her laptop .
The solution is a global computer network called the LHC Computing Grid , and with any luck , it may be giving us a glimpse of the Internet of the future .
Once the LHC reaches full capacity sometime next year , it will be churning out snapshots of particle collisions by the hundreds every second , captured in four subterranean detectors standing from one and a half to eight stories tall .*
It is the grid 's job to find the extremely rare events — a bit of missing energy here , a pattern of particles there — that could solve lingering mysteries such as the origin of mass or the nature of dark matter .
A generation earlier , research fellow Tim Berners - Lee of the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) set out to create a global " pool of information " to meet a similar challenge .
Then , as now , hundreds of collaborators across the planet were all trying to stay on top of rapidly evolving data from CERN experiments .
Berners - Lee 's solution became the World Wide Web .
But the fire hose of data that is the LHC requires special treatment .
" If I look at the LHC and what it 's doing for the future , " said David Bader , executive director of high performance computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology , " the one thing that the Web has n't been able to do is manage a phenomenal wealth of data . "
Bandwidth alone is a major bottleneck .
Bader said that for researchers running supercomputer simulations , it 's cheaper to write the data to terabyte hard drives and ship them from one supercomputer center to another via FedEx than it is to transfer the gigantic data sets over the net .
The LHC Computing Grid handles data in stages , referred to as tiers .
" Tier 0 , " located at CERN , is a massively parallel computer network composed of 100,000 of today 's fastest CPUs that stores and manages the raw data ( 1s and 0s ) from the experiments .
It ships portions of data over dedicated 10 - gigabit - per- second fiber - optic lines to 11 " Tier 1 " sites across North America , Asia and Europe .
Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , N.Y. , for example , receives data from the ALICE experiment , which collides lead ions .
From those sites the data is parceled out for easier access among 140 Tier 2 computer networks based at universities , government labs and even private companies around the globe .
Tier 2 is where scientists will actually access data and perform the kinds of hands - on numerical analysis needed to translate the raw 1s and 0s into energies and trajectories of particles .
The crucial element that will make the data accessible , said project leader Ian Bird of CERN 's information technology ( IT ) department in Geneva , is a type of software known as " middleware " .
The information a user wants may be spread among petabytes of data on different servers and stored in different formats .
An open - source middleware platform called Globus is designed to gather that information seamlessly as though it 's sitting in a folder on one 's own desktop PC .
The trial by fire that LHC programmers will be putting Globus through — and the modifications that emerge as a result — may be the first practical outgrowth of the LHC grid .
If project scientists can tame massive , worldwide fields of networked data and computing cycles in particle physics , their solutions could well apply across the Internet — in much the same way that Berners - Lee 's specialized HTML invention morphed into the very backbone of modern technological society .
Bader imagines future middleware allowing home computers to provide instant weather forecasts by accessing information from nearby environmental sensors .
Or it might help sift through a life 's accumulation of personal medical records or years of home video footage looking for dimly remembered events .
Ironically , CERN 's next great contribution to the Internet could be all but transparent to the end user .
In a perfect world , Globus or its successors would simply make everything on a given grid straightforwardly and transparently accessible from any computer .
" If Globus is a success , " Bader said , " then you wo n't hear about it . "
* Correction ( 9/3/08 ) :
This article originally stated that the LHC will produce millions of snapshots of particle collisions ; " millions " refers to the number of collisions , only a fraction of which will be recorded .
No one would have believed in the last years of the twenty - first century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences marginally greater than man 's and yet as mortal as his own ; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and studied , perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water .
With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs , serene in their assurance of their empire over matter .
It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same .
No one gave a thought to the older worlds of the series of tubes as sources of human danger , or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable , or more importantly , trivial .
It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days .
At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Gizmodo , perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise .
Yet across the gulf of the interwebz , minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish , intellects cynical and cool and unsympathetic , regarded this earth with envious eyes , and slowly and surely blogged their plans against us .

A Muhammad look - a- like competition is slated to take place during the Frankfurt Book Fair , and it has already offended and outraged people far beyond Germany .
But Titanic , the monthly satirical magazine behind the inflamatory event , insists : " It will be a blast . "
Titanic , the German satire magazine , is never far from polemics , but its latest action takes its reputation for controversy to new heights :
It is staging a Muhammad look - a- like competition -- and has invited the Turkish President Abdullah Gül to take part .
A drawing submitted to " Titanic " as part of its Muhammad look - alike contest .
Turkish newspapers were quick to react to the " unbelievable competition , " which is to be held parallel to the Frankfurt Book Fair , where Turkey will be the guest country this year .
The popular Turkish dailydrew parallels with the infamous Muhammad cartoons published in Denmark ' snewspaper in 2005 , which sparked death threats and protests across the Muslim world , with some escalating into violence .
UPDATED :
WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke suggested that the Fed will cut interest rates further in the days ahead as a result of the heightened risks to the economy from the severe financial crisis of the last month .
In a speech before the National Association of Business Economists , Mr. Bernanke said consumers and businesses have started to spend less as a result of spreading worries about the economy and reduced access to credit .
Even people with good credit are having trouble obtaining mortgages and home equity loans , he said .
At the same time , the huge drop in oil prices from a record high over $ 147 in July to under $ 90 today has dramatically lowered the outlook for inflation , giving the Fed room to consider lowering rates , he said .
“ The intensification of financial turmoil and the further impairment of the functioning of credit markets seem likely to increase the restraint on economic activity in the period ahead , ” he said .
“ Banks are reducing credit card limits , and denial rates on automobile loan applications reportedly are rising .
“ Businesses , too , are confronting diminished access to credit .
For example , disruptions in the commercial paper market and tightening of bank lending standards have made it more difficult for businesses to obtain the working capital they need to meet everyday operating expenses such as payrolls and inventories , ” he said .
The problems businesses are having raising cash through short - term debt sales prompted the Fed this morning to take the first - ever step of directly purchasing such unsecured debt from businesses and financial companies in the commercial paper market .
Mr. Bernanke told the business economists that the move was necessary because the Fed ’s other direct lending programs for banks and Wall Street firms were n’t working to calm that critical market .
The Fed ’s moves initially calmed stressed stock markets this morning , but stocks deteriorated rapidly during Mr. Bernanke ’s speech as investors were disappointed the Fed did n’t indicate any rush to cut interest rates .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 100 points at the beginning of the speech but quickly fell to a loss of 345 points as of 2 p.m .
Many analysts on Wall Street are calling for immediate , coordinated rate cuts from the Fed and its European counterpart .
Many believe the country is on the brink of , or already in , its first recession since 2001 .
“ The outlook for economic growth has worsened , ” Bernanke said in prepared remarks to the annual meeting here of the National Association for Business Economics .
All told , economic activity is likely to be “ subdued ” during the remainder of this year and into next year , Bernanke said .
“ The heightened financial turmoil that we have experienced of late may well lengthen the period of weak economic performance and further increase the risks to growth , ” he warned .
Meanwhile on Wall Street , the Federal Reserve took the extraordinary step Tuesday morning of moving to lend for the first time to businesses and financial companies that float short - term debt in the commercial paper market , which has been shut down for weeks .
Even top-rated businesses like GE and Caterpillar have had difficulty in recent weeks selling their short - term paper , and some companies have been shut out of the market altogether .
The Fed has many programs to lend to banks and Wall Street firms through its New York lending window , but this is the first time it will lend directly to U.S. businesses that are unable to roll over their debts and are facing a cash crisis .
The commercial paper market is one of the riskiest loan markets because the short - term debt in most cases is not backed with collateral and can be wiped out if the borrower files for bankruptcy , as happened in the case of Lehman Brothers last month .
Many subprime mortgage companies borrowed in the market and then disappeared last year when the credit crisis struck , leaving their creditors stuck with billions in bad loans .

In past lending programs for banks , the Fed always took collateral such as portfolios of Treasury bonds or mortgages in exchange for loans , to protect taxpayers in case the borrowers are unable to pay their obligations .
The new short - term loan program the Fed announced for businesses this morning will not require collateral on all the loans , but borrowers who do not provide collateral will be required to pay a fee , the Fed said .
“ The commercial paper market has been under considerable strain in recent weeks as money market funds and other investors , themselves often facing liquidity pressures , have become increasingly reluctant to purchase commercial paper , ” especially longer - term loans , the Fed board said in announcing the new program .
“ As a result , the volume of outstanding commercial paper has shrunk , interest rates on longer - term commercial paper have increased significantly , and an increasingly high percentage of outstanding paper must now be refinanced each day . ”
“ By eliminating much of the risk that eligible issuers will not be able to repay investors by rolling over their maturing commercial paper obligations , this facility should encourage investors to once against engage in lending , ” the Fed said .

We are getting back to posting the answers to our interview questions .
I ’ve found it is interesting to hear how individuals decide it is time to move on to another job .
Here are the answers from the people we interviewed .
If you have a method you use , please share in the comments .
I think when you start counting down — hours to the end of the day , days to Friday , weeks to vacation — it is time to start finding something more fulfilling .
Wishing your life away is no way to live — when you are doing something deeply satisfying , time disappears and each day becomes exhilarating !
Kristen from BOOK CLUB CLASSICS ( rss )
I think we underestimate the value of a minute spent doing something we really enjoy .
It ’s time to look for a new job when you are spending too much time working to earn money that you will never have the time to enjoy , and trying to earn the respect of people who really do n’t care about you .
Life is too short to not be lived .
Jason from World Fitness Network ( rss )
It is amazing what people will do to impress people they do n’t really like .
Jobs are valuable only insomuch as they allow you to do other things .
If you are so physically or mentally exhausted that you cannot do anything else , it ’s time to get a new job .
If you find that work gets in the way of you doing what you want to do more than it enables you to do those things , it ’s time to get a new job .
The ideal condition , of course , is when work is play since your job is what you want to do .
If you ’re happy doing what you want to do , success generally follows .
If you ’re not happy doing what you ’re doing , success generally will not follow .
The best time to quit your current job , if it meets the conditions specified about , is as soon as you find a better alternative .
There ’s never a good time to switch jobs or change careers , but if you know something ’s not working out for you , it is better to get off the boat while it ’s still in harbor rather than some indefinite time in the future .
Charlie Gilkey from Productive Flourishing ( rss )
I see many people getting an education in something that “ pays well ” without any thought as to what they really enjoy doing .
I think people should put effort into things that they enjoy .
Passion is often as valuable as knowing some well - paying skill .
( Although it helps when you are passionate about something that pays well . )
If you do n’t look forward to working when waking up in the morning then it ’s clear that something is seriously wrong .
Work is one of the things which should motivate you to get up in the morning , not make you wish that you were on holiday .
Alan Johnson from TheRatingBlog ( rss )
If you would n’t prefer to be on holiday , I ’d say you do n’t know how to take good vacation . :)
But , good point .
If you wake up with dread instead of excitement , you are doing something wrong .
Good clues it might be time for a job change : you do n’t feel like you are learning anything new ; you do n’t feel like anyone “ gets ” you ; you examine your job responsibilities and realize that few line up with what you are actually good at and are interested in ; you have serious concerns with the leadership or stability of your company ; you feel dread when you get up in the morning to go to work ; your health is poor due to overwork and stress or finally you do n’t see how this job contributes to your long - term career goals .
Pamela Slim from Escape from Cubicle Nation ( rss )
Good point on the long term goals .
When I hire people , I always make it a point to find out where they are wanting to be in 5 or 10 years .
I know I can make their work experience much more rewarding if I can help them work toward those goals .
When you do n’t have passion for what you are doing anymore !
John Richardson from Success Begins Today ( rss )
Although I would caution about jumping around just when things get boring , sometimes it is a sign that you need to talk to your boss and ask for more responsibility .
When somebody you know and trust makes you an offer you ca n’t refuse , and not before .
That said , always be working towards being the person that will be made that offer .
Priority number 1 , even if you are a CEO , is to know who your boss will be .
If that is n’t going to be bettered , with a high degree of certainty , then do n’t jump .
Never run away from things , always be called forwards .
Unless the thing is a lion of course !
Benjamin from WOWNDADI ( rss )
I have heard of high - level employees who said they would take a job with the condition that their office was on the same floor as the CEO .
Another employee agreed to take a job as long as he was able to eat dinner with the CEO and other top executives a couple times each year .
Who you work for matters and if you want to really learn from them , you need to make sure you actually are around them .
There are three important factors that cause me to look for another job :
1 . The most important factor in my personal occupational satisfaction is that I enjoy my work .
When the work becomes boring , unchallenging , or just pure drudgery and my boss does n’t seem to care , I start looking elsewhere for employment .
2 . Another important factor is that I am appreciated and valued .
How important I am to my organization is evidenced by how I ’m paid , how much I ’m paid , whether my opinions are valued , and how I ’m treated publicly and privately by my boss .
If these areas are lacking and the boss does n’t seem to care , I start looking elsewhere for employment .
3 . My third factor is that I want my work to be meaningful and fulfilling on some level .
I do n’t have to be saving thousands of starving people , but I want to know that my employment results in the betterment of someone ’s life .
It may be that I help keep a group of people employed and able to feed their families .
It may be that I help a struggling customer with setting up a payment plan .
When my work seems to become nothing but a meaningless wad or paperwork , I start looking elsewhere for employment .
Right now , I ’m looking elsewhere for employment … .
Ron Haynes from The Wisdom Journal ( rss )
I hope you find a job that you like .
Your three items make an excellent read for managers who are looking at retaining people .
I think a lot of bosses forget to treat people in the way they would like to be treated .
Usually when the business school career center tells us to …
In the past though , it ’s always been when you plateau on the learning curve .
If you stop growing and start stagnating , you slowly start to run into those things that really make your time at work stink .
It does n’t mean you have to quit your company , but it does mean you need to either look for a promotion or for ways to expand your current job description .
Jared Degnan from Vanderbilt OwenBloggers ( rss )
Good point .
Before jumping ship , it might be worth looking for ways to make your current job better .
If you are planning on leaving , it gives you quite a bit of leverage .
When you stop arriving an hour early just because you ’re excited to start working .
Which would mean most people should start looking .
Joel Falconer ( rss )
That is an interesting test .
I agree that if you are showing up an hour early just because you like the work , you probably have a pretty good job–or a horrible social life .
When you have really tried to find the value in what you do , but ca n ’t .
When you feel like you are doing things that are unethical .
When the ONLY reason for doing what you do is to make money .
When you start wondering if everything you do is useless and there is no hope for ever making things better .
If these feelings are present much of the time at work , you are in the wrong job and probably in the wrong career too .
Ariane Benefit from Neat & Simple Living ( rss )
Money is a good reason to work , but it is poor as an only reason .
For me , I know that I need to look for a new client when I am bored .
If I am not learning and thinking and growing , I am stagnating .
It ’s time to move on .
LJ from simpleproductivityblog ( rss )
This is a good reminder that people working for clients may sometimes need to switch to a new client in order to keep things interesting an fulfilling .
I ’m entrepreneurial , but I believe strongly in multiple streams of income–that often includes working for another employer in addition to running my own business .
A year - and - a - half ago I made a career change from working as a Web Programmer to working as a computer Instructor and Courseware Author .
I had identified in my 3 - to 5 - year plan that I needed to improve my public speaking skills and writing skills .
Shortly after that , a great job opportunity became available to do just that .
I ’m loving it !
I ’ve lost my share of jobs over the years as well , but each transition also turned into a better opportunity somewhere else .
More than anything , people need to follow their heart .
Life is too short to spend it doing something you hate .
Do what you love .
Do n’t be afraid to make a change when your own desires change .
Give every job 110 % , but do n’t take anything so seriously that it ceases to be fun .
When all the fun is gone it ’s past time to leave .
Ricky Spears from Ricky Spears ’ Blog ( rss )
When you can see into the future and realize that the fun is going to be gone is a good time to leave .
Better to move on while you are ahead .
Though I do n’t qualify for this anymore … three straight days of “ I do n’t want to go to work at that place ” was a clear signal .
Mike Sansone from ConverStations ( rss )
It would n’t take me many days of waking up like that to come to the same conclusion .
Fortunately , I ’ve been able to move on before I got to that point at every job I ’ve had .
I find this question difficult , because in a sense I ’m always looking for a new job .
I would say the most obvious tell would be stomach aches and difficulty sleeping .
This is not a way to live life .
Anne from Writers Cabal Blog ( rss )
If I ’m going to get stomach aches and insomnia from my job , I ’d rather be working for myself .
If you are going to take that level of stress , you need the associated chance of reward and that just is n’t present in most jobs .

WASHINGTON – Americans ’ retirement plans have lost as much as $ 2 trillion in the past 15 months — about 20 percent of their value — Congress ’ top budget analyst estimated Tuesday as lawmakers began investigating how turmoil in the financial industry is whittling away workers ’ nest eggs .
The upheaval that has engulfed financial firms and sent the stock market plummeting is also devastating people ’s savings , forcing families to hold off on major purchases and even delay retirement , Peter Orszag , the head of the Congressional Budget Office , told the House Education and Labor Committee .
As Congress investigates the causes and effects of the meltdown , the panel pressed economists and other analysts on how the housing , credit and other financial troubles have battered pensions and other retirement funds , which are among the most common forms of savings in the United States .

Maddow : Bush legacy ' defined by four massive failures ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This MSNBC's Rachel Maddow suggested on Monday that the continuing debate among historians about whether George W. Bush will find a place in the presidential failure hall of fame alongside Herbert Hoover and Warren G. Harding " is over . "
" Barring yet another disaster of unimaginable scale , we now know that the presidency of George W. Bush will be defined by four massive , country - changing failures , " stated Maddow .
She went on to cite 9/11 , the " mendacious launch of the Iraq War , " the drowning of New Orleans , and now an economic meltdown in which " we 're borrowing $ 700 billion dollars , probably mostly from China , to stem off utter collapse . "
" Eight years , four crises , each one awful enough on its own to brand any presidency an abject failure , " Maddow quipped .
" And we got them all done with just one guy .
Bargain . "
Maddow was then joined by Thomas Frank , author of The Wrecking Crew : How Conservatives Rule , who told her , " These things are connected , with the exception of 9/11 . "
" It 's judgment day for the conservative philosophy of governing , " Frank asserted , pointing out that Bush is n't personally responsible for the housing bubble , " but conservatism is , with its idea of ' let the markets do what they want , the markets will always find equilibrium , the markets can self - regulate . ' "
Frank blamed not only the current economic problems but also the missteps with Iraq and New Orleans on Bush 's philosophy of privatization and outsourcing .
" This is a problem of letting people run government when they believe that government can't work and ought not work , " Maddow suggested .
" What I wonder is whether or not Democrats are going to get off the Reaganeseque conservative trip they 've been on since Clinton and stop following the Republicans ' lead on this . "
" I certainly hope they are , " laughed Frank .
Maddow then asked whether any of these issues have come up in the presidential campaign , and Frank responded , " They have n't got at them yet , but they 're being forced to by the collapse on Wall Street . "
" If somebody can tell me what a ' credit default swap ' is we can start talking about how to go about regulating it , " Frank complained .
" We do n't even know what they are . "

A group of United States senators sent N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell a letter Tuesday expressing continued concern over what they consider the exclusionary nature of showing select games on the NFL Network .
The letter , obtained by The New York Times , was signed by 13 senators , including Patrick Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , and Arlen Specter , a Republican from Pennsylvania who has criticized Mr. Goodell on numerous issues , including the New England Patriots ’ spying case .
The NFL Network begins its slate of Thursday night games on Nov. 6 .
The Jets play the Patriots on Thursday , Nov. 13 , in a game that will be televised on the NFL Network and on Channel 11 in the New York metropolitan area .
Senator Specter has repeatedly called for the N.F.L. to make its games available to as many viewers as possible on free television , rather than favoring its own cable network .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
After months of tossing charges at each other , Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama came face to face at the White House on Thursday in high - stakes talks over a Wall Street bailout plan and their first debate hanging in the balance .
McCain emerged hopeful that progress on a $ 700 billion rescue of the financial industry would allow him to attend a debate with Obama on Friday in Oxford , Mississippi .
Obama said he would be there whether McCain was or not .
He suggested McCain was injecting presidential politics into negotiations over the rescue plan , one of many Democrats to howl about the Arizona senator ’s abrupt suspension of his campaign to return to Washington to insert himself into the debate .
“ The concern that I have ... is that when you start injecting presidential politics into delicate negotiations , then you can actually create more problems rather than less , ” Obama told a news conference .
McCain senior adviser Steve Schmidt shot back that it was the top Democrat in the Senate , Nevada Sen .
Harry Reid , who had said McCain ’s help was needed to help corral Republican support for the plan .
The presidential campaign played out across Washington , from Capitol Hill to the White House to the television cameras a day before the first presidential debate is scheduled to take place .
McCain said progress was being made and he expressed confidence that a deal would be reached .
Aides said he was working the phones to gain the support of Republicans uneasy about the cost of the $ 700 billion bailout .
“ I ’m very hopeful that we ’ll have enough of an agreement tomorrow that I can get to Oxford ... I understand how important this debate is and I ’m very hopeful but I also have to put the country first , ” McCain told CBS News .
AIR OF CAUTION
But the McCain campaign was maintaining an air of caution as the candidate settled in for the night in the Washington area instead of flying to Mississippi as scheduled .
Obama made clear he would show up at the site of the debate at the University of Mississippi on Friday night and stage an event alone if necessary , putting pressure on McCain to attend the first of three face - to - face debates that may prove pivotal in the November 4 election .
“ It is my intention to be in Mississippi , ” Obama told ABC News .
“ I think he ( John McCain ) knows that I ’m going to be there .
So , you know , I hope that he is as well . ”
Slideshow ( 10 images )
McCain and Obama stepped off the campaign trail to take part in the White House talks after McCain took the unusual step of suspending his campaign to work on the bailout deal and warned he would not attend the debate without an agreement .
Democrats accused McCain of pulling a political stunt in a scramble to regain his footing on the U.S. economy a week after saying economic fundamentals were strong despite the brewing Wall Street meltdown .
At the White House , a participant in the meeting , Republican Alabama Sen .
Richard Shelby , said McCain and Obama “ were very courteous to each other and very respectful . ”

Afterward , each candidate quickly ran to the television cameras and charges flew from both sides .
Schmidt accused the Obama camp of trying to buy television advertising space that McCain officials had given up during their campaign suspension , saying Obama acted in a “ politically predatory fashion . ”
Obama spokesman Bill Burton expressed doubts about McCain ’s self - declared campaign suspension .
“ Though the McCain campaign announced yesterday that they were also ‘ suspending ’ their attack ads , they continued to run Thursday , ” he said .
Reid , a Nevada Democrat , said he believed Democrats and Republicans were moving toward a deal and that McCain would only get in the way .
“ If we lose progress it is only because of one person -- that is John McCain standing in the way , ” he said .

A few days ago I made yet another tweak to my Ubuntu laptop to make the fonts look a little better .
The result is that I 'm now quite happy - - impressed even .
Here are the three things I 've done to make my day - to - day work easy on the eye .
First , enable subpixel smoothing in the System > Appearance control panel .
For a long time that 's all I had done was was reasonably happy .
Things looked okay but not great .
But I used GNU Emacs for most of my coding and wanted fonts there that looked at good as those in gnome terminal .
That led me to the second tip : install emacs - snapshot and use the GTK version .
Then you can add this to your ~/. Xresources file :
Emacs.font : Monospace -10
And bingo !
The same font that 's in your terminal is in Emacs .
That made me happy in Emacs , but my Firefox fonts were still a bit sucky .
So when I read Tweak Your Font Rendering for Better Appearance in Tombuntu , I had to give it a try .
I created a ~/.fonts.conf file and added this to it :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
<!
DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM " fonts.dtd " > < fontconfig > < match target = " font " > < edit name = " autohint " mode = " assign " > < bool > true </bool > < /edit > </ match > </ fontconfig >
I logged out and back in and suddnely found myself staring at fonts in Firefox that looked as good as I 've seen in Safari on a Mac .
That 's all there was to it for me : subpixel rendering , emacs - snapshot , and enabling hinting via a . fonts.conf file .
It 's worth noting that you can go even farther with the advanced font settings , but I really have n't needed to go that far yet .

昨日のネタがウケたので、悪ノリしてみました。
Rubyを使って自然言語（というか英語）っぽい記述を行うライブラリといえばRSpecがまず例に上がるんですけど、
最近はもう英語に近くなりすぎて、日本人にとっては逆に使いにくくなっているんじゃないかという気がするんですよ。
このままでは英語圏と日本人のプログラマの生産性の格差は高まるばかり、
ていうか正直に言って英語ばっかりずるい、ここは一つ日本語を生かしたコード、日本語DSLの登場が待ち望まれているのではないか。 以下 「それなでしこでできるよ」禁止。
というわけで妄想してみました、日本語でBDDを行うライブラリ、その名も「Japanespec」。
require ' japanespec ' include Japanespec " Ruby " .の 仕様{ # == Math.sqrt ( 4 ) .は
2.に なる # 案1 Math.sqrt ( 4 ) .は 3.に ならない Math.sqrt ( 4 ) .は 2 , である # 案2 Math.sqrt ( 4 ) .は 3 , ではない # be [ 1,2,3 ] .include ?( 3 ) .は 正しい # be_true [ 1,2,3 ] .include ?( 4 ) .は 正しくない # be_false [ ]. first .は nil .に なる # be_nil [ 1 ] . first .は nil . に ならない # not be_nil # equal ?
5.は 5.と 同一であ る " 5 " . は " 5 " . と 同一ではない # should change obj = 1 lambda{ }.は obj.の : prop .を 変える lambda{ }.は obj.の : prop .を 1.から 2.に 変える # has , include ary = [ 1,2,3 ] ary .は
2.を 含む ary .は
3.個の : item , を持つ ary .は
3.個以上の : item , を持つ ary .は
3.個未満の :item , を持つ # respond_to ary .は : size , : length , に応答する # raise lambda{ }.は 例外 を投げる lambda{ }.は 例外 ArgumentError , を投げる lambda{ }.は 例外 ArgumentError , " foobar " , を投げる # match str = " abcde " str. は / abc /.に マッチする # satisfy obj = 1 obj.は { |o| o < 3 and o%3 == 1 }.を 満たす }
どうでしょうか ？
まだ中身の実装はしてないんですけど、恐ろしいことにこれ、ちゃんとパーズが通ります。ソースはgithub。
暇な人は冬休みの課題として実装してみるといいよ！
テクニカルなこ と
以下 、Rubyで日本語DSLを設計する際の注意点など。
まず 、Ruby 1.8だとwarning出まくるんで1.9でやりましょう。1行目の「# coding : utf-8」も忘れずに。
上のソースがどのように解釈されるかですが、一つだけ例を挙げると
str.は /abc/.に マッチする
というコード( コードですよ ) は、
str.は(/abc/.に(マッチする ) )
と解釈されます。より分かりやすく書き換えると、
str.foo(/abc/.bar baz( ) )
ということ 。foo , bar , bazと いうメソッドの呼び出しがネストしてるわけです。日本語版ではそれぞれ「 String#は 」 、「 Regexp#に 」 、「 Japanespec#マッチする」ね。 こんな感じで、
obj.foo bar baz
のようにメソッドや関数を並べるのがRubyによる日本語DSLの定石です。
ちょっと凝ったことをしたいときには、つい
foo ( bar , 3 ) baz
みたいにカッコを使いたくなりますが、これはパースエラーになってしまいます。 「 あれ、fooがProcオブジェクトを返したらいけるんじゃね？」と思ったあなたはScheme脳(もしくはHaskell脳 ) ( もしくは Python脳 ) で、 Procオブジェクトを実行するには
foo ( bar , 3 ) . call baz foo ( bar , 3 ) [ baz ]
のようにcallか [ ]が必要です。まあcallは論外ですが[ ]も記号だらけになってあんまりよろしくないですね。
なのであり得る形としては、
a.foo b.bar baz , 3
のように一番右のメソッド呼び出しだけ引数をカンマで区切るくらいかと思われます。
もっとクール(笑) な書き方を見つけた方はご一報ください。
This is the third of a series of articles about my experience with the Pinax project .
I am building a sample paste bin application named Oxybeles , of all things .
On the previous articles I installed Pinax and created a tab in the main menu for my new app .
Now I want to create a basic view , but first I need to start a new Django app .
$ python manage .py startapp oxybeles
It seems that it would be appropriate to move it into the apps directory , so I did that :
$ mv oxybeles / apps /
Here , I took a detour to create a GitHub repository to host this application , but I wo n’t record my git sessions on this series , because the focus is on Pinax and Django .
After exploring a bit how other Pinax application URLs are set up , I decided to start by copying the pattern used in the “ about ” application .
I started by creating a basic template :
$ mkdir templates / oxybeles $ gedit templates / oxybeles / new.html
I created the new file templates / oxybeles / new.html with this content :
{ % extends " site_base.html " %} { % load i18n %} { % block head_title % }{ % trans " Paste Bin " % }{ % endblock %} { % block body %} { % blocktrans %} < p >
This will be a form to post some text .</p> { % endblocktrans %} { % endblock %}
Next , I created a new urls .
py file inside the new app :
$ gedit apps / oxybeles/urls.py
from django.conf.urls.defaults import * from django.views.generic.simple import direct_to_template urlpatterns = patterns ('' , url ( r' ^$ ' , direct_to_template , { " template " : " oxybeles/new.html " } , name= " oxybeles_new " ) , )
Then I added the new application to the main urls .
py file :
$ gedit urls .py
Around line 56 , inside the urlpatterns list declaration , I inserted :
( r'^pastebin / ' , include ('oxybeles.urls ' ) ) ,
And finally , I changed the menu option to link to the new URL :
$ gedit templates / site_base.html
Changing :
< td class = " tab rtab_pastebin " >< div > < a href= " # " >{ % trans " Paste Bin " %}</a></div></td>

It is unclear how many women may have decided not to get abortions at the already overstretched public hospitals because it took too long to get appointments or because they had to wait too long for the required ultrasound .

Since unrestricted abortions became legal in April 2007 , doctors have performed ( or overseen when pills are used ) some 12,500 of the procedures at public clinics and hospitals , according to the Health Ministry .
But at least some women have tried other methods .
Alejandra , 24 , who works for the city ’s women ’s institute , said that when she went to get an abortion last year at a public hospital , a social worker there told her that she would need to pay for her own ultrasound , which is supposed to be free , and that she would need to be accompanied by a family member .
Scared off by the description of the risks and the procedure , she fled the hospital .
She ended up taking pills to induce an abortion , without seeing a doctor , and developed a serious infection .
She asked that only her first name be used because she said she recently received a death threat for speaking at a city event celebrating the new law .
Another woman , a 27 - year - old high school literature teacher , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said her friends told her that they were treated like prostitutes at public hospitals .
She also took abortion pills but said they were ineffective , requiring her to visit a doctor to complete her abortion .
To speed up treatment , officials are moving low - risk abortions out of overworked public hospitals into three smaller public clinics , based in part on models in Britain and the United States .
The smaller staffs there should be more supportive , they hope .
On a recent morning at one of those clinics , called Beatriz Velasco de Alemán , in a working - class neighborhood , women waited with friends , husbands and boyfriends in a small courtyard , chatting , fiddling with their cellphones or staring into space .
One 27 - year - old married mother of two who had come to the clinic for an abortion saw no contradiction between her religion and abortion .
“ I ’m Catholic but now the law has been passed , ” she said as she went inside for her appointment .
" The first step in protection is education .

Sexually transmitted diseases ( also called STDs , or STIs for sexually transmitted infections ) are infections that can be transferred from one person to another through sexual contact .
Everyone , young or old , rich or poor , sexually active or not , needs to know a few important facts about sexually transmitted diseases .
1 What are STD ?
Sexually Transmitted Diseases are infections that are passed from person to person through sexual contact , including :
Vaginal sex  the mans penis in the womans vagina .
Anal sex  the mans penis in the partners anus ( the partner can be either male or female ) .
Oral sex  the mans penis in the partners mouth , or the partners mouth or tongue in the womans vagina .
Oral - anal sex  one partners mouth or tongue on the other partners anus .
Sexually transmitted diseases are caused by different infectious microorganisms including bacteria , viruses and parasites , which are transmitted through semen , vaginal fluid , blood or other body fluids during sexual activity .

2 There is no immunity to STD
If you get an STD once , you can get it again .
Moreover , you can have more than one STD at a time .
Hepatitis B is the only STD for which a licensed vaccine is available .
3 The incidence of STD's is rising
Even with all the education and resources readily available today , the number of cases of STDs continues to rise dramatically worldwide , sadly .
This happens in part because in the last few decades young people have become sexually active earlier yet they get married later .
In addition , divorce is more common .
The net result is that sexually active people are more likely to have multiple sex partners and are more likely to acquire and spread STD's .
4 Half of all STDs occur in people younger than age 25
Although teens and young adults represent only 25 % of the sexually active population , 15  24 - year - olds account for nearly half of all STI diagnoses each year .
Adolescents are more concerned about unwanted pregnancy than with contracting an STD .
5" No symptoms " does not mean " no STD "
Most STDs can be " silent , " causing no noticeable symptoms .
These asymptomatic infections can be diagnosed only through testing .
So infected person can infect someone else without even knowing it .
This is especially true in women .
If symptoms develop , they may be confused with those of other diseases not transmitted through sexual contact .
In fact , about 70 % of chlamydial infections in women , and 50 % in men pass without acute symptoms .
6 There is currently no cure for STDs caused by viruses
Viral STDs ( such as genital warts , herpes , hepatitis B ) cannot be cured , but their symptoms can be treated .
There is no known way to get any of these viruses out of a person 's body once infected .
7 Bacterial STDs are curable
Bacterial STDs , such as gonorrhea , syphilis , and chlamydia , are cured with antibiotics .
8 Women are more likely to have serious health problems from STDs
Health problems caused by STD 's tend to be more severe and more frequent for women than for men .
This is because of the increased frequency of asymptomatic infections .
As a result many women do not seek care until serious problems develop .
9Consequences of STDs
It is quite true that most sexually transmitted infections can be completely cured if they are caught at an early stage .
However , if left untreated , STIs can pose a long - term risk to your health and fertility .
And the sad fact is that certain STDs are eventually fatal .
While each STD causes different health problems , overall , they can have some common consequences :
Ectopic or tubal pregnancies which can be fatal to the mother and are always fatal to the unborn baby .
Babies born to women with sexually transmitted diseases may suffer death or severe damage as a result of the mother 's STD .
Sometimes sexually transmitted diseases cause damage to other organs including the heart , kidneys , and brain .
10 to 20 % of women with gonorrhea and chlamydia develop one of the most serious complications , pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) .
Women who have current or prior history of certain sexually transmitted diseases such as PID have a significant chance of experiencing infertility .
Up to 40 % of women with untreated chlamydia infections develop PID , and 20 % of those may become infertile .
In men , untreated STD can cause epididymitis , a painful infection in the tissue surrounding the testicles that can result in infertility .
10 Certain STDs can be transmitted through Non-Sexual contact
Usually direct sexual contact , such as vaginal , oral or anal sex , is required to transmit the infection .
However , some STDs can be passed in non-sexual ways , either with body - to - body contact or surface - to - body contact :
Syphilis
The spirochete bacterium that causes syphilis can be transmitted by direct contact with the open sores which often characterize the disease during its early stages .
Kissing can spread the disease under these conditions .
Unlike most STDs , primary or secondary syphilis also can be transmitted by nonsexual contact .
For example , if a person with a cut or break in the skin on his hand shakes hands with an infected person who has an open sore on his hand , infection can be transferred .
Though this is rare , it points out the extremely infectious nature of the disease at different stages .

Herpes can invade the body virtually anywhere an open herpes sore comes into contact with a break in the skin .
For example , a person can become infected by kissing someone with a herpes cold sore .

Trichomonas
Trichomonas vaginalis , the parasitic protozoan that causes trichomoniasis ( " trich " ) , is capable of surviving for some hours outside the body in bodily fluids , damp towels or bedding .
In rare cases it has been known to be spread by mutual masturbation , when bodily fluids from one partner come in contact with the other partner 's genitals .

In rare cases it has been known to be spread by mutual masturbation , when bodily fluids from one partner come in contact with the other partner 's genitals .
Parasitic insects
Parasitic insects , such as crab lice ( Pediculosis pubis ) and scabies mites , though typically transmitted through sexual contact , are highly mobile .
A person can acquire crab lice from bedding , clothing or toilet seats , and instances of scabies infection through contaminated clothes or bedding have been authenticated .
Babies can contract many different STDs at birth from their infected mothers .
11 Condoms are very effective , but do n't offer 100 % protection from STD
Remember , although condoms provide good protection against STDs , they are not foolproof .
Condoms will not prevent you from contracting some STDs , because they may not cover the infected area .
Examples of infections that can be transmitted despite religious condom use are :
Herpes Simplex Virus ( genital herpes )
Human Papilloma Virus ( genital warts )
Syphilis
Chancroid
But because condoms cannot protect against every form of STI , it is important to limit the number of sexual partners you have , and to be tested for STIs on a regular basis .
12 Retest for certainty
The only way to know if the sexually transmitted disease is no longer present is to follow - up with your doctor for retesting and examination .
Follow - up is extremely important because a person may have a resistant strain of the infection and could still have the infection despite it being adequately treated .

13 Signs and symptoms related to STD
STDs can manifest themselves with any of the following symptoms :
Pain or discomfort when urinating :
- you may have chlamydia , gonorrhoea , or genital herpes .
- you may have chlamydia , gonorrhoea , or genital herpes .
Itchiness or irritation in the genital area :
- test for pubic lice ( crabs ) , scabies , herpes .
- test for pubic lice ( crabs ) , scabies , herpes .
Lumps on the genitals :
- this is common for genital warts , molluscum contagiosum .
- this is common for genital warts , molluscum contagiosum .
Discharge from the genitals ( unusual or bad - smelling ) :
- Discharge from the penis is often caused by gonorrhoea and chlamydia or non-specific urethritis .
- Discharge from the vagina is more commonly associated with trichomoniasis , gonorrhoea and chlamydia .
- Discharge from the penis is often caused by gonorrhoea and chlamydia or non-specific urethritis .
- Discharge from the vagina is more commonly associated with trichomoniasis , gonorrhoea and chlamydia .
Genital sores
- these may be the result of herpes , syphilis .
14STD disparities : rates tend to be higher among African Americans
Although STDs are widespread across racial and ethnic groups , the rates tend to be higher among African Americans than white Americans .
Blacks remain the group most heavily affected by gonorrhea .
In 2004 , the gonorrhea rate among blacks was 19 times the rate among whites .
The rate of chlamydia among black women was nearly eight times the rate among white women .
The rate among black men was more than 11 times that of white men1 .
15 Behaviors and conditions that can increase the risk for STDs
The following behaviors and conditions can increase the risk for STDs :
Engaging in sexual activity when either partner has unhealed lesions ( e.g. , genital herpes sores , genital warts ) .
Enema or rectal douching before rectal intercourse .
Rectal or vaginal irritation or infection .
Sexual activity that may damage the mucosal lining of the vagina or rectum .
Tampon use can cause vaginal dryness and cellular abnormalities .
Vaginal dryness .
16Non-STI infections that may be transmitted via sexual contact
Some bacteria , viruses , and parasites that are usually transmitted nonsexually can sometimes be transmitted during sex :
Amebiasis
Salmonellosis
Shigellosis
Giardiasis
Typhoid fever
Yeast infections
17 The most reliable way to avoid getting an STD is to not have sex
It is quite clear that abstinence ( not having any form of sex ) is the best way to prevent STDs .
This is OK for some , but not realistic for most people .
If the first option is not for you , the next best way to is to limit the sexual relationship to a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have an STI .
And the third way to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases is to use condoms consistently and correctly .

Energy and food costs continue to rise quickly , but the prices of other items are being restrained by a faltering economy that is helping keep overall inflation in check .
The Labor Department Friday said the consumer price index rose 0.8 % in May and was up 4.2 % from a year ago , reflecting surging energy , food and transportation costs .
But ...
On Wednesday the U.S. Department of the Interior announced a plan to open 190 million acres of federal lands to companies seeking to develop geothermal energy production plants .
[ social_buttons ]
The lands that will be opened are in Alaska and 11 western states .
It is believed that the geothermal energy in time could provide electricity to 5.5 million homes .
Secretary of the Interior Dick Kempthorne said the following about the plan : “ Geothermal energy will play a key role in powering America ’s energy future … and 90 percent of our nation ’s geothermal resources are found on federal lands . ”
Much of the land that will be opened is managed by the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) and the U.S. Forest Service .
Places of great geothermal significance and public appeal like Yellowstone National Park will not be utilized .
Lands would be leased under the plan .
Revenues from the leases and the profits of the companies that produce geothermal energy would be shared by the companies , the federal government , and the counties and states where the plants are located .
The U.S. Congress recently passed tax breaks to entice more companies to invest in the development of geothermal energy sources , as well as other alternative energy possibilities .
While geothermal energy is not as well known ( i.e. sexy ) to the public as are wind and solar power , it probably deserves more attention as part of the new alternative energy craze .
( For instance , if you were n’t aware , both Google and Oregon Tech are notable early adopters ) .
With a plan to open public lands to more geothermal development , you can bet that some people are going to have concerns and want more information– just as they did when the BLM announced earlier this year that it would examine the possibility of large scale development of solar power on some of the lands it manages .
For the uninitiated , here ’s a brief summary about the basics of geothermal energy .
A Quick Geothermal Energy Primer
The Environment News Service provides the following introduction to geothermal energy :
Geothermal resources range from heat found just under the ground to hot water and rock miles below the Earth ’s surface .
Wells over a mile deep can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought to the surface to generate electricity .
There are environmental concerns around geothermal energy .
Dry steam and flash steam power plants emit low levels of carbon dioxide , nitric oxide , and sulphur , although at roughly five percent of the levels emitted by fossil fuel power plants .
To resolve these concerns , geothermal plants can be built with systems that can inject these substances back into the Earth , reducing carbon emissions to less than 0.1 percent of those from fossil fuel power plants .
Hot water from geothermal sources will contain trace amounts of toxics such as mercury and arsenic , which if discharged into rivers can make the water unsafe to drink .
To protect special resource values , the plan announced today identifies a comprehensive list of stipulations , conditions of approval and best management practices required for approval of future geothermal leases .
You can also read Wikipedia ’s informative entry on the subject .
Some of the advantages it mentions to geothermal energy include the small amount of greenhouse emissions it makes during production and use , its ability to be obtained without use of other kinds of fuel , and its ability to be harvested 24 hours a day regardless of weather conditions .
Over 20 Countries in the World Currently Produce Geothermal Energy
Among these geothermal energy producing nations , some of the most noteworthy include Iceland , the United States , and the Caribbean island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis .
Iceland is perhaps the best known of geothermal producing nations .
Perhaps it ’s the country ’s name that make people think of its steamy ( and potentially relaxing ) geothermal charms more often than they do for places in milder climates ( an Icelandic friend of mine actually tells me that Iceland and Greenland should swap names ironically ) .
Of course , maybe it ’s also that Iceland gets around 25 % of its entire electricity from geothermal power , and also uses it to heat buildings and provide hot running water to its citizens .
The United States , while having a much smaller percentage of geothermal power in its energy mix , is nonetheless the largest producer of geothermal energy in the world .
An area 72 miles north of San Francisco , California known as “ the Geysers ” is the world ’s current champion of geothermal energy production .
As the U.S. has a lot of production , and Iceland has a lot of application know - how , they have recently joined forces to share knowledge about geothermal energy , along with Australia .
Perhaps they should also partner with the island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis .
Construction has commenced on a new geothermal plant on the hot spring - laden island of Nevis .
The facility will eventually provide 50 MW of electricity .
This sum will help the nation to meet all of its energy needs , and will make it one of the least fossil fuel dependent countries in the world .

Used against the IRA :
One of the most interesting operations was the laundry mat [ sic ] .
Having lost many troops and civilians to bombings , the Brits decided they needed to determine who was making the bombs and where they were being manufactured .
One bright fellow recommended they operate a laundry and when asked “ what the hell he was talking about , ” he explained the plan and it was incorporated — to much success .
The plan was simple : Build a laundry and staff it with locals and a few of their own .
The laundry would then send out “ color coded ” special discount tickets , to the effect of “ get two loads for the price of one , ” etc .
The color coding was matched to specific streets and thus when someone brought in their laundry , it was easy to determine the general location from which a city map was coded .
While the laundry was indeed being washed , pressed and dry cleaned , it had one additional cycle — every garment , sheet , glove , pair of pants , was first sent through an analyzer , located in the basement , that checked for bomb - making residue .
The analyzer was disguised as just another piece of the laundry equipment ; good OPSEC [ operational security ] .
Within a few weeks , multiple positives had shown up , indicating the ingredients of bomb residue , and intelligence had determined which areas of the city were involved .
To narrow their target list , [ the laundry ] simply sent out more specific coupons [ numbered ] to all houses in the area , and before long they had good addresses .
After confirming addresses , authorities with the SAS teams swooped down on the multiple homes and arrested multiple personnel and confiscated numerous assembled bombs , weapons and ingredients .
During the entire operation , no one was injured or killed .
How Toxic Environmental
Chemical DBT Affects the Immune System
By Debra Kain
An international team of researchers at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine and the University of Basel in Switzerland have issued a report on the mechanism of toxicity of a chemical compound called Dibutyltin ( DBT ) .
Their findings will be published by PloS ONE on October 28 .
DBT is part of a class of high toxic and widely distributed chemical compounds called organotins , DBT is most commonly used as an anti-fouling agent in paint , for example in the fishing and shipbuilding industries .
It is also used in the production of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) plastic tubes and bottles .
According to co-lead investigators Michael E. Baker , Ph.D. , researcher in UC San Diego ’s Department of Medicine , Division of Nephrology - Hypertension , and Alex Odermatt , Ph.D. , at the University of Basel , DBT is closely related to tributyltin ( TBT ) , another well - known pollutant .
Concern about the side effects of TBT led the United Nations ’ International Maritime Organization to organize a global ban on its use .
“ TBT is metabolized by the body ’s liver into DBT , ” the scientists explained .
“ Humans are also exposed to DBT by drinking water from PVC pipes .
Because it is poorly broken down , DBT remains in the environment and it appears that its toxic effects are more rapid and more pronounced than those of TBT . ”
Symptoms of organotin exposure can include irritated skin , dizziness , difficulty breathing , and flu - like symptoms .
Although long - terms effects in humans are uncertain , large doses of certain organotins have been shown to damage the reproductive and central nervous systems , bone structure , the liver and immune system in mammals .
Combining studies of the effect in cell culture of DBT on the function of a key class of steroid hormone , glucocorticoids , with computer - based analyses of the molecular interaction of DBT and the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) , the U.S. and Swiss scientists explained the mechanism by which DBT inhibits transcriptional activity of the GR .
The GR is expressed in almost every cell in the body .
Besides important functions in energy metabolism , the GR helps to regulate genes that control the body ’s immune system .
The researchers propose that by blocking GR activation , DBT disrupts the appropriate response of the immune system during inflammation , providing an explanation for some of the toxic effects of this organotin .
Alex Odermatt is from the Division of Molecular and Systems Toxicology , Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Basel .
Additional contributors to the paper include first author Christel Gumy of the University of Basel and the Universitiy of Berne ; Anna A. Dzyakanchuk and Denise V. Kratschmar , University of Basel ; and Charlie Chandsawangbhuwana , UC San Diego Department of Bioengineering .

Harrisburg , PA – The Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania learned recently of an event planned by independent and third party activists for Friday , September 5th .
It 's a “ Thank You ” event at the Harrisburg law office of Cumberland County Republican Chairman Victor Stabile for his lawsuit contending that presidential candidate Bob Barr should be disqualified from the November ballot .
This , on the heels of the Bonusgate revelations , is seen by many as the Republican Party attempting to rival the Democratic Party at limiting political choice in Pennsylvania .
Event organizer Jim Gordon offered , “ We invite independent and third - party voters , candidates and supporters to demonstrate how ‘ thankful ’ we are that Mr. Stabile spotlighted the unconstitutional , undemocratic and unfair ballot access laws imposed on anyone not a Republican or Democrat in Pennsylvania . ”
The event will happen Friday , September 5th ( the same date as the Stabile vs. Barr hearing ) from 7:00 to 8:00 AM at the Law Office of Dilworth Paxson LLP , 112 Market Street , Harrisburg ( Graystone Bank Building ) .
At 8:00 AM , the group will march to the state capitol .
( For more information contact organizers at 717-652-2643 or 717-608-7366/cell . )
Victor Stabile of the Pennsylvania Republican Party filed the suit to have Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr removed from the Pennsylvania ’s ballot .
This year , LP candidates for statewide office collected 51,345 ballot access signatures .
Instead of challenging those signatures , the Republican suit probes a technicality to deny Barr ballot access in Pennsylvania .
Their objection relates to the substitution of Barr as the LP Presidential nominee and it highlights the inequality of Pennsylvania 's election laws .
Under the Pennsylvania Election Code , the Libertarian Party is not a recognized political party , but it appears that the objector wants the Libertarian Party to be further penalized for not being a recognized political party .
If so , this objection could be a thinly veiled attempt to remove a political rival from the ballot , thus subverting the electoral process .
Media Relations Chair , Doug Leard , indicated that “ in addition to highlighting Pennsylvania ’s draconian ballot access laws , this lawsuit demonstrates the hypocrisy at the top of the Republican ticket . ”
In the 2000 election , John McCain promised that he would “ never consider , ever consider , allowing a supporter of [ his ] to challenge [ his opponent ’s ] right to be on the ballot in all 50 states . ”
LP Presidential candidate , Bob Barr , represented the 7th District of Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 , serving as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee , as Vice - Chairman of the Government Reform Committee , and as a member of the Committee on Financial Services .
He now practices law with the Law Offices of Edwin Marger and runs a consulting firm , Liberty Strategies LLC , headquartered in Atlanta , Georgia with offices in the Washington , D.C. area .
Barr works tirelessly to help preserve our fundamental right to privacy and our other civil liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights .
Another Controversy for Sarah Palin Former police chief says he was fired for challenging Palin 's contributors .
Sept. 3 , 2008  -- Gov. Sarah Palin is already facing ethical questions over her firing of the Alaska public safety commissioner , and now she faces questions over the firing of a longtime local police chief .
After taking over as Mayor of the small town of Wasilla , Palin fired the longtime local police chief .
The former police chief , Irl Stambaugh says he was fired because he stepped on the toes of Palin 's campaign contributors , including bar owners and the National Rifle Association .
Stambaugh 's lawyer , William Jermain , says the chief tried to move up the closing hours of local bars from 5 a .m. to two a .m. after a spurt of drunk driving accidents and arrests .
" His crackdown on that practice by the bars was not appreciated by her and that was one reason she terminated Irl , " said Jermain .
In his 1997 lawsuit , Stambaugh also alleged that his stand on restricting concealed weapons upset the NRA .
" Mayor Palin has stated on several occasions that the National Rifle Association encouraged her to fire Chief Stambaugh because of his stance against the concealed weapons legislation , " the lawsuit claimed .
Palin says she was up against entrenched insiders when she was elected mayor of Wasilla in 1996 .
" We had a lot of people that were kind of dead wood , " said Colleen Sullivan Leonard , a staff member in Palin 's office .
" We needed people with new energy and a new vision . "
A federal judge later ruled the mayor , under city law , had the right to fire the police chief for any reason she wanted .
Palin is now facing similar allegations in the state capitol , that politics played a role in her firing of the Alaska public safety commissioner , Walter Monegan .
" It has every possibility of giving the Governor an ethical black eye in an area where she 's touted herself as being particularly strong , " said Alaskan State Senator Hollis French , a Democrat .
At issue is whether Palin fired the public safety commissioner because he refused to fire a state trooper who was the Governor 's brother - in - law and going through an ugly divorce with the Governor 's sister .
The Governor has denied any wrongdoing or involvement in the matter , but Senator French , who is leading the investigation has his doubts .
" The Governor first issued a blanket denial , " said Sen .
French , " and now she 's had to back down and that 's a problem . "
Monday , Palin called for the Alaskan Personnel Board to conduct a formal investigation into Monegan 's dismissal " to put these matters to rest " .
" The idea that there had been no contact and no pressure does n't stand up , " said Sen. French .
" Her credibility I think was damaged in that blanket denial . "
The McCain campaign says it 's clear that some insiders do n't like the fact that Palin has been bucking the status quo to implement change .

Justin Timberlake gets sidetracked on video shoot by curvy Rihanna
Behind his dark glasses Justin Timberlake could be looking anywhere - but there 's one shapely attraction he could be forgiven for eyeing .
Rihanna 's curvacious behind , clad only in fishnet stockings , was undoubtedly the star of the show as the popstar duo filmed the video for their new single on the beach in Los Angeles yesterday .
She 's giving sexy back : Justin Timberlake and Rhianna stand side - by - side as they film the video for their new music video in Los Angeles
Above the waist the Umbrella singer was the image of propriety , clothed in a multi-coloured wrap top and demure net hat .
But her long legs were on display in all their glory as she stalked around the beach in cripplingly high platforms .
Justin was wrapped up somewhat warmer than Rihanna , in black jeans and a leather jacket .
There have been rumours that the two have dated in the past .
Strike a defensive pose :
The two singers face off on the beach
Bend it like Rihanna :
The singer shows off her fabulous figure in sky - high heels
But both are now in happy relationships , with Justin dating actress Jessica Biel , while Rihanna is with fellow RnB artist Chris Brown .
In fact rather than flirtatious relations between Rihanna and Justin looked decidedly frosty as the two stood face - to - face on the beach .
But instead of a fall - out it seems the two were acting out scenes from Rehab off Rihanna 's Good Girl Gone Bad album .
After a quick costume change , Rihanna then stole the limelight again as she lay on a sunbed in suspenders and a pair of 40s style sunglasses .
Relax :
The star stretches out on a sunbed , but where 's Justin ?

PARIS ( Reuters ) - A French judge has ordered two departments and seven prominent members of the Church of Scientology in France to stand trial on charges of organized fraud , a judicial source said on Monday .
The case is the latest in a series of legal battles that have pitted the French judicial system against the Scientologists , who could be forced to stop their activities in France if found guilty .
The latest suit centers on a complaint made in 1998 by a woman who said she was enrolled into the Church of Scientology by a group of people she met outside a metro station .
In the following months , she said she paid 140,000 francs ( 21,340 euros ) for “ purification packs ” and books which she said were a fraud .
Other complaints then surfaced , prolonging the investigation .
Judge Jean - Christophe Hullin ruled that the Scientologists ’ Celebrity Center , bookstore and seven Church leaders should be tried for fraud and “ illegally practicing as pharmacists ” .
The Church of Scientology is registered as a religion in the United States but has struggled to be accepted in Europe , with French authorities seeing it as a sect masquerading as a church to make money .
The Church of Scientology denounced Monday ’s ruling , saying it was being “ stigmatized ” by the courts .
“ The special treatment reserved for the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center raises questions about the equality of the justice system and the presumption of innocence , ” it said in a statement .
The public prosecutor had said the case should be shelved .
In a relatively rare move , Judge Hullin ignored the recommendation and ordered a trial , which is not expected to start for at least six months .
The Scientologists said the suit was “ empty and concocted ” , adding that the original plaintiff had been reimbursed .
The Church of Scientology , which counts actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta among its members , was founded in 1954 by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard .
It has faced numerous setbacks in France , with members convicted of fraud in Lyon in 1997 and Marseille in 1999 .

How weird is that ?
Sticky tape emits light - and X - rays - as it unpeels .
Carlos Camara and Juan Escobar
Christmas could bring with it a new hazard as you wrap your gifts – X - ray - emitting sticky tape .
Researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles , have shown that simply peeling ordinary sticky tape in a vacuum can generate enough X - rays to take an image — of one of the scientists ' own fingers ( see videos ) .
" At some point we were a little bit scared , " says Juan Escobar , a member of the research team .
But he and his co-workers soon realized that the X - rays were only emitted when the kit was used in a vacuum .
" We do n't want to scare people from using Scotch tape in everyday life , " Escobar adds .
This kind of energy release — known as triboluminescence and seen in the form of light — occurs whenever a solid ( often a crystal ) is crushed , rubbed or scratched .
It is a long - known , if somewhat mysterious , phenomenon , seen by Francis Bacon in 1605 .
He noticed that scratching a lump of sugar caused it to give off light .
The leading explanation posits that when a crystal is crushed or split , the process separates opposite charges .
When these charges are neutralized , they release a burst of energy in the form of light .
As long ago as 1953 , a team of scientists based in Russia suggested that peeling sticky tape produced X - rays .
But " we were very sceptical about the old results , " says Escobar .
His team decided to look into the phenomenon anyway , and found that X - rays were indeed given off , in high - energy pulses .
When the researchers placed a small plastic window in their vacuum chamber , they were even able to take an X - ray image of a finger , using a dental X - ray detector .
Their results are published in Nature1 .
Mechanoluminescent mystery
" Of the total electron discharges , only one in ten thousand makes X - rays , " says Escobar .
The energies of the individual X - ray pulses , typically a few nanoseconds long , are about 15 kiloelectron volts .
The sticky tape can even help to take an X - ray image ( superimposed ) of a human finger .
Carlos Camara , Juan Escobar and Seth Putterman
The energy of the X - rays is directly related to the amount of charge that builds up at the surface of the tape as it is peeled .
The scientists calculate that this charge was ten times greater in their study than typically seen in similar experiments .
" We are not exactly sure why the tape is so heavily charged , " Escobar says .
The sticky - tape X - ray machine is also baffling others in the field .
" You would n't have thought that so much of the mechanical energy would come out as X - rays , " says Ken Suslick , an expert in mechanoluminescence at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
" The adhesive on the tape is an amorphous liquid , not crystalline .
What 's causing the transfer of charge , of electrons or protons , what the accepting and donor groups are — these things are much less clear . "
The researchers suggest that the high charge density generated by peeling the tape could be great enough to trigger nuclear fusion .
Michael Loughlin , a nuclear analyst at the international nuclear fusion experiment , ITER , in Cadarache , France , is sceptical .
But he adds that if he is proved wrong , a system that could provide fusion reactions at the flick of a switch would be very useful .
Suslick now intends to revisit mechanoluminescent systems he has worked on in his lab to search for X - rays .
Meanwhile , Escobar and his colleagues plan to look at different types of adhesive to see whether they get the same effect .
But the biggest challenge will be to figure out exactly how it works , Escobar says .
" That 's first on our list . "
Claim :
Three former Fannie Mae executives served on Barack Obama ’s 2008 presidential campaign as chief economic advisors .
FALSE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , September 2008 ]
Here is a quick look into 3 former Fannie Mae executives who have brought down Wall Street .
Here is a quick look into 3 former Fannie Mae executives who have brought down Wall Street .
Franklin Raines was a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Fannie Mae. Raines was forced to retire from his position with Fannie Mae when auditing discovered severe irregularities in Fannie Mae ’s accounting activities .
At the time of his departure The Wall Street Journal noted , ‘ Raines , who long defended the company ’s accounting despite mounting evidence that it was n’t proper , issued a statement late Tuesday conceding that ‘ mistakes were made ’ and saying he would assume responsibility as he had earlier promised .
News reports indicate the company was under growing pressure from regulators to shake up its management in the wake of findings that the company ’s books ran afoul of generally accepted accounting principles for four years . ’
Fannie Mae had to reduce its surplus by $ 9 billion .
Raines left with a ‘ golden parachute valued at $ 240 Million in benefits .
The Government filed suit against Raines when the depth of the accounting scandal became clear .
The Government noted , ‘ The 101 charges reveal how the individuals improperly manipulated earnings to maximize their bonuses , while knowingly neglecting accounting systems and internal controls , misapplying over twenty accounting principles and misleading the regulator and the public .
The Notice explains how they submitted six years of misleading and inaccurate accounting statements and inaccurate capital reports that enabled them to grow Fannie Mae in an unsafe and unsound manner . ’
These charges were made in 2006 .
The Court ordered Raines to return $ 50 Million Dollars he received in bonuses based on the miss - stated Fannie Mae profits .
Tim Howard – Was the Chief Financial Officer of Fannie Mae. Howard ‘ was a strong internal proponent of using accounting strategies that would ensure a ‘ stable pattern of earnings ’ at Fannie .
In everyday English – he was cooking the books .
The Government Investigation determined that , ‘ Chief Financial Officer , Tim Howard , failed to provide adequate oversight to key control and reporting functions within Fannie Mae , ’ On June 16 , 2006 , Rep. Richard Baker , R - La. , asked the Justice Department to investigate his allegations that two former Fannie Mae executives lied to Congress in October 2004 when they denied manipulating the mortgage - finance giant ’s income statement to achieve management pay bonuses .
Investigations by federal regulators and the company ’s board of directors since concluded that management did manipulate 1998 earnings to trigger bonuses .
Raines and Howard resigned under pressure in late 2004 .
Howard ’s Golden Parachute was estimated at $ 20 Million !
Jim Johnson – A former executive at Lehman Brothers and who was later forced from his position as Fannie Mae CEO .
A look at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ’s May 2006 report on mismanagement and corruption inside Fannie Mae , and you ’ll see some interesting things about Johnson .
Investigators found that Fannie Mae had hidden a substantial amount of Johnson ’s 1998 compensation from the public , reporting that it was between $ 6 million and $ 7 million when it fact it was $ 21 million . ’
Johnson is currently under investigation for taking illegal loans from Countrywide while serving as CEO of Fannie Mae. Johnson ’s Golden Parachute was estimated at $ 28 Million .
WHERE ARE THEY NOW ?
FRANKLIN RAINES ?
Raines works for the Obama Campaign as Chief Economic Advisor TIM HOWARD ?
Howard is also a Chief Economic Advisor to Obama JIM JOHNSON ?
Johnson hired as a Senior Obama Finance Advisor and was selected to run Obama ’s Vice Presidential Search Committee IF OBAMA PLANS ON CLEANING UP THE MESS – HIS ADVISORS HAVE THE EXPERTISE – THEY MADE THE MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE .
Would you trust the men who tore Wall Street down to build the New Wall Street ?
Origins :
When one of the hottest issues of a presidential campaign is the meltdown of the mortgage lending industry and the collapse of the economy , a candidate ’s having economic advisors on his staff who are strongly associated with the system and practices that helped create the current mess likely would n’t sit well with the public .
That ’s the premise of the above - quoted e-mail , which claimed that three men formerly associated with the Federal National Mortgage Association ( commonly known as “ Fannie Mae ” ) were serving as “ chief economic advisors ” with the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama .
However , although some of these men had at least tangential connections to the Obama campaign at one time or another , none of them had ongoing roles with that campaign as chief economic advisors .
Franklin Raines , who formerly headed the budget office for the Clinton administration , became the first black CEO of a Fortune 500 company when he took over at Fannie Mae ” in 1999 .
Raines ,
who had earned $ 20 million in salary and bonuses from Fannie Mae in 2003 , resigned from his CEO position in 2004 after regulators determined that the company had violated accounting rules and created an illusory $ 9 billion in past profit .
Raines had some dealings with the Obama campaign , but he never held any actual position within the campaign ( much less as its “ chief economic advisor ” ) , and his involvement with it was not nearly as substantial as implied above .
As the Washington Post reported when a McCain campaign commercial attempted to link Raines with the Democratic candidate , the whole substance of the connection between the two men was that Raines “ had gotten a couple of calls from the Obama campaign ” in which they talked about “ general housing and economy issues . ”
Franklin Raines ’ predecessor , James A. Johnson , ( former chief of staff to Vice President Walter F. Mondale ) , was CEO of Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998 .
After Johnson left the company , regulators later discovered that Fannie Mae had engaged in fraudulent accounting practices in 1998 which manipulated its earnings so that executives could earn performance bonuses ( up to $ 1.9 million in Johnson ’s case ) they would not otherwise have been entitled to .
In May 2008 , Senator Obama tapped James Johnson to be one member of a three - person panel tasked with vetting potential vice - presidential running mates .
Johnson ( who was not serving as an economic advisor to the Obama campaign ) resigned from that position shortly afterwards when news accounts reported that he had received more than $ 2 million in home loans at below average market rates from Countrywide Financial ( a partner of Fannie Mae ) .
Tim Howard , the former CFO ( chief financial officer ) of Fannie Mae , was caught up in the same accounting scandal that undid Franklin Raines , and ( like Raines ) resigned from the company in 2004 .
We found no substantive connection between Tim Howard and the Obama campaign , however , much less any information supporting the claim that Howard was ever a “ Chief Economic Advisor to Obama . ”

Yeast strains used today to brew lager have two genetic ancestors , not one as previously thought .
The discovery may explain the origins of the two major categories of lager today , described in the trade as the “ Saaz ” beers such as Pilsner and Budweiser , and the “ Frohberg ” beers such as Orangeboom and Heineken .
It turns out that both probably owe their origins to laws in 16th - century Bavaria that banned brewing in the summer because scorching heat ruined the ale that was brewed before the emergence of lager .
Forced to produce their beer in the winter , brewers accidentally created conditions favouring the emergence of a hybrid yeast better suited to the cold .
Researchers already knew that Saccharomyces pastorianus , now used to brew lager , is a hybrid produced through marriage between two yeast strains .
Advertisement
Brewing ’s founder
One was S. cerevisiae , the “ brewer ’s yeast ” on which the brewing industry is founded because it ferments sugars into alcohol so efficiently .
The other was S. bayanus , a yeast strain seldom used alone in brewing because it ferments sugar into alcohol far less efficiently .
Now an analysis of the forensic ancestry of lager yeast has established that this same marriage happened independently at least twice , not once as previously thought , giving rise to two broad families of lager beer .
Although both probably emerged during the Middle Ages in central Europe , their point of origin cannot be traced exactly .
“ We ca n’t say for sure when , where or by whom they were isolated , ” says Gavin Sherlock of Stanford University , who conducted the study with colleague Barbara Dunn .
They discovered the double emergence of an ancestor after analysing 17 samples of lager yeast originally archived between 1883 and 1976 .
They found that the yeasts broadly fell into two groups .
Those in Group 1 were used to brew the “ Saaz ” - type
beers .
Those in Group 2 were used to brew the “ Frohberg ” lagers .
Family differences
Sherlock and Dunn report that although the two types of hybrids shared the same parentage , they differed from one another considerably .
The Group 1 yeasts , for example , were true hybrids , with one set of genes from each parent .
The Group 2 yeasts had an extra copy of S. cerevisiae , making them “ triploid ” hybrids .
Very little genetic material from S. bayanus has been lost from either hybrid , probably because its capacity to produce energy at low temperatures from mitochondria turned out to be an indispensable asset in the cold beer cellars of 16th - century Bavaria .
By contrast , S. cerevisiae had jettisoned much of its genetic material in the Group 1 yeasts , maybe to reduce unnecessary energy expenditure .
In Group 2 yeasts , however , S. cerevisiae remained more intact , maybe because two copies of the genome were available to cushion losses of individual genes .
The researchers also noticed that both yeasts contained multiple copies of genes beneficial to brewing , such as those that ferment maltose .
Likewise , genes that mar the process had been lost .
Sherlock doubts whether the analysis will lead to ways of engineering new flavours and properties into beers .
“ The pastorianus strains , being hybrids , are sterile , so you ca n’t do genetics on them in a straightforward way , ” he says .
“ Rather , beer makers have been doing this via natural selection over the past several centuries , selecting those strains for further use that produced the beers they most enjoyed drinking . ”

Google patches V1 contain interesting patch to mirror binary log on slave .
Although Google is preparing GlobalTransaction
Id patch , which going to be replacement for MirroredBinlogs , we still think mirroring binary logs is very useful for :
Backup of binary logs in real time
High availability , to switch master load to slave with mirrored binary logs
By request of our friends Engine Yard we extracted this patch from Google ’s patchset and going to include in our next releases .
Actually our patch contains features for both MirroredBinlogs and FastMasterPromotion patches , as second provides feature to make slave as master in case of main master failure .
At this moment you can download patch by itself there
https://www.percona.com/mysql/5.0.67-b6/patches/mirror_binlog.patch
with docs on our wiki
Also the patch will be included in OurDelta binaries beside our releases for CentOS / RedHat platform , so you can download and test this feature for your OS .
For a while we ’ve been exploring switching to WYSIWYG text editing in our products .
Up until this point we ’ve been using either plain text , manual HTML , or Textile formatting .
Depending on who you are it ’s either fine or annoying .
We want to do a lot better .
We ’ve looked at a lot of existing options ( Yahoo ’s WYSIWYG plug - in , TinyMCE , etc ) , but we were n’t happy with any of them .
Currently available WYSIWYG editors do n’t offer much flexibility when it comes to modifying their look and behavior .
You are stuck with their HTML , buttons , and design .
Modification was possible , but it was really ugly behind the scenes .
We really needed a framework for building our own editor with beautiful code and a low cost of change .
WysiHat
So we decided to make our own .
It ’s called WysiHat and we ’ve open sourced it .
Get it ?
WysiHat .
Hat instead of Wig ?
Funny , we know !
Today we ’re releasing a very stripped down early developer release .
WysiHat is a WYSIWYG JavaScript framework that provides an extensible foundation to design your own rich text editor .
WysiHat stays out of your way and leaves the UI design to you .
Although WysiHat lets you get up and running with a few lines of code , the focus is on letting you customize it .
We are giving developers early access to the project while we continue to work out the remaining issues .
Note :
It ’s extremely early .

And they can just as easily download music and movies , although Mark and Kim generally restrict themselves to television shows .
A cheap DivX - enabled DVD player lets them watch downloads on their television as easily as watching a movie , and at practically the same picture quality .
They realise they 're breaking the law , but Mark and Kim say that downloading TV feels less like stealing than downloading movies or music .
" People might argue that you pay for television shows by watching the ads but you can skip the ads these days with video recorders if you want , " Mark says .
" Besides , when they put your show on at 10.30 at night , I do n't think they 're really counting on your revenue . "
File - sharing is no longer just in the realm of frustrated Star Trek fans , with almost every television show that screens in the US or Britain available online within 24 hours at DVD quality or better .
Movies are also often available before they even open in the cinemas .
In Australia , Nine 's real - life crime series Underbelly created an online frenzy after a court order banned its screening in Victoria .
The entire series was available online before it even finished screening in the rest of the country , with Nine powerless to intervene .
The most popular television downloads include the likes of Lost , Prison Break and 24 - generally shows with long story arcs and complicated plots that are difficult to follow when the networks chop and change the schedule .
" We 've kept downloading shows because the TV schedule keeps changing , " Kim says .
" They were just playing havoc with us .
They 'd stop shows , start them , show them really late at night and then stick in a repeat episode just to stretch out the season for another few weeks . "
Using a system known as BitTorrent ( see below ) , Mark and Kim download television shows or movies as easily as searching for websites on Google .
They pay about $ 70 a month for a 20 M bps cable broadband connection allowing them to download 12GB .
While they need home internet access for work , they also justify the expense by the fact that it means they do n't need pay TV and rarely hire movies .
" Downloading our favourite shows means when we find time to watch television , we watch what we 're interested in rather than whatever rubbish happens to be on , " Kim says .
While Mark and Kim are selective what they download , fellow Melburnians Shane and Amber use the internet for all their entertainment needs .
The couple keep two computers in their lounge room dedicated to home entertainment and connected to their television and surround sound system .
They pay $ 80 for a 90 GB download cap , but are stuck on a 1.5 M bps connection as they wait for a faster ADSL2 + slot to open up on their telephone exchange .
" I 've walked into a video shop twice in the last five years and , while I was in there , I made a list on my BlackBerry of things I was going to download , " Shane says .
" Considering what 's available online , why the hell would I watch free - to - air TV or even cable ? "
" When it comes to television and movies , we can download high - definition episodes of shows with no ads , " adds Amber .
" This means we can go to bed half an hour earlier , plus we can pause it if we need to .
With kids in the house , you often need to pause the television . "
Shane and Amber download files from encrypted online Usenet newsgroups ( see below ) , which they find faster and more reliable than BitTorrent .
" I know people who do n't go out places if their favourite show is on that night , " says Amber .
" They do n't have any other access to it so they will seriously stop their life to watch this show .
With a complicated show like Lost , if you miss one episode you have no idea what is going on .
I 'd rather wait until the series has screened in the US , download the whole lot and then watch it when it suits me . "
Such stories are becoming more common , although as far back as 2005 Australians already ranked as the world 's second most prolific downloaders of video after the British in a study by British technology consultancy Envisional .
Legitimate online alternatives for watching movies and television are starting to emerge in Australia from the likes of Apple and BigPond ( see below ) , but it 's yet to be seen if offering pirates a carrot will be any more effective than using the stick .
While there have been several high - profile court cases in the US , it 's clear that Australians illegally downloading movies and television shows have little to fear right now from the copyright police .
For years Australia 's copyright enforcers have privately admitted they have no intention of dragging local file - sharers through the courts US - style .
The head of the Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft now publicly admits the group has no interest in prosecuting file - sharers .
Executive director Adrianne Pecotic says AFACT has more interest in catching those releasing bootleg movies than those sitting on the couch downloading them for their private consumption .
" Our aim is not to be going in and bashing down people 's doors or suggesting that the police should be taking enforcement action against people who are downloading , " Ms Pecotic says .
" It 's not something we should be wasting police resources on .
" Police resources ... need to be used very appropriately to target people who are stealing copies of movies and then uploading them . "
A 21 - year - old Sydney man was fined $ 1000 for uploading a copy of The Simpsons Movie last year , which he recorded in a cinema on his mobile phone .
Hew Raymond Griffiths , Australian head of international online piracy ring DrinkOrDie , was also extradited to the US last year to face charges .
Thus far , no one in Australia has been prosecuted or sued simply for illegally downloading content from the internet .
Based on trials overseas , Ms Pecotic is placing her hopes on getting ISPs to warn their users against file - sharing and then cutting off their internet access after multiple violations .
She believes that 90 % of people will stop file - sharing when they realise that it 's illegal and can be monitored .
AFACT monitors Australian peer - to - peer file - sharing of copyrighted movies and traces the traffic back to internet service providers .
To date , the downloading of television shows has been all but ignored .
AFACT cannot identify individual users but instead requests the ISPs pass a warning to those users .
There 's anecdotal evidence that some Australian ISPs are forwarding these warnings to customers , although Ms Pecotic wo n't say which ISPs do this .
AFACT wants Australian ISPs to take sanctions against repeat offenders , eventually cutting off their internet access completely .
Similar trials are under way in the US and in Britain .
" People downloading in their homes need to be educated that what they 're doing is wrong , is causing damage to the film industry and is in breach of the terms and conditions of their broadband connection , " Ms Pecotic says .
" We say the ISP must take action to prevent illegal file - sharing .
We 're really at a point where we cannot tolerate illegal file - sharing continuing as though it 's perfectly normal and an activity that can be condoned .
It 's a very damaging activity .
It caused $ 92 million worth of damage to the film industry in 2005 in Australia alone . "
The problem for AFACT is that Australia 's ISPs have no interest in being judge and jury when it comes to dealing with illegal file - sharers .
Ms Pecotic insists that some local ISPs have started taking action against file - sharers , but again declines to name which ISPs are involved .
Meanwhile the Internet Industry Association has said that it will take more than AFACT 's allegations of file - sharing for ISPs to start disconnecting users .
" AFACT claims to have the IP addresses ( of file - sharers ) , but it 's alleged , " says IIA executive director Peter Coroneos .
" Even then the ISP can't say who at the address did the downloading .
The due legal process must be followed in our legal system .
The existing usage terms and conditions talk about illegal activity and not alleged illegal activity .
People are presumed innocent until found guilty by a legally constituted court . "
Even if major ISPs such as BigPond and Optus comply with such requests , serious file - sharers are attracted to the higher download limits of more progressive ISPs , which would face a massive customer backlash if they began disconnecting users based solely on the word of AFACT .
Unless legalisation forces all ISPs to comply with AFACT 's requests , it would seem Australian file - sharers have little to fear from the copyright police .
The local picture
Australians finally have access to legitimate video download services , but it 's yet to be seen if they 'll put a major dent in illegal file sharing .
Apple sells television shows through the online Australian iTunes Store for $ 2.99 per episode .
It also sells movies for $ 10 - $ 25 , but some can also be rented for $ 3.99 for 24 or 48hours ( $ 4.99 for high - definition movies ) .
A2 M bps broadband connection is required for watching videos in real - time , or 5 M bps for high - definition content ( see review , page 28 ) .
Telstra 's BigPond Movies also rents television shows for $ 2.95 and movies for $ 3.95 - $ 5.95 .
BigPond also offers free streaming video of news and sport .
Australian competitor Reeltime.tv closed its doors in February , but is set to be revived later this year by EzyDVD as the EzyDownload service .
BigPond has more television and movie listings than Apple , although BigPond 's catalogue mostly features old and obscure content .
Apple 's Australian service is more expensive than that in the US , while offering less content , but it is possible for Australians to circumvent Apple 's restrictions and access the US iTunes Store .
A growing amount of television content is also available to Australians courtesy of the local television networks themselves .
The ABC has by far the richest offering with its free iView service allowing users to watch a variety of ABC and BBC programs after they 've screened on television .
The resolution is sharp enough to watch full screen on your computer , although it is streamed rather than downloaded , so users need a connection of at least 1 Mbps .
SBS only offers short clips of TV shows , along with full - length episodes of locally produced shorts such as Marx and Venus and Stories From the Golf .
Of the commercial networks , Nine offers free access to episodes of the locally produced McLeod 's Daughters , Canal Road and Sea Patrol II , after initially charging $ 1.95 per episode .
Ten has also embraced the concept of " catch - up TV " , offering free streaming access to six locally produced programs such as Good News Week , although not at full - screen resolution .
Seven still lags behind the others , having only put The Outdoor Room and Make Me a Supermodel online in the past month - again not in full - screen resolution .
Everything else from Seven is short previews .
Such services are of little use to Australians wanting to watch the latest dramas from the US such as Lost , Heroes , 24 and Prison Break - shows that many people use illegal file - sharing in order to download .
Apple launched Australian television downloads in June , the week after all the major US television series finished screening locally .
We wo n't know until the new seasons begin whether Apple will come good on its promise to make shows available the day after they screen on Australian television .
Downloads on the up
Anyone who can use a computer can easily download movies and television shows from the internet .
One of the most popular methods of downloading is a file - sharing system called BitTorrent .
BitTorrent tracking websites , for example ISO Hunt and the Pirate Bay , let you search for movies and television shows as easily as you 'd search for sites on Google .
You can then use a free desktop BitTorrent application - such as uTorrent , BitComet or Vuze ( formerly Azureus ) - to connect to other BitTorrent users who are sharing those files .
Some BitTorrent applications let you automatically download new episodes of television shows as they come online .
Once downloaded , you can watch the videos on your computer , transfer them to your phone , stream them to your television or burn them to disc and pop them in your DVD player .
The more people sharing a file , the faster it comes down .
At its peak , BitTorrent allows you to download video in almost real - time .
The average movie consumes about 700MB of bandwidth , while a 60 - minute TV show ( 42 minutes with the ads removed ) consumes about 350 MB .
BitTorrent 's decentralised nature makes it impossible for authorities to shut down such peer - to - peer sharing networks , although their usage can be monitored .
Gnutella is a similar file - sharing system that works with desktop applications such as Morpheus and LimeWire .
Such technologies upload and download at the same time , which can be a trap for those using ISPs such as BigPond that count uploads towards monthly usage limits .
Efforts to catch illegal file - sharers have seen tech - savvy users turn to online encrypted forums , such as Usenet newsgroups , to download videos in ways that can't be intercepted by the copyright police .
Usenet groups are distributed across the internet , rather than on a single server .
Like peer - to - peer file - sharing systems , accessing Usenet groups requires the installation of a free desktop application , the most popular including NewsLeecher , NewsBin and SABnzbd .
To take advantage of file - sharing , users can start with an internet plan offering as little as 3GB per month at speeds of 512 kbps , which retails from $ 25 per month according to Broadband Choice ( bc.whirlpool.net.au ) .
Australian consumer broadband plans offer download speeds up to 24 M bps per second , with some plans offering well over 100 GB of data a month .
But plans offering unlimited downloads sell for about $ 100 per month , while restricted to speeds of 1.5 Mbps .
GenePool : Evolutionary Optimization in OCaml
GenePool is a framework for writing evolutionary optimization algorithms in OCaml .
This library is not a complete solution but rather is a generic skeleton which takes care of the plumbing and nuisances of optimization .
You provide GenePool with functions that give meaning to fitness and reproduction and after a specified number of generation , GenePool returns an array of the best " genomes " it evolved .
You can download the GenePool source , which is distributed under the LGPL license .
Library Interface
The interface to GenePool is extremely simple .
It consists of a single function evolve whose type is :
( ' genome , ' fitness ) ga_spec -> ga_params -> ' genome array * ' fitness
As you can tell from the signature , GenePool is polymorphic over both the representation of the genome and the type of fitness values .
Typically your genome will be an array and fitness will be expressed as either an int or float .
However , nothing stops you from using different types if your problem requires them .
The first parameter is a record ( of type ga_spec ) which encodes how evolution will proceed for your specific problem .
type ( ' genome , ' fitness ) ga_spec = { evaluate : ' genome -> ' fitness ; mutate : ' genome -> ' genome ; crossover : ' genome * ' genome -> ' genome ; genRandom : unit -> ' genome ; seed : ' genome array option ; report : ( int -> ' genome -> ' fitness -> unit ) option ; stop : ( int > ' genome -> ' fitness -> bool ) option }
Some parameters ( ie , the maximum number of generations , the number of genomes which survive each generations , etc ... ) are universal across all optimization algorithms .
These are provided in another record , whose type is ga_params .
type ga_params = { nRandom : int ; nSurvivors : int ; nMutations : int ; nCrossovers : int ; timeLimit : float ; maxGen : int }
The return value of evolve is ' genome array * ' fitness which is the last generation sorted by order of their fitness and the fitness of the single best genome ( ie , the genome at the 0th index of the returned generation ) .
Usage
To demonstrate GenePool in action , let 's solve a completely trivial problem : maximizing the number of bits in a binary vector .
First , we must pick a genome representation for solutions .
In this simple case both the genomes and their corresponding solutions can be of the same type : bool array .
Now , let 's make a ga_spec record to use as an argument to evolve .
GenePool comes with a set of handy functions for manipulating array genomes .
These can be found in the GenePool .
ArrayGenome module .
let spec = { evaluate = Array.
fold_left ( fun count b -> if b then count + 1 else count ) 0 ; mutate = ArrayGenome.mutatePoint not ; crossover = ArrayGenome.randomCrossover ; genRandom = ArrayGenome.mkArray 500 Random.bool ; seed = None ; report =
Some ( fun gen genome fitness -> Printf.printf
" Generation %d , fitness : %d
" gen fitness ) ; stop = Some ( fun gen genome fitness -> fitness = 500 ) }
Furthermore , let 's create a ga_params record to specify that we want to evolve a 1000 vectors over 10 generations without a time limit .
let params = { nRandom = 1000 ; nSurvivors = 100 ; nMutations = 450 ; nCrossovers = 450 ; timeLimit = max_float ; maxGen = 10 }
Putting It All Together
To make something happen , just call evolve with the two records we just created .
You 'll get back the best array along with its fitness score .
let genomes , bestFitness = evolve spec params let _ = Printf. printf
" Final fitness : %d
" bestFitness

Compiling
Since the internal timer in GenePool relies on the Unix module , be sure to link with either unix.cma or unix.cmxa ( depending on which compiler you use ) .
$ ocamlopt -o test unix.cmxa genePool.mli genePool.ml test.ml $ ./ test Generation 1 , fitness : 306 Generation 2 , fitness : 327 Generation 3 , fitness : 336 Generation 4 , fitness : 341 Generation 5 , fitness : 348 Generation 6 , fitness : 357 Generation 7 , fitness : 368 Generation 8 , fitness : 378 Generation 9 , fitness : 396 Generation 10 , fitness : 403 Final fitness : 403

News in Science
Fossils tell of mass exodus from sea
New fossils of the first land animals reveal that ancient shores were alive with more crawling , slithering creatures than anyone previously thought .
In the late Cambrian era , nearly 500 million years ago , the seas were teeming with life .
Food was abundant , but so were predators .
Palaeontologists believe animals fled the marine environment for the safe confines of tide pools , and ultimately dry land , where they could live without fear of being eaten .
From fossil tracks found in Ontario , Canada , researchers know that a group of insect - like creatures called arthropods were crawling on sand dunes around this time .
But how and when they migrated from the ocean to the dunes is still a mystery .
" They 'd first have to cross an intertidal zone - a tidal flat , " says Assistant Professor James ' Whitey ' Hagadorn of Amherst College in Massachusetts .
" So we went exploring , looking for rocks of similar Cambrian age representing coastal sandy settings . "
In the fossil - laden rocks of Wisconsin , New York , and Missouri , they struck it rich - arthropod tracks , left after the critters crawled through mud flats , were in abundance .
Alongside the tracks , fossilised mud cracks and impressions from rain drops proved the mud was dry as they scampered past .
Molluscs
Surprisingly , they also found evidence that slug - or snail - like molluscs and worm - like annelids had slithered through the tidal flats as well .
" We knew arthropods should be there , but did n't know what else , " Hagadorn says .
" In a way the molluscs are more interesting because they were n't carrying a big shell around , and they had to deal with all of the problems of being on land . "
Despite the lack of predators , living on land was a dangerous proposition for creatures used to life at sea .
Suddenly they were faced with intense radiation from the sun , an atmosphere that would dry them out in a matter of hours , and no support from buoyancy .
Modern - day arthropods include hermit crabs , horseshoe crabs and insects - all characterised by a hard , protective exoskeleton .
Their Cambrian cousins also had hard exteriors , making them well - suited to the rigors of life out of water .
" But how did molluscs deal with this ?
They were n't carrying around a big shell , " which made them vulnerable to drying out , says Hagador .
" Were they nocturnal ?
We see evidence of them burrowing beneath the surface , perhaps to avoid desiccation from the heat . "
Hagadorn stresses that his team 's interpretation of the fossils - especially the presence of annelids - are far from certain ; fossils yet to be discovered could change the picture .
" You 're just a detective in deep time , putting pieces of the puzzle together , " he says , " Until someone comes and strikes it down .
When it stands for a long time it becomes a theory , but I do n't think we 're anywhere near that yet . "
" This is very exciting - it implies that the diversity of life on land at the time was higher than we thought , " says Dr Simon Braddy of the University of Bristol .
" It 's all filling in the picture of when life on land first occurred -- a breathtaking moment in the evolution of life on earth . "
The dean of Yale University 's School of Management has announced that he will be leaving to join Apple as a new Vice President , serving of the dean of a new " Apple University . "
Sources at Yale said Joel Podolny 's departure as dean was unexpected , and that neither Podolny nor Apple would comment on what " Apple University " would be .
The new program is scheduled to get started early in 2009 .
Apple has run the iTunes U program since the middle of last year , which helps schools publish audio and video podcasts of lectures along with coursework documents to their student population , and the company encourages schools to share their educational content with the general public as well .
Another program
Apple set up earlier this year is iPhone University , which was designed to help schools learn how to develop custom mobile applications and deploy the WiFi infrastructure needed to support wirelessly connected mobile computing on campuses .
The company also manages a series of training and certification programs that range from desktop support , computer repair , and network administration to training programs that cover Final Cut Studio , Logic Pro , and the company 's other software titles .
Apple also runs free classes , workshops , and presentations in its retail stores covering Mac basics and the use of software such as iLife , and sells an annual subscription pass for ' One to One ' personal training related to computing .
The company has also started a summer Apple Camp and fall field trip programs for students within its retail stores .
Five years ago , a journalism student at UC Berkeley profiled a professional - development program at Steve Jobs ' other company , called Pixar University , intended to " build morale , spirit and communication among employees . "

A subatomic particle is any particle that is smaller than or makes up an atom .
There are two types of sub-atomic particle : composite particles , which include protons , and fundamental particles , which include electrons .
At one time this included protons , neutrons , and electrons , which are known to make up all elements ( except ordinary hydrogen whoch does not contain any neutrons in its nucleus ) .
Since that time , additional particles have been experimentally detected or theorized .
These include quarks and gluons which are a level smaller still .
Other particles that exist are photons and neutrinos .
Most of space on the subatomic level is empty , with only very small amounts having particles in them .
Subatomic particles are categorized into :
The graviton is a boson theorised by some models and would be responsible for gravitation .
It has so far not been detected .

If the Bush administration had consciously plotted to leave office with one last jab at American scientists , it could hardly have done better than the North Atlantic right whale incident .
This fish tale has everything : attacks on science , appeasement of special interests , delays in government action — even a cameo by Moby Dick Cheney .
North Atlantic right whales can grow to 55 feet in length and weigh 70 tons , but that hardly makes them invincible .
Because they have a habit of calving amid shipping lanes off the Atlantic coast , the whales sometimes perish in collisions — no small matter when there are fewer than 400 of them left in existence .
Accordingly , in 2006 the National Marine Fisheries Service ( nmfs ) sought to protect these endangered cetaceans by requiring speed limits for ships passing through critical areas at key times of year — in essence setting up the marine equivalent of school crossing zones .
But if science is a right whale , the Bush administration is a container ship doing 25 knots .
The White House stalled , and continues to stall , the nmfs regulation , and now we know why .
Behind the scenes , it has been indulging in opportunistic attacks on whale science that echoed those by the shipping industry , especially the World Shipping Council , a trade group that has lobbied heavily against the nmfs rule .
Last year , as the Fisheries Service sought to impose a 10 knot seasonal speed limit in certain areas , documents exposed by Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) and the Union of Concerned Scientists ( ucs ) show , several White House offices began challenging the seemingly indisputable fact that the faster a ship is going , the greater the danger it poses to whales .
This conclusion is rooted in scientific observation , basic physics , and of course common sense — but that did n’t stop the president ’s Council of Economic Advisers from undertaking its own highly selective reanalysis of whale mortality data .
( Government fisheries experts called the book - cooking exercise “ biased ” and “ unlike any formal sensitivity analysis nmfs biometricians are familiar with . ” )
The scientists also had to answer to the veep ’s office : Cheney ’s staff questioned whether it ’s not the speed of the ship that counts , but its size .
( To see how little sense this makes , compare being hit by a Prius at 60 miles per hour to being hit by a bus at the same speed — either way , your survival chances are basically nil . )
Waxman had this to say : “ While I appreciate the value of vigorous scientific debate , I question why White House economic advisers are apparently conducting their own research on right whales and why the vice president ’s staff is challenging the conclusions of the government ’s scientific experts . ”
And indeed , the whole saga does seem pretty over the top .
But it also perfectly fits a recurring pattern across President Bush ’s two terms .
Again and again , at agency after agency , government science has been undermined , torqued , twisted , muzzled .
For eight years the scandals have just kept coming — so much so that even very high - level appointees like the surgeon general and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have encountered interference with their attempts to convey scientific information .
“ It is an outcome of the ‘ faith based ’ presidency , with many decisions made based on instincts rather than facts , ” says Judith Curry , chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech , who ’s served as a nasa adviser .
“ The whole thing about faith is to believe things for which there is no empirical evidence .
The Bush administration treats science as if you have a choice regarding whether or not to accept demonstrable scientific knowledge , analogous to the choice of which church to go to or which type of automobile to drive . ”
Meanwhile , the battery of insults has dragged down the morale of scientist civil servants and amped up the cynicism of Americans who ’ve watched their government grow increasingly dysfunctional .
“ We ’re beyond ‘ here ’s another abuse , ' ” says Francesca Grifo , director of the scientific integrity program at the ucs .
“ It ’s more how they changed the system to turn it into this new kind of machine that perpetually sidelines the science . ”
think of science as the oil that greases the engine of modern government .
Without it , things do n’t run properly and eventually break down completely .
You do n’t merely need good science to protect endangered species .
You need it to regulate chemicals , preserve clean air and water , keep dangerous drugs and foods off the market , ensure highway and aviation safety , run a space program , forecast severe weather , and much , much more .
Accordingly , many branches of the US government basically amount to scientific dormitories .
The Environmental Protection Agency , Department of the Interior , Department of Health and Human Services , Department of Commerce , Department of Agriculture , National Aeronautics and Space Administration — each employs thousands of scientists .
And that ’s not all : Collectively these agencies also have a few hundred scientific advisory committees to help them assess research implications .
In one sense , it ’s modern technocracy at its most arcane .
But given the complexity of decision making today , it ’s hard to see how you could run the country any other way .
This also means that by assaulting the science infrastructure , you can hobble government itself , and during the Bush administration , science abuse has been not only epidemic , but endemic .
We can see this not only anecdotally — through myriad stories like the right whale saga — but statistically .
Over the past three years , the Union of Concerned Scientists has surveyed 3,400 scientists across nine federal agencies and has consistently found alarming levels of job dissatisfaction and widespread complaints about political meddling .
Consider the National Marine Fisheries Service , which nestles , Russian - doll - like , inside a bigger science agency , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which , in turn , resides within the Department of Commerce .
nmfs is charged with implementing the Endangered Species
Act in one narrow but critical area — the protection of marine species and anadromous fish like salmon , which migrate between freshwater and the sea ; to this end , as well as to perform other marine stewardship duties , it employs some 500 scientists .
The ucs took a poll of them in 2005 and found that more than half knew of instances in which commercial interests had “ inappropriately induced the reversal or withdrawal of scientific conclusions or decisions through political intervention . ”
Further , more than a third of respondents said they had been “ directed , for non-scientific reasons , ” to avoid making findings that required protection of species in peril , and nearly a fourth had been “ directed to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information ” from scientific documents .
When we start to inquire who is doing the “ directing ” in such cases , we begin to get to the root of the problem .
In the right whale instance , the interference with science came straight from the White House , and that ’s true of many other science abuse stories , particularly those relating to high - profile subjects like global warming .
( See “ Climate of Meddling “ ) The White House Office of Management and Budget ( omb ) has even begun hiring its own scientists for this purpose .
Nevertheless , the White House simply lacks the resources to keep tabs on all the scientific activities throughout the entire government .
And that ’s where an army of some 3,000 political appointees , spread across the agencies , comes in .
All too often they ’ve acted as stand -ins for the interests of either religious conservatives opposed to abortion and contraception or industry groups intent on blocking regulation , or as messengers for an ideology that suspects government - employed scientists of being liberal do - gooders ( or as one conservative put it , “ science moles ” ) out to block the Bush agenda .
Over the past eight years these appointees have fallen into repeated conflicts with agency career scientists as they have served as “ minders ” and the forceful editors of scientific documents .
All of which suggests that fixing the science abuse problem is in significant part a matter of staffing .
The White House and the administration ’s political appointees can still , of course , set policy — that ’s what they ’re there for — but they must keep their hands off actual science .
That ’s where the line was drawn for decades , until Bush erased it .
they called it “ Julie proofing ” : a strategy for avoiding unwanted attention from Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior Julie MacDonald , who became legendary for meddling with Fish and Wildlife Service scientists whose research indicated a need for greater protections for endangered species .
After enough run-ins , the scientists would learn to self - censor , anticipating MacDonald ’s hostile line of questioning , and modifying their own work ( and conclusions ) accordingly .
MacDonald was a civil engineer by training and had a history in California Republican politics .
But just like White House economic advisers in the right whale case , her background did n’t stop her from challenging government wildlife experts and digging deep into their realm of expertise .
According to an investigation by the Interior Department ’s inspector general that eventually led to her resignation , MacDonald had been “ heavily involved with editing , commenting on , and reshaping the Endangered Species Program ’s scientific reports from the field . ”
That included , in some cases , directly contacting individual scientists ( rather than their superiors ) to hector them , demanding that they change their conclusions and reach ones more conducive to private industry .
And even that was n’t the biggest scandal .
MacDonald also shared internal agency documents with a pro-industry law firm , a lobbyist for the California Farm Bureau Federation , and two people with “ chevrontexaco.com ” email addresses .
By law , the listing of endangered species must proceed solely based on science , but with MacDonald calling the shots , the science itself was recrafted to favor her political inclinations .
MacDonald was just one of several thousand political appointees installed by the Bush administration , which at its peak contained 350 more political appointees than there were at the end of Clinton ’s years .
While some of them may have been excellent managers , their general job qualifications are , by definition , political , making them acutely aware of the interests of private industry and the religious right , which put the Bush government in power .
Consider nasa , where climate scientist James Hansen alleged that political appointees at the public affairs office had sought to block his ability to discuss global warming with the media .
Hansen ’s central antagonist was a young political appointee named George Deutsch , who had worked on George W. Bush ’s 2004 presidential campaign and had n’t , at the time of his conflict with Hansen , yet obtained a college diploma .
Hansen ’s charges were vindicated by nasa ‘s inspector general , who also chronicled repeated instances in which the press office had distorted and suppressed scientific press releases about global warming .
“ In sum , ” the inspector general concluded , “ none of this course of conduct was in the public ’s best interest . ”
Similarly , when the press came calling for interviews about the relationship between hurricanes and global warming in the wake of Katrina , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found itself having to answer to political appointees — who handpicked which scientists could talk to the media , and which could n’t .
One such appointee in the Commerce Department ’s public affairs office , Chuck Fuqua , had directed media operations for the 2004 Republican National Convention .
These are all , in essence , Julie MacDonald stories .
They suggest that if the next administration wishes to fix the science problem bequeathed by the Bush administration , it must entrust far more duties , especially at the subterranean levels of government , to career civil servants .
the environmental Protection Agency represents the epitome of a science agency — it employs more than 6,000 staff with specifically scientific duties at its central headquarters , 10 regional offices , and numerous laboratories .
Particularly science - intensive sectors include the Office of Air and Radiation ( which sets clean air standards ) , the Office of Prevention , Pesticides , and Toxic Substances , and the Office of Research and Development .
This science bureaucracy has become more and more embattled :
In a recently released ucs survey of nearly 900 epa researchers , 60 percent reported at least one incident of political interference during the past five years , and more than half ( 560 scientists ) knew of “ many or some cases ” in which political appointees at other agencies had inappropriately been involved in agency decisions .
Nearly 100 epa scientists surveyed by the ucs pointed the finger directly at the White House .
As one scientist put it , “ They truly interfere and want to stamp the White House Agenda over every document that is sent to them for review .
They have hired their own scientists and play the ‘ my scientist is better than yours ’ game .
The epa has to accept a lot of shit from them to get any documents out . ”
It also has to put up with being ignored .
The New York Times recently reported that the omb simply refused to open an email from the agency containing a proposal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions — a proposal made in response to nothing less than a Supreme Court order .
Indeed , the epa has been constantly reversed in court of late , in part because it has been misstating science and rigging its analyses to justify its weak - tea regulatory actions .
In a particularly telltale case , epa Administrator Stephen Johnson recently overruled his own Clean Air Science Advisory Committee recommendation to tighten regulation of particulate matter , even though the committee had supported such action by a 22 - 2 margin .
Such behaviors prompted the coalition of unions representing epa scientists to charge that the epa “ ignores its own Principles of Scientific Integrity whenever political direction from other federal entities or private sector interests so direct . ”
One of the nastiest slaps at epa science is perhaps the most obscure .
In 2006 , facing cuts , the agency shut down a number of libraries , including a chemical library that scientists had relied upon to assess the dangers of various substances and especially seek out different information than the spin provided to them by private industry .
So not only are epa scientists repeatedly having their science reversed , disregarded , and micromanaged ; they ca n’t even conduct adequate research in the first place .
the food and Drug Administration , too , has been beset by science scandals — Plan B emergency contraception and Vioxx come to mind .
Indeed , in 2007 the agency ’s own science board reported that the fda “ suffers from serious scientific deficiencies and is not positioned to meet current or emerging regulatory responsibilities . ”
But fda whistleblower Susan Wood — director of the Office of Women ’s Health until she resigned over continuing delays in the approval of Plan B for over - the - counter use — says we must n’t get bogged down in specific scandals and miss the big picture .
Fundamentally , what befell the fda is pernicious neglect .
The administration simply did n’t care about the agency ’s mission , or even want it to function properly .
The fda , notes
Wood , went without a commissioner for well more than a year into the Bush administration ; since then , it has n’t had a leader who lasted longer than a year and a half .
The message is clear : “ We do n’t value you , ” explains Wood .
That ’s been the message for eight long years , which is why our next president must immediately signal that he takes science seriously .
He can start by appointing a presidential science adviser who enjoys a Cabinet rank ( unlike Bush ’s current science adviser , physicist John Marburger ) and charge her , and relevant Cabinet secretaries , with closely monitoring each agency with the explicit goal of ensuring research integrity .
“ Once the politicization is stopped , ” says Georgia Tech ’s Curry , “ leading scientists will stop leaving these agencies , and bright young scientists will once again view civil service positions in government laboratories as desirable positions , and these agencies can serve the public at the level that they should . ”

Gergen : Reagan administration enacted ' redistribution ' of wealth David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator John McCain has been attempting to appeal to voters lately by attacking Barack Obama over his plans to reduce taxes for the middle class while increasing them on the wealthiest Americans .
Political analyst David Gergen believes the Democrats ought to fight back harder than they have against these claims that Obama is a " socialist " and suggests they start by pointing out that the most esteemed Republican presidents , such as Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan , were also supporters of what McCain decries as " income redistribution . "
In a speech set for Monday , McCain asserts , " Senator Obama is running to be Redistributionist in Chief .
I 'm running to be Commander in Chief .
Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth .
I 'm running to create more wealth .
Senator Obama is running to punish the successful .
I 'm running to make everyone successful . "
When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper whether McCain 's attacks are working , Gergen replied , " They may be making some modest progress with it .
We do see some evidence of McCain coming up a point or two here and there .
I do n't think it 's anywhere near close enough to win an election . "
However , Gergen added that " more importantly , I do n't think the Democrats have really answered it appropriately . "
Gergen suggested that the Democrats should invoke the example of Teddy Roosevelt , who was both a Republican and one of the greatest advocates of progressive taxation in the years immediately preceding the enactment of the current income tax .
Gergen also noted that the Reagan administration was responsible for enacting the Earned Income Tax Credit , an extremely successful redistribution program which returns money to the working poor .
" Sometimes they get so carried away that they do n't realize the realities of what we 've been going through , " Gergen added .
Apparently referring to McCain 's promises to " create more wealth , " he explained that " the wealth over the last 30 years has been redistributed -- it 's been redistributed upwards .
As we grow , the top one percent 's getting a disproportionate share . "
" Everything McCain does seems scattershot , " concluded correspondent John King .
" You needed to start a long time ago and build your case , not just throw these things out . "

Lighter Roofs Could Save $ 1 Billion
Image : Mr. Mystery
Looking at the black roof just makes you want to not be up there in the summer , right ?
But what if it were white , that would n’t be so bad .
Well , it ’s exactly that thought that made the state of California require all new or renovated roofs to be white or “ lighter ” to some degree .
In cities around the country , a full 25 % of surface area is residential and commercial roofs , which means that white , which reflects UV rays and such , would be the perfect color to reduce cooling costs and much of the heat island effect experienced by large cities .
In 2005 California began requiring new commercial buildings with flat roofs to paint them white , but because angled roofs and residences are a bit trickier , it has taken longer to pass further regulation .
However , with estimates that lighter roofs could save this US $ 1 billion dolars a year , California has began to tighten up their regulations .
No one knows if other states will sign on , but hopefully both states and businesses catch on to what California is already doing .

1. Aerial Hunting of Wolves
This is one of the most disturbing acts that Palin supports .
Being an animal lover , supporter , and advocate I am sickened that she supports aerial hunting of wolves .
After a multi - year court battle , the Bush administration recognized in 2008 that polar bears are threatened with extinction by global warming .
Announcing Alaska ’s suit to block the listing , Palin said , “ We believe that the listing was unwarranted and that it ’s unprecedented to list a currently healthy population based on uncertain climate models . ”
[ Reuters , 5/22/08 ]
In 2007 , Palin illegally established “ a $ 150 bounty to the state sanctioned airborne wolf hunters as an added incentive to increase their kills , ” soon overturned by the Alaska State Court .
[ Alaska Wildlife Alliance ; Anchorage Daily News , 3/31/07 ]
Some information on Aerial Hunting :
Aerial hunting occurs when hunters use airplanes to track an animal in the snow , chase them to exhaustion and shoot them from the air , or when hunters in airplanes track animals in the snow , herd or chase them to exhaustion , land the aircraft and shoot them from the ground .
The use of aircraft to shoot or harass animals from the air is illegal under the Airborne Hunting Act , enacted in 1972 .
The act was passed after a nationwide outcry against the aerial hunting of wolves in Alaska .
The circumstances surrounding Alaska ’s program make it clear that the state is allowing aerial hunting , which is banned by federal law .
The state exploits a loophole in the AHA to allow private hunters and private pilots .
As recently as July , a known wolf den site was staked out -- a practice that is illegal under Alaska law -- and , using helicopters , gunned down 14 adult wolves from the air .
When they landed , they found the 14 helpless pups in the nearby dens -- just weeks old -- and methodically shot each one in the head .
28 wolves gunned down in all .
Rep. George Miller ( CA ) has introduced the Protect America 's Wildlife ( PAW )
Act , legislation to close a federal loophole and curb Alaska 's brutal aerial hunting program -- and prevent programs like it from spreading to places like the Greater Yellowstone region .
Support the PAW Act

Sarah is pro-life .
I do not have a problem with that , except for one thing .
She opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest .
In 2006 , Palin said that even if her daughter were raped , “ I would choose life . "
In my opinion , I think that is a horrible way to think .
I am generally against abortion , but I think if a woman is the victim of rape or incest , she should be able to decide to have an abortion .
I do not believe anyone , especially the government , has the right to tell you what you can and can't do with your own body .
I think what is most disturbing is the comment she made regarding her daughter .
Earlier this year , Palin used a veto to cut funding for a state program that benefits teen mothers in need of a place to live .
Funding for Covenant House Alaska , which provides transitional housing for teen mothers , was cut by 20 percent — from $ 5 million to $ 3.9 million .
[ Washington Post , 9/3/08 ]
Sarah Supports Abstinence - Only Policies .
In 2006 , the Eagle Forum Alaska asked Palin whether she would “ support funding for abstinence - until - marriage education . ”
Palin replied , “ Yes , the explicit sex - ed programs will not find my support . ” [ Politico, 9/1/08 ] .
An abstinence - only policy will not teach young adults the importance of protection , the risk of STD's , and the risk of pregnancy .
Many teens choose to have sex .
If the policy she supports became the primary teaching , teens would not learn important issues regarding safe sex .
She is said to be against birth control and sex-education .
Did she not teach her daughter about the importance of birth control ?
Watch these videos about Palin 's views on birth control , sex education , and abortion .
I can not ignore one rumor .
I do n't know the truth , nor am I going to speculate .
However , I decided to include a video questioning who is the real mother of Trig .
Is Sarah or Bristol the mother ?
There is even speculation that Bristol is pregnant now with her 2nd child .
3. Energy
One major event I am protesting right now is the possibility of drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge ( which can be seen in my previous post . )
Palin Is A Top Arctic Wildlife Refuge Drilling Advocate .
Palin said she thinks McCain is “ going to evolve into , eventually , supporting ANWR ( Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ) opening also ” and “ I ’d like the opportunity to get to change his mind about ANWR . ” [ Kudlow & Co.,6/25/08 ]--

Last night I listened to John McCain make his speech at the Republican National Convention .
In his speech he mentioned his desire to seek out alternative energy .
I hope Sarah does n't change his mind .

Before really knowing who Sarah Palin was , I was quite happy that John McCain decided to choose her as Vice President .
However , my views have changed .
Sarah stands for many things I advocate against .
This post is not an attack on John McCain , nor is it to support Barack Obama .
It is simply to show who Sarah Palin really is , and my dislike for her .
I can only hope that you read what I have found and do your own research .
This analysis of Sarah Palin will be done in two parts .
This is post number 1.I want to mention if you find that Palin has written the opposite of what I researched , please be aware that she wrote a campaign booklet for her 2006 gubernatorial bid .
Her co-author , Sean Parnell , is now Alaska 's Lieutenant Governor .
As we all know , politicians have a tendency to say and write whatever is necessary to get elected .
What she wrote in the booklet does not reflect what she really ended up doing .

Sitting pretty : Tina
Fey kicks back on the set of her sitcom 30 Rock , which starts its third season Thursday ( 9:30 p.m. ET / PT , NBC ) .

People 's choice : Tina Fey 's impression of Sarah Palin , with Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton , scored big on SNL .
MIRROR IMAGES ?
YOU BETCHA !
MIRROR IMAGES ?
YOU BETCHA !
Tina
Fey at first resisted playing Sarah Palin -- and not because she does n't share the Alaskan governor 's politics .
" I 'm not an impressionist , and I 'm barely even a sketch player anymore .
It 's weird , " Fey says .
" The sketches have been feeding back and forth off each other .
People may love her or not love her , but they 're fascinated by her . "
What did she think when people started commenting on her resemblance to the Republican nominee for vice president ?
" I did n't see it .
That lady looks fantastic .
She 's got these super - straight white teeth and she 's got this really even caramel tan .
She 's got legs for days , " Fey says .
" I 'm sure she 's going , ' Really , I do n't look like that . '
I did n't see it at first , but then I had to ( admit ) that there 's something there .
We have a similar nose .
We draw a different mouth on my mouth .
The point of her lips are further apart and her lips are fuller .
We glue my ears down . "
But her imitation of the governor goes way beyond skin deep .
SNL's Amy Poehler , who is Hillary Clinton to Fey 's Palin , says Fey " totally nailed it .
It was scratching the biggest itch , when she did it .
But just her doing it is so not funny .
She nailed the voice and got what was really funny " about Palin .
Adds SNL head writer Seth Meyers : " She works really hard to make it look easy .
People do n't realize how she has watched ( Palin ) to pick up all the minutiae .
She has killer instincts . "
By Donna Freydkin SEASON PREMIERE : SNEAK PEEK SEASON PREMIERE : SNEAK PEEK LONG ISLAND CITY , N.Y . 
" The election needs to be over , " sighs Tina Fey .
Right now , the woman turned pop-culture marvel for her impression of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is wiped out .
She 's shooting her Emmy - winning NBC comedy , 30 Rock ( which returns Thursday ) , 12 hours a day , five days a week .
And she 's spending Saturdays at Saturday Night Live as Palin .
She has one day off to be with her husband , composer Jeff Richmond , and daughter , Alice , 3 . PHOTOS : Scope out the highlights from Fey 's career VOTE : Pick the best comic political impersonator CLIP : Peek at the ' 30 Rock ' season premiere " It did sort of catch up with me last Sunday , " she says , trying to relax in her dressing room at Silvercup Studios on a recent Friday .
" I was pretty tired .
I 'd done the day shift into the night shift and wanted to hang out with the family on Sunday .
Hopefully this will all be over soon .
We 're taking it week by week , checking in to see if they need me " at SNL .
And need her they do .
Last week , when both Fey and Palin were on , the comedy show lured 15 million viewers , the highest rating since 1994 .
( Neither NBC nor Fey will say whether she 'll appear this weekend . )
How Fey balances what now amounts to two jobs , plus marriage and motherhood , and writing an upcoming humor non-fiction book , is a question none of her co-stars or friends can answer .
Friend and fellow SNL - er Amy Poehler attributes it to " cloning and time travel . "
30 Rock writer Robert Carlock says , " It 's kind of unprecedented what she 's trying to pull off .
I guess she does n't sleep ?
She has those early calls and works all day .
She runs out and gets her kid from school and runs back for the next shot .
She does do it all . "
Jack McBrayer , who plays perky Kenneth the page , calls her a workhorse .
" Yesterday , she had to do several scenes , do a taped episode of Letterman and go back to writing the next episode .
She does n't stop . "
In fact , it would n't be a stretch to say that Fey lives and breathes 30 Rock .
She 's of course proud of the series , but the acting Emmy she won this year ( one of three ) was an important milestone .
" For a long time , " she says , " I think it was easy for people to write or say , ' Well , she 's not really an actor . '
Maybe I 'm passing now .
So there 's that .
( Winning ) makes it feel like the show is a real TV show .
Someday maybe we 'll overcome the phrase ' ratings - challenged . ' " Shoring up ' 30 Rock ' Despite plenty of critical plaudits , 30 Rock ( Thursdays , 9:30 p.m. ET / PT ) is not what you 'd call a hit .
It averaged 6.5 million viewers last season , up 14 % from its first year .
But it 's the least - watched show on NBC 's four - comedy Thursday lineup .
Still , this season Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Aniston guest - star , which should attract eyeballs .
Fey says she can't complain about her schedule .
" But you can get pretty close . "
She pauses , and wraps her black coat tightly around herself in the frigid dressing room .
" It 's just that there 's nothing else .
You work , and you see your family when you can , and you go to bed .
I do n't see any movies .
It took me a year to read The Year of Magical Thinking . "
And " I never get to have wine !
I always have to go to bed .
I can't really bitch about it , either .
We have six weeks off — that 's four weeks longer than most people .
And it 's a job where I can bring my daughter , if I want to , and I get to be with people I love . "
She clearly cherishes time with her daughter , who visited the set the previous day after school .
" She 's in nursery school .
It 's pretty cute , " Fey says with a smile .
" She has a backpack that takes up the entire size of her torso .
She 's really proud of it .
If you said to her , ' What 's in your backpack ? '
She 's really cocky and says , ' Nothing . '
There 's nothing in it .
She just carries it . "
Indeed ,
Fey 's dressing room seems more like a kindergarten then a den of Zen .
The two candles on her coffee table have virgin wicks .
Next to them is a cup of Dunkin ' Donuts coffee and the last crumbs of a loaf of bread .
The little room is crammed with all the accoutrements that a toddler requires .
A little plastic pink chair sits near the couch , near a potty and a red wood rocking horse .
In the other corner stands an Eddie Bauer highchair .
It 's not exactly luxurious .
She brushes a black speck resembling a rice kernel off the couch and cracks , " By the way , I do believe that 's a mouse turd .
It 's the basement of an old bread factory .
Remind me to wash my hands before I eat more . "
Earlier that morning , she and McBrayer had been picking through an assortment of Dean & Deluca snacks sent over as a thank - you by Conan O'Brien for appearing on his show .
She gave McBrayer a guided tour of the selection of spicy and salty nuts , candied cherries and chocolates .
" Those are peppery .
Those are sweet .
These are pretty good , " she says , pointing to the coco nibs .
The snacks become fodder for her dry wit .
Talking about her tasks for the day , she shrugs , " I always have to do something , " setting up the quip : " But I 've got my Smokehouse nuts . "
She has just wrapped the first half of a scene set to air in December , in which her character , slightly loopy sketch comedy writer Liz Lemon , accompanied by her show star , Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) , and Kenneth visit a low - income apartment .
They 're making sure the Christmas gifts Lemon sent , as part of a charitable mission , were in fact delivered to children living there .
Inadvertently , the well - meaning but gaffe - prone Liz clues the kids into a secret about Santa 's existence .
" Yes , I know I made several mistakes , " Fey says after the first take .
After another , they break into laughter when Morgan messes up his closing line .
And when the actor playing a little boy 's dad admits that he can't keep one sentence straight , Fey is unfazed and reassures him , " We do this all the time . "
Sweeter than Lemon
In between set -ups , she regales the crew with a story about the pregnant Poehler and how dad - to - be Will Arnett is dealing with the impending arrival .
" She 's 10 months pregnant , " Fey joked .
" She had some contractions , some Braxton - Hicks , and Will blew it in every possible way . "
In some obvious ways , Fey and Liz Lemon are alike .
They 're both comedy writers .
They 're both smart and well - meaning , if not entirely polished or slick .
" A desire not to show her feet in public would be the main overlap between the two of them , " Carlock quips .
" They 're both sincere in their desire to do good and are aware of their occasional inability to live up their own ideals . "
Fey , who has been married seven years , can't relate to Liz 's relationship travails , but she understands that the character appeals to women who do n't see themselves in the sleek , skinny hotties on Gossip Girl .
" What 's the opposite of fantasy fulfillment ?
Nightmare reminding .
That 's good , if women like her , " Fey says .
" She 's mostly me , with some neuroses and behaviors exaggerated . "
This season , Liz has plenty to continue to be neurotic about .
She 's serious about adopting a child .
She still deals with her egomaniacal boss , Jack ( Alec Baldwin ) .
And she 's dating .
" She 's going to have some romantic endeavors .
She has one with Steve Martin — it 's pretty rad , right ? — he plays an eccentric , agoraphobic millionaire friend of Jack's , " Fey says .
Liz also has a brief relationship with Peter Dinklage .
" He plays a really together guy who works at the U.N. , " Fey explains .
" She 's trying to not blow it , and guess what happens ? "
Like any great comedian , Fey has no qualms about looking foolish on screen .
" Old girl will make fun of herself in a heartbeat , " McBrayer says .
Pretty funny
In an industry in which a woman can be either gorgeous or funny but rarely both , she 's the rare exception .
Fey can star in her own American Express ads , chasing Martin Scorsese through an airport , and rock a fancy David Meister frock on the red carpet .
But she 's still a comedy nerd , not entirely at home in the spotlight and still most comfortable in her broken - in Dansko clogs , which she slips into on set when the camera stops rolling .
And therein perhaps lies the key to Fey 's appeal .
Even when she was first garnering attention for her writing on Saturday Night Live , Fey came across not as a ham , but as the smart , polite girl next door — even as she gently layered on the sarcasm and wit .
" She deals with ( fame ) the same way she deals with everything else .
She just works harder , " says Lorne Michaels , executive producer of SNL , where Fey became the show 's first female head writer .
" She 's strong and she 's smart , which is a very appealing combination .
You trust her way of looking at the world .
There 's nothing strident about her .
She knows who she is . "
She 's still the same old Tina who is obsessed with finding the humor in oddball , everyday things , Carlock says .
" Having started working with her at SNL , " he says , " she has the same interest and the same desire to find that funny angle on everything .
She has n't changed . "
Even when she 's wiped out , Fey 's absurdity meter stays on .
Is she ever tempted to carry her acting Emmy around with her , like a talisman , and shove it in people 's faces ?
" The city is de-gentrifying . "
She pauses .
" Someone would mug me for it . "

Just two days after Microsoft announced plans to make over 420 million Windows Live ID accounts OpenID compatible , Google got in on the action as well .
Google announced that starting today , Gmail accounts can now be used as OpenIDs .
With Google ’s announcement that means the world ’s top web properties — Google , Yahoo ! , Microsoft , AOL , MySpace — are all now OpenID providers or will be soon .
That should be a huge win for OpenID , but unfortunately , while the companies pay lip service to the idea of single sign - on , they ’re still not truly getting behind the idea of OpenID .
The OpenID website describes the idea like this : “ OpenID eliminates the need for multiple usernames across different websites , simplifying your online experience .
You get to choose the OpenID Provider that best meets your needs and most importantly that you trust . ”
OpenID is supposed to be a completely open system that allows anyone to become a provider of URIs .
OpenID is supposed to be above branded identity systems , because no matter who your provider , your credentials are supposed to work anywhere OpenID is accepted .
Unfortunately , that ’s not the vision that big sites are subscribing to .
Instead , Yahoo ! and Google — and probably soon Microsoft — are locked in a battle to become the de facto OpenID provider .
By refusing to become relying parties ( i.e. , refusing to authenticate OpenIDs from other providers on their own properties ) , the single sign - on utility is completely lost for users .
As it stands , I still need a separate set of credentials to log into Gmail , MyYahoo ! , and Windows Live Messenger ( all services I use ) .
As Chris Messina writes : “ While I ’m sympathetic to [ the ] argument that more OPs is frankly better for the web , I ’m not convinced that a Visa card is all that useful if none of the major department stores will accept it . ”
Yahoo ! and Google further belie their true goals in their attempts to obfuscate the OpenID brand by encouraging developers to add “ Sign in with Yahoo ! / Google ” buttons and putting their own unique “ spin ” on OpenID ( as some developers have begun to note , what Google announced today is n’t a pure OpenID implementation ) .
Neither provide users with unique , claimed OpenID URIs .
Rather , they use generic URLs as an API starting point that direct users to sign in with a more traditional username and password schema .
That in and of itself may not be such a bad idea .
Edit : Technically , Yahoo !
does provide users with a unique URI , but they ’re not very user friendly , and it is not made readily clear to users where to find them — probably because Yahoo !
would prefer that developers implement a “ Sign in with Yahoo ! ” button .
The two field “ username ” and “ password ” approach is so ingrained in the minds of users , that a lot of people are confused when presented with an OpenID login form and do n’t know how to proceed .
Users in a recent Yahoo !
usability test confirmed this , and many reported being confused when they were n’t presented with the password box they ’re used to .
Using email addresses in place of URIs for OpenID is something Chris Saad talked about in August .
However , Google and Yahoo !
( and likely Microsoft to follow ) are ultimately competing with one another to become the branded single sign - on solution for the web .
The good news for users is that by using the same underlying technology , most relying parties will able to turn on support for any new OpenID provider fairly easily .
The bad news for users is that since none of the major providers are also relying parties , using services at each of these site still requires multiple accounts .
Further , a sign in box with 100 different logos for 100 different providers is n’t a great user experience .
No Takers for Contest to Make Fun of Walking , Biking , Transit
From the Competitive Enterprise Institute — the Phillip Morris - Amoco - Texaco - Ford - funded activist " think tank " that brought you such informational videos as " Where ’s the Warming ? " — comes this attack on World Carfree Day .
CEI invited YouTube auteurs to submit video responses in a competition for a $ 100 gas card , but its target audience may not think going car - free is all that nutty .
They did n’t get any takers for their contest , though there were almost a dozen negative viewer comments , 100 percent of the feedback as of this writing .
In the video , narrator and CEI senior fellow Marlo Lewis says that car - free events are catching on " because there ’s a growing political push to restrict car use . "
Uh , right .
It is n’t like Americans are turning to transit , walking and biking for other reasons — rather than , say , relying on contests for free gas .

Steve Fossett : Mammoth Lakes Hikers Find Personal Items
, American adventurer and the first person to circle the world solo in a hot air balloon , disappeared on September 3 , 2007 .
The aviator took off in a single engine plane borrowed from a Nevada ranch owned by .
He disappears without a trace - that is until now .
Hikers who were near the town of Mammoth Lakes , California , discovered personal identification , pilots and aircraft licenses and cash , which included $ 1,000 in cash , tangled in a clump of bushes on Tuesday .
The weathered papers had Fossett 's name on them and the money was battered .
There was no sign of a plane wreckage in the immediate vicinity .
Mammoth Lakes Police Department chief Randy Schienle verified that the items had been found .
He has initiated a ground and air search of the area based upon the new evidence that has surfaced .
Numerous conspiracy theories have surfaced over the past year , including speculation that Fossett staged his own death and is now out of the country living under a new identity .
Fossett 's good friend and financier , British billionaire Richard Branson , scoffs at the idea that his pal would have undertaken a scam of this kind .
Peggy Fossett petitioned the courts to declare her husband legally dead so that she could put his Will through probate .
The request was carried out by an Illinois judge on February 15 , 2008 .

ALBUQUERQUE – Senator John McCain pressed his strategy of trying to sow doubts about Senator Barack Obama during the closing month of the campaign by asking a crowd at a rowdy rally here Monday : “ Who is the real Barack Obama ? ’’
That question came in a sharply - worded speech in which Mr. McCain dismissed Mr. Obama as “ a Chicago politician , ’’ said that the Obama campaign had had to return “ $ 33,000 in illegal foreign funds from Palestinian donors , ’’ and sought to raise questions and doubts about Mr. Obama ’s background .
The speech came as the McCain campaign has opened a series of verbal assaults on Mr. Obama as it tries to turn the page on the financial crisis , which many analysts believe has rallied support to the Democrats .
But even as Mr. McCain gave the sharper - edged speech , the stock market was plunging .
In the speech , Mr. McCain repeatedly tried to paint Mr. Obama as a largely unknown , risky choice .
“ I did n’t just show up out of nowhere , ’’ Mr. McCain said to cheers , seeking to draw a contrast with Mr. Obama .
He said that “ even at this late hour in the campaign , there are essential things we do n’t know about Senator Obama or the record that he brings to this campaign . ’’
Mr. McCain decried what he called Mr. Obama ’s “ touchiness every time he is questioned about his record . ’’
“ For a guy who ’s already authored two memoirs , he ’s not exactly an open book , ’’ Mr. McCain said .
“ It ’s as if somehow the usual rules do n’t apply , and where other candidates have to explain themselves and their records , Senator Obama seems to think he is above all that .
Whatever the question , whatever the issue , there ’s always a back story with Senator Obama .
All people want to know is :
What has this man ever actually accomplished in government ?
What does he plan for America ?
In short : Who is the real Barack Obama ?
But , my friends , you ask such questions and all you get in response is another angry barrage of angry insults . ’’
Mr. McCain complained that “ whenever I have questioned his policies or his record , he has called me a liar , ’’ even as he accused Mr. Obama of lying about his record .
“ Senator Obama has accused me of opposing regulation to avert this crisis , ’’ he said .
“ I guess he believes if a lie is big enough and repeated often enough it will be believed .
But the truth is I was the one who called at the time for tighter restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that could have helped prevent this crisis from happening in the first place . ’’
Mr. McCain ’s return to Washington during negotiations of the financial bail - out bill was criticized by some participants for complicating its passage by injecting presidential politics in the mix , and the bill ’s initial demise was widely attributed to the failure of House Republicans to support it .
But Mr. McCain faulted Mr. Obama and the Democrats for going slow on the bailout package .
“ Today the Dow has fallen below 10,000 , ’’ he said .
“ And yet , members of his own party said they felt no pressure to vote for the bill .
Why did n’t Senator Obama work to pass this bill from the start ?
Why did he let it fail and drag out this crisis for a full week before doing a thing to help pass it ? ’’
The crowd booed mentions of Mr. Obama repeatedly , and several men called out again and again that Mr. Obama was a “ liar , ’’ and yelled “ send him home ! ”
The Obama campaign responded that Mr. McCain was “ angry . ”
“ On a day when the markets are plunging and the credit crisis is putting millions of jobs at risk , the one truly angry candidate in this race kept up his strategy of ‘ turning the page ’ on the economy by unleashing another frustrated tirade against Barack Obama , ’’ Tommy Vietor , an Obama campaign spokesman , said in a statement .

Cross the threshold of John Pilger 's south London home and the deep pile carpet gently gives way beneath the feet .
Soothing strains of classical guitar waft through the air and , over mugs of tea , the great polemicist examines the impact of his career , his sentences punctuated by the mewling of a ginger cat .
This scene of domestic calm is not one Pilger 's many political opponents , or the millions who follow his work , would associate with the cage - rattling campaigner who has set himself against authority figures from Washington DC to the killing fields of Cambodia .
It is half a century since Pilger started out as a copy boy on the Sydney Sun and he turned 69 last Thursday .
But he remains agitated by injustices which he sees at every turn in Britain and abroad .
Forty years after he began working for Granada 's World in Action , he has been commissioned to make a new film examining the media 's portrayal of Britain at war .
And in the New Statesman he calls the political establishment to account , most recently railing at the failure of the main parties to debate the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts at their conferences .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yet he has also set himself a fresh challenge , one that appears to have filled him with a sense of self - doubt .
" I 've started ... , " he announces with a splutter of disbelief , " to write what I hope is my first fiction . "
The author of a dozen books of journalism , he has yet to offer a sample of this " collection of short stories " to his publisher .
" The wonderful thing about writing fiction is that you are released from the tyranny of facts , of having to get everything right , of sourcing everything that matters .
Your imagination is released .
But you know , " he adds , starting to laugh , " there is a bit of clash going on here and I 'm not sure that it 's a good idea . "
After five decades as a crusader for truth , making stuff up does n't come easily , despite what some of his right - wing critics might claim .
" It 's a real struggle .
I 'm constantly drawn back to non fiction because it is so much more interesting and vivid , " he says .
If the book does get finished , do n't expect to find Pilger wrestling with his emotions – " I 'm not interested in navel gazing " – but developing characters he has observed on a journey that has taken him to war zones in Vietnam , East Timor , Palestine and beyond , always examining the roles of western governments in the conflicts .
More than anything now , he wants to conduct a sit - down televised interview with Tony Blair , if only he can persuade the former prime minister to go on camera .
" ITV would take that – Blair is somebody I do n't believe has ever been interviewed properly , " he says .
" I 've approached the people you are meant to approach and the silence is ear - splitting .
No surprise there . "
Later this month sees the release of a 16 - disc DVD box - set of Pilger 's work , spanning 37 years of film - making and 52 documentaries .
Though the documentary films were made for ITV , it is a series made for Channel 4 in 1983 he draws attention to .
The Outsiders was a series of conversations between Pilger and maverick individuals he admired , many of them journalistic heroes such as Wilfred Burchett of the Daily Express , whom he reveres for having landed " the scoop of the century " in exposing the effects of the atomic attack on Hiroshima .
" I have his wonderful front page , " he says , leading the way up to his office via a staircase decorated with framed photographs of his journalistic adventures , family and friends .
And there it is , Wilfred Burchett 's scoop from 5 September 1945 with the headline " The Atomic Plague " , the intro , " I write this as a warning to the world ... " and the byline " by Peter Burchett " .
" The sub got his name wrong .
Wilfred forgave him , " observes Pilger .
" The entire press corps of Japan were embedded and on the day he set out on this perilous journey to Hiroshima , Japan had just been defeated and foreign journalists were being shepherded to see General MacArthur receive a ritualistic sword of defeat .
Burchett said , ' To hell with that , that 's not the real story , ' and headed the other way . "
Burchett was demonised for his revelation that deaths at Hiroshima were caused by more than a bomb blast .
The New York Times ran a " No Radioactivity in Hiroshima " piece and Burchett was branded a crazy leftie .
The treatment echoes that meted out to Pilger following his 1970 film The Quiet Mutiny , which revealed rebellion in US military ranks during the Vietnam War .

That documentary , stemming from articles Pilger had produced for Hugh Cudlipp 's Daily Mirror , was denounced by the American government , which complained to the broadcasting authorities .
" I had no experience of anything like this , everything seemed to fall down around my shoulders and it was disturbing .
But the story that film told became the received wisdom all over the world within a year . "
To some in the modern media , Pilger is a figure from a bygone age , his name eliciting the sort of sighs of exasperation that until recently accompanied the notion of nationalisation .
But he is convinced that there remains an appetite for left - wing journalism .
" The influence of The Independent and Guardian are much greater than you would think .
I do n't believe the majority of people in Britain have the so - called values of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail and certainly not The Sun .
That does n’t mean to say they flock to read the Guardian and the Independent , clearly they do n’t .
But on occasion , these newspapers speak up and gesture towards people , or they pretend to .
Without them there would be an entirely closed media . ”
In the morning , he logs on to the Information Clearing House , a US - based website that provides a digest of left - of - centre journalism , highlighting the work of Noam Chomsky , Robert Fisk and Pilger himself .
Such sites ensure a large readership .
" The internet has changed so much .
In America alone , my New Statesman column reaches millions on the web . "
He returned briefly to the Mirror after the September 11 terrorist attacks , when Piers Morgan ( who he appears to respect ) was editing the paper .
" It was a very rewarding 18 months , " he says .
" I was happy to keep on writing for the Mirror , but Piers was under pressure from the management and American shareholders who objected to the kind of journalism that he was publishing , often written by me .
It was a myth that the readers did n't want a serious approach to journalism in a popular newspaper . "
When he speaks to journalism students , he is convinced " many start with the same passion I started with " and implores them to " keep your principles as you navigate the system " .
His watchword remains , ' Never believe anything until it 's officially denied , ' a favourite expression of reporter Claud Cockburn , father of Independent journalist Patrick Cockburn .
Pilger hopes that his last documentary , The War on Democracy , and his forthcoming one , will encourage colleagues to take a more critical view .
" If journalists can look behind the press - release version of events , or push back the screen of what is often propaganda but rarely recognised as such , " he says , " then we will produce true journalism , not a form of PR .
We ought to be the agents of people , not power . "

Just this morning , I published a new article at TechRepublic ’s IT Security Weblog .
I ’m basically the “ headliner ” there , a twice - a- week columnist of sorts pondering the imponderables of information security as they apply to professional computer geeks and the world at large .
In the terms used by the TechRepublic staff , I ’m the “ IT Security blog host ” .
If that ’s a topic of interest to you , you might want to swing by and see what I have to say .
Take note of the fact that though I ’m the “ host ” ( kind of a misnomer , but whatever ) , mine is far from the only name to appear in a byline .
Examine each article for its author before assuming I wrote it .
I maintain a mostly up to date list of IT Security articles I ’ve written for TechRepublic , if you ’re interested .
Anyway . . . this new article , How do you interview security experts ? , takes on the question of what sort of questions one should ask a candidate for a security focused job .
In addition to what I said there , however , I felt like offering the world a bonus example interview question here at SOB .
This question is n’t just for candidates for a security focused job , however .
This is basically for any IT job candidate at all .
Anyone with any degree of responsibility for the smooth operation of your IT infrastructure at all should have at least the most rudimentary understanding of computer security , and this question is something I would consider a must - ask for any IT job interview .
Unfortunately , the formula for this question kinda flies in the face of the advice I give in the article : it ’s the sort of question that has a “ right answer ” .
On the other hand , I would n’t just reject a candidate out of hand because ( s ) he gave a different answer .
As suggested in the article , if I get an answer that disagrees with what I expect as a “ right answer ” , I would explain the answer I expected and ask why the candidate ’s answer differed .
Without further ado , the question is :
What do you do if you discover your personal computer at home was compromised by malware or a malicious security cracker ?
The “ perfect answer ” is something like :
I ’ve never had to deal with that state of affairs on my own computer , but as I ’ve done when helping others , I would probably just make sure my backups were up to date , ensure there ’s no sign of infection or compromise in the backups , then nuke and pave the system , followed by restoring important data from backups .
There ’s just no way to be certain , once a system has been compromised , that there ’s no further infection or compromise after cleaning up the known problem .
The otherwise “ right answer ” would be much the same , but perhaps without having actually done the above when helping others , or with personal experience involving the candidate ’s own computer as an example of a compromised system in the past ( hopefully not often ) .
Other variants on this approach surely exist , such as restoring the system to a previous known good state from a disk image maintained on another computer that has not been compromised .
Keep an open mind for different ways of solving the same problem of uncertainty that the system can be cleaned up after infection ; a candidate ’s answer may not seem the same as yours at first blush , but may achieve exactly the same end result — or at least a security - conscious approximation .
For instance , I would n’t necessarily exclude a candidate for failing to keep regular backups , as long as ( s ) he knows that ’s a failure and mentions some reason that ( s ) he does n’t regularly back up the system that I could reasonably expect would not translate to similar failures on the job .
I knew an excellent accounting clerk who could n’t manage her own finances worth a damn , after all ; she knew exactly what she was doing wrong with her personal finances , and did n’t suffer the same failures professionally , which is sorta the point .
Assuming a wrong answer , like “ I ’d run some malware and rootkit cleaners to make sure the infection is gone , ” I ’d have to ask about why the answer was n’t what I expected — maybe with something like this :
I would have expected you to say you would wipe the system and reinstall , in case the infections or intrusions you detected were merely the tip of a mostly undetectable iceberg .
Do you think it is possible to be sure the computer is really clean of all security compromises ?
If the candidate is not being interviewed for a specifically security focused position , an answer like “ Oh , I had n’t thought of that .
Of course , now that you mention it , that ’s what I ’d do , ” might be acceptable .
This suggests not disagreement , but simply that the candidate had not had occasion to think the matter through completely , and is willing to change his or her approach when exposed to new information .
A candidate with a rigid and obstinately wrong approach is a bit more worrisome , on the other hand .
If a candidate ’s answer was something like “ Oh , I personally own licenses for a full suite of Symantec security and recovery tools .
I ’d be able to clean it up , no problem ! ” I ’d be tempted to say “ Thanks for your time , but I do n’t think you ’ll be a good fit for our organization , ” and show him or her to the door right then and there .
Depending on how desperate I was for candidates , I might give one more chance to correct the problem by prodding a little more , but at that point the candidate may become suspicious that ( s ) he is answering incorrectly and change the answer just to try to get the job without actually believing what ’s coming out of his or her mouth .
In this case , I would definitely focus more on the “ why ” of any further answers rather than the “ what ” , because that ’s the kind of answer that ’s more difficult to convincingly fake .

Oops… [ via CBSNews ]
Alaska Governor and Republican Vice President hopeful Sarah Palin may be facing another round of scrutiny , this time for charging the state for her children to travel with her while conducing official state business .
Bristol , Piper and Willow , Palin ’s daughters , accrued $ 32,629 in travel expenses while Palin ’s husband Todd raked up $ 22,174 – all billed to the state for a total of $ 54,803.00 .
“ The Governor ’s office has expended $ 54,803.00 in Alaska state dollars for family travel since December 2006 , ” according to the Governor ’s Administrative Services Director , Linda Perez .
“ The documentation related to family travel has changed and you have to keep in mind that the governor and her family are very popular , ” added Perez .
American Democracy : The 10 Alarm Fire We 're Ignoring
Mr. Shenkman , the author of the new book , Just How Stupid Are We? Facing the Truth About the American Voter ( Basic Books , June 2008 ) , is an associate professor of history at George Mason University and editor of the university 's History News Network .
What was I thinking when I decided to name my book : Just How Stupid Are We? Facing the Truth About the American Voter ?
I 'm starting to wonder .
Reviewers are finding the title easy to mock ( I knew they would ) .
And it 's led one or two to conclude I 'm the stupid one .
Still , I 'm convinced it was the right title .
First , I think book readers will understand that I am not talking about them , contrary to what one reviewer suggested ( no , I ’m not going to name this person ) .
I am talking about people who do n't think hard about politics not those who do .
Somebody buying my book is obviously interested in the subject and willing to explore it .
Second , the title was meant to be provocative but that 's all .
My purpose in going for this kind of title was to try to get a national debate going about a topic most of us would rather not talk about .
My goal was not to characterize the American people but our politics .
It would be stupid to say that the American people are stupid -- as stupid as saying the American people are smart .
It 's impossible to generalize - - and silly .
But our politics are often stupid .
And there are times when no other word , harsh as it is , seems to capture the essence of the turn politics have taken .
Over the last few months we 've had national debates about Barack Obama 's bowling score , Hillary Clinton 's knocking back a tumbler of Scotch , and John McCain 's non -stop smiling .
Earlier in the primary season there were stories about the candidates ' sex lives .
I read in the New York Times of all places that Elizabeth Edwards had popped a rib when she and her husband were copulating and that the wife of Rudy Giuliani referred to her husband as a " high testosterone " kind of guy .
( Of course , as the past publisher of the paper once cleverly remarked , it 's not sex when the New York Times does this kind of story , it 's sociology . )
What 's the harm ?
Years ago I would have thought stories like these merely part of the fun and frolic of an American campaign and nothing to worry about .
But maybe we should be worried .
These should be the side dishes of a campaign but in our era they have become the main course .
Superficiality is ubiquitous .
What convinced me that these kinds of stories are alarming evidence of a major problem ?
Our debates about 9/11 and Iraq .
As became irrefutably clear in scientific polls undertaken after 9/11 by the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) , millions of Americans simply cannot fathom the twists and turns that complicated debates take .
In January 2003 , three months before our invasion of Iraq , the survey - takers found that a majority of Americans falsely believed that “ Iraq played an important role in 9/11 . ”
Over the next year and a half PIPA polls indicated that a persistent 57 percent believed that Saddam Hussein was helping al Qaeda at the time we were attacked .
( Other polls came up with higher numbers .
For instance , in September 2003 a Washington Post poll found that 70 percent of Americans believed Saddam was personally involved in the 9/11 attacks . )
In the spring of 2004 the 9/11 Commission flatly stated that Saddam had not provided support to al Qaeda .
The Commission ’s findings received saturation coverage .
Nonetheless , in August of the same year , according to a PIPA poll , 50 percent were still insisting that Saddam had given “ substantial ” support to al Qaeda .
( A full two years later , in 2006 , a Zogby International poll indicated that 46 percent of Americans continued to believe that “ there is a link between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 terrorist attacks . ” )
The illusion that Saddam was behind 9/11 had real - world consequences .
A poll for Investor ’s Business Daily and the Christian Science Monitor cited by the PIPA researchers found that 80 percent of those who backed the Iraq War in 2003 said that a key reason for their support was their belief that Saddam had ties to al Qaeda .
Another clear indication of public ignorance concerned the claim that Saddam possessed “ weapons of mass destruction , ” which became such a ubiquitous part of the national conversation that the phrase soon became known by its initials : WMD .
Poll results show that the voters were quick to absorb the administration line , but only slowly came to realize that they had been snowed .
As late as the spring of 2004 a clear majority remained unaware that experts such as Hans Blix ( head of the UN weapons inspectors ) , David Kay ( the former head of the Iraq Survey Group ) , and Richard Clarke ( the national coordinator for counterterrorism ) had firmly concluded that Iraq lacked WMD at the time of our invasion , even though their findings had received wide publicity .
Finally , there was the question of world opinion .
By all measures the Iraq War was unpopular around the world .
On the eve of the war millions protested , bitterly denouncing George W. Bush and the United States .
In several countries these were the largest anti-American rallies ever held .
Opposition was strong even in countries that were traditional American allies , such as Spain .
Most Americans , however , did not comprehend the isolation of the United States .
According to PIPA , the majority either believed that world opinion was about evenly divided or actually favored the war ( 31 percent were in the second camp ) .
Only 35 percent realized that the planned invasion had drawn far more criticism than support .
Given all this , a robust debate about public opinion would seem warranted .
If Americans cannot think straight about events of the magnitude of 9/11 and the Iraq War , what can they think straight about ?
But no such debate has been forthcoming .
Instead , we have had endless arguments about the media and the nefariousness of the Bush administration .
Both of these arguments have merit , in my opinion .
But the real problem is with Americans .
Too many simply pay so little attention to politics that they are sitting ducks for manipulative politicians .
I acknowledge in the book that Americans are good at recognizing success and failure .
After several years of being bamboozled they finally came round to the view that the war was a mistake .
But while mistakes are inevitable we should be able to avoid the ones based on flagrant misinformation , as this one was .
The reason we were n't was because too many voters simply did n't take the time to investigate the administration 's claims .
The fact is politicians count on voters being stupid .
They play on peoples ' emotions , exploit their fears , and summon myths from the depths of the national culture to advance their hold on the voters ' hearts and minds .
Were the voters smarter the pols would play politics differently .
If politicians were angels we would n't need smart voters .
But they are n't .
So we do .
Are we worse off than in the past ?
We are .
Half a century ago voters were better prepared to take on the responsibilities of good citizens , this despite the fact that they were less well educated then than now .
( In 1940 six in ten Americans did n't get past the 8th grade .
Today most have spent some time in college . )
So what happened ?
Television is a big part of the explanation .
Once television replaced newspapers as the chief source of news – this happened around 1965 — shallowness was inescapable as Americans began judging politicians by how they looked and acted .
Another factor was the collapse of the traditional two - party system and unions .
Once voters stopped taking their cues from party and labor bosses they were largely on their own as they sorted through the complicated choices they face .
We need to talk about all this , even it 's uncomfortable doing so .
We cannot keep playing politics as we have and expect different results .

Here we are 10 months since the above comment .
The methods you describe were employed with ACORN , areas with more Dem. votes then there were registered voters in total .
The dying of a great many of the reliable , common sense , middle - American majority of an elder generation gave way to an even greater number of a huge wave of children of a generation of Bill Ayers - style " educational " system indoctrination .
I think that strong quiet core that remembered the days before superficiality , and which helped keep us all closer to the track , is pretty much gone .
You still hear claims that they will make themselves heard again but I think they are gone .
Of the remaining hope for undoing the current damage being done here , now , in April 2009 , I think we are left with a high number of them , unfortunately , being just who the " progressives " have always characterized them ALL to be : actually ignorant , uneducated , hillbilly types , many with real shades of racism , who often throw around labels and names they 've heard but do n't really understand .
Just the type that elicits ridicule and disdain from liberals , for sure , but increasingly from anybody left in the undecided or open - minded middle .
Joseph S Harrington - 8/3/2008
To suggest American politics is " stupid " misses an important point .
There are simply times when a people and its leaders choose to believe what they want to believe , and are conveniently ignorant of inconvenient realities .
The Germans of the first half of the 20th century were arguably the best educated , most knowledgeable nation the world had ever seen up to that time , and perhaps since .
But they tragically chose to embrace psuedo - scientific drivel in their politics .
It not that they lacked the aptitude to know better ( they learned quickly after 1945 ) , it 's just that the drivel served other needs for them .
Lumping Saddam with al Qaeda served the adminstration 's purposes of expanding the " war on terror " to eliminate a genuine nuisance and assert American control in an oil - rich region .
Many Americans knew this and agreed , but understood that an invasion needed a defensive rationale .
They most certainly were NOT stupid , although events would show that our course of action was unwise .

Or at least a word that is conspicuously missing from this analysis , is NATIONALISM .
The current administration knows that , while Americans may be stupid , they 're not stupid enough to think or act " unamerican . "
So , if they tell you something is a matter of national ______ ( blank could be filled with " security " ; " pride " ; or any other abstraction ) , then you 're bound by custom to agree ( and support ) or you face the frightening prospect of becoming an Unamerican .
It 's a lesson taken from the likes of Julius Caesar , Adolf Hitler , Josef Stalin , etc .
It works like a charm !

Maarja Krusten - 6/13/2008
You mention TV as a factor .
Of course , television has changed a great deal since 1965 .
Viewers once turned to NBC or CBS for nightly news ( and later , as ABC established a more robust news presence , to that network , as well ) .
Now we have niche TV .
Viewers who turn to MSNBC are unlikely also to tune in to the Fox News Channel .
And vice versa .
The same is true with the marketplace for books .
Those who have read Huffingtonpost blogger Stephen Ducat 's book , The Wimp Factor : Gender Gaps , Holy Wars , and the Politics of Anxious Masculinity are unlikely also to have read Ann Coulter 's book , Slander : Liberal Lies About the American Right .
I have n't read either , I 've just read about them and picked them out as representative of differing viewpoints from among several books of that nature .
My point is that with so many specialized outlets , there are fewer and fewer places where large groups of people come together either to get facts , analysis or opinion as they once did when they turned to CBS and Walter Cronkite for news and Eric Sevareid for analysis .
Lawrence Brooks Hughes - 6/13/2008
The Democrats have terrible trouble trying to register the underclass to vote in America 's big cities , partly because they read and write only with extreme difficulty .
And then , often , after liberals have registered such people , many or most will fail to show up at the polls on election day .
This goes on year after year followng one voter registration " drive " after another , in city after city .
Progress , if any , is terribly modest , despite immense amounts of time and money spent on it .
This is in no small part because such people are ashamed of their illiteracy and ignorance , and aware they suffer from both .
When given a slip and told to write their name and address they cannot read where it says " name " and " address , " and have to confess this to someone .
That is not fun .
It is mortifying .
How much more pleasant it is to just stay at home and not suffer embarrassment in public !
With a little luck , they can can recline on a couch and watch " The Dating Game , " instead .
With a beer !
And a mate .
And because they are illiteate , they are so woefully uninformed that their opinion en bloc really should not be elevated into an elections tie - breaker , anyway .
Also , their vote is often paid for ( with cash ) by ward heelers and other low life , who get the money from filthy rich liberals in quest of legislation to abet their very shady commercial activities .
Such voters quite often are in lock step with completely unethical demogogues , and we are probably much better off without their input in the process .
We are lucky , in fact , that the big city schools are so dreadful , and their unions so destructive , because what was once a fine public school system now fails miserably , with no hope of improvement .
Were this not the case many more of these ignoramuses would be voting like robots regularly , with Oz somewhere behind the curtain at the controls .
Maarja Krusten - 6/12/2008
Yes , that 's what I 've heard also , that you can take the test at different times and get different , reasonable results .
As you say , it 's regarded as a snapshot .
Jim Good - 6/12/2008
My understanding of Myers - Briggs is that it 's perfectly normal to get different outcomes at different points in life .
It 's intended as a snapshot of your current preferences rather than an indication of immutable personality traits .
R.R. Hamilton - 6/12/2008
Literacy tests are a solution .
You can't even see the problem :
" Half a century ago voters were better prepared to take on the responsibilities of good citizens ....
So what happened ?
Television is a big part of the explanation .
Once television replaced newspapers as the chief source of news – this happened around 1965 — shallowness was inescapable as Americans began judging politicians by how they looked and acted .
Another factor was the collapse of the traditional two - party system and unions .
Once voters stopped taking their cues from party and labor bosses they were largely on their own as they sorted through the complicated choices they face . "
In other words , " We used to have smarter citizens who voted as they were told .
We need to go back to that . "
We used to have smarter voters because we had literacy tests .
We used to make voting " difficult " :
In Texas , until we became " enlightened " , if one wanted to vote in the November election , he needed to register by January ( and pay the evil , racist , sexist , and homophobic $ 2 poll tax ) .
Maybe that 's why the voters were smarter .
Do you think the electorate got dumber by accident , by happenstance ?
Quo bono ?
It was in the interest of certain political ideologies to move dumber people into the electorate and to dumb down the smart people .
Yes , it is true that blacks and hispanics will score lower on voter literacy tests -- just as they will on any test of intelligence .
And whites will score lower than Asians .
That is no argument against literacy tests , especially when the point of the test is to educate voters .
The test could remain the same for many years : people could have multiple opportunities to pass .
The point of the test would not be to exclude but to educate .
I would suggest we could start with the Intercollegiate Studies Institute 's civic literacy test that was feature on this site .
It has 60 questions on American political science , history , and economics .
I made a perfect score , so it 's not that hard .
Why not use that test and say that voters need to answer at least , say , 35 of 60 correct -- and they can take the test , say , three times a year until they pass ?
I have a feeling though that those who propose a standard - free " educated voter " mean to teach the people what to think , not how to think :
" How many Republicans do we have in class today ? ...
Oh , well see , that 's the kind of ignorance we 're talking about . "
matt a townsend - 6/11/2008
The voting public obviously has a responsibility to be informed , but I find your using PIPA surveys quite ridiculous , and I 'll tell you why .
I was uniformed about the war as anyone until I got high - speed cable and started to consume alternative news sources .
Most Americans consume news on TV ( owned by huge corporations with conflicted interests ) , radio ( same conficts ) or local newspapers which can be a crapshoot .
Get this through your head .
THE PROBLEM IS CORPORATE OWNERSHIP AND CORPORATE CONSOLIDATION OF MEDIA !!!
I guarantee that if the Iraq war were to happen now , it would n't happen because more and more people get their news information from non-corporate sources .
The entire meme of your book sounds highly flawed and quite naive .
The American public has shown that when provided with the information , they make sound choices .
In the lead - up to the Iraq war they were n't given sound information , by both the political establishment ( I do n't think we have to go far to confirm that the WH mislead the public ) and the media ( Judith Miller , Michael Gordon of the NYT , Meet the Press , paid off military generals on the networks ) .
I think it 's pretty simple .
Independent and quality media outlets equal an informed Democracy and that does n't exist .
I found your appearance quite appalling .
Maarja Krusten - 6/11/2008 Interesting .
You may be right that of the people who read about Myers Briggs or communication ( Prof. Deborah Tannen 's books , etc. ) on their own , more are women than men .
But there are many professions and workplaces where men and women study these issues in order to be more effective managers .
I think that is most likely to occur in collaborative or team oriented workplaces morse si than ones which rely on a top down and very hierarchical approach .
The more you rely on the art of persuasion , the more it behooves you to understand how differently people process your presentations .
Foreign Affairs and People -- interesting combo .
But one that requires reading .

I 've taken the Briggs test twice and had a different personality both times .
Both rang true at the time .
Pardon my genralization but I think women are more interested in such tests because women are more interested in other people .
Speaking of women , voters and how to better inform would be voters , Yahoo has a scary poll up right now regarding future first ladies , sorry Bill .
61 % of American voters according to Rasmussen Reports are " somewhat influenced " and 22 % are " strongly influenced " in their voting by their feelings for the candidates spouses .
Over 70 % of female voters are influenced by the spouses .
Everything in America is sold through personality stories .
If we want voters to think and understand issues we have to connect issues to how they effect individuals and their families .
Foreign Affairs and People have to merge if we want voters to recognize the value of Iraqi lives and to save us from ourselves .
Maarja Krusten - 6/11/2008
Rick , you ’ve noted that the people who are interested in the issues you discuss in your book are less likely to be the sources of the problem you describe .
I think you tend to be right in saying that .
HNN ’s readers tend to be pretty well informed , although they do sometimes reject each others ' citations of certain news stories from certain outlets ( CNN , FNC , MSNBC ) depending on where they stand politically .
How do you reach the others ?
It seems to me that you need a multi- faceted solution that takes into account the large number of people who are not inclined to immerse themselves in lengthy articles and history books .
And who catch a few news headlines here and there ( by clicking through Internet sites or having a TV or radio playing in their house ) rather than sitting down with a newspaper or news magazine .
If you look at the factors I listed above , historians face challenges in reaching a wide audience because of the degree of diversity in personality types among the population .
If you look at the link I provided above , you ’ll see that “ Studies estimate that 75 % of the population is Extraverted , while only 25 % is Introverted . ”
That means 75 % ( the Extraverts ) “ are energized by having interactions with others , and may often speak without thinking something through .
They are people of action . ”
By contract , “ Introverts ( I ) prefer quiet reflection . ”
If , as I suspect , many historians are Introverts rather than Extraverts , they need to keep in mind that they represent a minority personality type in terms of Myers Briggs Type Indicators .
The other indicators do not show so large a split .
The Judging ( drawn to planned , structured situations ) and Perceiving ( drawn to open , unstructured situations ) split is said to be 55 - 45 .
The Thinking ( drawn to logic and objective analysis ) and Feeling ( drawn to doing things because it “ feels ” right ) split reportedly is the only one that shows a little bit of gender difference .
The Thinking to Feeling split reportedly is 60 - 40 for men and 40 - 60 for women .
These indicators show up in various combinations .
Based on my experiences , I suspect many -- but not all -- historians and lawyers ( male and female alike ) would be ISTJ .
Even among those who write on HNN you see differing temperaments among the historians , of course .
Not all are ISTJ , certainly .
But if most of the population is E , and many are P and many are F then an outreach effort that is effective for ISTJ types is n’t the best way to reach them .
You have to get inside the heads of people who sometimes look for information and process data somewhat differently than you do .
As I ’ve pointed out before , people have little leisure time .
Given some free time , I ’m inclined to sit down with a nice , long history book .
Or to surf the web and to read about current events .
That ’s a personal choice that fits my personality type .
Other people use their leisure time for different hobbies .
People decompress from work and chores in many different ways .
How do you reach so diverse a group ?

Maarja Krusten - 6/11/2008
You raise some interesting questions , Rick .
It 's hard to get a handle on this question because voters are so very different in how they approach this .
You see this here on HNN .
These differences do n't seem to be based on gender or level of education .
I 've seen some very well educated men at HNN who have expressed strong emotions in their postings .
At times this has been direct , at times it has come through in metamessags .
The same is true for some women , as well .
There are other posters who may only hold a B.A. but who articulate their points very effectively .
You have to think about the field in which someone has succeeded professionally , not just their gender or level of educaqiton .
Myers Briggs indicators help to explain why that is the case .
Lawyers , historians and people drawn to analytical fields often are ISTJ .
There 's a good explanation of what these terms mean at
http://www.counseling.mtu.edu/myers_briggs.html
The author of the article at the Michigan Tech site notes that a profile " may change over the years as your personal and professional circumstances change .
It 's probably better to think of your Myers - Briggs indicator type as a ' snapshot ' of your personality right now than as some kind of lifelong ' window on your soul ' " that is unchangeable . "
Given everything that goes into how people attain and absorb information , I do n't think the answer to the questions you raise can be found solely by looking at college education .
There are plenty of Americans who still work and support families without having attained college degrees , althouh that is harder and harder to do given the nature of the job market .
And then there is the fact that the voting population is split among three groups : there are strong adherents to the two major party with a group of unaffiliated Independents in between .
I know some people ( men and women alike ) who are single issue voters and who almost appear to screen out information related to other issues , as a result .
I know others who when elections come up , shake their heads over the difficulty of knowing whom to vote for .
For many reasons , there seems to be a great deal of variety in " the people . "
HNN - 6/10/2008
Fixing one problem - - ignorance -- by creating another - - divisive literacy tests that undoubtedly would exacerbate tensions between blacks , whites , and hispanics -- is not my idea of a serious solution .
I do n't want any part of it .

Shenkman 's argument is about changing American political culture .
In that vein , improving the country 's literacy is essential .

Without the power our country invests in the masses we would certainly have lost our proprerty rights and our gun rights and hence our liberty long ago .
Buckley was absolutely right when he said it would be better to be governed by the first 535 names in the Boston phone book than by the Harvard faculty .
The best thing to do is what we used to do : Imbue all children with a huge reverence for the Constitution and the Founders , whether they understand what was accomplished by them or not , and let them instinctively oppose all who would change the Constitution .
That fifth column has grown more numerous lately , especially in academia .
( How long has it been since you were told some part of the Constution is now " obsolete ? " )
Fortunately , the stupid hicks do n't buy that opinion , and if we 're lucky , they never will .
This nation has advanced extraordinarily well under its obsolete old charter , and continues to astonish the world in wealth creation and human progress .
It was probably a mistake to extend the franchise in 1920 , because this raised the importance of smiles , sex appeal , gossip , and other emotional nonsense in the results of our elections .
That we have survived that damage , after a fashion , testifies to just how ingenious the Constitution was before that harm was inflicted .

You are making the mistake of putting value in the " liberal education " that is trumped in so many colleges nowadays .
Fact of the matter is , while specialization does limit the breadth of a college student 's education and is in many aspects unfulfilling , is the best way to ensure that our college graduates are smart .
I remember one of my teachers introduced their " liberal " course as " information that is useless other than for cocktail parties . "
America stopped producing mechanics and scientists ; we import them now , usually from places that do have specialized education and constantly outscore us on standardized tests .
Sure , you can make the argument that countires like China do not have the most discerning and politically involved populace ( I would disagree with you , ) but there are other countries like Korea and Finland , which are democracies , which do specialize students , and which have the top scoring students on the exams .
However , you are right in that the problem lies deeper .
America does not encourage any specialization .
We do not have an adequate number of trained teaching professionals that have proven themselves by continuosly being examinated ( this is the standard MO of Finland , I believe . )
Once in a great while , the Oresident parades out in front of cameras and says some blurp about America needing more engineers and scientists , but nothing gets done .
Meanwhile , you turn on the TV and the most scientifically - inclined character is always the nerd or some other social misfit .
At the same time , our education problems are being solved by fiber optics cause both business and government can outsource the important scientific and engineering jobs out of the country since a physicist in India can probably contribute just as much as one trained in the US .
The most common advise I have heard is to get a job back in my home country working for a US - based multinational because , if I know the native language and customs , I can make more money than I ever could here .
Soon , the only intelligent jobs that will remain are doctors and lawyers .
Lawyers can claim that foreign knowledge is not up to par with their own , robotics has not developed far enough that we can outsource doctors ( doctors do claim the same thing as lawyers , which I find a little odd , ) and both have a good lobby .

" Are we worse off than in the past ?
We are .
Half a century ago voters were better prepared to take on the responsibilities of good citizens , this despite the fact that they were less well educated then than now .
( In 1940 six in ten Americans did n't get past the 8th grade .
Today most have spent some time in college . ) "
I hit on this issue in a comment on your blog some time back .
I do n't see how this sort of reasoning proves that Americans are better educated than they were in 1940 .
Most college educated Americans who are alive today went to colleges that had been corrupted , in my opinion , by a vocational model of higher education .
How does a degree in engineering , or any number of other disciplines , really prepare one to be a better citizen ?
Perhaps this raises a chicken or the egg sort of problem , but it seems to me education began going downhill before television had much of a cultural impact .
In fact , you can trace the trend toward narrow specialization back at least to the late - nineteenth - century .
That specialization has been materially beneficial , but it has also made us shallow and easily manipulated .
My broader point is that I think the problem has far deeper roots , and is thus more intractable , than you seem to admit .

And the sad truth is the majority of Americans will take the bait again if we 're attacked by terrorists before election day .
John McCain 's foreign policy is little different from W's but he 's a " war hero " and Americans will choose a tough guy to protect the empire from cave dwellers setting us back another decade .
Katie Couric interviewed Obama before Hillary conceded , she asked him three times how he " really " felt about her .
Yeesh .

Please excuse the quoting of a fictitious character but it seems apropos in honestly replying to Mr. Shenkman 's question .
We do live in a world fabricated by the media and media moguls .
“ Stupid is as stupid does ” so says Forrest Gump .
Yes , Americans are far more interested in American Idol ( only a short leap from Ted Mack 's Amateur Hour ) than they are in American Politics .
They ARE interested in American “ politicians ” , their sex lives , their drinking , drugs , their evil ways – not their fitness for service .
Yes , “ Stupid is as stupid does ” and television has reduced us all to that least common denominator – the lowest education , attention - span , interest level of all of us bespeaks who we really are and what we collectively think – or at least that is what the television tell us .
Debate .
What debate ?
Monitored verbal food fights orchestrated around advertisers time slots ?
Debate , indeed !
Okay let ’s place the challenge of “ debate ” at the doorstep of those who would have a meaningful chance at making a debate really important , HISTORIANS .
Go ahead all you eggheads at the pinnacle of academia – make my day !
Invite the candidates and the party leaders into the fray of intelligent and meaningful debate .
You have friends and contacts in the media to arrange such an offer to those who would have us elect them .
We the rabble , can only sit and watch as the circus of politicians ’ divorce trials , corruption trials , embezzlement trials and more unravel on the new age boob - tube .
Go ahead Historians and Academicians , invite those you critique and number by the Dewey Decimal System into the arena of intelligent and vigorous and meaningful debate .
Maarja Krusten - 6/9/2008
A search reveals that the New York Times reported on March 23 , 2007 that Elizabeth Edwards 's breast cancer had spread to her bones .
So you need to consider the fact that she discovered that terrible condition when she felt pain in her rib and had it checked out by a doctor .
According to the initial report in the NYT last March
" She said she had no symptoms except for a sore spot where a rib had cracked .
It was the painful rib , which broke either when she moved furniture or when Mr. Edwards later hugged her , that made her see a doctor and led to the discovery of the cancer recurrence .
The rib may have broken because it was weakened by cancer , but that is not clear .
The diagnosis was actually made from a biopsy taken from another rib . "
The citation Rick refers to came later , in a September 23 , 2007 NYT style writer 's article about celebrity culture and " too much information . "
The author referred to a July interview in Esquire in which a reporter asked John Edwards , " How did your break her rib with a hug ? "
Edwards first responded that " Maybe it was a little personal " but then said " It was a perfectly reasonable question . "
The NYT style writer did not mention cancer in his September article .
In my view , although this was a style writer , if he was going to write about the Esquire piece , he should have mentioned that Mr. and Mrs.
Edwards learned of the cancer when she went to the doctor to check out a cracked rib .
They then learned that her cancer had spread to her bones and was " incurable " but " treatable . "
Hey all ,
Im up to my old tricks again , making some neat things for you to tinker with !
This time Ive added to the Inspire wallpaper and added some stuff to make scaling easier .
What that means to us artists , is that our work stays at the correct aspect when displayed on widescreen or standard displays .
This is something that normal pixmap backgrounds obviously can not do , so we might as well use the tools we have !
Remember , this is only a demonstration of what can be done with these layers and parts .
There are a multitude of things to play with in edje .
Lets get started !
Firstly , fire up GIMP and create a new image at 800 x 600 .
( This resolution is only used for demo purposes ) I created 4 layers .
The base is the Blue galaxy swirl thing .
This will layer be stretched to fill all the space .
The next 2 are the corner graphics on their own separate layer .
The last layer on top is the E logo , but you could swap this for anything , or scrap it entirely .
Next , save each layer as a separate image .
This can be done by making the target layer the only visible one then saving and repeating the process .
You might be able to Save Layer As… in GIMP 2.6 , but I have n’t checked it out yet .
Once you have all the layers separated , open them again and resize them to save some space .
Things like E logo need to be in the dead centre of the image to centre correctly later .
Now comes the super fun code part !
Heres the .edc from Blast .
Its already commented so read on !
collections { group { name : " e/desktop/ background " ; // //
Lets make a wallpaper that will SCALE well !!!
Because not everyone // has the same screen aspect these days .
There are a couple ways to // get this to work .
In this exmaple it keeps the objects at all the // same sizes so that no scaling happens .
// //
All min and max sizes are taken from their respective image properties // images { //
Include all files from the XCF image : " Scaled.png " COMP ; image : " LeftBit.png " COMP ; image : " RightBit.png " COMP ; image : " ELogo.png " COMP ; } parts { part { name : " Scaled " ; description { state : " default " 0.0 ; image.normal : " Scaled.png " ; //
Make it fill all the space } } part { name : " LeftBit " ; description { state : " default " 0.0 ; align : 0.0 1.0 ; // Align left and at the bottom .
min : 334 314 ; //
Set the min size and ... max : 334 314 ; // max size so it wont scale .
image.normal : " LeftBit.png " ; } } part { name : " RightBit " ; description { state : " default " 0.0 ; align : 1.0 0.0 ; // Align Right and at the top .
min : 260 284 ; //
Set the min size and ... max : 260 284 ; // max size so it wont scale .
image.normal : " RightBit.png " ; } } part { name : " ELogo " ; description { state : " default " 0.0 ; min : 165 224 ; //
The absence of an align : will max : 165 224 ; // make the image centred .
image.normal : " ELogo.png " ; } } } } }
Next you need to compile it up using ‘ edje_cc blast.edc ’ then import the picture from the Wallpaper selector .
You should have a well scaled wallpaper that preserves your efforts for all screen sizes .
Here are some links to the wallpaper at a few different sizes for comparison .

Imagine a world without chemotherapy .
Imagine a world where cancer could be fought without side effects .
Imagine a world where it did n’t matter how far along your cancer had progressed , treatment could still be rendered and completely effective .
The New England Journal of Medicine recently published an article from a joint collaboration between several cancer centers on both the east and west coast .
A 52 year - old man with stage IV malignant melanoma , a very aggressive and potentially lethal form of skin cancer , donated blood to the scientists who have developed a technique to isolate specific CD4 +
T cells and clone them in vitro .
In our bodies , our immune system is responsible for attacking all cells that may pose a threat to our well - being , whether they be bacteria , viruses , foreign bodies , or even cancerous cells .
Each T cell is responsible for recognizing a specific cell line which is potentially threatening , then targeting ( where the “ T ” comes from ) those cells for destruction by the production of antibodies , and large vacuum cleaner - type cells called macrophages .
The trouble with cancer is that the cells are multiplying very rapidly , and there are only a few circulating T cells which are specific to that cancerous cell line .
Therefore the cancerous cells overwhelm our ability to tag them fast enough , and the cancer grows and spreads .
What the scientists in this study have done is isolate the T cells which are targeted towards the malignant melanoma .
Then they used a chemical and biological process to multiply those T cells several thousands of times over .
Finally , they injected those thousands of T cells back into the patient , and let them go to work .
Now there were so many T cells compared to cancerous cells , that tagging them was easy and the body was naturally able to break down the cancer using its own immune system .
The man went into complete remission and has stayed there for the past two years .
The beauty and elegance of this new technique is that scientists are augmenting our body ’s inherent ability to fight cancer .
Because the patient was injected with his own T cells , there was no threat of rejection , and no side effects whatsoever .
Additionally , by unleashing the patient ’s immune system he was able to attack cancer cells wherever they were in his body , rather than just the primary site .
It does n’t matter if the cancer is multiplying in the lungs , in the brain , on skin , or in lymph nodes .
As long as there is a blood supply , the body is able to fight back and win .
This technology is still a long way off from being implemented in the mainstream , but it definitely holds promise as a new tool in the fight against cancer .

In one of the stories yesterday about Palin ’s hiring of a lawyer — which we now find out she ’s having the state of Alaska pay for — I noted that her new counsel , Thomas Van Flein , asked the lead investigator in the case to turn over all witness statements and documents produced so far in the probe .
That struck me not as a good - faith request but rather an effort to get into a fight over process and thus gum up the investigation until after the election .
And sure enough , today ’s Anchorage Daily News provides plenty of evidence that that is what ’s happening in spades .
Though to this point Palin has said she would cooperate fully with the investigation , Van Flein is now challenging the standing of the entire inquiry .
He claims that any investigation should be handled not by the legislature but by the state Personnel Board which , conveniently , is made up of the governor ’s appointees .
Van Flein is also charging that the state senator charged with overseeing the investigation is on a partisan witch - hunt .
“ Our concern is that Hollis French turns into Ken Starr and uses public money to pursue a political vendetta rather than truly pursue an honest inquiry into an alleged ethics issue , ” Van Flein told the ADN .
To which French rather persuasively responded that the charge of partisanship rang at least a little hollow since the investigation was instigated and authorized by a committee dominated by Republicans ( though it ’s only fair to note that Palin is not beloved by all Republicans in the state ) .
And finally that deposition that the investigator is trying to arrange with Gov. Palin ?
Seems she may be too busy running for vice president to make time for that .
From the ADN …
Branchflower [ the lead investigator ] has n’t been able to set up an interview with Palin .
French said the state will fly Branchflower to wherever Palin is on the campaign trail if needed .
“ Clearly the governor ’s new political role will make it more challenging for her to make time for this investigation , ” French wrote .
But Palin needs to be interviewed sometime in September , he said .
Van Flein said the investigation is “ bad timing ” in the middle of a presidential campaign .
He said he could n’t guarantee her availability this month .
If witnesses are n’t available , French wrote , he ’ll ask the Senate Judiciary Committee , which he chairs , to issue subpoenas .
Buckle up .
War architect said to be considering Iraqi oil deal RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday July 29 , 2008
Print This Email This A neoconservative architect of President Bush 's Iraq occupation could be preparing to personally reap the spoils of war , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Documents suggest that Richard Perle , top aide to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , has been in talks with government officials and its Washington envoy , and Turkish AG Group International , over a plan to drill for oil near the Kurdish city of Erbil .
Perle is also in talks with the oil - rich nation of Kazakhstan , whose ruler , Nursultan Nazarbayev , has been involved in a US oil bribery investigation .
" Mr. Perle has publicly lauded President Nazarbayev as a ' visionary and wise , ' " the Journal added .
Perle worked in the Reagan administration as assistant Secretary of Defense and held a seat on the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee from 1987 to 2004 , also serving as its chairman from 2001 to 2003 under Bush .
He is a member of such think tanks as Project for the New American Century , the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs and the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research .
Perle , as a member of PNAC , had called on President Clinton to overthrow Saddam Hussein as a signatory on a January 1998 letter alongside such names as Donald Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney , Gary Bauer , Dan Quayle and William Kristol .
Perle also linked Hussein to Osama bin Laden during a CNN interview on September 16 , 2001 , shortly after the World Trade Center towers were attacked .
Endeavour International , based in Houston , would administer the drilling and exploration of the " K18 concession , " estimated to hold at least 150 million barrels of oil .
The State Department recently said that it was investigating deals brokered between the Kurds and other American energy companies , such as Dallas - based Hunt Oil Company , " infuriating " the Iraqi government , which called such deals " illegal attempts " to circumvent Baghdad 's authority as the Iraqi government works to pass a national oil law .
Documents suggest , however , that the State Department did not object to such deals .
Virginia Governor and top election officials are being sued by the NAACP and the Advancement Project for failing to allocate resources at polling places for expected record turn out .
Local officials are expecting between 80 % to 85 % of voters to turn out to vote compared to 67 % to 71 % in the last election .
The polling place resource problem is particularly acute in the cities of Richmond , Norfolk , and Virginia Beach .
In particular , election officials in Richmond , Norfolk , and Virginia Beach have adopted resource allocation plans that unconstitutionally and otherwise unlawfully under - or mis-allocate polling place resources , including , specifically , voting machines and poll workers , in a manner that infringes and burdens the rights of the voters in these cities and that disfranchises voters in these locales , including , particularly , African - American voters in Richmond and Virginia Beach .
“ The Commonwealth is under - resourced for this election this will lead to long lines that will disenfranchise voters who cannot wait , particularly in communities of color , ” continued Browne - Dianis .
“ It boggles the mind why officials would stubbornly refused to prepare for the increased turnout that could potentially result in a meltdown on Election Day . ”
In the suit , it states that they are not distributing the voting machines and poll workers fairly .
Advancement Project ’s research in Virginia showed :
In many jurisdictions , voting machines , privacy booths , and poll workers have either been mis-allocated or are simply insufficient to accommodate all those who may turn out to vote on November 4 , 2008 .
This will likely result in extremely long lines at the polls and “ lost ” voters unless these problems are addressed beforehand .
In some of the jurisdictions the allocation of polling place resources is likely to have a disproportionate impact on communities of color .
In other words , there will be fewer voting machines or poll workers per voter in high minority precincts than in low minority precincts .
In some jurisdictions , the location of polling places has a disproportionate impact on certain communities , including communities of color .
In essence , voters from these communities have to travel greater distances to even have an opportunity to vote .
Bottomline , the Governor and other election officials ’ are basically violating the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States of Constitution , Section Two of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Virginia Constitution .
LONDON , Oct. 31 ( UPI ) --
Boys born to light drinkers get higher - than - average vocabulary scores and girls are less likely to have emotional problems , a university study suggests .
The University College London study of some 12,500 3 - year - olds also found boys born to mothers who had one or two drinks a week were 40 percent less likely to have conduct problems and 30 percent less likely to be hyperactive , even when the differences between social and economic circumstances were taken into account .

They also were better able to identify shapes , colors , letters and numbers , the study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found .
Girls born to light drinkers were 30 percent less likely to have emotional and peer problems , compared with babies whose mothers abstained from alcohol , the study found .
" The reasons behind these findings might in part be because light drinkers tend to be more socially advantaged than abstainers , rather than being due to the physical benefits of low - level alcohol consumption , " lead researcher Yvonne Kelly said .
" However , it may also be that light - drinking mothers tend to be more relaxed themselves and this contributes to better behavioral and cognitive outcomes in their children , " she said .
While research shows heavy drinking can seriously damage babies , scientists have little evidence proving light drinking causes harm , Britain 's Guardian reported .
But British Chief Medical Officer Liam Donaldson said his advice to pregnant women remains , " avoid drinking alcohol . "

It took a multimillion dollar lawsuit , two years of tense negotiations , and an awful lot of scanning .
But yesterday the publishing world stood on the threshold of a digital era after a US deal paved the way to transform publishing .
The agreement between Google and the US book industry means that internet users will soon be able to choose from and buy millions of titles , many out of print , or read them on a page - by - page basis .
The service invites comparison to the iTunes revolution , and was hailed by the internet search giant , the American Association of Publishers , and the Authors ' Guild as a key moment in the evolution of electronic publishing .
Google 's co-founder , Sergey Brin , called the $ 125 m deal a " great leap " .
Paul Aiken , executive director of the guild , called it " the biggest book deal in US publishing history " .
Once approved by a federal court in Manhattan , the deal will offer access to a library of millions of titles .
After searching for books via Google , users will be offered free samples of chosen titles , with the option to buy more .
Although it is as yet unclear how much books will cost to download , a royalty organisation , the Book Rights Registry , will take payments from Google ( after it has taken a 37 % cut ) and distribute them to the authors and publishers .
" This historic settlement is a win for everyone , " said Richard Sarnoff , chairman of the publishers association .
" It 's hard work writing a book , and even harder work getting paid for it , " said Roy Blount , president of the guild .
" This deal makes good sense . "
The agreement mirrors the way that Apple 's iTunes music store helped revolutionise the record industry when launched in 2003 .
Although the Google scheme will start in the US , Google 's chief legal officer , David Drummond , said that it was working with rights holders , governments and organisations in other countries .
To start with , the scheme will be targeted at universities and organisations which will pay large institutional subscriptions on behalf of students and researchers .
But the deal also enables ordinary customers to download any of the 7 m books already scanned into Google 's database .
UK publishers hoped the deal will be replicated .
Simon & Schuster UK 's chief executive , Ian Chapman , said : " It 's a significant agreement , but also has substance for the longer term - it 's ground - breaking . "
Mark Le Fanu , of the Society of Authors , said : " What is so positive is that it recognises that authors and publishers must be involved when works in copyright are digitised and made available to the public , and usage must be paid for , while at the same time it promises to make the practicalities easily manageable for users . "
At The Bookseller , Neill Denny said the deal was good news , as it put more books in front of more people , and access ultimately created demand .
" It 's the long tail argument writ large , and I 'm not only talking about books but also book content .
If you want to read one chapter from an obscure textbook about Serbo - Croatian poetry in the 1920s , there might be five books on the subject , but 10 with chapters on the topic .
This opens up the route to what you might describe as granulisation of book content ... tailored books .
And for publishers it 's a new revenue stream . "
The deal , subject to court approval , ends a lawsuit by authors and publishers against Google Book Search after it began scanning US books still in copyright .
Backstory
Google began scanning and uploading books four years ago .
However , unlike other countries where it scanned books fallen out of copyright , in America it scanned books that were simply out of print and made them available through its search engine - enraging publishers and authors .
Three years ago , the Authors Guild , the Association of American Publishers and others filed a class action lawsuit against Google Book Search .
As part of the agreement Google will compensate them at a minimum of $ 60 ( £ 37 ) per work , costing it up to $ 90 m of the $ 125 m deal .
McCain goes after another Biden slip
Biden yesterday said that everyone making less than $ 150,000 would get a tax cut under Obama -- a number lower than the campaign promise , if likely a slip of the tongue -- and McCain 's jumping on it today :
" You getting an idea of what ’s on their mind .
A little sneak peek .
It 's interesting how their definition of rich has a way of creeping down , " he said .
Biden spokesman David Wade did n't directly respond to a question about Biden 's line , but reiteated the promise that no family making more than $ 250,000 will see a tax hike and accused McCain of " lying about Obama 's tax plan . "
UPDATE : Wade says it was an example , not a slip .
And First Read has more detail on who'd get what under Obama 's plan .
In an interview today , UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohammed ElBaradei said that Iran would be lacking key components for the production of a nuclear weapon even if they chose to do so .
According to ElBaradei “ they do not have even the nuclear material , the raw unenriched uranium to develop one nuclear weapon if they decide to do so . ”
The IAEA chief ’s assessments are in stark contrast to accusations and bellicose rhetoric regarding the ultimate goal and progress of Iran ’s nuclear program .
The European Union has accused Iran of “ methodically pursuing a program aimed at acquiring the nuclear bomb . ”
Permanent members of the UN Security Council met today to discuss further sanctions against the Iranians , but failed once again to reach an agreement .
The primary concern cited is Iran ’s enrichment of uranium for its civilian nuclear power plant , presently being constructed by Russia .
The IAEA has certified that Iran is not diverting any of its nuclear material to a weapons program , and they are only enriching to the level needed for energy production , insufficient to produce nuclear weapons at any rate .
Iran suggested earlier this month it would reconsider its enrichment program in return for international supply guarantees .
The IAEA has also been charged with investigating other allegations related to a “ stolen laptop ” acquired by the United States several years ago from militant Iranian opposition group the Mujahideen al - Khalq .
Iran has refused the IAEA access to certain facilities , insisting the documents are obvious forgeries and the investigation would require them to disclose information about their conventional military arsenal .
Penicillium chrysogenum is used in the commercial production of antibiotics Dutch researchers have decoded the DNA sequence of the fungus which produces penicillin .
It is hoped that uncovering the genome of Penicillium chrysogenum will boost the development of new antibiotics to overcome problems of resistance .
The findings come just in time for the 80th anniversary of the discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming .
Full details of the 13,500 - gene sequence will be published in Nature Biotechnology in October .
Penicillium chrysogenum is used in the production of antibiotics such as amoxicillin , ampicillin , cephalexin and cefadroxil .
If we understand the genome we might be able to manipulate the genes
Professor Hugh Pennington
Its use in killing bacteria was discovered in 1928 after mould spores accidentally contaminated a petri dish in a laboratory .
Further work discovered it was safe for use in humans .
About one billion people are thought take penicillin every year around the world .
But antibiotic resistance is becoming an increasingly serious problem , as for example has been shown with MRSA .
UK experts have repeatedly cautioned against overuse of antibiotics and warned there is an urgent need for industry to develop new drugs .
Surprises Researchers said in addition to combating resistance , the genome sequence may also help to improve the manufacturing of antibiotics .
Dr Roel Bovenberg , a researcher at DSM Anti-Infectives , the biotechnology company behind the genome sequencing , said the four - year project had thrown up " several surprises " which they were investigating further in collaboration with academics .
" It provides insight into what genes encode for , know - how in terms of manufacturing and new compounds to be identified and tested .
" There are genes and gene families we did not think would be involved in biosynthesis of penicillins - they were n't on our radar so that is our follow - up work . "
Professor Hugh Pennington , an expert in bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen , said the genome sequence might well lead to the development of new antibiotics .
" If we understand the genome we might be able to manipulate the genes . "
He said traditionally antibiotics had been found just from looking at what fungi produce , but in recent years scientists had been trying to modify existing treatments .
" All the easy targets have been hit by one drug or another so it 's proving very difficult to find new compounds and we 're going to need some lateral thinking .
" If the genome helps to do antibiotic development quicker , then that can only be a good thing . "

What are these ?
For lunch in her modest apartment , Madeline Nelson tossed a salad made with shaved carrots and lettuce she dug out of a Whole Foods dumpster .
She flavored the dressing with miso powder she found in a trash bag on a curb in Chinatown .
She baked bread made with yeast plucked from the garbage of a Middle Eastern grocery store .
Nelson is a former corporate executive who can afford to dine at four - star restaurants .
But she prefers turning garbage into gourmet meals without spending a cent .
On this afternoon , she thawed a slab of pate that she found three days before its expiration date in a dumpster outside a health food store .
She made buttery chicken soup from another health food store ’s hot buffet leftovers , which she salvaged before they were tossed into the garbage .
Nelson , 51 , once earned a six - figure income as director of communications at Barnes and Noble .
Tired of representing a multimillion dollar company , she quit in 2005 and became a “ freegan ” -- the word combining “ vegan ” and “ free ” -- a growing subculture of people who have reduced their spending habits and live off consumer waste .
Though many of its pioneers are vegans , people who neither eat nor use any animal - based products , the concept has caught on with Nelson and other meat - eaters who do not want to depend on businesses that they believe waste resources , harm the environment or allow unfair labor practices .
“ We ’re doing something that is really socially unacceptable , ” Nelson said .
“ Not everyone is going to do it , but we hope it leads people to push their own limits and quit spending . ”
Nelson used to spend more than $ 100,000 a year for her food , clothes , books , transportation and a mortgage on a two - bedroom co-op in Greenwich Village .
Now , she lives off savings , volunteers instead of works , and forages for groceries .
She garnishes her salad with tangy weeds picked from neighbors ’ yards .
She freezes bagels and soup from the trash to make them last longer .
She sold her co-op and bought a one - bedroom apartment in Flatbush , Brooklyn , about an hour from Manhattan by bike .
Her annual expenditures now total about $ 25,000 .
“ I used to have 40 work blouses , ” said Nelson , sipping hot tea with mint leaves and stevia , a sweet plant she picked from a community garden .
She shook her head in shame .
“ Forty tops , just for work . ”
Freeganism was born out of environmental justice and anti-globalization movements dating to the 1980s .
The concept was inspired in part by groups like “ Food Not Bombs , ” an international organization that feeds the homeless with surplus food that ’s often donated by businesses .
Freegans are often college - educated people from middle - class families .
Adam Weissman , whose New York group Freegan .
info has been around for about four years , lives with his father , a pediatrician , and mother , a teacher .
The 29 - year - old is unemployed by choice , taking care of his elderly grandparents daily and working odd jobs when he needs to .
The rest of his time is spent furthering the freegan cause , he said , which is “ about opting out of capitalism in any way that we can . ”
Freegans troll curbsides for discarded clothes and ratty or broken furniture , which they repair to furnish their homes .
They trade goods at flea markets .
Some live as squatters in abandoned buildings , or in low - rent apartments on the edges of the city , or with family and friends .
In recent years , Internet sites like Meetup.com have posted announcements for trash tours in Seattle , Houston and Los Angeles and throughout England .
Some teach people how to dumpster - dive for food , increasing the movement ’s popularity .
At least 14,000 have taken the trash tour for groceries over the last two years in New York .
Another site , Freegankitchen.com , offers lessons for cooking meals from food found in dumpsters , such as spaghetti squash salad .
Though recycling clothes and furniture does n’t strike most people as unusual , combing through heaps of trash for food can be unthinkable to many .
One recent night , Weissman and Nelson led a trash tour through New York for about 40 experienced and first - time diggers , including college students , a high school teacher , a taxi driver and a former investment banker .
One veteran handed out plastic gloves .
An employee at D’Agostino ’s supermarket in Midtown Manhattan had carried out the garbage minutes earlier .
The clear plastic bags lining the gum - stained sidewalk bulged with bruised peaches , discolored eggplants , day - old poppy seed bagels and imitation crabmeat .
Careful not to rip the bags and risk angering store managers by creating a mess , some unknotted the ties and sifted through the garbage with bare hands .
The bittersweet scent of cilantro , bananas and bread drifted into the air .
Two women who worked next door at a nail salon came outside and stared .
A few first - time tour - takers stood away from the group , looking self - conscious .
“ We encourage people who have never opened a bag before , just try it , ” Nelson told the group .
“ Go ahead . ”
A few began filling backpacks and plastic bags with food that looked fresh enough to eat : heads of lettuce , tubs of party dip , baby arugula salad mix , avocados , shiny red and green apples , corn on the cob -- mere scraps in the estimated 50 million pounds of food that New York throws away each year , including at least 20 million pounds that go to the poor .
“ Whoa , someone found the soy milk ! ” said Cindy Rosin , 31 , a freelance graphics designer .
“ Good find . ”
One person pulled a bag of Purina dog chow from the pile .
Another found a bunch of grapes .
Two men in dark dress slacks , button down shirts and shiny shoes approached the trash tourists .
“ Pardon me , what is this ? ” one asked .
“ Vegetable justice ? ”
“ It ’s over - consumerism , ” said Gracie Janove , 19 , an anthropology student with a crescent moon pendant hanging around her neck .
Janove , who participated in her first dumpster dive during a trip to France , frequently searches the trash of New York bakeries for pastries and the garbage of grocery stores for fruit .
The two men walked away , laughing .
D’Agostino ’s , Trader Joe ’s and Whole Foods -- freegans ’ most popular dumpster diving sites -- donate edible food to agencies that prepare it for the poor , according to their spokespeople .
But freegans and food experts say a large amount of edible food still gets thrown away .
Smaller businesses do n’t always have agreements with food banks , they say , or they have not taken time to donate .
“ We have found canned goods , completely wrapped pastas , ” said Nelson , who recently salvaged piles of parsley , lettuce , onions and a potted plant from a Whole Foods ’ garbage .
Sometimes grocery stores do n’t sell food because there was an error in the processing , and though the product may be edible , it is the wrong color or shape , said Beth Osborne Daponte , a senior research scholar at the Yale University Institution for Social and Policy Studies who served on the Hunger in America 2006 task force .
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that Americans create 245 million tons of waste a years , about 12 % of it food .
Much of the food that stores throw out is still edible at the time of its expiration date .
“ We should n’t be wasting as much as we do , ” Daponte said .
But , she added , “ to go dumpster diving , you also have to be willing to take the risk .
Some of the food might be great .
Some might be contaminated . ”
Supermarket officials say food found in their trash should not be eaten .
“ Food items are disposed of because they are inedible or not otherwise safe to donate , ” said Ashley Hawkins , a spokeswoman for Whole Foods .
The store ’s guidelines about what is edible , Weissman said , may be unrealistic , adding that at home , people would n’t throw away a banana with a few brown spots .
As Nelson and Weissman helped guide the scavengers to their next stop on the trash tour , a D’Agostino ’s employee brought out a big bag of doughy , plump , sweet - smelling bagels .
The experienced freegans glanced at the bag and kept walking .
Instead they led the group across the street to Daniel ’s Bagels , voted one of the best bagel shops in New York by one online site .
“ We ’re picky freegans , ” said Deirdre Rennert , who would not reveal her place of work because of the stigma attached to living off dumpster groceries .
She once took home a salmon carcass from D’Agostino ’s trash and made ceviche , and admitted she was somewhat surprised she did not get sick .
Daniel ’s had closed at 9 p.m. and its storefront was lined with black trash bags .
The group sniffed and squeezed the bags .
They opened the ones that felt soft and smelled of bread fresh from the oven .
They discovered pounds of bagels : onion , pumpernickel , cinnamon raisin , sesame , sourdough .
“ Usually you will find a bag that has got the coffee remains with the bagels , ” Rosin told the diggers .
“ If they are nice , they will separate them . ”
Nelson scooped up two bags of bagels to freeze for later .
A few doors down , on the outdoor patio of a swanky restaurant , people sipped glasses of wine over half - eaten platters of pasta and salad , mostly ignoring the trash diggers , waiting for busboys to take away their leftover food .
Since she upended her lifestyle , Nelson has learned how much she can live without .
She still buys toilet paper and food for her two cats .
She has n’t bought clothes in three years .
Nor has she set foot in a supermarket to purchase eggs , vegetables , fruit , bread or coffee .
Sitting in her hardwood - floor apartment furnished mostly with remnants of her former life -- a sofa with slightly torn fabric , an elaborate collection of books -- she wore a plain T - shirt and faded dark jeans cut off below the knee .
The place is decorated with a few items she found in the trash : a chair , CD rack , rug and headboard in her bedroom .
Her cupboards were full of food she did not pay for : cake mix , turkey gravy , curry mix , sweet rice .
The freezer contained oatmeal bread , lime and cucumber sorbet , tomato basil soup and bagels .
Everything was retrieved from the trash .
“ Just because it ’s two or three days past its pull date , it ’s not like it ’s Cinderella ’s coach and it ’s going to turn into a pumpkin at midnight , ” she said .
Last year , Nelson asked her family if she could make Thanksgiving dinner out of foraged food .
They found the idea odd at first , but agreed , and ended up enjoying an elaborate feast .
Nelson used to love browsing department stores or buying new books or shoes .
Now she finds satisfaction recovering 20 rosemary - seasoned roasted chickens from a dumpster outside of the Gourmet Garage , or sharing conversation over a lunch made from garbage .
She has never been happier .
erika.hayasaki@latimes.com
She has , however , saved on stockings .
With each remaining day as precious to the McCain campaign as a newborn fawn , the recent distractions coming from Sarah Palin ca n’t be helpful .
The maverick governor apologized yesterday for her remark about the “ pro-America ” parts of the country .
Then she gave a dubious answer to a third - grader ’s question about the role of the vice - president in the United States government .
Meanwhile , an AP investigation found that she charged the Alaska government for her kids ’ travel expenses , and a new NBC / WSJ poll shows that Palin ’s qualifications are voters ’
No. 1 concern about voting for McCain .
And that was all before Politico revealed that the RNC has spent $ 150,000 on Palin ’s wardrobe since late August , the kind of spending spree that does n’t mesh with the candidate ’s image as a regular hockey mom , nor the campaign ’s appeals to middle - class Joe the Plumbers .
• Marc Ambinder says that “ Democrats are going to have a lot more fun with this than is prudent , but the heat for this story will come from Republicans who cannot understand how their party would do something this stupid … during the collapse of the financial system and the probable beginning of a recession . ”
The wardrobe price tag is “ without precedent , ” and one can tell by the campaign ’s “ weakly defensive response ” that they ’re “ deeply embarrassed . ” [ Atlantic ]
• Steve Benen thinks the “ political implications are more than a little humiliating ” considering “ all the McCain campaign messages a story like this steps on — ‘ elitist , ’ ‘ small - town values , ’ ‘ big spender , ’ ‘ relating to “ real ” America , ’ etc. ” [ Political Animal / Washington Monthly ]
• Christopher Orr concurs that many “ Joe the Plumbers , Tito the Builders , Phil the Bricklayers , etc. … may be less than thrilled to hear that the RNC has apparently spent $ 150,000 clothing and accessorizing La Palin . ”
Though on the bright side , “ John McCain ’s $ 520 Ferragamos now sound like the shoes of a pauper . ” [ Plank / New Republic ]
• Matthew Yglesias says John Edwards ’s $ 400 haircut , over which there was such a huge kerfuffle , looks “ like a rounding error compared to Palin ’s September hair and makeup expenses . ”
It ’s also surprising that this type of expenditure is legal , though apparently it is .
[ Think Progress ]
• Chuck Todd and friends believe the story “ could further add to the perception that Palin is n’t a serious candidate . ”
And Andrea Mitchell wonders whether Palin is “ permitted to accept these kinds of gifts under Alaska ethics laws . ” [ First Read / MSNBC ]
• Jake Tapper wonders whether Palin realizes that even if she donates the clothes to charity , as her campaign claims , she still has to pay taxes on “ those fancy new duds just as if someone had written her a check for $ 150,000 . ” [ Political Punch / ABC News ]
• Amanda Carpenter understands that “ Palin needs to look good and probably did n’t have a closet full of prime time suits in stock before she got picked , ” but thinks this is “ extravagant . ”
She also wonders how much Hillary Clinton spent in comparison .
[ Town Hall ]
• Ezra Klein writes that being a governor , Palin presumably had clothing that “ was appropriate for giving political speeches and attending campaign meetings . ”
Even assuming she needed some new things , “ $ 150,000 of other people ’s money ” is too much .
[ American Prospect ]
• Michael Tomasky calls the expenditures “ both ghastly and hilarious , ” and says it ’s “ way beyond my comprehension ” how a woman “ running for public office and giving speeches about how she ’s just a regular Joe / Joan who understands what regular families go through ” can accept “ $ 3,500 jackets . ”
The tangible effect is that this will “ demoralize Republicans . ” [ Guardian UK ]
• Sam Stein writes that the timing is awful :
As the “ Republican ticket is trying to highlight its connection to the working class , ” it ’s revealed that Palin “ received more valuable clothes in one month than the average American household spends on clothes in 80 years . ”
[ HuffPo ]
• Alex Koppelman says “ the optics of this are n’t great for the McCain campaign or for Palin , especially given the country ’s economic woes and the work the campaign has done to portray Palin and her family as salt - of - the - earth middle - class types . ” [ War Room / Salon ]
• Emily Bazelon contends that , “ In a sense , this is unfair , ” because any wealthy candidate would already have the nice clothes that Palin needed to buy .
Plus , “ Is n’t her image a legitimate campaign expense ? ”
However , “ the price tag is just much [ too ] high , too many teacher and nurse and firefighter salaries , ” and it also “ points out exactly how much Palin is trading on her sexuality , her winks , her look . ” [ XX Factor / Slate ]

The Fab@Home project is an attempt to get open source and hobbyist hardware hackers involved in the development of what could prove to be one of the most disruptive technologies the modern world has ever seen .
Specifically , it ’s an open specs project for developing desktop 3D printers , or ( as the Fab@Home project labels them ) “ fabbers ” .
The specs for it are there for all the world to see at the main Website ( a wiki , natch ) , and the Fab@Home firmware is being developed under the BSD license .
What ?
Windows Only ?
Oddly , the firmware ( written in C++ ) is currently only compatible with 32 - bit Microsoft Windows platforms .
This strikes me as a nearly criminal oversight .
Considering the licensing , among other matters , it should be compatible with BSD Unix systems as well — or at least with some form of open source ( probably Unix - like ) OS .
Considering this fact has prompted me to renew my motivation to refamiliarize myself with C in the near future , and from there try to achieve some kind of competence in C ++.
We need to get this stuff working with BSD Unix , dammit .
Of course , “ near future ” is a relative term .
Disruptive Tech
I call this thing a disruptive technology because it can have some really significant effects on simple product manufacturing industries .
For the most extreme examples of the kind of change in the ground rules I ’ve seen that is a step on the road to universal assemblers even as small as a desktop 3D printer like this , check out Cory Doctorow ’s novella After the Siege , included in his collection of short stories , Overclocked : Stories of the Future Present .
Damn , that sentence ran on for a bit .
In fact , depending on how quickly lobbyists get in on the action , how thoroughly Congress can regulate home fabrication technologies , and how innovative and / or oppressive enforcement gets , low cost desktop 3D printers and similar fabricators like these might actually lead to what some would call a minor economic singularity event , disrupting not only a specific industry or related set of industries , but having far - reaching implications across a wide range of industries that might shake up the entire structure of dominant Western economies .
Consider , for instance , the manner in which people have tended to conflate concepts of property ownership and “ intellectual property ” control in recent years .
People have been so socially programmed by the propaganda of strong copyright advocates over the years that they really do n’t seem to be capable of recognizing any significant difference in principle between “ intellectual property ” and actual property .
Ubiquitous desktop 3D printers , nearly as common as desktop computers at home , could very easily disabuse a lot of people of such notions of equivalency .
Ironically , it would be the introduction of easy device - copying technology analogous to digital data copying technology — the bugbear of strong copyright advocates such as the RIAA — that would serve as the spotlight on the absurdity of treating “ intellectual property ” like property .
Once it becomes increasingly obvious that the product of the intellect as it applies to things like chairs and coffee mugs is a CAD specification that can be used to “ print ” an object with your desktop fabricator , the notion that the lyrics of a song are the same in proprietary terms as a chair or coffee mug ( and thus subject to property laws under the concept of “ intellectual property ” ) becomes inescapably absurd .
While this may not have any immediate legal or economic repercussions , it would certainly undermine a lot of assumptions about “ intellectual property ” , and perhaps pave the way for a much more rapid collapse of the already weakening copyright regime .
Regime Change
The economic consequences of a technology like this could range anywhere from almost unnoticeable over any short period of time to immediately dramatic and widely felt .
The way things progress , and the short - term effects of a technology as potentially disruptive as this , depends on how people react to it — of course .
Legislation may in fact stand in the way of widespread adoption , and a simple lack of ability across much of the population to grasp the value of something like this may slow development and adoption to an excruciatingly slow crawl .
It ’s even possible nobody who has n’t already “ gotten ” it will notice the implications for something like this in the matter of so - called “ intellectual property ” .
At the other extreme , this could just gut huge segments of traditional manufacturing industries , accelerate the collapse of copyright , and generally undermine a lot of the corporate centralization of economic power in Western markets , to say nothing of drastically reducing dependence on cheap manufacturing labor in Asian and Indian subcontinent markets .
It could do serious harm to major corporate retail chains like Wal - Mart , undermine the arguments of industry advocacy organizations such as the RIAA in the minds of the general public , and greatly reduce dependency in “ disadvantaged ” people on government handouts .
It could also give rise to whole new markets and business models .
Imagine , for instance , object printing templates that result in simple household objects with company names and logos on them as advertising .
Think of the possibilities for bringing “ shareware ” distribution models from software into the realm of physical products — you can download plans and print out a low - quality object to try out , then decide to go buy the real thing once you ’ve decided it ’s worth your money .
All the carrying on in some circles about “ new media ” vs. “ old media ” , and how the democratization of publishing via the Internet is shaking up the industries of traditional print publishers , could turn out to be nothing compared with the shaking up of industries for traditional manufacture of cheap , simple , throw - away objects .
Significant swaths of Western corporate dominated industries could be wiped away , directly or indirectly , by a disruptive technology like this — and replaced by wholly new business models predicated upon the possibilities that arise in place of those traditional business models .
. . . and time , energy , and brainpower can all be freed up to pursue the next major advance .
Or Not
Maybe these technologies will arrive with a whimper instead of a bang ( or worse , get suppressed entirely for home use ) .
It depends on us — narrowly , “ us ” the technically inclined who can help usher in new technologies like this , make them usable by basically anyone , cheap , high quality , and widely distributed ; broadly , “ us ” the potential user base , who must have the imagination to see the possibilities , the willingness to adjust to a new way of doing things and accept the benefits thereof , and the will to demand that people in positions of power with a strong stake in maintaining the manufacturing scarcity of the status quo get the hell out of the way of progress .
Hopefully we — both sets of “ us ” — do n’t let them stand in the way .
Sometimes , change hurts , but that does n’t mean it is n’t good for us .
Shauna Newell : Sex Slaves in the Suburbs ( Video )
, a teenage girl who was sold as a sex slave , is telling her story in " Sex Slaves in the Suburbs , " in hopes of preventing other teens from falling prey to human traffickers .
Shauna , now 18 , was kidnapped , drugged , gang raped , beaten and sold into sex slavery at age 16 when a new friend she had met in high school asked her to come to a sleepover .
Shauna 's mother , Lisa Brant , met the girl and her father because she wanted to make sure her daughter was safe .
The girl 's " father " was actually a convicted felon , and the girl , an accomplice in the abduction , had a history of prostitution .
Newell recounts her ordeal in an in - depth report with Today 's Natalie Morales on " Sex Slaves in the Suburbs . "
“ Her dad took us to this house and said he'd be right back and he left us there , ” Newell recounted in a taped interview .
“ And I asked for some water because I was thirsty .
And I drank the water and I blacked out . ”
Shauna woke up while being raped .
“ My legs were being held down , and the guy that was raping me was holding my hands back , ” she said in a quiet voice .
“ I kept screaming , ‘ Stop , please do n't do this .
Leave me alone . ’
But I was so weak , I could n't fight them off .
Like I was , I was so really out of it .
And I blacked out a few times and I kept coming back to .
And I was still being raped every time I woke up . ”
In a stroke of luck Shauna was rescued , although barely alive , after three days of being raped , beaten and drugged .
Shockingly , no one was ever prosecuted in the case , and unfortunately Newell 's story is not unique .
Merideth Vierra 's interview with Shauna Newell and her mother can be seen in the video below .
The in - depth report by Morales on “ Sex Slaves in the Suburbs ” premieres at 10 p.m. ET Sunday , Oct. 12 on MSNBC .
Reciprocating saws are the thugs of the demolition world , with powerful motors and strong blades that slice through wood , PVC and metal .
But they 're unwieldy brutes , requiring two hands and lots of space to cut safely .
Milwaukee 's scrappy little Hackzall , however , is easy to command with a single hand and maneuver in tight spaces .
Its 12 - volt motor drives the blade at 3,000 strokes per minute — nearly as fast as a full - size saw , so it can do about as much damage .
Failed bank chiefs to face sanctions : Sarkozy Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday October 4 , 2008
Print This Email This PARIS ( AFP ) -
The leaders of Britain , France , Germany and Italy vowed at an emergency summit Saturday to help European banks and financial institutions in trouble but also to sanction the heads of failed banks , President Nicolas Sarkozy said .
The quartet also issued a joint call for a Group of Eight industrial powers summit " as soon as possible " to review rules governing financial markets , Sarkozy told a press conference .
Sarkozy said the four countries would intervene to help commercial institutions in trouble , but there would be no bailout fund and authorities would penalise executives and shareholders under the terms of rescue packages .
" We have agreed to make a solemn engagement as heads of state and government to support banking and financial institutions faced with the crisis , " he said .
" In the case of a public support to a bank in distress , each member state present here has decided that those executives who failed will be sanctioned and the shareholders bear the weight of the intervention , " Sarkozy said .
Sarkozy said that bonus structures for top executives should be " revisted in order to avoid incentivising the taking of excessive risk and to fight against what we can call ' short - termism ' . "
And they agreed to show flexibility when applying strict European state aid rules -- as has been the case in Britain , where Brown 's government waived through a proposed merger deal between Lloyds - TSB and HBOS .
He called for a " task force uniting regulators , central banks and ministers " to take charge of monitoring the coordinated response .
The group met to seek a coordinated response to the credit crunch , which has drained liquidity from banks and stock markets and undermined flagging growth rates .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spelled out that European states must " take their responsibilities at a national level " for the banking crisis , while being careful not to harm other European states .
Jean - Claude Juncker , Luxembourg premier and eurozone group head , said Saturday after a mini-summit of European economic powers that the stability pact laying down regulations for economies which use the euro must be " respected " despite the international financial crisis .

A dismal economy coupled with mounting federal debt and expected cuts to science and technology spending threaten to unseat the United States as the reigning superpower of the world .
Many people around the globe already thought the mantle had been passed , perhaps to China , though that possibility is hotly debated .
Now signs of changing times are more stark , with world leaders frustrated and even angry over a global financial crisis many see as caused by American policy mistakes .
Meanwhile the monetary meltdown is likely to force cuts in public and private science and technology investment — a cornerstone of the American economic engine that has historically driven the nation 's preeminence .
While opinions on the ultimate outcome run the full spectrum of possibilities , many see a new world order , of some sort , in the making .
" The general perception of the United States as the key base of the world economy is shaken badly right now , " said Alan Porter , emeritus professor of the School of Public Policy at the Georgia Tech .
" That will spiral into foreigners being less inclined to put their money into our government and companies .
And that will lead to less investment and production . "
Porter and others also do n't see how military spending can continue at such a high level .
" Military might depends upon economic wherewithal , " Porter told LiveScience .
" We are so stretched now , that this is certainly slipping . "
Yale University sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein has been predicting the end of America 's global dominance since the 1980s .
This week he told the Christian Science Monitor that fallout from the Iraq war and the mounting U.S. debt had accelerated the country 's decline , and the current global crisis is just a culmination of these events .
Superpower ingredients
America 's superpower status depends on many factors .
It was achieved through dominance in military , economic , political , intellectual , technological and cultural realms .
Some experts have been saying in recent years that power could shift to those nations with huge emerging economies .
In a survey released in June , the Pew Research Center reported that citizens in many countries think the shift has already occurred :
" Most of those surveyed in Germany , Spain , France , Britain and Australia think China either has already replaced the U.S. [ as the superpower ] or will do so in the future , " according to the report .
But historians and other analysts told LiveScience in August , during the Olympics , that such a change had not yet taken place , and many doubted that it would anytime soon .
The current global financial crisis has created an all - bets - are - off feel , however , leaving some seasoned observers to ponder big changes that could emerge when the dust settles .
One unavoidable observation is that money , which equals power to a large degree , is vaporizing faster than you can say " $ 700 billion . "
Anne -Marie Slaughter , Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University , says the perception that New York is the financial capital of the world a false one — and now she 's not the only one thinking that way .
" Shanghai is booming , and Hong Kong is booming , and Singapore is booming .
London was already growing enormously , " Slaughter said this week in an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations .
She said neither New York nor any other single city will dominate the financial scene moving forward .
Others are more blunt .
" The USA will lose its superpower status in the global financial system , " Germany 's Social - Democrat Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said recently .
" The world financial system is becoming multi-polar . "
Perceptions rule
One big question the next president of the United States will have to deal with is how the nation 's money problems play out in military , political and cultural realms .
And when it comes to power , perceptions are important , too .
The German magazine Der Spiegel summed up a growing European sentiment in a commentary last week :
" The banking crisis in the United States has shaken many things in recent days , not just the chancellor 's [ Angela Merkel ] affection for America and the respect the rest of the world once had for the U.S. as an economic and political superpower .
...
Now , of all times , the world is faced with a preeminent power that no longer seems capable of leading and a U.S. president who is not even able to unite his divided country in an hour of need . "
The situation will only worsen , Carnegie Endowment Visiting Scholar David Rothkopf wrote Sunday in The Washington Post : " Already this crisis has seen not just our enemies but even some of our closest allies wondering whether we are at the beginning of the end of both American - style capitalism and of American supremacy . "
Superpower status is not just about having money and military might , but persuading much of the world to emulate or at least admire your political and financial systems , among others .
That less - tangible aspect to power is eroding , too , as citizens and politicians around the world question how the unique American mix of democracy , capitalism and deregulated finance are now playing out .
" Whatever the final outcome , one thing is certain , " says Eswar Prasad , a senior fellow for Global Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution , a think - tank in Washington , D.C. " The rest of the world will no longer be enthusiastic about adopting the free - market principles that guided U.S. financial development . "
Silver lining ?
Some believe an underlying base of money , willpower and American ingenuity , along with a rebounding economy , will eventually put America back on top .
And , they ask , who would fill the vacuum anyway ?
China is among the most - cited answers .
Like many nations now facing recession , China may stumble in the current crisis , analysts predict .
But assuming the global economic engine eventually gets going again , China 's prospects for long - term growth are bright .
Its economy will surpass that of the United States by 2035 and be twice its size of the U.S. economy by mid-century , predicts Albert Keidel of the Carnegie Endowment .
For now , China 's gross domestic product — the value of goods and services it produces annually — is about $ 7 trillion , second place to the United States ( $ 13.8 trillion ) .
Many experts think China 's current growth can't be sustained and so Keidel 's estimates may be too optimistic .
At any rate , before the current crisis began , the United States was No. 1 in the Geneva - based World Economic Forum 's global competitiveness index , which ranks 134 countries on 12 criteria including quality of education , labor and product market flexibility , along with infrastructure and financial market sophistication .
Switzerland , Denmark , Sweden and Singapore round out the top five .
China is 30th .
" Once the global economy emerges from the current financial crisis , which it will , the countries that do well on our index are those that are best prepared to bounce back and perform well in the longer term , " WEF spokesperson Jennifer Blanke told the Financial Times this week .
Science matters
Porter , the Georgia Tech researcher , is not so optimistic .
" Long term , I think prospects also get shakier , " he said .
" We are the world ’s science and technology leader .
Graduate students want to come here to study , and often to then work .
This has been slipping as industrializing countries enhance their own R&D [ research and development ] capabilities and universities , and as terrorism fears make it harder to come here .
I would anticipate that the next U.S. administration will have to face the reality of balancing its budget or face bankruptcy .
That will likely squeeze federal R&D funding , worsening these trends . "
It wo n't be just U.S. researchers that suffer , of course .
There could be " very dramatic reduction in available funds for research in all sorts of countries , " said Richard Leakey , a paleoanthropologist who has unearthed important fossils of ancient humans in Africa .
Leakey notes that a lot of science funding comes from institutions and donations by wealthy individuals , two sources that are dealing with their own reduced balance sheets .
" I think it 's extremely worrying for science , " he said .
Many analysts see global power becoming more diffuse .
China and India will play significant roles because of the sheer sizes of their populations and the ongoing modernization of their economies .
Less - often cited potential powerhouses like Brazil , which recently determined it has loads of untapped oil in offshore deposits ( the Associated Press this week said the country will be an " oil superpower " ) will become more prominent on the increasingly shared world stage .
" Clearly , lots of other countries count in ways that they did not before , " said Robert Lieber , professor of government at Georgetown University .
In the Christian Science Monitor article , Lieber otherwise restated his view that America 's role as superpower will not end anytime soon , owing to military superiority , economic productivity that will recover , and " a capacity for reinvention . "
At the very least , the current financial squeeze — if it continues — is likely to alter how the United States deals with the world .
To finance and effectively fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the United Sates will need more help , figures Slaughter , the dean at Princeton 's Wilson School .
" Overall , it 's going to force us to work with partners , which is what we should be doing anyway , " Slaughter said .
The Triumph of Ignorance
Why morons succeed in US politics .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 28th October 2008
How was it allowed to happen ?
How did politics in the US come to be dominated by people who make a virtue out of ignorance ?
Was it charity that has permitted mankind ’s closest living relative to spend two terms as president ?
How did Sarah Palin , Dan Quayle and other such gibbering numbskulls get to where they are ?
How could Republican rallies in 2008 be drowned out by screaming ignoramuses insisting that Barack Obama is a Muslim and a terrorist ?
( 1)
Like most people on this side of the Atlantic I have spent my adult life mystified by American politics .
The US has the world ’s best universities and attracts the world ’s finest minds .
It dominates discoveries in science and medicine .
Its wealth and power depend on the application of knowledge .
Yet , uniquely among the developed nations ( with the possible exception of Australia ) , learning is a grave political disadvantage .
There have been exceptions over the past century : Franklin Roosevelt , Kennedy and Clinton tempered their intellectualism with the common touch and survived ; but Adlai Stevenson , Al Gore and John Kerry were successfully tarred by their opponents as members of a cerebral elite ( as if this were not a qualification for the presidency ) .
Perhaps the defining moment in the collapse of intelligent politics was Ronald Reagan ’s response to Jimmy Carter during the 1980 presidential debate .
Carter – stumbling a little , using long words – carefully enumerated the benefits of national health insurance .
Reagan smiled and said “ there you go again ” ( 2 ) .
His own health programme would have appalled most Americans , had he explained it as carefully as Carter had done , but he had found a formula for avoiding tough political issues and making his opponents look like wonks .
It was n’t always like this .
The founding fathers of the republic – men like Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , John Adams and Alexander Hamilton – were among the greatest thinkers of their age .
They felt no need to make a secret of it .
How did the project they launched degenerate into George W Bush and Sarah Palin ?
On one level this is easy to answer .
Ignorant politicians are elected by ignorant people .
US education , like the US health system , is notorious for its failures .
In the most powerful nation on earth , one adult in five believes the sun revolves around the earth ; only 26 % accept that evolution takes place by means of natural selection ; two - thirds of young adults are unable to find Iraq on a map ; two - thirds of US voters cannot name the three branches of government ; the maths skills of 15 year - olds in the US are ranked 24th out of the 29 countries of the OECD ( 3 ) .
But this merely extends the mystery : how did so many US citizens become so dumb , and so suspicious of intelligence ?
Susan Jacoby ’s book The Age of American Unreason provides the fullest explanation I have read so far .
She shows that the degradation of US politics results from a series of interlocking tragedies .
One theme is both familiar and clear : religion – in particular fundamentalist religion – makes you stupid .
The US is the only rich country in which Christian fundamentalism is vast and growing .
Jacoby shows that there was once a certain logic to its anti-rationalism .
During the first few decades after the publication of The Origin of Species , for example , Americans had good reason to reject the theory of natural selection and to treat public intellectuals with suspicion .
From the beginning , Darwin ’s theory was mixed up in the US with the brutal philosophy – now known as Social Darwinism – of the British writer Herbert Spencer .
Spencer ’s doctrine , promoted in the popular press with the help of funding from Andrew Carnegie , John D. Rockefeller and Thomas Edison , suggested that millionaires stood at the top of a scala natura established by evolution .
By preventing unfit people from being weeded out , government intervention weakened the nation .
Gross economic inequalities were both justifiable and necessary ( 4 ) .
Darwinism , in other words , became indistinguishable to the public from the most bestial form of laissez - faire economics .
Many Christians responded with revulsion .
It is profoundly ironic that the doctrine rejected a century ago by such prominent fundamentalists as William Jennings Bryan is now central to the economic thinking of the Christian right .
Modern fundamentalists reject the science of Darwinian evolution and accept the pseudoscience of Social Darwinism .
But there were other , more powerful , reasons for the intellectual isolation of the fundamentalists .
The US is peculiar in devolving the control of education to local authorities .
Teaching in the southern states was dominated by the views of an ignorant aristocracy of planters , and a great educational gulf opened up .
“ In the South ” , Jacoby writes , “ what can only be described as an intellectual blockade was imposed in order to keep out any ideas that might threaten the social order . ” ( 5 )
The Southern Baptist Convention , now the biggest Protestant denomination in the US , was to slavery and segregation what the Dutch Reformed Church was to apartheid in South Africa .
It has done more than any other force to keep the South stupid .
In the 1960s it tried to stave off desegregation by establishing a system of private Christian schools and universities .
A student can now progress from kindergarten to a higher degree without any exposure to secular teaching .
Southern Baptist beliefs pass intact through the public school system as well .
A survey by researchers at the University of Texas in 1998 found that one in four of the state ’s public school biology teachers believed that humans and dinosaurs lived on earth at the same time ( 6 ) .
This tragedy has been assisted by the American fetishisation of self - education .
Though he greatly regretted his lack of formal teaching , Abraham Lincoln ’s career is repeatedly cited as evidence that good education , provided by the state , is unnecessary : all that is required to succeed is determination and rugged individualism .
This might have served people well when genuine self - education movements , like the one built around the Little Blue Books in the first half of the 20th century , were in vogue .
In the age of infotainment it is a recipe for confusion .
Besides fundamentalist religion , perhaps the most potent reason why intellectuals struggle in elections is that intellectualism has been equated with subversion .
The brief flirtation of some thinkers with communism a long time ago has been used to create an impression in the public mind that all intellectuals are communists .
Almost every day men like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly rage against the “ liberal elites ” destroying America .
The spectre of pointy - headed alien subversives was crucial to the election of Reagan and Bush .
A genuine intellectual elite – like the neocons ( some of them former communists ) surrounding Bush – has managed to pitch the political conflict as a battle between ordinary Americans and an over - educated pinko establishment .
Any attempt to challenge the ideas of the rightwing elite has been successfully branded as elitism .
Obama has a good deal to offer America , but none of this will come to an end if he wins .
Until the great failures of the US education system are reversed or religious fundamentalism withers there will be political opportunities for people , like Bush and Palin , who flaunt their ignorance .

Medical marijuana patients are routinely discriminated against in medical settings .
Even in medical marijuana states , patients are denied transplants because they are considered " drug abusers . "
All across the country , medical marijuana patients face problems in obtaining traditional pain treatment , especially because of " pain contracts " used by doctors who either do n't understand or believe in medical marijuana or who fear the heavy hand of federal law enforcement , or both .
Now , in West Virginia , one patient is fighting back .
Putnam County resident Ronald Sprouse filed a lawsuit September 3 against a doctor and health center , claiming they refused to prescribe him pain medications and dismissed him as a patient after he tested positive for marijuana on June 13 .
Sprouse is suing the Family Care Health Center , officer manager Janice Amburgey , and Dr. Larry Beker for refusing to treat him because he uses marijuana medicinally .
In his complaint , Sprouse admitted he smokes marijuana and said he does so to relieve the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder .
" In addition , the Plaintiff asserts that many medications have been used in the past to attempt to treat his disorder without success , " the complaint said .
" Only the use of marijuana has proven effective to control the Plaintiff 's disorder . "
Without marijuana , Sprouse wrote , he becomes violent toward his family and is reluctant to leave his home for fear of how he will react to others .
" Unless properly medicated the Plaintiff cannot sleep , has night sweats , and bouts of deep depression , " the suit said
Sprouse admitted signing a pain contract , or pain management agreement that says : " Unannounced urine or serum toxicology screens may be requested , and your cooperation is required .
Presence of unauthorized substances ( legal or illegal ) will result in discharge from the practice . "
But Sprouse argued that the clause is invalid , first because Family Care did not provide him with a list of what it considered unauthorized substances .
" Without such a list the Plaintiff had no way of knowing what Family Care considered to be legal or illegal unauthorized substances , " the suit said .
He may have better luck with his second argument against the pain contract .
He signed the contract under coercion , he argued , because he had to to obtain treatment .
" In this case the Plaintiff was forced to sign the Pain Management Agreement or live a life in constant pain with no medication , " his complaint said .
Sprouse also argued that he violated the agreement out of medical necessity , not malfeasance .
" Family Care was not authorized to prescribe the medication needed to alleviate his serious medical condition , not is any medical professional in the state of West Virginia , " the complaint states .
" In order to preserve his health , mental stability , and the safety of his family and others , the Plaintiff was forced to medicate himself . "
As a remedy , Sprouse is seeking a judgment against the center that would order it to continue treating him and bar it from placing any negative comments in his medical file that would inhibit other doctors or practices from prescribing him medication .
He is also seeking court costs .
Sprouse has requested a jury trial .
He is representing himself .

Stanley Miller 's first experiments turned the mixture red
There 's a new spark of life in iconic experiments first done in the 1950s , on the kind of primordial " soup " that may have predated life itself on Earth .
Ageing vials of chemicals have been discovered in a Californian lab , surviving samples from the legendary experiments performed by chemist Stanley Miller .
They hold evidence that life may have born violently , in erupting volcanoes in the midst of a thunderstorm .
Miller was just 22 years old and studying for his PhD when he carried out his original , groundbreaking experiments ( under his University of Chicago mentor , Harold Urey ) .
He wanted to test the current ideas for the origin of life , by striking electric sparks in a mixture of gases thought to resemble the atmosphere of the young Earth .
When his analysis of the products in the experiments revealed traces of the building blocks of life , amino acids ( which combine to make proteins ) , Stanley Miller became an instant celebrity - though the 1950s newspapers were overstating the case when they claimed he had actually recreated life in the lab .
Each one of those volcanoes could have been a little , local prebiotic factory
Jeffrey Bada , University of California , San Diego When Stanley Miller died in May last year , his former student , Jeffrey Bada , inherited his materials ; including , it turns out , several boxes containing vials of dried samples from those 1950s experiments , and the accompanying notebooks .
" We started going through some of the stuff that was piled up in the corner , and here were several little cardboard boxes , taped shut and all dusty , carefully labelled with all of these little vials with dried material from his experiments , " Professor Bada , of the University of California , San Diego , told the BBC .
The old samples were subjected to state - of - the - art techniques
Miller 's well - known experiments first done in 1952 used water along with methane , ammonia and hydrogen , the kinds of gases then thought to have dominated the Earth 's oxygen - free atmosphere more than two billion years ago .
His sparks turned the mixture red , then yellow - brown , and made a number of amino acids , including glycine and alanine , commonly found in proteins .
Is this how life 's chemistry got going ?
But soon after , Miller had revised those experiments by injecting hot steam into the gas mixture , so that conditions resembled those you might find in an erupting volcano .
These experiments were the ones that intrigued Jeffrey Bada .
Because not long after Miller 's original experiments , it became clear the Earth 's early atmosphere was nothing like the " reducing " mixture simulated in his apparatus .
The first experiments remained iconic in their attempt at simulating pre-biotic chemistry , but became irrelevant in detail .
But conditions locally in volcanoes , says Professor Bada , might not have been so different .
The trouble was , Miller published only the sketchiest of details of those tests , and the apparatus was lost .
It had looked like a dead end , until those dusty boxes turned up with their 200 vials .
" We started sorting through these , and lo and behold , we found a whole collection , almost a complete collection , of the extract samples from the volcanic experiments .
And so we just went at it , using the state - of - the - art techniques we have today and analysed these samples .
" We found not only did these make more of certain amino acids than in the classic experiment , but they made a greater diversity of amino acids . "
Miller , using the old methods , had found five amino acids ; Jeffrey Bada and his teams tracked down 22 .
What is more , the overall chemical yields were often higher than in the first set of experiments - the mixture appeared to be more fertile .
Professor Bada points out that today , almost all volcanic eruptions are accompanied by violent electric storms .
The same could have been true on the young Earth .
" What we suggest is that volcanoes belched out gases just like the ones Stanley had used , and were immediately subjected to intense volcanic lightning .
" And so each one of those volcanoes could have been a little , local prebiotic factory .
And so all of that went into making the material that we refer to as the prebiotic soup . "
That material could then have been washed down the flanks of volcanoes into pools or coastal bays , where the building blocks of life might have kick - started evolution .
Jeffrey Bada and colleagues report their latest work in the journal Science .

What are these ?
In praise of Shoulda macros
Shoulda contexts let you to share setup code between different tests .
This is for me one of Shoulda ’s most attractive features .
When you combine this with the technique of defining your own macros to encapsulate assertions or setups that come up often , you end up with seriously DRY and readable tests .
I see a few different kinds of Shoulda macros :
Assertion macros
Assertions macros often begin with should_ .
They encapsulate one or a few assertions .
For ActiveRecord models :
should_require_attributes :name , :phone_number
They may even accept a block and do assertions on its execution , like should_raise :
should_raise ( LoadError , : message => / vespene / ) do require " more vespene gas " end
To learn more about assertion macros , you can take a look at Shoulda macros allows you to embrace your inner slacker by Josh Nichols .
Inner slacker ?
I ’m right there !
Setup macros
This kind of macro encapsulates a setup that comes up often in your test suite .
One inspired by Restful Authentication ’s login_as helper method could be used like this :
logged_in_as :mat do # Shoulda tests end
These kinds of macros accept a block that defines more Shoulda tests , rather than a block of code testing your app per se .
Turnkey macros
Turnkey macros are beefed up assertion macros .
The main difference is their extent .
They contain many contexts and a lot of should blocks .
They usually accept substantial options hashes or are configured with a setup block .
Like should_be_restful in the following example , inspired by the Shoulda documentation :
logged_in_as : stranger do should_be_restful do |resource | resource.create.params = { : subject => " test " , : body => " message " } resource.denied.actions = [ : edit , :update , : destroy ] resource.denied.redirect = " login_url " resource .
denied .flash = / only the owner can / i end end
Two Shoulda best practices around setup macros
This article is specifically about setup macros .
Here ’s the implementation of a pretty generic Shoulda macro I could define in my test_helper * .
This is an implementation of the macro I mentioned at the beginning :
# Sets the current person in the session from the person fixtures .
def self.logged_in_as( person , &block ) context " logged in as #{person} " do setup do @request.session [ : person ] = people ( person ) .id end yield end end
Which can then be used like this in any controller test :
logged_in_as : mat do # tests for users end logged_in_as : admin do # tests for admin end
Setup macros have a very subtle catch , however .
Here ’s a modified version of the first example above :
logged_in_as :mat do setup do @request.session[:last_login ] = Time.now end #
Some tests end
The setup block you see here is never going to be executed .
Why ?
If we were to replace the logged_in_as macro by the actual code it contains , here ’s what it would look like :
context " logged in as #{person} " do setup do @request.session [ : person ] = people ( person ) .id end setup do @request.session[:last_login ] = Time.now end #
Some tests end
Does that make sense ?
Not so sure .
Shoulda does n’t like to have multiple setup blocks for a given context .
That part does make sense .
Best practice # 1 : Always describe the situation with a context .
You should always describe the situation in which your test takes place ( what your setup is doing ) with a context .
logged_in_as : mat do context " with last login set to now " do setup do @request.session[:last_login ] = Time.now end #
Some tests end end
Fair enough .
We blame it on the user of the macro :-)
Since we ’re using Ruby , most of us are probably in agreement with Matz ’
“ Make the programmer happy ” motto .
So can we also solve the problem from the other end ?
Create a setup macro that supports a direct inner setup block ?
Of course we can , this is Ruby , not VB .
Best practice # 2 : Create setup macros that support a second setup block
A setup is grafted to a context that describes it .
As the creator of the macro , I do n’t know what crazy setup blocks programmers will put inside their macro .
So I simply create a mute context :
# Sets the current person in the session from the person fixtures .
def self.logged_in_as( person , &block ) context " logged in as #{person} " do setup do @request.session [ : person ] = people ( person ) .id end context '' do yield end end end
Now my macro supports the following test without a hitch :
logged_in_as :mat do setup do @request.session[:last_login ] = Time.now end #
Some tests end
And of course , programmers who stick to best practice # 1 can still write a cleaner test without a problem .
The awesomeness of contexts lies in the fact that they can be nested :
logged_in_as : mat do context " with last login set to now " do setup do @request.session[:last_login ] = Time.now end #
Some tests end end
Conclusion
Best practice # 1 is simple .
A setup block should be described by its encompassing context .
It ’s a question of readability .
Nesting a setup block immediately inside a Shoulda macro is a dubious practice .
Best practice # 2 is a more pragmatic solution to the problem .
Ok , nesting a block right inside a macro is n’t always the best idea .
But when you do n’t have the macro right under your nose , it may take you a while before you think about looking at said macro .
I do n’t know about you , but I have a tendency to have a great deal of confidence in macros that work well across my test suite .
So after you ’ve spent an hour questioning Shoulda ( or your sanity , or whether you should have become a gardener instead of a software developer ) because your setup block is n’t executing , best practice # 2 starts to make sense .
It may or may not be necessary in all your setup macros .
I find it ’s especially useful for macros that are generic enough to be used across your test suite .
Or most of all , in setup macros you will share with the world .
Best practice # 2 makes setup macros bulletproof to the problem of multiple setups .
Now go refactor your setup macros !

What makes Texans so crazy ?
What kind of bizarro culture makes them so obsessed with their own statehood ?
What ’s up with those fucking hats ?
Well , my friends , I am risking having my passport revoked to share with you six things about Texas that you do n’t know .
( Unless you ’re from Texas , then you ’ll know it . )
Strap in and get ready to experience Lone Star State up close and in your face !
If you get scared , just take a deep breath and think about New Jersey .
# 1 . The True Origins of “ Do n’t Mess With Texas . ”
Everyone thinks this is some kind of jingoistic crazy Texan shotgun - rack - on - the - pickup - truck - type slogan .
The funny thing about it is that it ’s really an anti-litter campaign .
Yup .
During the ’ 80s , they had all these commercials meant to compete with the crying Native American dude commercial .
They would show someone throwing a beer can out of a truck onto some roadside flowers and then say , “ Do n’t Mess With Texas . ”
Like literally , do n’t mess it up , asshole .
The rest of the world misinterpreted it so now it ’s some kind of de facto rallying cry , but do n’t be fooled .
Litter .
# 2. Religious Education = “ Super Makeout Party . ”
Texas is notorious for being deeply weirdo religious .
Which do n’t get me wrong , in many adult cases it is .
What nobody realizes , though , is that even Republicans are n’t total losers .
All teenagers , regardless of creed , want a chance to get away from their parents , drink cheap booze , and get to third base .
Enter religion .
Between ski trips , lock - ins , sleep away bible camp , and a nauseating phenomenon called “ Young Life , ” they found the perfect ruse .
Since those things were always ostensibly Bible ( or Torah ) - focused , the parental supervision was sparse and lax .
They ’re the “ good kids ” who voluntarily submit to indoctrination !
Certainly none of them would be interested in filling their water bottles with vodka painstakingly filched from three different parents ’ liquor cabinets or giving head under the blankets in the back of the bus !
And because adults were all convinced that these “ alternative activities ” keeps kids out of trouble , every single sect of every single church , no matter how laid - back elsewhere , has these intense youth programs .
Even Unitarians .
Looking back , I have to assume that our parents knew what went on , to some extent , and just figured that you had to learn to finger a girl sometime .
Oh what a friend we have in Jesus .
# 3 . There ’s a Baroque Hierarchy of Organizations Required to Properly Boost Football .
So everyone ’s heard about how Texans are these fanatical high school football fans a la “ Varsity Blues , ” what with the shaving cream bikinis and the “ I do n’t want your life . ”
What people do n’t realize is that all of the football satellite organizations are equally fanatical .
You do n’t have to be a concussed hillbilly with an overactive pituitary gland to get involved .
To wit , every football game my school plays requires a minimum of 24 school buses .
You need your three hundred member band ( 7 buses + 18 - wheeler full of instruments ) , your dance team ( 1 bus ) , drill team ( 2 buses ) , pep squad ( 4 buses ) , color guard plus twirlers ( 1 bus ) , varsity cheerleaders ( 1 bus ) , J.V. and Freshman cheerleaders ( 1 bus ) , J.V. and Freshman football teams , just in case ( 4 buses ) , R.O.T.C. , to “ guard ” the band and assorted cheering and pep engineers ( 1 bus ) , the student council , to “ greet ” the other school ’s student council , which consisted of shaking hands and exchanging candy ( 1 bus ) , plus the actual football team itself ( 2 buses ) .
The mascot has to drive him / her self there because that privilege rotated every week .
So at least half the school is required to participate in every single game .
If you are not from Texas , you simply cannot conceive of the pageantry .
There ’s a reason the Texas public school system is forced to make do with Apple IIGSes built out of rocks and mud : the uniforming alone is like the entire school ’s budget .
Of course , who needs computers to learn anyway ?
Twirling is the kind of thing you can really build a career on .
# 4 . Here , Private School is for Kids Who Ca n’t Hack it at Normal School .
Well that ’s just public school , though , right ?
Where the dumb and poor kids go ?
Surely there are high - powered prep schools for rich , smart children who wish to attend an Ivy someday .
Hah !
You liberal Northern fool .
There are exactly two colleges worth attending : The University of Texas and Texas A&M .
Anything you can’t learn there is most likely some form of homosexual mind control .
So private schools come in exactly two flavors : military and special needs .
Are you a discipline problem ?
Are the radically underpaid teachers in public school scared of you / tired of disciplining you ?
Welp , off to military school with you .
Complete with uniforms , drill lessons , inspections , push - ups , and scary grown - ups screaming at you .
And do n’t worry , moms and dads , military school is n’t just for surly teens .
If the Ritalin is n’t doing its job , there are military school opportunities for kiddies as young as pre-K !
If your problems are more in the cognitive arena , you can go to a special needs school .
Small classroom sizes provide the extra help and instruction you require .
And do n’t worry , all the kids on your block know you go there .
You do n’t have to go to school with them for them to beat the crap out of you .
Have fun in that pigeonhole for the rest of your life , you retard .
# 5 . The Civil War is Not Our Racially Insensitive War of Choice .
This may surprise a lot of people but Texans are n’t really that big into the Civil War .
I mean , sure , there are lots of Confederate flags lying around and stuff , but really you ’ve got to go to Alabama and Georgia to get really quality “ War of Northern Aggression ” talk .
Our most favorite war is the Texas War of Independence , otherwise known as “ That One With the Alamo . ”
That ’s the one where , in a “ brilliant military tactic , ” we slaughtered thousands of Mexican soldiers in their sleep .
And took back the land that was rightfully ours .
‘ Cause , uh , we said so .
# 6 . We Have Bizarre College Mascot Rituals .
We in Texas love a good joke .
When overt racism went out of style , many funny jokes were threatened with extinction just because they implied that white people were smarter than some other race of people .
Fortunately , a way was found to salvage these jokes .
Colleges !
Every Texan child , at birth , is determined to be either a University of Texas Longhorn or a Texas A&M Aggie .
There is a ritual involved that I wo n’t get into .
Suffice it to say that if you are Longhorn , you think Aggies are dumb and vice - versa .
It was discovered you could just plug in Longhorn and Aggie for Jew and Catholic or whatever , and voila !
Instant joke fodder !
It does n’t stop there , though .
If you are lucky enough to actually attend the school you have inexplicably been rooting for your entire life , you must cheer on your team ’s mascot at the football games .
UT ’s mascot is , unsurprisingly , a Longhorn steer named Bevo .
Like the majority of the school ’s students , Bevo spends most of his life in a drugged - up stupor .
They plunk the poor thing down on the sideline during games to incite pep , but that ’s about all he does .
Texas A&M , being a little more war - like and well , nutty , has a collie named Reveille that they treat like some kind of god .
There is a special unit of the “ Corps , ” which is Aggiespeak for crazy weird R.O.T.C. , assigned to care for it .
They trot this dog around campus , and if it barks during class , well , that class is dismissed .
For real .
Corps members must salute it .
When one dies , they bury it under the goal post .
Kids tease each other based on their choice of school and mascot .
This is usually pretty puerile , to the tune of “ you suck / no you suck ” .
Any Longhorn kid lucky enough to be exposed to the song “ Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy ” through music class is golden , though , because of the line “ He ’s in the army now , he ’s blowing Reveille , he ’s the Boogie Woogie bugle boy from company B. ” Hours of entertainment .
It ’s almost enough to make one miss race - based humor .
So that ’s it .
That ’s what you outlanders have been missing .
It should shed some light on the whole “ Republic of Texas ” phenomenon .
Now you can wink knowingly at your ex-pat friends from Texas .
You ’ve got their number .
Do n’t Mess with Texas indeed .
And remember , hook ’em , horns !
According to Bush - Cheney sycophantic " reporter " Glenn Kessler , Bush ’s alleged support for the diplomatic " solution " proposed by Secretary of State Condi Rice " suggests he increasingly is determined to put aside a possible military strike " to " end " Iran ’s nuclear programs  all currently verifiably " Safeguarded " against diversion to any military purpose by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
And what is Condi ’s diplomatic solution ?
Well , it amounts to the Iranian Mullahs " verifiably " committing suicide .
Shortly after Bush replaced Colin Powell with Condi , she had a munchkin inform the conferees at the 2005 Review Conference on the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , being held at United Nations Headquarters , that 
“ Britain , France and Germany , with our support , are seeking to reach a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear problem , a solution that given the history of clandestine nuclear weapons work in that country , must include permanent cessation of Iran ’s enrichment and reprocessing efforts , as well as dismantlement of equipment and facilities related to such activity . ”
The previous November , Britain , France and Germany ( E3 )  allegedly on behalf of the European Union  had began negotiations under the so - called Paris Accord , which begins with the E3 / EU recognizing “ Iran ’s rights under the NPT . ”
However , for the duration of the negotiations  which were initially expected to last six - months 
Iran offered to continue voluntarily adhering to an Additional Protocol to its IAEA NPT Safeguards Agreement , in advance of its ratification .
Iran also offered to extend its voluntary suspension of all uranium - enrichment and spent - fuel reprocessing related activities .
For its part , the E3 / EU recognized that these suspensions were " voluntary confidence - building " measures and " not a legal obligation . ”
As we now know [. pdf ] , more than a month before Condi ’s ultimatum about what she would consider an acceptable outcome of their negotiations , the Iranians had made a confidential offer to the E3 / EU which included :
Restrictions on Iran ’s nascent uranium - enrichment program
( a ) a verifiable ceiling on enrichment level ,
( b ) immediate conversion of all enriched - uranium to reactor - fuel
( c ) a verifiable ceiling on reactor - fuel quantity ,
Iran ’s foregoing its NPT right to reprocess spent fuel
Legislative and regulatory measures
( a ) ratification by Iran ’s Parliament of the Additional Protocol ,
( b ) a prohibition against development or acquisition of nuclear weapons
Continuous on - site presence of IAEA inspectors at uranium conversion and enrichment facilities above and beyond that required by the Additional Protocol
Condi essentially prevented the E3 / EU from even acknowledging receipt of this magnanimous offer .
So , on August 1 , 2005 , the Iranians informed the IAEA Director - General  who had agreed to verify the voluntary suspension of certain IAEA Safeguarded activities for the duration of the Paris Accord negotiations  that they intended to resume some of those Safeguarded activities , which had now been suspended for almost two years .
“ Against all its sincere efforts and maximum flexibility , Iran has not received a proposal as of today , and all public and diplomatic information , [ particularly the letter of 29 July 2005 of the E3 Ministers ] indicate that the content of the eventual proposal will be totally unacceptable .
“ We have been informed that the [ eventual ] proposal not only fails to address Iran ’s rights for peaceful development of nuclear technology , but even falls far short of correcting the illegal and unjustified restrictions placed on Iran ’s economic and technological development  let alone providing firm guarantees for economic , technological and nuclear cooperation and firm commitments on security issues .
“ It must be underlined that all States party to the NPT , without discrimination , have an inalienable right to produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
As this right is “ inalienable , ” it can not be undermined or curtailed under any pretext .
Any attempt to do so , would be an attempt to undermine a pillar of the Treaty and indeed the Treaty itself . ”
Subsequent attempts by Condi to reach a " diplomatic " solution to her " Iranian nuclear problem , " went on to undermine the IAEA and the UN Security Council , itself .
In particular , Condi effected passage of UNSC Resolution 1747 on 24 March , 2007 , which began with the Security Council 
“ Reaffirming its commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , the need for all States Party to that Treaty to comply fully with all their obligations , and recalling the right of States Party , in conformity with Articles I and II of that Treaty , to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination , ”
but then proceeding to " discriminate , " explicitly denying Iran all its NPT rights .
Unbelievably , the resolution even “ called ” upon all States to deny Iran any items on the UN Register on Conventional Arms !
Here ’s what Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki had to say when he was finally allowed to address the Security Council , after  of course  UNSCR 1747 had already passed .
“ This is the fourth time in the last 12 months that in an unwarranted move , orchestrated by a few of its permanent members , the Security Council is being abused to take an unlawful , unnecessary and unjustifiable action against the peaceful nuclear program of the Islamic Republic of Iran , which presents no threat to international peace and security and falls therefore outside the Council ’s Charter - based mandate .
“ In order to give this scheme a semblance of international legitimacy , its initiators first manipulated the IAEA Board of Governor and  as they acknowledged themselves  “ coerced ” some of its members to vote against Iran in the Board , and then have taken advantage of their substantial economic and political power to pressure and manipulate the Security Council to adopt three unwarranted resolutions within 8 months .
“ As an organ of an international Organization created by States , the Security Council is bound by law , and Member States have every right to insist that the Council keep within the powers that they accorded it under the Charter of the United Nations .
“ The Security Council must exercise those powers consistently with the purposes and principles of the Charter .
“ Equally , the measures it takes must be consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and with other international law .
Members of the Security Council do not have the right to undermine the Council ’s credibility . "
So , what do you think ?
Will Undersecretary William Burns , Condi ’s emissary to the E3 / EU talks , which will also include emissaries from China and Russia , be able to persuade Saeed Jalili , Iran ’s nuclear negotiator , and the ruling Mullahs to " dismantle " their IAEA Safeguarded programs ?
Or will Bush the Younger have to " take them out , " himself , before leaving office ?
By using his nomination acceptance speech to say he would appoint Democrats to his cabinet and solicit Democratic policy ideas , presidential candidate John McCain sought to assure voters that he could avoid legislative gridlock if Democrats , as is likely , deepen their control of Congress .
The Republican 's message is especially important this year , as polls show that Americans find both the president and Congress wanting and are frustrated with political bickering in Washington .
Already , McCain advisers are working on strategies for governing , including emphasizing issues where Sen.
McCain and Democrats largely see eye - to - eye , such as promoting renewable energy and curbing greenhouse - gas emissions .
They say they would also try to break Democratic party unity on more - contentious issues .
For example , they are counting on the growing ranks of Democratic centrists , who are more fiscally conservative than mainstream Democrats , to become McCain allies on taxes .
They 're also counting on the legislative calendar to force accommodation .
The tax cuts signed into law by President George W. Bush are set to expire at the end of 2010 , and neither party wants to revert to higher rates across the board , especially given the frail economy .
The Democrats , in general , want to raise the rates on families that make more than $ 200,000 in taxable income and use the money for other priorities , such as health - care subsidies .
Sen .
McCain wants to block any tax increases and reduce the top corporate tax rate to 25 % from 35 % .
Neither is likely to prevail entirely , but they can't avoid working out their differences .
" Again and again , I 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed , " the Arizona senator told the Republican convention .
" That 's how I will govern as president . "
Most polls show Sen. McCain trailing Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama by a small margin and forecast big gains for congressional Democrats , who already control the House and Senate .
If Sen. McCain wins , a divided government probably would n't limit him greatly on foreign policy , where the president has broad powers to conduct war and diplomacy .
But on economic and domestic policies , the consequences can be enormous .
A President McCain would have to negotiate -- and compromise -- on his tax , energy , environment and health - care plans with the same Democratic lawmakers who are belittling his proposals on the campaign trail .
Viruses intended to steal passwords and send them to a remote server infected laptops in the International Space Station in July , NASA confirmed Tuesday .
And according to NASA , this was n't the first infection .
" This is not the first time we have had a worm or a virus , " NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries said .
" It 's not a frequent occurrence , but this is n't the first time . "
That suggests that even in the future where space travel becomes an experience to complain about , rather than get dressed up for , computer viruses will still be tagging along uninvited .
NASA downplayed the news , calling the virus mainly a " nuisance " that was on non-critical space station laptops used for things like e-mail and nutritional experiments .
NASA and its partners in the space station are now trying to figure out how the virus made it onboard and how to prevent that in the future , according to Humphries .
NASA declined to name the virus , but SpaceRef.com , which broke the story , reported that the worm was W32 .
Gammima .
AG worm – a worm first detected in August 2007 that installs software that steals credentials for online games .
The virus did make it onto more than one laptop – suggesting that it spread via some sort of intranet on the space station or via a thumb drive .
Humphries did not know when the laptops entered the space station or what country bought them , though he did indicate that the hardened equipment on the space station was typically purchased by Russia or the United States .
The International Space Station has no direct internet access , but astronauts can send and receive mail though a KU band data link also used for data and video transfer , according to Humphries .
That means the space station laptops are not connected to the net , according to Humphries .
" Everything is scanned before it goes up , so it's an indirect connection , " Humphries said .
As for whether mission critical systems are connected to the same network as these kinds of laptops ?
" I do n't know and even if I did , I would n't be able to tell you for IT security reasons , " Humphries said .

If you listen closely , you ’ll find that the earth is full of sounds .
Some are things that you hear every day , some are truly remarkable and some sounds hail from origins completely unknown .
What follows here is a list of “ sonic mysteries ” for your pleasure – many of them include audio .
1. The Bloop
At various times during the summer of 1997 , an ultra-low frequency sound that rose rapidly in frequency over about one minute was detected at 50 degrees S , 100 degrees W . The sound was detected by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with the Equatorial Pacific Ocean autonomous hydrophone array ( which was U.S. Navy equipment originally designed to detect Soviet submarines ) , and was loud enough to be heard on multiple sensors , up to 5000 km apart .
Scientists dubbed it the “ Bloop ” ( not to be confused with the “ Boing ” . )
Although the sound matches the profile of a living animal , it is much louder than any known creature can produce .
Any creature that could produce such a sound would have to be many times larger than the largest whale .
You can hear a very short recording of the bloop sound here .
The recording is short because it ’s been sped up 16 x to make it audible to you and I .
Some people link the Bloop to Cthulhu , a mythical creature from an H.P. Lovecraft story as the noise originated from an area near the mythical sunken city of R’lyeh from the same story .
The Bloop also makes an appearance in the game promoting the movie Cloverfield , and was also seen in the movie “ The Loch ” , coming from a giant eel .
A 2001 album by Dntel ( “ Life is full of possibilities ” ) uses the bloop as a repeating sample through the piece .
The actual origination of the sound is not known and remains a mystery to this day although it is suspected to be biological in origin .
2. The Hum
The hum is the name of a phenomenon that is generally given to mysterious low frequency humming or rumbling .
It is typically heard by many people at a time ( but not others ) , and can come and go or it can be constant .
There are many famous Hums , most notably the Taos Hum and the Bristol Hum .
The Hum is usually difficult to record , and it ’s often difficult to localize the source of the hum ( perhaps due to the low frequency , as low frequency sounds are harder to localize ) .
Hums have been detected ( or reported ) all over the world , but most appear in Europe and South America .
The Hum is more often heard indoors , and some people hear it more faintly than others .
Here is a recording of the Auckland Hum ( UPDATE : file no longer available ) .
The Taos Hum has been featured on the X - Files and Unsolved Mysteries .
The source of some Hums have been identified – for example , a pair of fans in a cooling tower at a DaimlerChrysler casting plant was emitting a 36
Hz tone that caused a Hum over the entire city of Kokomo , Indiana .
Other Hums remain a mystery .
Some possible explanations Include geological events , pulsed microwaves and electromagnetic waves from meteors .
Tinnitus might explain some cases as well .
A creditable scientific hypothesis from 2005 suggests the Hum is caused by the tensor tympani muscle ( a muscle in the inner ear ) trembling in the eardrums of individuals .
on the eardrums of affected individuals by the tensor tympani muscle trembling .
There is a website by the “ Interest Group for Research of the Hum Nuisance ” ( unfortunately in German ) describing this theory .
3. The Hell Hole
You can decide for yourself on this one .
More than forty years ago , researchers in the Soviet Union began an ambitious drilling project whose goal was to penetrate the Earth ’s upper crust and sample the warm , mysterious area where the crust and mantle intermingle the Mohorovic discontinuity , or “ Moho . ”
This type of drilling was completely new and the technology did n’t exist to go that deep , so the Russians had to invent a completely new way of drilling to be able to do it .
Unfortunately , the Russians never reached their goal , and many of the Earth ’s secrets were left undiscovered , however The Kola Superdeep Borehole is still a scientifically useful site , and research there is ongoing .
When drilling stopped in 1994 , the hole was over seven miles deep , making it by far the deepest hole ever drilled by humans .
The last of the cores to be plucked from from the borehole was dated to be about 2.7 billion years old .
Although the Kona hole was the deepest hole ever drilled , seven miles was still very short of the 20 - 80 km required to penetrate the earth ’s crust .
Like all newfangled science stories , some Genesis freaks have decided that the intent of the project was not real scientific research as they were told – rather this simple experiment was actually an attempt to drill to hell – and that they were successful !
The story has , and still does , made its rounds on Christian circles via tracts , preaching and radio broadcasts .
The story varies , but here are the basics :
1 . After going only a few miles down , the drill began to spin wildly .
2. A Doctor Azzacov is quoted as stating authoritatively that it has been shown that the earth is hollow .
3 . Immensely high temperatures were experienced , much higher than expected at that depth .
Usually 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit or 1,100 degrees Celsius is quoted .
4. Microphones were lowered into the hole ( to listen to the earth ’s movement ) .
Human screams were heard hordes of tortured souls .
5 . Many of the scientists have quit the project in fear and / or have become total nervous wrecks .
Of course , these “ facts ” are not quite true :
a) If the earth was largely hollow , it would clearly be evident from seismic studies , as well as from orbital / gravitational considerations , but this is not the case .
b ) Far from being a fiery inferno , the temperature increased by one degree Celsius every 100 meters to 3,000 meters , then by 2.5 degrees every 100 meters thereafter .
At 10,000 meters , it was only 180 degrees .
The story of course is based on a factual borehole , and creation geologists have had a field day with the shaky “ facts ” – using the story to prove that yes , hell exists and they ’ve been right all along .
Here ’s the “ quote ” that has been making it ’s way through evangelical circles :
We lowered a microphone , designed to detect the sounds of plate movements down the shaft .
But instead of plate movements we heard a human voice screaming in pain !
At first we thought the sound was coming from our own equipment .
But when we made adjustments our worst suspicions were confirmed .
The screams were n’t those of a single human , they were the screams of millions of humans !
Oh , you wanted to HEAR the screams from hell ?
But of course !

In some places in the world , people have reported long successions of enormously loud booming noises .
Â
They are called different things in different areas of the world – Guns of the Seneca ( near Seneca Lake in New York ) , Barisal guns ( in Bangladesh ) , uminari ( in Japan ) , fog guns , lake guns , and many other terms .
These terms all describe a sound or sounds that resemble distant cannon fire , and are usually heard near large bodies of water .
Often times they are accompanied by a long rumble that is strong enough to shake plates and pictures .
There have been many proposed theories about where these sounds come from , however most are not very satisfying .
Since these sounds have been reported for centuries means that the most obvious explanation , artillery tests , are pretty much ruled out .
Earthquakes and volcanoes could produce these sounds and rumbles , however the sounds have not been directly connected to any seismic activity , which is fairly well measured .
Some have speculated that undersea activity ( perhaps seismic ) creates great bubbles of released gas which floats to the surface and creates huge “ ocean farts ” , however it is a stretch to think that these bubbles could produce a sound strong enough to create the distant - gunfire sound of Mistpouffers .
Meteorite impacts have also been bandied about as a possible explanation ( see here for actual meteor sounds ) as have tidal waves .
It has also been speculated that these noises happen everywhere and that ambient noise from communities simply make them harder to hear .
Sound travels farther over water than over land , and so the sounds are more easily heard in remote , quiet areas close to bodies of water .
Of course the latest theory is rather boring – that the sounds are made by thunder or other explosions very far away , and the sounds simply travels a very , very long way because atmospheric and topographic conditions happen to be “ just so ” .
This would explain why no storms or other activity are present in the area and yet the sounds are still heard .
Some people still believe that the sounds are made from alien spacecraft , God , or Thor ’s hammer banging on nails while trying to fix the roof over the heavens .
However there is another theory :
A Web page describing the many tourist attractions of the Cayuga Lake area mentions the Guns of the Seneca it also says .
At the southern end , you ’ll find the booming city of Ithacaa Well , that it .
What people are hearing is obviously the sound of Ithaca booming .
5. Slow Down
Slow down was recorded in the Pacific Ocean on May 19,1997 .
It was recorded by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration located around 15 degrees S 115 , degrees W .
It is called the Slow Down because the sound slowly decreases in frequency over the span of about 7 minutes .
It was detected using the same hydrophone array as the Bloop , and was loud enough to be detected on multiple sensors 2000 km apart .
Here is a recording of the sound , sped up by 16 times .
Source : http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/sounds/noise97139.wav
Some people believe that this sound has been made by a giant squid or other large sea creature , however this theory does n’t stand up to scientific reason , as squids likely not have the capability of producing these sounds .
The real source of the Slow Down sound remains completely unknown .
This signal and anything like it has not been heard before or since .
6 . The WOW !
No discussion of mysterious sounds would be complete without this one , although it ’s not a sound from earth – it ’s from space .
You can also debate whether or not it ’s actually technically a sound at all , but I ’m presenting it here just because it ’s interesting .
On August 15 , 1977 a SETI scientist working at the Big Ear radio telescope of the Ohio State University noticed a very strong signal that lasted for 72 seconds .
The type of signal resembled signals that are non-terrestrial and non-solar system in origin .
Because the signal was so remarkable ,
The scientists circled the data on the computer printout and wrote the word “ WOW ! ” beside it .
Ever since then , it ’s been called the “ Wow ! ” signal .
Since the signal was discovered , scientists from all over have tried to locate it again , however it has never been seen since .
It has been theorized by some people that the signal may have come from extraterrestrial life , however others remain skeptical .
More information on the Wow can be found here by the person who discovered it .
So that ’s it for earth sounds .

The rapid mis-education of Sarah Palin
September 2 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
I could n’t read this Newsweek article past this sentence :
The McCain team has hastily assembled a team of former Bush White House aides to tutor the vice - presidential candidate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , on foreign - policy issues …
It stumped me .
I mean , I know all those words , but that sentence does n’t make any sense .
The Bush team ?
Really ?
That ’s who you went to ?
But they have n’t found a foreign policy yet they ca n’t fuck up .
Aside from the damage this does to the ‘ experience argument , ’ does n’t this ruin their ‘ not Bush III ’ argument as well ?
So let me get this straight , because I want to make sure I understand it :
At a time when you are telling us that experience matters , and that the McCain presidency will not be a continuation of the current policy ( which he supports , apparently , 90 + percent of the time , as well as ( in his words ) on all of the “ transcendental issues ” of our time ) , you picked as your vice president someone with less experience than your opponent and then give them tutoring from the very people who fucked everything up in the first place ?
How does that even make fucking sense ?
Because I really need to know what sort of logical contortions and self delusions one must go through to not only think that is a rational thought process , but that other people will believe it as well …
The crew of La Somme , a 160 m command vessel and fuel tanker , easily saw off the brazen night - time assault by lightly armed fighters in two open - topped motorboats , and captured five of the pirates .
" The pirates , who because of the darkness took the French warship for a commercial vessel , were on board two boats and opened fire with Kalashnikovs , " Admiral Christophe Prazuck said last night .
La Somme is the French command vessel in the Indian Ocean , overseeing French air , sea and land forces fighting Somali pirates and hunting terrorists under the banner of the US - led Operation Enduring Freedom .
Officers on the ship have directed commando operations to free French hostages held by Somali pirates .
The pirates tried to flee when they realised their mistake but were pursued by French forces , who caught one of the skiffs after an hour - long chase .
On it they found five men but no weapons , water or food as the pirates had reportedly thrown all the boat 's contents overboard .
The world 's naval powers have deployed dozens of warships to the lawless waters off Somalia over the past year to curb attacks by pirates in the busy maritime trade route .
La Somme was operating 460 km off the Somali coast , on its way to resupply fuel to frigates patrolling shipping lanes as part of the EU 's Operation Atalanta anti-piracy mission .
This was not the first time Somali pirates have mistakenly attacked a French naval vessel .
Several pirates were captured in May when they tried to board a frigate in the area .
Somalia has had no proper government since it plunged into lawlessness after Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991 .
The country is riven by fighting , and pirate gangs operate from several ports along its Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden coasts .

A secret memo controls the rules of the presidential debates - should it ?
1 / 1 Back to Gallery
There is a confidential agreement between presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama .
Its secret contents control a critical aspect of the upcoming election .
This is n't the plot for novelist Dan Brown 's next thriller , but rather the true story of the 2008 presidential debates .
The McCain and Obama campaigns have negotiated and signed a 31 - page memorandum of understanding .
This document governs every aspect of the presidential debates , from speaking times to follow - up questions .
This is the document to which moderator Tom Brokaw repeatedly referred last Tuesday as he tried to maintain control of the debate .
This is the document that dictated how much time vice presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sarah Palin each had to speak at their Oct. 2 debate .
This is the document that governs the final presidential debate Wednesday .
The memorandum of understanding is a vital part of the 2008 election and the democratic process .
However , both campaigns have refused to divulge the memorandum 's contents .
Such a stance is antithetical to the fundamental American notion of transparency in government .
For the good of the country , the rules of the presidential debate should be released immediately .
From examining last week 's debate , media leaks about the memorandum , and past memoranda of understanding , we know that this memorandum will play a pivotal role in the structure of the final presidential debate - the last opportunity the American public will have to see the candidates side by side .
We 've already seen the memorandum 's impact in the earlier debates .
For instance , the memorandum prevented Brokaw from asking meaningful follow - up questions , and also controlled the candidates ' answer times .
After a tepid response from both candidates on the future of Social Security and Medicare , Brokaw refrained from pushing further , declaring , " I 'm going to stick by my part of the pact and not ask a follow - up . "
Brokaw 's deference to the memorandum squares with the historical record , in which memoranda dictated almost every aspect of the debate , ranging from relatively minor details , such as where the candidates must stand during the debate , to major issues , such as whether the candidates may ask each other direct questions .
The American people have a right to know the memorandum 's contents .
The memorandum contains no state secrets or classified information ; there is no reason to keep it confidential .
There is no downside to releasing its contents .
Indeed , the campaigns have never proffered a persuasive rationale for their obsessive confidentiality .
There is historical precedent for releasing the memorandum .
In 2004 , the Bush and Kerry campaigns consented to the memorandum 's release before the debates .
No cataclysm resulted .
Rather , there was a healthy discussion of the agreement between the campaigns , and voters were able to understand the restrictions the candidates had placed on themselves .
As lampooned on " Saturday Night Live , " last week 's town - hall - meeting - style debate broke records for boredom .
Many blamed the format ; none of us watching knew what the actual rules of the format were .
Without knowledge of the memorandum , watching the presidential debates is like seeing a baseball game without foul lines or base paths :
The general idea is to round the bases , but we do n't have any idea about the critical rules of the game .
Both McCain and Obama talk about change in Washington and reform on Wall Street .
McCain calls for an end to secretive earmarks ; Obama criticizes the lack of oversight in the bailout package .
The path to new , principled and transparent governance begins with the immediate release of the memorandum of understanding before Wednesday 's debate .
If these campaigns are truly committed to transparency and the rule of law , they should start where it counts : at home .
Senator Bob Casey came out swinging Tuesday night and landed a few direct hits on the jaws of the " Bush - McCain Republicans . "

" John McCain calls himself a maverick , but he votes with George Bush 95 % of the time .
That 's not a maverick .
That 's a sidekick . "
" The Bush - McCain Republicans inherited the strongest economy in history and drove it into a ditch .
They cut taxes on the wealthiest of us , and passed the pain to the least of us .
They ran up the debt gave huge subsidies to oil companies and now they 're asking for four more years ?
How bout four more months . "
There 's something about the camera zoom and the way he says " that 's a sidekick " that just cracks me up .
Devilstower at dKos has a great graphic .
Yazan Khalaf has no shortage of big dreams .
Aspiring to be a pilot , the young Arab - Israeli entering the 10th grade is also trying to " change the whole world . "
Yazan might not start any kind of global revolution , but he is taking part in an educational experiment that could profoundly affect Israel .
He 's among 14 students who started this year in Israel 's first bilingual Jewish - Arab high school .
It 's a radical development for a country where most schools are segregated and one that its founders hope will spark a national rethink about education .
At a minimum , putting Jews and Arabs together in bilingual classrooms can foster greater understanding between both sides of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
It might be a model of the world they may live in someday .
" It has to succeed , " says Lior Aviman , principal for the high school started by the Hand in Hand Center for Jewish - Arab Education .
" There are more than a few cynics and skeptics and we must prove that this is possible .
For me , this is a big challenge … to show that Jews and Arabs can really study and live together . "
Indeed , the school faces plenty of obstacles .
First , it 's not officially approved by the Ministry of Education .
A ministry official said the school did not submit all of its paperwork on time for this school year .
Without a license , the school will miss out on government funding and it will become more difficult for students to take matriculation exams , which help determine university admission .
To further complicate matters , nearly all of the 14 students are Arab citizens of Israel , except for one who is half - Jewish .
But administrators say they are not deterred .
Hand in Hand has overcome these sorts of obstacles before , they say .
" At the beginning , we did n't have anything , " says Amin Khalaf , Yazan 's father and Hand in Hand cofounder .
" We did n't have offices , we did n't have money , only questions with good intentions . "
The group started in 1997 and today operates four bilingual and bicultural schools and serves about 900 students .
In addition to having a Jewish and an Arab coprincipal , nearly each class has a Jewish educator and an Arab one .
The children are taught in both Arabic and Hebrew , learn about both cultures , and commemorate Jewish , Muslim , and Christian holidays .
Students in bilingual schools appear to have a more complex understanding of Israeli society , including of its minorities and of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , than their counterparts who attend monolingual schools , says Zvi Bekerman , a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem 's school of education and an expert in peace education .
" The relationships and the appreciation and perceptions of each child toward the other are much better than in regular society , " he says .
However , he adds , research indicates that these attitudes do not necessarily carry over outside the schools .
In addition , schools cannot fully divorce themselves from the wider sociopolitical context .
But the fact that the schools have made it through some tense political times , such as the eruption of the second Palestinian intifada , which started in 2000 , is considered an achievement in itself , he says .
" The fact that these schools still exist and still struggle , with all its complexities , with all these ups and downs , is fascinating , " Professor Bekerman says .
" In that sense , well , something is going on here . "
The struggle for Hand in Hand , in addition to branching out into starting a high school , is to maintain enrollment at its other schools , particularly among Jewish students .
The Jerusalem school , where the high school is located , boasts 256 Arab and 205 Jewish and other students .
At least five Jewish pupils from the sixth and seventh grades have left the school this year .
This is due , in part , to competition with other strong schools .
Some parents also prefer to send their children to a high school with a proven track record in matriculation exam success .
But over time , say school organizers , Hand in Hand will have this sort of track record , too .
But the bigger success , so far , for the school is that they have achieved much of what they set out to accomplish .
The children speak both Hebrew and Arabic , play together without thinking " I am a Jew " and " you are an Arab , " and visit one another at their homes , says Yochanan Eshchar , the former Jewish coprincipal at the Bridge over the Wadi Hand in Hand school in the northern Arab village of Kfar Kara .
" We are teaching both sides both stories , " says Mr. Eshchar .
" They know this is the Jewish story and this is the Palestinian story .
We teach to be empathic to the pain of the other and that both sides have a right to be here and we teach that right . "
It is precisely these traits that make the school so attractive to parents Rajaa Massalha and Yochai Cohen Benveniste .
Mr. Benveniste , a Jewish resident of Givat Ada whose two sons attend the Kfar Kara school , admires the school 's high level of education and the opportunity it affords his children to mix with both Jewish and Arab children
" I 've seen a complete understanding of the human race and not just the Jewish race and not just the Jewish story , " he says , speaking of his 8 - year - old son , Yonatan , who is in the fourth grade .
" They get a complete picture . "
Ms. Massalha , an Arab resident of Kfar Kara whose four children attend the school , is thankful that the school is instilling in her children a strong sense of identity and helping them to feel proud that they are Arab , a minority in Israel .
She also loves the idea of a school " for two peoples and two cultures " that promotes equality , respect , and nonviolence .
" It gives you a broader view , " she says .
Cofounder Khalaf says he 'll continue to push to have the Hand in Hand high school in Jerusalem officially recognized .
He submitted additional paperwork for the high school and hopes the ministry will reconsider .
If not , he says , they will try again next year .
A few years ago , it took two years and a Supreme Court petition before their middle school received its license .

College Confessional : Casual Sex Scores High Marks
Our intern Erika Sarmiento Usui , a senior at the University of Colorado at Boulder , begs to differ with yesterday 's College Confessional about a healthy relationship being the key to the perfect GPA .
I do n't want a boyfriend .
With a full credit load and a 40 - hour a week work schedule , a boyfriend is the last thing on my Santa list .
If my already packed days become even more swamped with daily phone calls , routine dates , fights and make - ups , I 'm just going to give up on school and join the circus .
Yes , having a special someone who can provide both organization and orgasm is romantic .
He 's there to bring you coffee when you 're pulling all - nighters , and he 'll even make you breakfast in bed after a night of steamy , hot lovin ' .
But that 's just not for me .
I was in a common - law marriage through my first few years in school , and having someone who wanted to know every aspect of my personal and educational endeavors was , for me , irksome .
Breakfast in bed ?
Yes , it 's very thoughtful and lovely , but I 'd rather hit snooze at least five times to get every minute of possible beauty sleep .
As for sex , it 's nice to have a passionate lover who knows how to turn me on -- but why not have five who can show me a good time ?

One of the most crucial lessons I 've learned so far in college is the importance of time management .
As such , I am an expert at managing sex and school , booty calls and study sessions .
And my grades ?
Sex : A+. School : Look me up on the Dean 's List .
For me , casual sex is not a distraction , nor does it make me vulnerable .
Instead , it provides me with stress relief when I 've got three exams in two days .
It also helps me get to sleep when I 'm wired at 1:00 a.m. , with an 8:00 a.m. lecture .
As for psychological effects , I 've got absolutely no worries -- at this point , what I want most is to graduate with honors , not amour .
It does n't matter if they 're hot frat boys or dorky engineering nerds ; I 'll do 'em .
My only rule is that they leave both their emotional and overnight baggage at home , because I 've got to get up at 7:00 a.m. to take a midterm .

So while Obama can continue to try to reassure resistant Clinton loyalists in Appalachia that he ’s not a bogeyman from Madrassaland , he must also move on to the bigger picture for everyone else .
He must rekindle the “ fierce urgency of now ”  but not , as he did in the primaries , merely to evoke uplifting echoes of the civil - rights struggle or the need for withdrawal from Iraq .
Most Americans , unlike the press , are not obsessed by race .
( Those whites who are obsessed by race will not vote for Obama no matter what he or anyone else has to say about it . )
And most Americans have turned their backs on the Iraq war , no matter how much McCain keeps bellowing about “ victory . ”
The Bush White House is now poised to alight with the Iraqi government on a withdrawal timetable far closer to Obama ’s 16 months than McCain ’s vague promise of a 2013 endgame .
As Gen. David Petraeus returns home , McCain increasingly resembles those mad Japanese soldiers who remained at war on remote Pacific islands years after Hiroshima .
Economic anxiety is the new terrorism .
This is why the most relevant snapshot of voters ’ concerns was not to be found at Saddleback Church but at the Olympics last Saturday .
For all the political press ’s hype , only some 5.5 million viewers tuned in to the Rev. Rick Warren ’s show in Orange County , Calif .
Roughly three - quarters of them were over 50  in other words , the McCain base .
By contrast , a diverse audience of 32 million Americans tuned in to Beijing that night to watch Michael Phelps win his eighth gold medal .

This was a rare feel - good moment for a depressed country .
But the unsettling subtext of the Olympics has been as resonant for Americans as the Phelps triumph .
You could n’t watch NBC ’s weeks of coverage without feeling bombarded by an ascendant China whose superior cache of gold medals and dazzling management of the Games became a proxy for its spectacular commercial and cultural prowess in the new century .
Even before the Olympics began , a July CNN poll found that 70 percent of Americans fear China ’s economic might  about as many as find America on the wrong track .
Americans watching the Olympics could not escape the reality that China in particular and Asia in general will continue to outpace our country in growth while we remain mired in stagnancy and debt ( much of it held by China ) .
How we dig out of this quagmire is the American story that Obama must tell .
It is not a story of endless conflicts abroad but a potentially inspiring tale of serious economic , educational , energy and health - care mobilization at home .
We do n’t have the time or resources to go off on more quixotic military missions or to indulge in culture wars .
( In China , they ’re too busy exploiting scientific advances for competitive advantage to reopen settled debates about Darwin . )
Americans must band together for change before the new century leaves us completely behind .
The Obama campaign actually has plans , however imperfect or provisional , to set us on that path ; the McCain campaign offers only disposable Band - Aids typified by the “ drill now ” mantra that even McCain says will only have a “ psychological ” effect on gas prices .
Even as it points to America ’s future , the Obama campaign also has the duty to fill in its opponent ’s past .
McCain ’s attacks on Obama have worked : in last week ’s Los Angeles Times - Bloomberg poll , Obama ’s favorable rating declined from 59 to 48 percent and his negative rating rose from 27 to 35 .
Yet McCain still has a lower positive rating ( 46 percent ) and higher negative rating ( 38 ) than Obama .
McCain is not nearly as popular among Americans , it turns out , as he is among his journalistic camp followers .
Should voters actually get to know him , he has nowhere to go but down .
It 's quite difficult to make guns - portable ones , anyway - convincingly hi-tech .
Sure , you can add a laser sight , you can attach all kinds of crazy lights and optics , you can even have a boresight camera and helmet heads - up display for shooting round corners without sticking your neck out * .
But at the end of the day it will still , basically , be a gun .
Lumps of metal driven by expanding gas will fly out of the end at high speed , and make holes in things or people which they hit .
You 'd better be hiding around two corners these days .
Judge Dredd , one of relatively few sci - fi gunmen to stick mainly with projectiles rather than moving to rayguns of some kind , does a bit better .
Placing Justice Department boot to perp arse on the mean streets of Mega - City One , he uses implausibly reliable voice commandware to select different types of ammo for his Lawgiver pistol .
In some of the stories he had extremely exotic rounds available , too - rubber ricochet bullets for tricky bank shots , high - explosive warheads , even infrared heat - seekers .
But mostly it was just bullets .
That 's generally how it 's been in the real world , too .
Most small - arms manufacturers reckon it's a good day if they can make a shoulder weapon which will shoot fairly ordinary bullets accurately and not need too much maintenance .
Sometimes they can't manage even that .
Generally speaking , even the most fashionably equipped soldiers and cops today are still armed with weapons which were on offer sixty years ago and more - assault rifles or carbines , submachineguns , low - velocity grenade launchers of one kind and another , light machine guns .
There is a bewildering array of portable missile and rocket launchers , but these are generally meant for shooting up aircraft , vehicles or buildings - not people .
For that , you 're normally still firing boring old kinetic energy bullets , devoid of any major differences from those of World War II and earlier .
( One might say that nothing much has changed since the late 19th century , unless you happen to be a gun dork and up on all the intermediate - power cartridges guff . )
But those who like a bit of mad science fiction technology in their gun news will be pleased to hear that - according to reports - a long - stalled 1990s plan to kit out US soldiers with a truly wack new firearm has come back to life .
Essentially , the idea is to have a gun which shoots special , extra -big 25 mm slugs - sort of a cross between a normal bullet and a 40 mm launched grenade .
The projectile is thus big enough to put clever stuff in it , but small enough that a weapon carried by a normal person can shoot it a long way without the recoil knocking the user flat .
( Everyone loves 40 mm grenades , but they are so tubby that a shoulder launcher of reasonable weight and recoil can't throw them very fast - hence not very far either ) .
What you put in your big fat .98 - calibre ** slugs is a small HE - frag warhead - but that 's not the clever bit .
The clever bit is the electronic precision time fuse , which is set wirelessly by the gun 's systems at the moment of firing .
This means that the slug will explode at exactly the distance from the muzzle you want .
I 'm even less happy with this news : Wachovia loaned the Republican party $ 8 million - at the same time they had to be rescued by the FDIC and sold to Wells Fargo .
I can admit that I do n't know too much about the economy - after all , it 's hard to worry about inter - bank credit when you 're barely able to afford your own health insurance .
I do know that I 'm not happy in the least about bailing out Wall Street fat cats when I see a lot of my Indianapolis neighbors going " feral " as they lose their homes .
So let me see if I have this right .
Wachovia has a history of giving to the Republican party .
The company 's PAC gives 62 % of their donations to Republican candidates .
The federal government steps in to save Wachovia .
The bank gets sold to Citigroup by the FDIC , but at the last minute is bought by Wells Fargo .
George W. Bush , Republican , is in charge of the federal government .
While the average American can't get a car loan , Wachovia finds enough cash to give the Republicans an unsecured loan of $ 8 million to fund last minute campaign activities .
John McCain , Republican candidate for President , is best known for being a millionaire champion de-regulator of the financial industry .
Deregulation and industry insider greed caused the downfall of the economy and the need for the government to pump billions into the banking industry .
Who gets a good chunk of that change ?
Congressmen who voted in favor of the bailout , the de-regulators and industry insiders ...
Yeah , maybe - just maybe - there 's a reason why Americans are demanding change .
I know I sure as hell can't stomach another four years of this shit .
What 's pissed you off the most during this election cycle ?
What isolated incident makes your blood boil and definitely tips you into the Obama camp ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States military 's Northern Command , formed in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks , is dedicating a combat infantry team to deal with catastrophes in the U.S. , including terrorist attacks and natural disasters .
Soldiers preparing for a mission coordinated by Joint Task Force North , the U.S. Northern Command unit .
The 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry , which was first into Baghdad , Iraq , in 2003 , started its controversial assignment Wednesday .
The First Raiders will spend 2009 as the first active - duty military unit attached to the U.S. Northern Command since it was created .
They will be based in Fort Stewart , Georgia , and focus primarily on logistics and support for local police and rescue personnel , the Army says .
The plan is drawing skepticism from some observers who are concerned that the unit has been training with equipment generally used in law enforcement , including beanbag bullets , Tasers , spike strips and roadblocks .
That kind of training seems a bit out of line for the unit 's designated role as Northern Command 's CCMRF ( Sea Smurf ) , or CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force .
CBRNE stands for chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear and high - yield explosive incidents .
According to Northern Command 's
Web site , the CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force is a team that will ultimately number about 4,700 personnel from the different military branches that would deploy as the Department of Defense 's initial response force .
Its capabilities include search and rescue , decontamination , medical , aviation , communications and logistical support .
Each CCMRF will be composed of three functional task forces -- Task Force Operations , Task Force Medical and Task Force Aviation -- that have individual operational focus and mission skills , the Web site says .
The Army says the unit would be deployed to help local , state or federal agencies deal with such incidents , not take the lead .
The law enforcement - type training is not connected to its new mission , it says .
Use of active - duty military as a domestic police force has been severely limited since passage of the Posse Comitatus Act following the Civil War .
Bloggers are criticizing the new force , saying that because it has been training in law enforcement tactics it could be be used for domestic law enforcement .
Troops may be trained in non-lethal tactics , but they are not trained for what they may have to deal with in domestic situations , said Gene Healy , a vice president of the conservative think - tank Cato Institute .
Healy said civilian police and , if circumstances are extreme , National Guard troops under the command of state governors should keep the peace .
" Federal troops should always be a last resort , never a first responder , " he said .
Critics also point to a General Accounting Office study in 2003 that found that domestic security missions put a strain on a military stretched thin by two simultaneous wars , and that a unit 's readiness for combat is reduced if the members have to take time out to respond to an emergency at home .
The U.S. military " is not a Swiss Army knife , " ready to fight the Taliban one week , respond to a hurricane the next and put down a major political protest the third week , Healy said .
The Army says the non-lethal training is an outgrowth of missions that troops have faced around the world in recent years .
" We need a lot more in our toolbox in order to deal with angry people on the street , " said Col. Barry Johnson of U.S. Army North .
The units are well - trained in the skills they might need to assist the Northern Command , and that wo n't weaken the unit when and if it goes back to Iraq .
The designation of a specific unit as the CCMRF is a step forward , he said .
The active - duty military has long had units capable of handling chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or other domestic emergencies , such as hurricanes , Johnson said .
But they were assigned as needed .
Now they will have a unit that knows in advance that it might be called upon to respond in a domestic emergency .
" We do n't have the luxury to wish these things away .
We have to imagine the unimaginable , " Johnson said .

So , I ’ve really just had it with the #django chan on freenode .
I ’ve gone there several times for help only to be treated like whale turd , essentially because I ’m a newbie to django I suppose .
They seem to have an issue with that there .
It ’s not that you ca n’t get answers there , mind you , it ’s that the answers are served up cold and begrudgingly with generous side portions of arrogance and self - importance .
This is n’t a judgment of every person on the chan — it ’s the general take - away I ’ve personally had .
However , I really like django 🙂
So , rather than just whine and then sit idly by hoping things change , I started a chan for django newbies called , appropriately , #django - newbie on freenode .
If you ’re a newbie , come join in !
If you ’re not , come help the newbies find the docs they need to get where they want to go .
So , in my continuing series of simple Flex examples , I am posting an example of how to build mathematically generated Fractals .
In this app , we have a button , a color picker , a numeric stepper , and of course , our friend the Canvas .
To use the example , choose a “ trunk ” color from the color picker , and click somewhere in the Canvas ( which is pretty much the entire stage ) .
It will call a function that will draw the tree .
This function is iterative , meaning it calls itself over and over again to create the proper number of branches , etc .
At each iteration , it will also make the color more ‘ green ’ , and the line weight one pixel smaller .
We pass in a few seed variables to get it started , including an initial direction ( pointing straight up ) , the initial color , and an X and Y coordinate to start at .
The last variable we pass in also dictates how think the trunk should be ( and therefore setting how many iterations deep the function should go ) .
Again , you can view 100 % of the source code of this application by clicking on the image above and running the app , right clicking , and going to View Source .
I encourage comments on the example and code — let me know if this is useful at all !
This app should be a good example on some of the math and graphics functions in Flex .
There is also a demonstration on how to break up an RGB value and modify it programmatically , in addition to recursive functions .
Hope you have fun , and enjoy !
I think I only have one more example based on math stuff , so if that bores you , there is other cool stuff to come !
Edit :
Be careful with the " trunk size " or the number of iterations .
Slower PC ’s have a hard time with numbers larger than 10 .
Only choose a number > 13 if you have a really slick pc .

Two weeks after the death of Joerg Haider , former leader of the far - right Austrian Freedom Party , media attention has moved from Haider ’s fascistic political life to his personal life , with the politician ’s sexual identity undergoing a bit of a queering , much to the surprise of his ultranationalistic supporters .
Haider was a 58 - year - old married father of two .
Time :
In life , Austria ’s best known far - right politician , Joerg Haider , was a media staple .
In death , interest in him has skyrocketed again , thanks to the revelation that he may have been gay or bisexual .
Haider was killed in a high - speed car accident on October 11 .
Since then , Europe ’s newspapers , especially those in Germany , have published stories and photographs of the leader surrounded by young men in what the newspapers call gay bars .
“ Was Haider Living a Double Life ? ” the mass market German daily Bild blared this week .
A later story showed photographs of Haider ’s deputy Stefan Petzner in low cut jeans and a dolphin tattooed on his hip .
Even the otherwise circumspect Austrian media is broaching the topic .
Newspapers there have published pictures of Haider , who was 58 , partying with groups of young men , including shots from the night of his death .
“ Everybody knew about his sexual orientation , ” Thomas Hofer , a former magazine editor who is now an independent political consultant in Vienna , says .
“ But there was a consensus in the Austrian media not to write about it . ”
No Austrian newspaper has openly declared Haider gay so far .
But the revelations of the past two weeks are far more specific than in the past .
“ The Austrian press has already gone well beyond where they ’d been up to now , ” says Hofer .
“ It ’s a crucial period for the media here . ”

Elaine Cato , 40 , never intended to become a bra designer .
All she wanted , seven months after the birth of her second daughter in 1998 , was to look hot for a New Year 's Eve party .
Last week , Maidenform rolled out for other women what she invented to solve the problem , calling it the Breakthrough Backless bra .
About a month before ringing in 1999 , the size - four Nashville mother of two had set her sights on fitting into a black , backless number for the party .
The problem : Her 34DD bust needed a little support after nursing baby No. 2 , and she could not find a backless bra that worked .
" When I could n't find anything on the market to support this outfit , I thought maybe I could take one of my bras and alter it , " says Cato .
" I started to experiment with reconfiguring the straps . "
She was not an expert .
" I took a sewing class in high school , and my mom taught me stuff about sewing , " she says , " but I never went beyond the basics . "
But she cut and sewed some old bras together and ultimately created a backless bra that even had five other configurations , including halter and crisscross , and was a hit at the New Year 's Eve party .
" When I wore the bra that night … women were asking , ' What do you have on ? ' " Cato says .
" They knew that for a heavy - busted woman with small body frame , the adhesive types of bras on the market really do n't give you the lift and support that you want . "
Cato saw marketing potential in her bra and figured out how to file for a patent because she could n't afford the $ 4,000 fee for a patent attorney .
She was granted the patent in 2000 , but her big break came after she heard about ABC reality show American Inventor , which had a million - dollar top prize for the best invention .
She won an audition to compete in the show 's second season last year .
Her bra finished second in the competition , but Maidenform noticed and surprised her with a licensing offer on the season 's final episode .
Maidenform tweaked the backless bra , but it remains true to Cato 's design .
It has adjustable straps that are attached to the outside edge of the cups in the front , loop over the shoulder and come back under the arm to attach to sturdy but pliable 2 - inch wings that extend back from the cups .
It went on sale at retailers last week for a suggested price of $ 32 and will be the centerpiece of Maidenform marketing this year that emphasizes new products and seeks new customers .
The tagline of the campaign : This Feels Right .
Innovation " is our big story for the year , " says Sally Skidmore , Maidenform 's vice president of marketing and advertising .
" We 're bringing something new to the market that ( the female consumer has ) never seen before . "
The Breakthrough Backless bra and other new products , including seamless and single - construction bras , are featured in the new ads .
Print ads will run in magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Glamour .
Online advertising includes banner ads , as well as video and ring tones at MySpace.com .
Billboards and posters will run in out - of - home ad spaces ranging from women 's locker rooms at gyms to a giant display on a tall , old warehouse along the Long Island Expressway in New York .
The warehouse has two billboards on the roof , a giant poster down the middle and walls of windows at each end have been painted to look as if women are throwing their old bras out the windows .
The idea : " Out with the old , in with the new . "
" We 're really trying to encompass something new for Maidenform , " says Greg Smith , chief creative officer for The Via Group , the Portland , Maine , agency that created the campaign .
" How we are able to market the brand is derived from what they have done with the product . "
Enlarge A Nashville mom's invention of a backless bra is catching on , with Maidenform marketing the idea .

Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange has spent two years fighting for justice for his family A court in the western Indian state of Maharashtra has sentenced six people to death for killing four members of a lower - caste Dalit family in 2006 .
Another two were sentenced to life in prison .
All eight were found guilty last week .
Three others were acquitted .
The Dalits , a woman , daughter and two sons , were killed by an upper - caste mob in a land row .
The husband escaped .
The case led to widespread protests .
Crimes against Dalits , formerly known as untouchables , often go unpunished .
The prosecution argued that the killings were caste - related , but the court rejected the allegation .
Prosecutors plan to appeal .
Discrimination against Dalits , who are at the bottom of the centuries - old Hindu caste system , is a punishable offence in India .
Even so , campaigners say violence against Dalits is on the rise .
Raped
The brutal killings took place on 29 September 2006 in a remote village called Khairlanji , in Bhandara district in the north - east of the state .
Dalits are often the victims of inter caste violence Surekha Bhotmange , her 17 - year - old daughter Priyanka and two sons , 19 - year - old Roshan and 21 - year - old Sudhir , were at home when an upper - caste mob broke into their mud hut and murdered them .
The four were dragged out and beaten with bicycle chains , sticks and other weapons , the court in Bhandara heard .
The mother and daughter were stripped and raped by the mob , prosecutors said .
The women 's bodies were found in a nearby canal the next day .
Surekha 's husband , Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange , managed to escape and hid behind a tree from where he watched his family being killed .
He pursued the case with the support of several human rights activists .
Death sentences are relatively rare in India - and even more rarely carried out .
According to law , the death penalty must be confirmed by a higher court , and may be appealed against .
Menial
The killings led to widespread protests across Maharashtra and in November 2006 the case was handed over to the Central Bureau for Investigation ( CBI ) .
A month later , the agency charged 11 people with criminal conspiracy , unlawful assembly with deadly weapons , murder , trespass , outraging the modesty of women , destruction of evidence and caste - related offences .
About 10.2 % of Maharashtra 's population of about 100 million belong to the Dalit community .
In the traditional Hindu caste system , Dalits were considered the lowest of the low castes .
They were expected to do the most menial jobs in villages .
They could not share basic amenities , including drinking water , with upper - caste people .
Such practices still exist in rural areas .

Coffee only has nine calories per cup , but before you sip that hot , steamy brew , it 's important to know the relationship between caffeine and weight gain .
Drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages can actually sabotage your efforts to lose weight .
Relationship Between Caffeine and Weight Gain
If you drink caffeinated beverages throughout the day , you may actually be causing yourself to eat more .
That 's right .
If you 're struggling to lose weight , it may help you to kick the caffeine habit .
Here 's why :
Food Cravings
Do you wake each morning with new determination to eat healthy and within your calorie limit , only to find yourself snacking or eating more at lunch than you had first planned ?
Limiting your intake of caffeine can help you control your food cravings and stay within your dieting goals .
According to a study published by the National Institutes of Health , caffeine affects cravings for food because it raises the stress hormone cortisol .
Cortisol raises heart rate and blood pressure and tells your body to increase its energy stores .
This results in the body craving sweets .
So if you 're wondering why you snacked on cookies in the afternoon , it could have something to do with that coffee you drank with breakfast .
Appetite Stimulant
Low blood sugar , also known as hypoglycemia , occurs when blood glucose levels drop .
When this happens , your body does n't have enough energy to perform regular activities because glucose provides important fuel for your body .
The main dietary sources for glucose are carbohydrates like rice , potatoes , bread , fruit , and sweets .
According to Life Extension Magazine , drinking caffeine can trigger hypoglycemia .
The body 's reaction is an increased appetite and cravings for higher calorie foods .
The more caffeine consumed , the more your body urges you to eat .
Stress
Caffeine is known to make people feel jittery , but its effects go beyond that .
The stress caused from drinking caffeine can take on other forms :
Physical
Mental
Emotional
Caffeine - induced stress can actually interfere with how you feel about yourself and trigger emotional eating or a need for comfort food .
This correlation between caffeine and weight gain is another good reason to consider weaning yourself from caffeine to reduce stress hormones that result in emotional eating .
Cortisol Levels
Since caffeine can raise cortisol levels , it 's important to take a closer look at what this means .
Higher levels of cortisol can leave you feeling anxious , fearful and even lashing out in frustration and anger .
This diminished feeling of well - being can even lead to feelings of depression and affect your ability to communicate and learn .
Elevated cortisol levels can also result in increased belly fat .
Decreasing caffeine intake combined with regular exercise can help you reach that goal of having a flatter stomach and better overall health .
Caffeine and Insulin Resistance
According to the American Diabetes Association , caffeine may also contribute to insulin resistance .
When this happens , glucose and insulin builds up in the blood .
It 's common knowledge that drinking coffee can also cause insomnia and sleep deprivation .
Both of these conditions are related to insulin resistance , and insulin is a metabolism hormone .
It affects every cell in the body .
Insulin plays many roles , including the following :
Regulates blood sugar
Controls the storage of fat
Helps direct the functions of amino acids , fatty acids and carbohydrates
Regulates the liver 's synthesis of cholesterol
Affects appetite control
Affects kidney function
A consistent elevation of insulin presents other possible problems , such as the following :
Raised blood pressure
Raised cholesterol levels
Stores food as fat instead of using it for fuel
Causes kidneys to retain excess fluid
Damages arteries
Elevates triglycerides
Changes protein into sugar and fat
Breaking the caffeine habit can help lower the risk of insulin resistance and , as a result , help manage your weight .
Get Better Control Over Your Appetite Without Caffeine
Do n't let caffeine sabotage your efforts to lose weight .
Limit your caffeine intake , and you 'll have better control over your appetite .
Instead of reaching for a cup of coffee , learn to drink herbal teas , water , or smoothies made with fresh fruit .

Human rights watchdog Amnesty International said Tuesday that it is halting its operation in India , citing reprisals by the government and the freezing of its bank accounts by Indian authorities .
Amnesty International India said it has laid off its staff and paused all its ongoing campaign and research work on human rights , and that Indian authorities froze its bank accounts on suspicion of violating rules on foreign funding .
It said in a statement that the authorities ' actions were “ the latest in the incessant witch hunt of human rights organizations by the government of India , ” and that the group 's fundraising was being portrayed as money laundering because it has challenged the “ governmen ...
The Wall Street Journal had a fascinating story on the regions with the most underwater mortgages , together with an invaluable map .
When you look at the map , you 'll see that the areas facing the greatest impact are also the areas most affected by immigration .
The Inland Empire of California , metro Phoenix and Las Vegas , south Florida — all have had heavy influxes of Latino immigrants or of Anglos leaving immigrant - dominated places like Los Angeles and Miami - Dade counties .
Homeowning here was in effect subsidized by the toxic - waste mortgages pumped through the system by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and other improvident financial institutions .
Now evidence is accumulating that Latino migrants are returning to their home countries because of the housing bust ( construction jobs have disappeared ) , tougher immigration law enforcement , and a longer - term demographic trend that may be having an effect : a sharp decline in birthrates in Mexico and other Latin countries about 18 years ago .
For speculation , some of which goes farther than I would , on how immigration has interacted with cheap mortgages , you can see any number of items in Steve Sailer 's interesting blog .
I hope to look further into this when I have the time — but campaign 2008 is calling .

GREEN -MINDED folk of many shades came to Spain this month , to talk about the need to save from human recklessness as much as possible of nature 's bounty of genes , habitats and species .
They brought bad tidings .
Common birds are in decline across the world .
Almost one in four species of mammals is in danger of extinction .
If current trends continue until 2050 , fisheries will be exhausted .
As it is , deforestation costs the world more each year than the current financial crisis has cost in total , one economist argued .
In theory , virtually all the world 's governments are committed to limiting the damage .
In 1992 , at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro , they signed a treaty called the Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) .
In 2002 , under its auspices , they vowed to bring about “ a significant reduction ” in the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 .
The pledge became one of the Millennium Development Goals , the United Nations ' eight fondest ambitions for the world .
Yet this target now looks unattainable , said most participants at the World Conservation Congress , which concluded in Barcelona on October 14th .
The meeting was awash with gloomy forecasts .
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , the network of conservation groups that organised the congress , released the latest version of its “ red list ” of threatened species .
It describes the health of all species whose populations have been assessed — almost 45,000 this time round .
At first glance , the proportion of species at risk seemed to have fallen slightly .
But that , the compilers note , simply reflects the expansion of its coverage beyond the creatures seen as most in danger .
Of 223 species whose status has changed since last year , 82 % were closer to extinction .
The IUCN also released a “ comprehensive assessment ” of the status of all known species of mammals .
It found that 22 % were threatened or extinct , and the well - being of a further 15 % was unknown .
For amphibians , the outlook is grimmer : a full 31 % of them are at risk , and the status of a further 25 % is uncertain .
Sampling of species in other categories suggests similarly dire outlooks , with some 24 % of reptiles and 32 % of crabs thought to be threatened .
For the most part , these findings do not reflect the latest data on global warming .
But another IUCN study released at the congress found that 35 % of the world 's birds , 52 % of its amphibians and 71 % of its warm - water corals were “ particularly susceptible ” to the threats from warming .
Last year , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which is studying global warming for the UN , said 20 - 30 % of species could die out if global average temperatures rise by more than 2 °C or so .
And even today 's rate of extinctions , one Barcelona delegate noted , is 1,000 times faster than the norm before man made a mess .
What does the loss of other species cost humans ?
Many congress - goers talked about valuing “ ecosystem services ” : natural processes that benefit people , such as the pollination of crops , the purification of water in wetlands and the sequestration of carbon in soil and forests .
A study released this year said the world was losing € 50 billion ( $ 68 billion ) in ecosystem services each year because of damage to nature .
Biodiversity underpins ecosystem services .
Bees can't pollinate , nor can trees store carbon , if they have all died .
And it seems to matter that ecosystems contain more than a handful of species .
Diverse systems are better at capturing carbon , storing water and preserving fisheries .
Just how diverse an ecosystem has to be in order to supply the goods and services needed by man is a matter of debate — a debate made harder by the fact that many species may have uses that man has not yet found .
And regardless of its uses for humans , many see a moral imperative to save biodiversity .
Ecuador 's new constitution duly confers on ecosystems “ the inalienable right to exist , flourish and evolve ” .
In a report for the British government , Johan Eliasch , a businessman and environmentalist , suggests a virtuous circle : climate change could be slowed , biodiversity saved and poverty alleviated if forests were included in carbon markets .
Deforestation is responsible for so many emissions that allowing countries to claim carbon credits for reducing the pace at which they cut down their forests could cut the cost of halving global carbon emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 by 50 % .
And , in the process , deforestation rates would be reduced by 75 % by 2030 .
But this would cost the rich world money : $ 4 billion over the next five years , and a further $ 11 - 19 billion a year by 2020 .
In the short term , there is little sign of governments becoming better stewards of nature .
Only 30 or so of the 191 countries that are party to the CBD have made plans to protect biodiversity , as the treaty demands .
Another study released at the congress found that the world 's biggest economies were spending only a fraction of the money needed to police protected areas ; they were also falling short on legal and administrative measures needed to stop the spread of invasive species and eradicate the trade in endangered species .
Money , of course , is likely to get tighter as the world economy slows and governments rescue struggling banks .
Many at the congress said that nature , too , needed a bail - out .
As Andrew Mitchell of Global Canopy Programme , a forest - conservation group , puts it : “ Rainforests work as a giant natural utility company .
If we do n't start paying for it , we will get cut off .
Instead of simply preventing the next global credit crunch , it is time to start thinking about averting the rainforest crunch as well . ”
Julia Marton - Lefèvre , the head of the IUCN , agrees .
“ Business as usual is simply not an option , ” she says .
But that is the option many governments seem to be choosing .
Clayton Cubitt blogs :
" Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin quoted an unidentified " writer " who extolled the virtues of small - town America : " We grow good people in our small towns , with honesty and sincerity and dignity . "
( 9/3/08 ) The unidentified writer was Westbrook Pegler ( 1894 -1969 ) , the ultraconservative newspaper columnist whose widely syndicated columns ( at its peak , 200 newspapers and 12 million readers ) targeted the New Deal establishment , labor leaders , intellectuals , homosexuals , Jews , and poets . "
I disagree with him fully .
Except for the poets .
Fucking poets .
More on Pegler at TNR , here 's Wikipedia .
Here are a few other quotes Palin did n't use :
Jews , he said , could not be the victims of persecution because persecution " connotes injustice …
They are , instead , enduring retaliation , or punishment . "
( D. Levitas , The Terrorist Next Door : The Militia Movement and the Radical Right , Macmillan , 2002 , p. 71 . )
He advanced the theory that American Jews of Eastern European descent were " instinctively sympathetic to Communism , however outwardly respectable they appeared . "
( The New York Times , Obituary : " Free - Swinging Critic , " June 25 , 1969 , p. 43 ) .
He had a habit of calling Jews " geese " because they , in his words , hiss when they talk , gulp down everything before them , and foul everything in their wake .
( Diane McWhorter , " Revisiting the controversial career of Westbrook Pegler , " Slate , March 4 2004 ) .
( … ) In 1963 , less than 3 months after Martin Luther King Jr. , delivered his famous " I Have a Dream Speech , " he wrote in a column , " [ It is ] clearly the bounden duty of all intelligent Americans to proclaim and practice bigotry . "
( D. Levitas , The Terrorist Next Door : The Militia Movement and the Radical Right , Macmillan , 2002 , p. 71 )
Update : Blogger and Boing Boing reader Karen says , " Robert Kennedy Jr. was rightfully outraged about this too .
I blogged about it here . "
Bob Chapman | October 4 , 2008
Well , what a surprise , we 've been sold down the river for the usual " thirty pieces of silver " by our Congress and our President , working together in unison , for the nth time .
The $ 700 billion bailout , a mere sideshow , sweetened with 150 billion in pork , has now been approved so that Wall Street can continue to game the system and its hapless suckers , the American sheople .
Just put some pork in , and the hungry piranha in Congress would legislate their own mothers into slavery for a nice juicy morsel of that pork .
And never mind the moral hazard dripping from the pork , because that makes it taste all the sweeter .
If you were wondering why all the healthier financial institutions , and of course we say that with tongue - in - cheek because we know they are all eventually slated for destruction by the explosive blast of a Quadrillion Dollar Derivative Death - Star , were buying all the gargantuan commercial and investment banks that are laden with toxic waste , you now have your answer .
This is why all the shareholders in these zombie - acquisition deals are getting vaporized .
Their assets were more valuable than they thought , because unbeknownst to them , the US government was about to pay far more for these assets than they were worth .
But since the shareholders were not Illuminists , they were not privy to this information .
And look at the disgrace with Citibank and Wachovia .
After Citigroup wipes out the Wachovia shareholders , with the help of the FDIC , suddenly Wells Fargo , which now sees the value of all of Wachovia 's crap paper via the Paulson Ponzi - Plan , comes through with a better offer .
The Wachovia shareholders should attack Citigroup based on their fraudulent balance sheets , because they were in no position to acquire anything on this scale , or any other scale for that matter .
The Illuminist insiders were all told in advance that Wall Street 's Excellent Bailout Bonanza would be stuffed down the throats of gullible US taxpayers .
Note how many of these zombie - acquisition - deals were done before the bailout plan was even proposed on September 20 .
As you can see , the masters of the universe are so arrogant that they were willing to bet hundreds of billions of dollars that the Paulson Ponzi - Plan would be successfully shoved up our collective butts by our bought - and - paid - for - or - compromised government " representatives , " so - called , despite the hue and cry of the sheople against this monstrosity , sometimes by as much as 300 to 1 .
All that cesspool paper that they now own by virtue of these zombie - acquisition - deals is very valuable to them .
It will be sold to the government for far more than it is worth so that financial institutions around the world can somehow pretend that the losses are far less than they really are .
And never mind that everyone in the world knows this stuff is crap , because we will all now have some sort of collective pipedream in the United Goldilocks Matrix .
We can just see Hank and Ben firing up the pods and installing the everything - will - turn - out - juuuust - right software , so we can all pretend that the credit - crunch never happened .
We will just ignore it .
This is another Illuminist fantasy that will turn out about as well as their subprime scam .
Of course , the reality is , whether this cesspool paper worth pennies on the dollar is sold for its hold - to - maturity value or for some lesser , but still outrageously exaggerated , figure , the sheople will eat just about everything they pay out for this toxic garbage via the bailout plan .
This stuff is crap even under current conditions , which are worsening by the minute .
Just imagine what this stuff will be worth as the real estate markets , and the value of our new collateral , continue to fade off into the sunset while we enter into the Very Large Depression , which is now insured to happen by virtue of the Paulson Ponzi - Plan .
And how much less will it be worth as the rate of return on this garbage gets buried by the upcoming double - digit interest rates that will be born out of the hyperinflation generated by all these bailouts , thus reducing its present value quite drastically .
Then throw in the proposed government workouts , complete with interest rate reductions and cram - downs , just for good measure , and that ten cents on the dollar paper that we paid thirty , forty or fifty cents on the dollar for , will soon become worthless .
Making matters even worse , all this toxic waste will be sold by select Illuminist institutions at what will be sham " arranged " auctions where everyone gets to sell what they want for the price they want , as long as they are Illuminist insiders .
Everyone else can of course go scratch .
With Hanky Panky as the real , unsupervised or rubber - stamped auctioneer , you can bet that we , the sheople , will be taken to the Illuminati 's slaughterhouse to be sliced up into some prime cuts for the elitist carnivores .
Mutton chops anyone ?
Dinner is now served , complete with caviar and champagne .
Bon appetite .
The Illuminati will now act like drunken sailors at a keg party .
They will drain the keg in short order , and then ask for more .
If they do not get what they want , they will get rowdy , pounding the tables with their mugs and threatening a brawl that will destroy the tavern if they do not get their next round , pronto .
Out comes the next keg , which gets drained even faster than the first because everyone is inebriated , and the next round of table pounding and threats becomes manifest .
This process will proceed until everyone at the party has more than they can handle and passes out .
Then comes the derivatives tsunami that will drown them all in a sea of counterparty risk , an event which will be used to usher in a new Orwellian , corporatist fascist state , where the financial , manufacturing and other major industries are all nationalized .
We , and our European and Canadian counterparts , will all then resemble our fellow fascists , Marxists and dictators in Russia , in China , in the Middle East , in Asia and in South America , and the formation of world government will seem like the most the most natural thing to do , when everyone is on the same page , after the pesky , arrogant United States has been humbled into submission .
As we mentioned , this Excellent Bailout Bonanza , this Paulson Ponzi - Plan , is just a sideshow to distract everyone from the real issue , which is of course the Derivative Death - Star , with a Quadrillion Dollar mass that is about to implode , detonate , and morph into a financial black hole that will suck the entire world economy into its dark , massive , foreboding center .
The subprime debacle is just one of the many fuses leading into the gargantuan derivatives powder keg .
The subprime paper to be auctioned is little more than a catalyst for the creation of the real disaster , which are the credit - default swaps and interest rate swaps , an entangled , Byzantine labyrinth of opaque , unregulated counterparty risk that will be ignited by continuing corporate bankruptcies and double - digit interest rates that will be created by a hyper - inflated economy awash in bailout dollars which the Fed will have created out of thin air .
Foreign nations with dollar forex cannot possibly keep buying all the treasuries that will have to be created to fund all these bailouts because they are all experiencing rampant inflation , and printing more of their own domestic currencies to absorb the dollars necessary to purchase treasuries is no longer possible without risking social upheaval and revolution as hyperinflation destroys their economies .
This means that some , or even most , of the new treasuries that will be created by the Treasury and the Fed to fund the bailouts and deficits will have to be monetized , which is immediately inflationary .
M3 is about to explode as these many monetizations and the Fed 's trillions in liquidity injections continue to flood the fiat money and credit system , which will continue in its cryogenic state despite the Paulson Ponzi - Plan that will now be implemented in an attempt to re-inflate the credit markets , which are the lifeblood of our debt - based , fiat money system , thanks to the cessation of the gold standard .
Everyone on Wall Street knows that the subprime paper is not the real problem .
The real reason they distrust one another , and will not lend to one another , is the unknown counterparty risk that will go into a plasma state when the Derivative Death - Star detonates .
It is the opaque , unregulated OTC derivatives market that they are really afraid of .
Due to the fact that you have 70 or more trillion of credit default swaps insuring 5 trillion in bonds , a ten billion dollar loss by a large corporation can on average morph into a 140 billion disaster of epic proportions that could wipe out several other companies , whose own credit - default swap counterparty risk would then ignite , in a chain reaction reminiscent of a thermonuclear explosion .
Remember , credit default swaps are not true derivatives with a zero net sum .
They are insurance policies .
But unlike most insurance , there are no regulators or loss reserves , thanks to Slick Willie Clinton and the Congress , which passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000 .
Worse yet , they can be used to insure property which the insured party does not even own .
Hence , you can see why everyone trembles at the thought of this radioactive sector going thermonuclear .
Did you see how the stock market received the Paulson Ponzi - Plan ?
They used it as an opportunity to de-leverage , which is pretty much all it was good for , and the Dow was taken to a new low in the process .
No problems have been solved , and we will continue on to our ignominious destiny with recession , depression , and a third world Banana Republic standing where we are all but irrelevant to the world economy .
No one will have anything but worthless paper to spend for foreign tangible goods .
Americans and Europeans are too stupid to understand the necessity of owning precious metals under these disastrous circumstances , and they will have little of value to trade for the tangible goods exported by the world 's manufacturing economies , who have taken over America 's role as the lead producer thanks to free trade , globalization , off - shoring , outsourcing and both legal and illegal immigration .
The main purpose of the IF is to wise these dolts up , and save them from the planned destruction of our economy at the hands of the Illuminati .
This situation is survivable , but advance notice and preparation are the key to success .
Gold and silver are the only remedy for what now ails our nation , and nations around the world .
The Senate financial market rescue bill would temporarily allow the FDIC to borrow unlimited amounts of money from the Treasury Department in order to provide larger government deposit coverage that would extend until the end of next year , which really means forever .
This has all the earmarks of a banana republic .
The latest propaganda from the government and the Illuminist think tanks tells us that , treasuries are more secure than gold because they are backed by the US government and gold has a counter party risk by whoever is storing your gold as the counter party .
I ’ve never heard any stupider comments .

I guess it depends on your point of view .
Maybe it 's the liberal elitist in me , but I want to know that the President of the United States gathers information from varied and challenging sources and then makes thoughtful , reasoned and logical choices in guiding this country .
As is patently clear from both his Senate career and his friends and colleagues , that would not be John McCain .
As his out - of - left - field choice of running mate perfectly exemplifies , John McCain is a gambler and a reactor , making decisions intuitively and quickly .
That may work well in some arenas ( although I 'm hard - pressed to think of one other than the mentioned fighter pilot ) , but as President , what a recipe for a worldwide disaster .
Especially considering how poor his intuition has served in critical areas like the economy .
SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN : As a politician , I am instinctive , often impulsive .
JUDY WOODRUFF : McCain goes on to say , " I do n't torture myself over decisions .
I make them as quickly as I can , quicker than the other fellow , if I can .
Often , my haste is a mistake , but I live with the consequences without complaint . "
But that quick - to - decide approach gives pause to some . [..]
FORMER SEN .
GARY HART ( D ) , Colorado :
On a scale of pure intuitive , pure impulsive versus pure cerebral , pure analytical , I 'm putting him very much on the former end .
See , the problem with this approach is that McCain is not the only person forced to live with his consequences and that 's where all voters should be concerned .
Further , as his own Chief of Staff proudly admits , McCain serves no other master than himself , refusing to commit to his party leaders or even participate in their organization to push legislation .
MARK BUSE : The Senate leadership used to get very frustrated with him when they would do their whip checks , their vote counts in advance of votes .
He would n't answer .
He would n't give an answer .
His answer would be , " I 'll vote how I want to vote . "
He would n't let them count his vote necessarily .
He does n't do the daily attendance check .
JUDY WOODRUFF : What 's that ?
MARK BUSE : In the Senate , every morning , they check to see what numbers are there so that they know what might happen .
We do n't respond to that .
Hard to buy that whole " Country First " crap when he 's shown over his entire Senate career that it 's " McCain First " .

SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN : I 've been called a maverick .
Now we have a team of mavericks that 's going to ...
JUDY WOODRUFF : McCain has long been described as a maverick , a title he 's happy to brandish .
As evidence , he touts his work with Democrats on issues like campaign finance and immigration reform .
McCain staffers describe a boss who makes decisions outside of partisan pressures .
MARK BUSE , Chief of Staff , McCain Senate Office :
He has a concept of party .
He believes in his party , but he 's more than happy to cross the aisle .
And he does it all the time to the anguish of those who demand party unity .
JUDY WOODRUFF : Mark Buse is McCain 's Senate office chief of staff .
Buse started working for the senator 17 years ago as an intern .
MARK BUSE : The Senate leadership used to get very frustrated with him when they would do their whip checks , their vote counts in advance of votes .

We do n't respond to that .
While he respects the leadership , he respects their jobs , he 's not there to serve them .
JUDY WOODRUFF : Republican Jon Kyl , the other Arizona senator , has known McCain for over 20 years and says much of McCain 's decision - making style can be attributed to his military experience .
SEN . JON KYL ( R ) , Arizona : I think , partly as a result of his background in the United States Navy and partly because of his personality and his disposition , John goes a lot on instincts .
He 's peripatetic .
He covers a lot of ground in a short period of time .
And so he's not one to sit around , and ponder , and wring his hands , and try to figure out what the right thing is .
He 's got an idea right off , and then he 'll take advice from his advisers , his staff , and others around him , but he makes a judgment relatively quickly , sticks with it , does n't look back .
And in that sense , he 's a leader that bases a lot of what he decides on his instinct , on his judgment , and his sense of what 's right and wrong and proper .
JUDY WOODRUFF : As an example , Kyl points to an international crisis that flared between Russia and the Republic of Georgia .
SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN : Today , we are all Georgians .
SEN .
JON KYL : John McCain immediately had an idea of what was right and wrong .
He immediately had a view about what should be said about it in criticism of the Russian invasion , and he did it .
He did n't get any advice from advisers on that .
That was pure John McCain .
JUDY WOODRUFF : In his book , " Worth the Fighting For , " McCain himself describes his instinctive approach .
SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN : As a politician , I am instinctive , often impulsive .
JUDY WOODRUFF : McCain goes on to say , " I do n't torture myself over decisions .

Former Colorado Democratic Senator Gary Hart , a one - time presidential candidate himself , befriended McCain when McCain was the Navy liaison to the Senate .
Hart later served as a groomsman in John and Cindy McCain 's wedding .
FORMER SEN .
GARY HART ( D ) , Colorado :
On a scale of pure intuitive , pure impulsive versus pure cerebral , pure analytical , I 'm putting him very much on the former end .
Now , he 's a smart guy or he would n't be where he is , but I do n't think -- I think he'd be the first to say he's not a rocket scientist or a pure analytical brain , if you will .
I think he , John , reacts to things .
JUDY WOODRUFF : Hart says he has great respect for McCain but is supporting Barack Obama for president .
GARY HART : I have hesitation , probably would have were John McCain a Democrat , about a personality in the Oval Office who is more impulsive and intuitive , if you will , than analytical and thoughtful .
Now , John McCain is not seat - of - the - pants .
I 'm not -- I do n't want to give the impression that he just -- whatever he had for breakfast makes the decision of going to war .
It 's not quite like that .
But I think , again , on a scale , I 'd prefer somebody who 's a little more thoughtful , a little less impulsive , and a little more analytical .
JUDY WOODRUFF : Long - time Congress - watcher Norman Ornstein worked alongside Senator McCain on campaign finance legislation .
NORMAN ORNSTEIN , American Enterprise Institute : John McCain is a fighter pilot .
A lot of his persona comes from being a fighter pilot .
This is a man who not only constantly questions authority , but is fond of making last - minute , from - the - gut , impulsive , risk - taking decisions , and believing to his bones that there may be a risk here , but it will pay off .
An impulsive decision - making style is fine if you 're riding a jet .
An impulsive decision - making style is fine if you 're piloting a jet in combat .
It 's fine if you 're a senator where the consequences are not going to be that long - lasting .
It 's a real question mark when you move into the presidency .
WASHINGTON — Having tried without success to unlock frozen credit markets , the Treasury Department is considering taking ownership stakes in many United States banks to try to restore confidence in the financial system , according to government officials .
Treasury officials say the just - passed $ 700 billion bailout bill gives them the authority to inject cash directly into banks that request it .
Such a move would quickly strengthen banks ’ balance sheets and , officials hope , persuade them to resume lending .
In return , the law gives the Treasury the right to take ownership positions in banks , including healthy ones .
The Treasury plan was still preliminary and it was unclear how the process would work , but it appeared that it would be voluntary for banks .
The proposal resembles one announced on Wednesday in Britain .
Under that plan , the British government would offer banks like the Royal Bank of Scotland , Barclays and HSBC Holdings up to $ 87 billion to shore up their capital in exchange for preference shares .
It also would provide a guarantee of about $ 430 billion to help banks refinance debt .
“ My first reaction when I heard about this was , ‘ Honey , I could have dressed you for a lot less than that , ’ ” said Cindi Leive , the editor in chief of Glamour magazine , which asked readers on Wednesday to vote in an online poll whether the expenses were too high ; 72 percent said they were .
“ In general , she looks terrific , ” Ms. Leive said , “ but if you asked me to figure out where the $ 150,000 went , I ’m not sure I could tell you . ”
It is not yet clear whether Ms. Palin chose her new wardrobe or worked with stylists and other advisers , or what message her clothes were intended to broadcast .
In fact , most of her bracelet sleeve jackets are so generic - looking that they could have come from any of the favored designers of Washington politicians : Oscar de la Renta , Escada and St. John .
The square ivory jacket she wore during her acceptance speech at the Republican Convention was a $ 2,500 silk shantung Valentino , reportedly bought at Saks .
But the black wrap jacket she wore for the vice - presidential debate in St. Louis was a Tahari suit , according to a spokesman for the line , and costs less than $ 200 ; her shoes , according to the sleuths at ShoeaholicsAnonymous.com , were red imitation croc pumps from Kate Spade .
To her credit , Ms. Palin has been wearing those suits , and those awkward - yet - efficient , zip - close jackets ( nothing says maverick like red leather ) repeatedly over the last month , implying a sense of frugality that would belie the credit card statements of the Republican National Committee .
To be scrupulously nonpartisan , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , her Democratic counterpart , seems to have a deep wardrobe of ties .
Up in every national poll , leading in most of the battleground states , and blanketing the networks with a 30 minute infomercial you may think that the Obama campaign would be somewhat confident .
Nope .
They 're still worried .
Worried enough to launch a new campaign ad that targets McCain 's decision to select running mate Sarah Palin .
But in truth , it is a shot squarely at Sarah Palin 's intelligence .
The ad
The spot begins with soft music and a photo of McCain .
Then quotes from McCain appear .
“ The issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should . ” Boston Globe Political Intelligence 12/18/07
“ I might have to rely on a Vice President that I select for expertise on economic issues . ”
GOP Debate 11/28/07
" His choice ? " flashes up on the screen followed by slow moving video of Palin .
Winking .
Questionable
Support her or not , it 's a harsh ad .
And one that is questionable , simply because Obama had the opportunity to discuss his thoughts on Palin during the third debate .
Back then he was asked if he thought Palin was qualified .
" That 's going to be up to the American people , " Obama said .
" I think that obviously she 's capable politician .
She has , I think , excited the base in the Republican Party and I think it 's very commendable , the work she 's done on behalf of special needs . "
But today , a different answer from the Obama campaign .
Questionable or not , people from across the spectrum have voiced their discontent with the day - in , day - out mockery of Palin .
O'Reilly and Letterman
It 's no surprise that Bill O'Reilly stuck up for her last night while appearing on the David Letterman show .
And he was applauded after his remarks .
" I think she 's a self - made woman , " he said to Letterman .
" Reformed the state , went after her own party , put those people in jail , got the oil companies to give the folks some of these obscene profits they make .
I admire her record in Alaska .
I think the media is beating the hell out of the woman unfairly and I do n't like it . "
" If you do n't like her , do n't vote for her .
But you do n't have to beat the living daylights out of her .
If you do n't like her , do n't vote for her .
But knock it off , " he added .
" Women are the real losers "
The director of Women 's Watch Inc. , a nonprofit women 's advocacy group in New Jersey , wrote an op - ed two days ago in the Philadelphia Inquirer entitled , " Palin deserves our respect . "
It 's a difficult column to read .
What she discusses is ugly .
Really ugly .
" I cannot predict who will win the presidential campaign , but I already know who will lose big : all women , " she writes .
After describing a disgusting encounter with a Palin hater , she writes :
Hollywood
Even some Democrats in Hollywood say enough is enough .
At a political forum sponsored by the Caucus for Producers , Writers and Directors , Variety reports that television producer Linda Bloodworth - Thomason spoke up for Palin .
Fair ad or not ?
TOLEDO , Ohio -- Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin tried to tamp down reports about internal dissent in the McCain campaign , telling the Wall Street Journal Tuesday : " I laugh at 'em . "
" I have nothing but praise for those involved in this campaign , " she said in the brief interview aboard her plane .
With just six days left ...
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush authorized U.S. special forces to conduct ground assaults inside Pakistan without seeking Islamabad 's permission first , a senior American intelligence official said Thursday .
Adm . Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , said better U.S. - Pakistan cooperation is needed to fight terror .
" We have had the president 's OK for months , " said the official , who declined to be identified because the order is classified .
" It is my understanding that the Pakistanis are well aware of the change . "
The official would not elaborate on the exact nature of the order .
The official said Pakistan 's leaders will be notified during an assault or after the fact , depending on the situation but " most definitely after a decision has been made and things set in motion . "
National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe declined to comment on the report .
Pakistan 's ambassador to the United States said he had been " assured at the highest level by the U.S. government that no such orders exist , " and that Pakistan would be very displeased if they did .
" We will not allow foreign troops on Pakistani soil under any condition , " Ambassador Husain Haqqani said .
The United States is concerned that Taliban and al Qaeda forces operate with relative impunity in tribal areas along Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan , and use those areas as a staging ground to attack U.S. forces and their allies inside Afghanistan .
The intelligence official 's revelation comes after what Pakistan said was a September 3 incursion by U.S. forces into the country .
A senior U.S. official said last week that U.S. helicopters dropped troops in the village of Angoor Adda in South Waziristan , which borders Afghanistan .
Watch a report on new rules of engagement for hunting terrorists »
Local media reports said the troops came out of a chopper and fired on civilians .
The U.S. official who spoke about the operation said a small number of women and children may have been in the immediate vicinity , but when the mission began , " everybody came out firing " from the compound .
Pakistan summoned the U.S. ambassador in Islamabad to complain about the incident , which it said killed 15 civilians .
It called the raid " reckless . "
Haqqani on Thursday insisted Pakistan would handle security within its borders .
" We have been assured that the United States ... fully understands that the most effective means of fighting terrorism would be to allow Pakistani military forces to operate on the Pakistani side , while letting international forces and Afghan forces operate on the Afghan side , " he said .
Haqqani said unauthorized U.S. operations inside Pakistan would only harm relations between the two countries and added that the September 3 incursion was counterproductive .
" The kind of operation that we saw on the third of September is certainly not acceptable to the Pakistani people or the Pakistani government , and it does not advance the cause of the war against terror .
It enrages the people of Pakistan , " he said .
On Wednesday , Pakistan 's top general , reacting to the September 3 operation , also said no foreign forces would be allowed to conduct operations there .
Pakistan's " territorial integrity ... will be defended at all cost and no external force is allowed to conduct operations ... inside Pakistan , " according to a military statement attributed to Chief of Army Staff Gen.
Parvez Kayani , who succeeded Pervez Musharraf after he stepped down as Pakistan 's army chief last year .
Adm . Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Wednesday that the United States and Pakistan must increase cooperation to battle al Qaeda and Taliban militants that are using areas along Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan as a safe haven .
Mullen stressed that Afghanistan can't be referenced without " speaking of Pakistan , " where , he said , the militant groups collaborate and communicate better , launch more sophisticated attacks , employ foreign fighters and use civilians as human shields .
Watch how Pakistan is trying to fight militants »
" In my view , these two nations are inextricably linked in a common insurgency that crosses the border between them , " he said , adding that he plans " to commission a new , more comprehensive strategy for the region , one that covers both sides of the border . "
CNN 's Nic Robertson , Barbara Starr and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report .

Indiana is a key swing state .
Her job is overseeing vote counts .
This woman needs to lose her job , now .
More from AP :
A Republican county election clerk distributed copies of an apparent chain letter referring to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama as a “ young , black Adolf Hitler ” to two employees but later told police she intended it to be a joke … .
Doug Lechner , Republican Party chairman in the county just south of Indianapolis , said the letter was unacceptable and taints Jackson ’s ability to appear unbiased in administering this year ’s election .
County clerks are responsible for training poll workers , providing all voters an opportunity to cast their ballot without influence , and overseeing vote counts .
Even the Republicans agree that this woman is now tainted .
She needs to be fired NOW .

While campaigning in Michigan today Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden retaliated against the idea that John McCain equals change and a better economy by comparing McCain and Bush specifically on the issues of the economy , healthcare , taxes , and energy .
“ Eight years ago , a man ran for President who claimed he was different , not a typical Republican .
He called himself a reformer .
He admitted that his Party , the Republican Party , had been wrong about things from time to time .
He promised to work with Democrats and said he ’d been doing that for a long time …
We saw how that story ends .
A record number of home foreclosures .
Home values , tumbling .
And the disturbing news that the crisis you ’ve been facing on Main Street is now hitting Wall Street , taking down Lehman Brothers and threatening other financial institutions , ” Biden said .
Biden continued , “ Eight years later , we have another Republican nominee who ’s telling us the exact same thing :
This time it will be different , it really will .
This time he ’s going to put country before party , to change the tone , reach across the aisle , change the Republican Party , change the way Washington works .
We ’ve seen this movie before , folks .
But as everyone knows , the sequel is always worse than the original .
If we forget this history , we ’re going to be doomed to repeat it — with four more just like the last eight , or worse .
If you ’re ready for four more years of George Bush , John McCain is your man .
Just as George Herbert Walker Bush was nicknamed “ Bush 41 ” and his son is known as “ Bush 43 , ” John McCain could easily become known as “ Bush 44 . ” ”

Biden then moved into the policy comparison , “ Take a hard look at the positions John has taken for the past 26 years , on the economy , on health care , on foreign policy , and you ’ll see why I say that John McCain is just four more years of George Bush .
On the issues that you talk about around the kitchen table , Mary ’s college tuition , the cost of the MRI for mom , heating our home this winter — John McCain is profoundly out of touch .
John McCain just does n’t seem to understand what middle class people are going through today .
I do n’t doubt that he cares .
He just does n’t think that we have any responsibility to help people who are hurting . ”
He said there is no difference between Bush and McCain on the issues , “ There is simply no daylight – at least none I can see — between John McCain and George Bush .
On every major challenge we face , from the economy , to health care , to education and Iraq , you can barely tell them apart .
Do n’t take my word for it , look at the record .
Ninety percent of the time , John McCain votes with George Bush . ”
Biden , then got specific , “ When George Bush called for Social Security to be privatized , John McCain stood with him – he even campaigned for that roundly rejected plan .
When George Bush says that the government has no obligation to re-train or provide extended unemployment benefits for people who have lost their jobs due to trade agreements , John McCain echoes that view , and has said that Bush is “ Right on trade … absolutely . ” ”
He continued , “ When George Bush said we should n’t investigate why the government ’s response to Hurricane Katrina was so incompetent , John McCain stood with him .
When George Bush initially opposed a new GI Bill that would send a new generation of veterans to college , John McCain stood with him , calling Senator Webb ’s effort too generous .
When George Bush blocked our efforts to provide health care to another 3.8 million children , John McCain stood with him . ”
He also brought back the charge that McCain wants to tax employee healthcare benefits , “ And when , in early 2007 , George Bush suggested that the health care benefits you get through your employer should be taxed as income , John McCain stood with him .
And now , ladies and gentlemen , John McCain has resurrected that idea , and made it an essential part of his health care plan .
Issue after issue , vote after vote , the story is the same .
In the last 16 years , he ’s voted 23 times against the renewable energy – wind , solar , biofuels — we need to free ourselves from foreign oil .
Since he arrived in the Senate over 20 years ago , he ’s voted more than 19 times against the minimum wage . ”
If Obama wants to win this election , he has to debunk the myth that McCain represents a change from George W. Bush .
The truth really is that McCain is four more years of Bush .
This is why the Republican is not running his campaign based on the issues .
If he were to run an issue based campaign , people would discover that McCain agrees with Bush on all of the major issues in this election .
In order to conceal this fact , McCain is running a campaign based on biography and distractions .
As Democrats have discovered in the last two presidential elections , being right on the issues does n’t matter if they ca n’t cut through the clutter and get their message out .
Biden ’s speech today was their first real attempt at shifting the discussion away from pigs and lipstick , and back to the issues , and who John McCain really is .

X maintains a list of hosts from which client programs can be run .
By default , only programs on the local host and hosts specified in an initial list read by the server can use the display .
This access control list can be changed by clients on the local host .
Some server implementations can also implement other authorization mechanisms in addition to or in place of this mechanism .
The action of this mechanism can be conditional based on the authorization protocol name and data received by the server at connection setup .

Atoms are used to identify properties , types , and selections .
An InputOutput window can have a background , which is defined as a pixmap .
When regions of the window have their contents lost or invalidated , the server automatically tiles those regions with the background .
When a server maintains the contents of a window , the pixels saved off - screen are known as a backing store .
A font name used to select a family of fonts whose members may be encoded in various charsets .
The CharSetRegistry and CharSetEncoding fields of an XLFD name identify the charset of the font .
A base font name may be a full XLFD name , with all fourteen '-' delimiters , or an abbreviated XLFD name containing only the first 13 fields of an XLFD name , up to but not including CharSetRegistry , with or without the thirteenth ' - ' , or a non-XLFD name .
Any XLFD fields may contain wild cards .
When creating an XFontSet , Xlib accepts from the client a list of one or more base font names which select one or more font families .
They are combined with charset names obtained from the encoding of the locale to load the fonts required to render text .
When a window is resized , the contents of the window are not necessarily discarded .
It is possible to request that the server relocate the previous contents to some region of the window ( though no guarantees are made ) .
This attraction of window contents for some location of a window is known as bit gravity .
When a pixmap or window is thought of as a stack of bitmaps , each bitmap is called a bit plane or plane .
A bitmap is a pixmap of depth one .
An InputOutput window can have a border of equal thickness on all four sides of the window .
The contents of the border are defined by a pixmap , and the server automatically maintains the contents of the border .
Exposure events are never generated for border regions .
Buttons on the pointer can be passively grabbed by a client .
When the button is pressed , the pointer is then actively grabbed by the client .
For image ( pixmap / bitmap ) data , the server defines the byte order , and clients with different native byte ordering must swap bytes as necessary .
For all other parts of the protocol , the client defines the byte order , and the server swaps bytes as necessary .

A coded character set .
For display in X , there can be a direct mapping from a charset to one font , if the width of all characters in the charset is either one or two bytes .
A text string encoded in an encoding such as Shift - JIS cannot be passed directly to the X server , because the text imaging requests accept only single - width charsets ( either 8 or 16 bits ) .
Charsets which meet these restrictions can serve as " font charsets " .
Font charsets strictly speaking map font indices to font glyphs , not characters to character glyphs .
Note that a single font charset is sometimes used as the encoding of a locale , for example , ISO8859 - 1 .

Windows can be of different classes or types .
See the entries for InputOnly and InputOutput windows for further information about valid window types .
An application program connects to the window system server by some interprocess communication ( IPC ) path , such as a TCP connection or a shared memory buffer .
This program is referred to as a client of the window system server .
More precisely , the client is the IPC path itself .
A program with multiple paths open to the server is viewed as multiple clients by the protocol .
Resource lifetimes are controlled by connection lifetimes , not by program lifetimes .
In a graphics context , a bitmap or list of rectangles can be specified to restrict output to a particular region of the window .
The image defined by the bitmap > or rectangles is called a clipping region .
A character bound to a codepoint .
A set of unambiguous rules that establishes a character set and the one - to - one relationship between each character of the set and its bit representation ( ISO2022 , as adapted by XPG3 ) .
A definition of a one - to - one mapping of a set of characters to a set of codepoints .
The coded representation of a single character in a coded character set .
A colormap consists of a set of entries defining color values .
The colormap associated with a window is used to display the contents of the window ; each pixel value indexes the colormap to produce an RGB value that drives the guns of a monitor .
Depending on hardware limitations , one or more colormaps can be installed at one time so that windows associated with those maps display with true colors .
The IPC path between the server and client program is known as a connection .
A client program typically ( but not necessarily ) has one connection to the server over which requests and events are sent .
A window contains the pointer if the window is viewable and the hotspot of the cursor is within a visible region of the window or a visible region of one of its inferiors .
The border of the window is included as part of the window for containment .
The pointer is in a window if the window contains the pointer but no inferior contains the pointer .
The coordinate system has X horizontal and Y vertical , with the origin [ 0,0 ] at the upper left .
Coordinates are integral and coincide with pixel centers .
Each window and pixmap has its own coordinate system .
For a window , the origin is inside the border at the inside upper - left corner .
A cursor is the visible shape of the pointer on a screen .
It consists of a hotspot , a source bitmap , a shape bitmap , and a pair of colors .
The cursor defined for a window controls the visible appearance when the pointer is in that window .
The depth of a window or pixmap is the number of bits per pixel it has .
The depth of a graphics context is the depth of the drawables it can be used in conjunction with graphics output .
Keyboards , mice , tablets , track - balls , button boxes , and so on are all collectively known as input devices .
Pointers can have one or more buttons ( the most common number is three ) .
The core protocol only deals with two devices : the keyboard and the pointer .
DirectColor is a class of colormap in which a pixel value is decomposed into three separate subfields for indexing .
The first subfield indexes an array to produce red intensity values .
The second subfield indexes a second array to produce blue intensity values .
The third subfield indexes a third array to produce green intensity values .
The RGB ( red , green , and blue ) values in the colormap entry can be changed dynamically .
A server , together with its screens and input devices , is called a display .
The Xlib Display structure contains all information about the particular display and its screens as well as the state that Xlib needs to communicate with the display over a particular connection .
Both windows and pixmaps can be used as sources and destinations in graphics operations .
These windows and pixmaps are collectively known as drawables .
However , an InputOnly window cannot be used as a source or destination in a graphics operation .
A set of unambiguous rules that establishes a character set and a relationship between the characters and their representations .
The character set does not have to be fixed to a finite pre-defined set of characters .
The representations do not have to be of uniform length .
Examples are an ISO2022 graphic set , a state - independent or state - dependent combination of graphic sets , possibly including control sets , and the X Compound Text encoding .
In X , encodings are identified by a string which appears as : the CharSetRegistry and CharSetEncoding components of an XLFD name ; the name of a charset of the locale for which a font could not be found ; or an atom which identifies the encoding of a text property or which names an encoding for a text selection target type .
Encoding names should be composed of characters from the X Portable Character Set .
The escapement of a string is the distance in pixels in the primary draw direction from the drawing origin to the origin of the next character ( that is , the one following the given string ) to be drawn .
Clients are informed of information asynchronously by means of events .
These events can be either asynchronously generated from devices or generated as side effects of client requests .
Events are grouped into types .
The server never sends an event to a client unless the client has specifically asked to be informed of that type of event .
However , clients can force events to be sent to other clients .
Events are typically reported relative to a window .
Events are requested relative to a window .
The set of event types a client requests relative to a window is described by using an event mask .
Device - related events propagate from the source window to ancestor windows until some client has expressed interest in handling that type of event or until the event is discarded explicitly .
There are certain race conditions possible when demultiplexing device events to clients ( in particular , deciding where pointer and keyboard events should be sent when in the middle of window management operations ) .
The event synchronization mechanism allows synchronous processing of device events .
The deepest viewable window that the pointer is in is called the source of a device - related event .
Servers do not guarantee to preserve the contents of windows when windows are obscured or reconfigured .
Exposure events are sent to clients to inform them when contents of regions of windows have been lost .
Named extensions to the core protocol can be defined to extend the system .
Extensions to output requests , resources , and event types are all possible and expected .
A font is an array of glyphs ( typically characters ) .
The protocol does no translation or interpretation of character sets .
The client simply indicates values used to index the glyph array .
A font contains additional metric information to determine interglyph and interline spacing .
Clients can freeze event processing during keyboard and pointer grabs .
The abstract graphical symbol for an index into a font .
GC is an abbreviation for graphics context .
See Graphics context .
An identified abstract graphical symbol independent of any actual image .
( ISO / IEC / DIS 9541 -1 )
An abstract visual representation of a graphic character , not bound to a codepoint .
An image of a glyph , as obtained from a glyph representation displayed on a presentation surface .
( ISO / IEC / DIS 9541 - 1 )
Keyboard keys , the keyboard , pointer buttons , the pointer , and the server can be grabbed for exclusive use by a client .
In general , these facilities are not intended to be used by normal applications but are intended for various input and window managers to implement various styles of user interfaces .
Various information for graphics output is stored in a graphics context ( GC ) , such as foreground pixel , background pixel , line width , clipping region , and so on .
A graphics context can only be used with drawables that have the same root and the same depth as the graphics context .
The contents of windows and windows themselves have a gravity , which determines how the contents move when a window is resized .
See Bit gravity and Window gravity .
GrayScale can be viewed as a degenerate case of PseudoColor , in which the red , green , and blue values in any given colormap entry are equal and thus , produce shades of gray .
The gray values can be changed dynamically .
The encoding of the X Portable Character Set on the host .
The encoding itself is not defined by this standard , but the encoding must be the same in all locales supported by Xlib on the host .
If a string is said to be in the Host Portable Character Encoding , then it only contains characters from the X Portable Character Set , in the host encoding .
A cursor has an associated hotspot , which defines the point in the cursor corresponding to the coordinates reported for the pointer .
An identifier is a unique value associated with a resource that clients use to name that resource .
The identifier can be used over any connection to name the resource .
The inferiors of a window are all of the subwindows nested below it : the children , the children 's children , and so on .
The input focus is usually a window defining the scope for processing of keyboard input .
If a generated keyboard event usually would be reported to this window or one of its inferiors , the event is reported as usual .
Otherwise , the event is reported with respect to the focus window .
The input focus also can be set such that all keyboard events are discarded and such that the focus window is dynamically taken to be the root window of whatever screen the pointer is on at each keyboard event .
Control over keyboard input is typically provided by an input manager client , which usually is part of a window manager .
An InputOnly window is a window that cannot be used for graphics requests .
InputOnly windows are invisible and are used to control such things as cursors , input event generation , and grabbing .
InputOnly windows cannot have InputOutput windows as inferiors .
An InputOutput window is the normal kind of window that is used for both input and output .
InputOutput windows can have both InputOutput and InputOnly windows as inferiors .
The process of making software adaptable to the requirements of different native languages , local customs , and character string encodings .
Making a computer program adaptable to different locales without program source modifications or recompilation .
ISO standard for code extension techniques for 7 - bit and 8 - bit coded character sets .
Keys on the keyboard can be passively grabbed by a client .
When the key is pressed , the keyboard is then actively grabbed by the client .
A client can actively grab control of the keyboard , and key events will be sent to that client rather than the client the events would normally have been sent to .
An encoding of a symbol on a keycap on a keyboard .
The coded character set defined by the ISO8859 - 1 standard .
The encoding of the X Portable Character Set using the Latin - 1 codepoints plus ASCII control characters .
If a string is said to be in the Latin Portable Character Encoding , then it only contains characters from the X Portable Character Set , not all of Latin - 1 .
The international environment of a computer program defining the " localized " behavior of that program at run-time .
This information can be established from one or more sets of localization data .
ANSI C defines locale - specific processing by C system library calls .
See ANSI C and the X / Open Portability Guide specifications for more details .
In this specification , on implementations that conform to the ANSI C library , the " current locale " is the current setting of the LC_CTYPE setlocale category .
Associated with each locale is a text encoding .
When text is processed in the context of a locale , the text must be in the encoding of the locale .
The current locale affects Xlib in its : Encoding and processing of input method text
Encoding of resource files and values
Encoding and imaging of text strings
Encoding and decoding for inter-client text communication
The process of establishing information within a computer system specific to the operation of particular native languages , local customs and coded character sets .
( XPG3 )
The identifier used to select the desired locale for the host C library and X library functions .
On ANSI C library compliant systems , the locale argument to the setlocale function .
A window is said to be mapped if a map call has been performed on it .
Unmapped windows and their inferiors are never viewable or visible .
Shift , Control , Meta , Super , Hyper , Alt , Compose , Apple , CapsLock , ShiftLock , and similar keys are called modifier keys .
Monochrome is a special case of StaticGray in which there are only two colormap entries .
A character whose codepoint is stored in more than one byte ; any encoding which can contain multibyte characters ; text in a multibyte encoding .
The " char * " null - terminated string datatype in ANSI C .
Note that references in this document to multibyte strings imply only that the strings may contain multibyte characters .
A window is obscured if some other window obscures it .
A window can be partially obscured and so still have visible regions .
Window A obscures window B if both are viewable InputOutput windows , if A is higher in the global stacking order , and if the rectangle defined by the outside edges of A intersects the rectangle defined by the outside edges of B .
Note the distinction between obscures and occludes .
Also note that window borders are included in the calculation .
A window is occluded if some other window occludes it .
Window A occludes window B if both are mapped , if A is higher in the global stacking order , and if the rectangle defined by the outside edges of A intersects the rectangle defined by the outside edges of B .
Note the distinction between occludes and obscures .
Also note that window borders are included in the calculation and that InputOnly windows never obscure other windows but can occlude other windows .
Some padding bytes are inserted in the data stream to maintain alignment of the protocol requests on natural boundaries .
This increases ease of portability to some machine architectures .
If C is a child of P , then P is the parent of C .
Grabbing a key or button is a passive grab .
The grab activates when the key or button is actually pressed .
A pixel is an N - bit value , where N is the number of bit planes used in a particular window or pixmap ( that is , is the depth of the window or pixmap ) .
A pixel in a window indexes a colormap to derive an actual color to be displayed .
A pixmap is a three - dimensional array of bits .
A pixmap is normally thought of as a two - dimensional array of pixels , where each pixel can be a value from 0 to 2 ^ ( N - 1 ) , and where N is the depth ( z axis ) of the pixmap .
A pixmap can also be thought of as a stack of N bitmaps .
A pixmap can only be used on the screen that it was created in .
When a pixmap or window is thought of as a stack of bitmaps , each bitmap is called a plane or bit plane .
Graphics operations can be restricted to only affect a subset of bit planes of a destination .
A plane mask is a bit mask describing which planes are to be modified .
The plane mask is stored in a graphics context .
The pointer is the pointing device currently attached to the cursor and tracked on the screens .
A client can actively grab control of the pointer .
Then button and motion events will be sent to that client rather than the client the events would normally have been sent to .
A pointing device is typically a mouse , tablet , or some other device with effective dimensional motion .
The core protocol defines only one visible cursor , which tracks whatever pointing device is attached as the pointer .
Portable Operating System Interface , ISO / IEC 9945 - 1 ( IEEE Std 1003.1 ) .
The set of 65 characters which can be used in naming files on a POSIX - compliant host that are correctly processed in all locales .
The set is : a ..z A..Z 0..9 ._-
Windows can have associated properties that consist of a name , a type , a data format , and some data .
The protocol places no interpretation on properties .
They are intended as a general - purpose naming mechanism for clients .
For example , clients might use properties to share information such as resize hints , program names , and icon formats with a window manager .
The property list of a window is the list of properties that have been defined for the window .
PseudoColor is a class of colormap in which a pixel value indexes the colormap entry to produce an independent RGB value ; that is , the colormap is viewed as an array of triples ( RGB values ) .
The RGB values can be changed dynamically .
A rectangle specified by [ x , y , w , h ] has an infinitely thin outline path with corners at [ x , y ] , [ x+w , y ] , [ x+w , y+h ] , and [ x , y+h ] .
When a rectangle is filled , the lower - right edges are not drawn .
For example , if w=h=0 , nothing would be drawn .
For w=h=1 , a single pixel would be drawn .
Window managers ( or client programs ) may enforce window layout policy in various ways .
When a client attempts to change the size or position of a window , the operation may be redirected to a specified client rather than the operation actually being performed .
Information requested by a client program using the X protocol is sent back to the client with a reply .
Both events and replies are multiplexed on the same connection .
Most requests do not generate replies , but some requests generate multiple replies .
A command to the server is called a request .
It is a single block of data sent over a connection .
Windows , pixmaps , cursors , fonts , graphics contexts , and colormaps are known as resources .
They all have unique identifiers associated with them for naming purposes .
The lifetime of a resource usually is bounded by the lifetime of the connection over which the resource was created .
RGB values are the red , green , and blue intensity values that are used to define a color .
These values are always represented as 16 - bit , unsigned numbers , with 0 the minimum intensity and 65535 the maximum intensity .
The X server scales these values to match the display hardware .
The root of a pixmap or graphics context is the same as the root of whatever drawable was used when the pixmap or GC was created .
The root of a window is the root window under which the window was created .
Each screen has a root window covering it .
The root window cannot be reconfigured or unmapped , but otherwise it acts as a full - fledged window .
A root window has no parent .
The save set of a client is a list of other clients ' windows that , if they are inferiors of one of the client 's windows at connection close , should not be destroyed and that should be remapped if currently unmapped .
Save sets are typically used by window managers to avoid lost windows if the manager should terminate abnormally .
A scanline is a list of pixel or bit values viewed as a horizontal row ( all values having the same y coordinate ) of an image , with the values ordered by increasing the x coordinate .
An image represented in scanline order contains scanlines ordered by increasing the y coordinate .
A server can provide several independent screens , which typically have physically independent monitors .
This would be the expected configuration when there is only a single keyboard and pointer shared among the screens .
A Screen structure contains the information about that screen and is linked to the Display structure .
A selection can be thought of as an indirect property with dynamic type .
That is , rather than having the property stored in the X server , it is maintained by some client ( the owner ) .
A selection is global and is thought of as belonging to the user and being maintained by clients , rather than being private to a particular window subhierarchy or a particular set of clients .
When a client asks for the contents of a selection , it specifies a selection target type , which can be used to control the transmitted representation of the contents .
For example , if the selection is " the last thing the user clicked on , " and that is currently an image , then the target type might specify whether the contents of the image should be sent in XY format or Z format .
The target type can also be used to control the class of contents transmitted ; for example , asking for the " looks " ( fonts , line spacing , indentation , and so forth ) of a paragraph selection , rather than the text of the paragraph .
The target type can also be used for other purposes .
The protocol does not constrain the semantics .
The server , which is also referred to as the X server , provides the basic windowing mechanism .
It handles IPC connections from clients , multiplexes graphics requests onto the screens , and demultiplexes input back to the appropriate clients .
The server can be grabbed by a single client for exclusive use .
This prevents processing of any requests from other client connections until the grab is completed .
This is typically only a transient state for such things as rubber - banding , pop -up menus , or executing requests indivisibly .
ISO2022 defines control characters and escape sequences which temporarily ( single shift ) or permanently ( locking shift ) cause a different character set to be in effect ( " invoking " a character set ) .
Children of the same parent window are known as sibling windows .
Sibling windows , similar to sheets of paper on a desk , can stack on top of each other .
Windows above both obscure and occlude lower windows .
The relationship between sibling windows is known as the stacking order .
An encoding in which an invocation of a charset can apply to multiple characters in sequence .
A state - dependent encoding begins in an " initial state " and enters other " shift states " when specific " shift sequences " are encountered in the byte sequence .
In ISO2022 terms , this means use of locking shifts , not single shifts .
Any encoding in which the invocations of the charsets are fixed , or span only a single character .
In ISO2022 terms , this means use of at most single shifts , not locking shifts .
StaticColor can be viewed as a degenerate case of PseudoColor in which the RGB values are predefined and read - only .
StaticGray can be viewed as a degenerate case of GrayScale in which the gray values are predefined and read - only .
The values are typically linear or near - linear increasing ramps .
Many Xlib functions return a success status .
If the function does not succeed , however , its arguments are not disturbed .
A stipple pattern is a bitmap that is used to tile a region to serve as an additional clip mask for a fill operation with the foreground color .
Latin - 1 , plus tab and newline .
Two ISO Latin - 1 STRING8 values are considered equal if they are the same length and if corresponding bytes are either equal or are equivalent as follows : decimal values 65 to 90 inclusive ( characters " A " to " Z " ) are pairwise equivalent to decimal values 97 to 122 inclusive ( characters " a " to " z " ) , decimal values 192 to 214 inclusive ( characters " A grave " to " O diaeresis " ) are pairwise equivalent to decimal values 224 to 246 inclusive ( characters " a grave " to " o diaeresis " ) , and decimal values 216 to 222 inclusive ( characters " O oblique " to " THORN " ) are pairwise equivalent to decimal values 246 to 254 inclusive ( characters " o oblique " to " thorn " ) .
A pixmap can be replicated in two dimensions to tile a region .
The pixmap itself is also known as a tile .
A timestamp is a time value expressed in milliseconds .
It is typically the time since the last server reset .
Timestamp values wrap around ( after about 49.7 days ) .
The server , given its current time is represented by timestamp T , always interprets timestamps from clients by treating half of the timestamp space as being earlier in time than T and half of the timestamp space as being later in time than T .
One timestamp value , represented by the constant CurrentTime , is never generated by the server .
This value is reserved for use in requests to represent the current server time .
TrueColor can be viewed as a degenerate case of DirectColor in which the subfields in the pixel value directly encode the corresponding RGB values .
That is , the colormap has predefined read - only RGB values .
The values are typically linear or near - linear increasing ramps .
A type is an arbitrary atom used to identify the interpretation of property data .
Types are completely uninterpreted by the server .
They are solely for the benefit of clients .
X predefines type atoms for many frequently used types , and clients also can define new types .
A window is viewable if it and all of its ancestors are mapped .
This does not imply that any portion of the window is actually visible .
Graphics requests can be performed on a window when it is not viewable , but output will not be retained unless the server is maintaining backing store .
A region of a window is visible if someone looking at the screen can actually see it ; that is , the window is viewable and the region is not occluded by any other window .
Any spacing character .
On implementations that conform to the ANSI C library , whitespace is any character for which isspace returns true .
When windows are resized , subwindows may be repositioned automatically relative to some position in the window .
This attraction of a subwindow to some part of its parent is known as window gravity .
Manipulation of windows on the screen and much of the user interface ( policy ) is typically provided by a window manager client .
A basic set of 97 characters which are assumed to exist in all locales supported by Xlib .
This set contains the following characters : a ..z A..Z 0..9 ! " #$ %&'( )*+,-./:;<=>?@[ \\] ^_`{|}~ < space > , < tab > , and < newline >
This is the left / lower half ( also called the G0 set ) of the graphic character set of ISO8859 - 1 plus < space > , < tab > , and < newline > .
It is also the set of graphic characters in 7 - bit ASCII plus the same three control characters .
The actual encoding of these characters on the host is system dependent ; see the Host Portable Character Encoding .
The X Logical Font Description Conventions that define a standard syntax for structured font names .
The data for a pixmap is said to be in XY format if it is organized as a set of bitmaps representing individual bit planes with the planes appearing from most - significant to least - significant bit order .
The data for a pixmap is said to be in Z format if it is organized as a set of pixel values in scanline order .
Cool stunt !
Too bad about the teeth , though .

Are you kidding me ??
Her response to questions and statements made by James Carville while discussing McCain ’s choice of Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate , was “ It ’s demeaning to women ” , and “ I ’m offended .. ” ??
( This last response made repeatedly by Bachmann was in their exchange if you watched the entire interview live on CNN .
She spoke as if she was offended on behalf of all the women of the country – as she is smiling .
Sheesh .. ) .
The rest of her responses were just plain absurd .
Hey , wait ..
Is n’t that the same Michele Bachmann that kissed GW after his SOTU Speech in 2007 ?
I thought she looked familiar ..
Now THAT was offensive .
This below video is Larry King Live on CNN with a panel discussing Sarah Palin as McCain ’s choice for VP .
The panel is Rep. Michele Bachmann , James Carville , Stephanie Miller , and Amanda Carpenter ( who ..? ) .
The exchange is priceless if you can stand Bachmann ’s smile , syrupy voice , and her feigned indignation ..
( Aside from her idiotic comments .. )
James Carville is not one of my favorite people , but this was priceless .
I wish they had the entire interview with the two of them .
Election Worries Court to Examine Security of Electronic Voting
A father and son want Germany to stop using electronic voting machines because they believe them to be vulnerable to manipulation .
They have brought their case before Germany 's highest court .
Imagine a screen so thin , light and flexible that it can be rolled up and carried in your pocket , while consuming almost zero power .
That technology could become reality in two to three years , thanks to U.S. Army - backed research being done at Arizona State University 's Flexible Display Center .
According to Army researchers , the displays could be in field trials with soldiers as early as 2010 or 2011 .
" The Army 's motivation is to give soldiers the best situational awareness , " says David Morton , U.S. Army research laboratory manager for the center .
" Flexible display technology can enable us give soldiers information in ways we can't now . "
These flexible displays have been the dream of science fiction authors , wearable - computing enthusiasts and the display industry for nearly a decade .
LG Philips , Fujitsu and Sony have shown off prototypes of flexible - display systems , while startups such as Plastic Logic and E - Ink have talked about the possibility of putting their digital ink displays onto bendable backings .
But so far the idea has remained more in the realm of Minority Report than the real world .
The research center , formed through a partnership between the the Army Research Laboratory and the university , has been working on creating flexible displays since 2004 .
So far , the U.S. Army has invested nearly $ 44 million toward the research .
" We are now at a point where we are making high quality tech demonstrative panels , " says Gregory Raupp , director for the center .
The Army is interested in small displays that can be folded up , have very little weight and wo n't break .
They will allow the military to send greater information to soldiers and replace many of the bulky devices that they carry currently .
For instance , a soldier in the field could get information about the surroundings , the position of enemies or the blueprint of a building he or she may be planning to enter .
Other applications could include the use of the flexible displays as maps .
Flexible displays — when they arrive — will be a big leap from today 's liquid crystal displays ( LCDs ) and even organic light - emitting diode - based displays ( OLEDs ) .
Consider the difference in power consumption .
The flexible displays will consume 100 times less power compared with LCDs .
Even OLEDs , which are two to three times more efficient than LCDs , can't match that kind of efficiency .
The center is focusing on electrophoretic ink - based displays that are extremely low power and flexbile , says Raupp .
The displays have thin - film transistor arrays on specialty polymer and thin stainless - steel substrates and use electrophoretic ink ( E Ink ) , among other technologies , to render the characters .
E Ink , from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology spinoff , is composed of tiny microcapsules , each of which has positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid .
Once a polarized electric field is applied , the particles move to the top or the bottom of the microcapsule , depending on the polarity of the charge .
Alternating between the white and the black particles helps render characters and images on the screen .
To form a display , the e-ink is printed on to a sheet of plastic , which is laminated to control circuitry .
An early prototype has a soldier holding a flexible PDA weighing just 13
ounces and featuring an E Ink frontplane and a low temperature amorphous
Silicon TFT backplane .
Currently , the center is looking at two kinds of flexible displays : a reflective display ( which relies on ambient light ) known as a " zero power " version for its almost negligible power consumption and an emissive low - power model that emits its own light .
In comparison , an LCD relies on backlight .
The reflective displays are the most promising as they only require power to switch the transistors in the pixel array to update the image and have no backlight so power for fixed image viewing is very low .
" We need to look at technology that is fairly far along in the path towards commercialization , " says Morton .
It is also evaluating additional materials and manufacturing issues to get the displays into production devices , says Morton .
It hopes to have them in limited field trials within the next two to three years , and is working with companies such as LG to commercialize the technology .
" Our goal is to speed development of the displays and make them available for commercial manufacturing soon , " he says .
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon's top uniformed officer is calling for all returning combat troops , from privates to generals , to undergo screening for post - traumatic stress with a mental health professional , a move aimed at stemming an epidemic of psychological issues among veterans .
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said there 's a reluctance to acknowledge psychological problems for fear of showing weakness .
Troops now fill out questionnaires after combat tours that help determine if they have suffered psychological damage .
They 're examined by medical professionals for physical injuries , but not by mental health experts .
" I'm at a point where I believe we have to give a ( mental health ) screening to everybody to help remove the stigma of raising your hand , " Mullen said .
" Leaders must lead on this issue or it will affect us dramatically down the road . "
About one in five combat veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from post - traumatic stress or depression , according to a study by the RAND Corp .
In all , RAND estimates that 300,000 veterans have been affected and it could cost more than $ 6.2 billion to treat them .
Half of the troops RAND surveyed reported that they had a friend who was seriously wounded or killed .
Rates of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and depression were highest among soldiers and Marines , the study said .
" The PTS issue is something we just all have to focus on , " Mullen said .
" I think it 's a bigger problem than we know . "
Mullen 's proposal is in its infancy , and there are no estimates about its potential costs or when it would start .
Another potential complication is the number of available mental health professionals , such as psychiatrists , psychologists and social workers .
Pentagon budget records show the military has increased signing and retention bonuses for these professionals in recent years to make up for shortages .
Troops also know how to evade certain mental health questions to avoid treatment .
Mullen said the Pentagon still has not addressed the negativity surrounding mental health care , which has kept many troops from seeking help .
A trained mental health professional who meets one - on - one with a service member can detect signs of post - traumatic stress in as few as five minutes .
Troops worry their careers will suffer if they seek mental health care , said Terri Tanielian , co-director of RAND 's Center for Military Health Policy Research .
If Mullen 's plan increases access to confidential care , she said , " we will go a long way to removing the stigma associated with getting mental health care . "
IN the past decade , baseball has experienced a data - driven information revolution .
Numbers - crunchers now routinely use statistics to put better teams on the field for less money .
Our overpriced , underperforming health care system needs a similar revolution .
Data - driven baseball has produced surprising results .
Michael Lewis writes in “ Moneyball ” that the Oakland A’s have won games and division titles at one - sixth the cost of the most profligate teams .
This season , the New York Yankees , Detroit Tigers and New York Mets  the three teams with the highest payrolls , a combined $ 486 million  are watching the playoffs on television , while the Tampa Bay Rays , a franchise that uses a data - driven approach and has the second - lowest payroll in baseball at $ 44 million , are in the World Series ( a sad reality for one of us ) .
Remarkably , a doctor today can get more data on the starting third baseman on his fantasy baseball team than on the effectiveness of life - and - death medical procedures .
Studies have shown that most health care is not based on clinical studies of what works best and what does not  be it a test , treatment , drug or technology .
Instead , most care is based on informed opinion , personal observation or tradition .
It is no surprise then that the United States spends more than twice as much per capita on health care compared to almost every other country in the world  and with worse health quality than most industrialized nations .
Health premiums for a family of four have nearly doubled since 2001 .
Starbucks pays more for health care than it does for coffee .
Nearly 100,000 Americans are killed every year by preventable medical errors .
We can do better if doctors have better access to concise , evidence - based medical information .

Wealth Preservation Wealth Enhancement Financial and Geopolitical Intelligence
The ongoing and intensifying Series of Financial and Economic Crises reveals a Pattern .
Analyzing this Pattern provides excellent clues about future financial and economic developments , and especially about near - term , as well as long - term , developments .
These clues provide the key to Profit , as well as the Alert to Dangers , and clues regarding the next MegaMove .
The Overall Outline of The Pattern is slowly becoming clearer and is revealed by considering the examples described below .
Deepcaster was among the first to Forecast not only the Crises we now experience but also the likely � End Game� Plan of key Central and Commercial Bankers and their Allies .
Deepcaster was among the first to expose a � Massive Financial - Geopolitical Scheme Not Reported by Big Media� in an Alert published on August 11 , 2006 ( all Deepcaster articles can be found in either the Alerts Cache , Latest Letter Cache or Articles by Deepcaster Cache at www.deepcaster.com).
This � End Game � Scheme has many components , one of which is to facilitate the destruction of the U.S. Dollar and its replacement by the Amero .
Fortunately , there are others who recognize the Perfidy of this Scheme and have sought to stop it , including a few members of Congress ( see H. Res. 40 � Goode , R - Va . ) .
A Central Characteristic of this Nefarious Scheme is manipulation of Major Markets by a Cartel* of key Central Bankers and their Favored Financial Institutions .
* We encourage those who doubt the scope and power of Intervention by a Fed-led Cartel of Central Bankers to read Deepcaster�s January , 2008 Letter containing a summary overview of Intervention entitled � Market Intervention , Data Manipulation - - Increasing Risks , The Cartel End Game , and Latest Forecast� at www.deepcaster.com>LatestLetter.
Also consider the substantial evidence collected by the Gold AntiTrust Action Committee at www.gata.org for information on precious metals price manipulation .
Virtually all of the evidence for Intervention has been gleaned from publicly available records .
Deepcaster�s profitable recommendations displayed at www.deepcaster.com have been facilitated by attention to these � Interventionals . �
In order to effect this Market Manipulation Regime , the Cartel has facilitated the creation of nearly $ 600 trillion of OTC Darkly Liquid Derivatives ( see bis.org , path : statistics > derivatives > Table 19 and ff ) see Deepcaster�s � Derivatives Deluge Multiplies Real Risks and Potential Profits � of 12/01/06 .
These Derivatives have a wide variety of characteristics and �uses , � but the two in our focus are : 1 ) Magnified Profits ( and Losses ) - - when the market moves favorably ( and magnified losses when the market moves unfavorably ) and 2 ) Market Manipulation - - given the aforementioned Magnification Effect , their proliferation causes increasing Financial Systemic Risk .
Among other characteristics of the Cartel Interventional Regime is what Deepcaster has described as a � War on Tangible Assets . �
In order to prevent Precious Monetary Metals and Strategic Commodities ( e.g. Crude Oil ) from gaining legitimacy as superior Stores and Measures of Value to their Fiat Currencies and Treasury Securities , the Cartel periodically intervenes to cap and take down prices of key Commodities , especially Gold and Silver .
In response , Deepcaster developed a strategy for � Profit Potential From The War on Tangible Assets � in his article of 1/5/07 .
A major impediment to Protecting and Profiting from the increasing deluge of OTC ( Over The Counter ) Derivatives is that many of them are only darkly liquid ( or , as recent events show , illiquid ) that is to say they are OTC and not publicly Exchange Traded .
That means that they are not often publicly reported ( see Deepcaster�s � Protecting Profits From Dark Liquidity & Other Systemic Risks � article of 4/6/07 ) yet their existence can have a profound effect on the markets , as the current Credit Freeze - Up attests .
As the evidence continued to develop throughout 2007 , it became clear that the implementation of the Cartel�s � End Game � Scheme was continuing relentlessly .
Consequently , on 6/6/07 , Deepcaster published � Profiting From the Push to Denationalize Currencies and Deconstruct Nations � ( in the Articles Cache at www.deepcaster.com).
One consequence of the End Game Scheme implementation will likely be a massive redistribution of wealth to the owners of the private - for - profit Fed ( and to their favored financial institutions ) via a scenario quite similar to the one revealed by the �Boom of the 1920s � and consequent Depression and Foreclosures of the 1930s .
Clearly this increasing flood of OTC Derivatives is increasingly causing negative consequences including , for sure , our worsening Hyperinflationary Recession ( leading eventually , perhaps , to Depression ) .
Others in addition to Deepcaster have substantiated this point .
For example www.shadowstats.com reports the Real Numbers for Unemployment , Inflation , M3 and GDP by using pre-1990 methods ( before they were gimmicked ) to calculate them .
For example , as calculated by shadowstats , currently the Real CPI is 13 % , Monetary Inflation ( M3 ) is 14 % , Real Unemployment is 14.5 % , and real GDP is a negative 2 % , all annualized .
Some claim that , given the Housing Price Deflation , Equities Market Deflation , and Ongoing Commodities Price Deflation , we are in a deflationary rather then hyperinflationary environment .
Alas , if only it were true .
On a net basis , we are actually in a hyperinflationary environment because , inter alia , the pace of Fed - generated monetary inflation at 14 % annualized is far greater than the housing / equities markets / commodities price deflation .
The bottom line is that the hyperinflationary influence of rampant money supply expansion , plus the Bailout Bills , Massive Credit Creation and other Fed buyouts and Market Support Actions is far more inflationary than the aforementioned deflationary items taken together .
And there is another Negative Consequence to the dramatic inflation of the OTC Derivatives market , which according to the Bank for International Settlements was $ 596 trillion as of December , 2007 ( www.bis.org, path : statistics > derivatives > Table 19 and ff ) .
That major consequence is the ongoing credit market freeze - up .
The August , 2007 Credit Market Freeze - up was the first indication to investors - at - large that the Toxic ( to use Warren Buffet�s term ) OTC Paper Empire The Cartel had facilitated was becoming unraveled .
The key Symptom of Systemic Illness was the Credit Market Freeze - up beginning in that month .
By the end of 2007 , it became clear that the few Band - Aids that the Fed and Treasury had applied to unfreeze the Credit Markets had been unsuccessful and one would have to plan ahead to protect profits ( see Deepcaster�s article � Protecting Profits From the Burning Platform� of 12/2/807 ) .
It has also become clear that virtually no sector was immune from OTC Derivatives , Data Manipulation , and Market Intervention Contagion .
Specifically , it was clear that even traditionally Defensive Sector stocks were no protection from the Derivatives Implosion or the onrushing train of Hyperinflationary Recession ( the Big Pharma sector�s Bristol Myers Squibb�s Derivatives - caused write - down is one object lesson - see Deepcaster�s � Profit From and Protection Against Defensive Sector Stocks � of 2/1/08 ) .
Indeed , as we moved into 2008 , it became clear that there would be ever more severe OTC Derivatives Market failures and worsening Credit Market Freeze - ups such as we have recently experienced ( see � Profiting and Protecting from Collapsing Paper� of 2/15/08 ) .
It also became clear that the Cartel was continuing to implement its nefarious � End Game� as a result of the aforementioned crises ( see Deepcaster�s article of 3/7/08 entitled � Increasing Systemic Risk Portends Cartel End Game Attempt� ) .
It is also becoming clear that notwithstanding the tremendous power of the Fed - led Cartel , that power was unsustainable , absent The Cartel�s being successful at implementing its End Game ( see Deepcaster�s article of 1/4/08 entitled � Private Ownership of U.S. Fed Unsustainable� ) .
In response , Deepcaster developed an Approach that provides substantial potential for � Defeating The Cartel � With Profit� ( 3/28/08 ) .
Nonetheless , as we indicated , it was ( and is ) in The Cartel�s interest to reach with Hubris for even more power as we Forecast in our 4/4/08 article � The Fox Wants More of Our Chickens � and � Profit From Fed- Catalyzed Crises� of 7/3/08 ) .
The subsequent Bailout Bill conferring vast power to intervene in ostensibly �free� markets and control the fate of any business is but one manifestation of that Hubris .
As crisis after crisis which Deepcaster had predicted developed it became clear by June , 2008 that the � Systemic Meltdown Risk Increases . �
It also became clear by July , 2008 that we were moving into an Abyss in which the whole Financial System could fail ( see � Crisis Opportunities As We Move Into the Abyss� on 7/11/08 and � Profit From the Jaws of Death� on 7/25/08 ) .
Indeed , that Forecast was prescient , as that Abyss has subsequently swallowed several trillion dollars in nominal Equities Value by early October , 2008 .
But as the Bailout Disaster approached and the financial system came closer and closer to lockdown , Deepcaster developed strategies to cope with this ( see � Opportunities & threats from the Paper Money Regime� of 8/1/08 and � Opportunities in the Impending Perfect Storm� of 9/5/08 and � Strategy Beyond the Bailout Outrages for Profit and Protection� of 9/12/08 ) .
Deepcaster�s Strategies and Forecasts have facilitated very profitable recommendations for Deepcaster subscribers ( via five short positions going into September , 2008 ) , as disclosed on the front page of www.deepcaster.com.
Most recently , Deepcaster Forecast well in advance that the bailout package that a cowed Congress passed would not work to solve the financial systemic crises .
Indeed , it will , in the long run , serve to increase the threat of Systemic Meltdown .
Subsequent events have proven that Forecast correct .
Of the several reasons that we laid out that the Bailout will in fact increase meltdown risk , one is worth noting here .
That is , under the Bailout Plan that passed , the Treasury will literally give at least $ 700 billion to a variety of Favored Financial Institutions in return for paper which has little or no value .
To finance this gift , additional tax payment obligations will be placed on the American Taxpayer , burdens the repayment of which will have to be financed by Treasury ( Taxpayer ) borrowing from the private - for - profit Federal Reserve .
Given that the U.S. Consumer / Taxpayer is 70 % of the U.S. GDP , additional debt ( upon which interest , at least , must be regularly paid ) this will only increase home mortgage , credit card and other obligation defaults and thus increase the Financial and Economic Systemic Risk , while not preventing future freeze - ups or Systemic Failure .
Of course , many other sensible alternatives to the Bailout Giveaway were available ( as former Treasury Secretary O�Neill and Professor Roubini have shown ) but , the powers - that - be in Washington , spearheaded by Fed Chief Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson wanted a U.S. Taxpayer - funded Giveaway to Wall Street , and a Taxpayer - funded Giveaway they got .
The Bottom Line is that The Crises are not over - - they are only just beginning .
Therefore , one must be constantly vigilant to proactively take steps to protect one�s wealth and profit to the extent one may from the ever - increasing number of crises .
Therefore , Deepcaster has developed a strategy ( in his Article of 9/26/08 ) for � Protection and Profit from Bailouts Doomed to Fail . �
The central focus of The Strategy for Protection and Profit is careful attention not only to the Fundamentals and Technicals but also to the Interventionals .
These Cartel - generated Interventionals literally have the power to move markets , as those who study the matter can attest .
Protection and Profit require Proactivity , and attention to the Interventionals as well as Fundamentals and Technicals , not � Buy and Hold . �
Buy and Hold rarely succeeds anymore , as current market conditions attest .
The Key to Profit and Protection is a Strategy .
Successful investors must become long - term traders , with their trading choices informed by the Interventionals as well as the Fundamentals and Technicals .

Advertisement Residents in one area of the Texas coastline have been warned they must evacuate before the arrival of Hurricane Ike or " face certain death " .
The National Weather Service issued the grave warning to those living in low - lying areas around Galveston Bay .
More than a million people in Texas have been advised to leave their homes before Ike hits early Saturday morning .
The storm has already killed more than 70 people in the Caribbean , with Haiti and Cuba particularly badly hit .
At 1500 GMT Ike was about 195 miles ( 320 km ) south - east of Galveston , with winds above 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) .
The US National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) said Ike could strengthen from a Category Two to a Category Three storm - a " major hurricane " - by the time it reaches the coast .
The effects of the storm will be felt along the coast before it makes landfall .
The hurricane 's predicted path will take it through Galveston and on to the US 's fourth largest city , Houston .
Enlarge Map
Forecasters warned that because of the size of the storm , the low - lying coastal areas could be hit by a 20 ft ( 6 m ) high surge of water .
" All neighbourhoods and possibly entire coastal communities will be inundated during the period of the peak storm tide , " the National Weather Service said in a statement .
" Persons not heeding evacuation orders in single family one - or two - storey homes will face certain death . "
The warning was issued after it became apparent that some residents in the Galveston Bay area were resisting orders to evacuate .
" There 's more people here than I thought , " Alicia Cahill , a public information officer for Galveston was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying .
The Texas authorities have laid on more than 1,000 buses to facilitate the exodus .
In Galveston - scene of the country 's deadliest hurricane which killed at least 6,000 people in 1900 - 75 buses are transporting residents to the state capital , Austin .
Weak and chronically ill hospital patients are being moved to San Antonio , about 190 miles from Houston .
Authorities have ordered residents in Houston to stay put , to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when some 110 people in the city died during a chaotic evacuation in the face of Hurricane Rita .
Almost all energy production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut down as a precaution , but the US Department of Energy said the storm was expected to miss most of the installations .
President George W Bush has declared a federal emergency in Texas , allowing funds to be freed to help the state deal with the storm .
Aid appeal Hurricane
Ike killed four people , wrecked tens of thousands of buildings and destroyed crops when it slammed into Cuba .
The UN estimates the cost of the damage at $ 3 bn - $ 4bn ( £ 1.7bn -£ 2.26bn ) .

The island nation was already reeling from the impact of Hurricane Gustav , which destroyed about 100,000 homes when it hit the island at the end of August .
Ike earlier caused 66 deaths in Haiti and reportedly damaged 80 % of the homes in the Turks and Caicos Islands .
Haiti , the poorest country in the Western hemisphere , has endured the onslaught of four tropical storms in a three - week period , causing more than 550 deaths .
The UN has appealed for more than $ 100 m ( £ 57 m ) in international aid to assist Haiti , where most people live on less than a dollar a day .
The US has pledged $ 10 m ( £ 5.7 m ) in aid to Haiti , where the UN estimates 800,000 people are in temporary shelters .
Washington also offered $ 100,000 ( £ 57,000 ) in initial aid to Cuba , whose government has been subject to a US trade embargo for four decades .
Cuba turned the offer down , asking instead that the US sells it supplies on credit .

Top 10 Boobs In Relation To Body Frame !
We all love big boobs .
Unfortunately boobs are made of fat which means that most of the naturally busty girls are also naturally chunky .
This is n't a complaint from me because I 'll take a curvy girl over a stick figure any time of the day .
However , there are some girls who have defied the laws of nature with their skinny bodies and huge natural boobs .
Usually the only way skinny girls can get double D's is with the help of your friendly neighbourhood plastic surgeon but somehow these girls were blessed with in my opinion ; the ultimate body .
# 10 Peach Peach , who 's real name is Renata Daninsky and is also known as Nancy Lane comes from the great land of boobs : the Czech Republic .
She was born in the glorious year of 1981 and has appeared on tons of websites over the years .
According to some websites she is supposed to wear a 32D cup .
I do n't know if that 's true or not , all I know is that her boobs look great on that skinny body .

# 9 Raylene Richards Raylene Richards who is also known as Zuzanna is also from the Czech Republic .
There is a reason I called it the land of the boobs you know .
The reason II put her ahead of Peach is simply because of her bigger boobs .
She got 32 DD cup breasts on her chest , was born in 1983 and she makes my penis tingle .

Twisty 's # 8 Veronica Zemanova
Hey , guess what country Veronica Zemanova is from ?
Yup , the Czech Republic .
Veronica Zemanova used to be my favourite nude model but she went ahead and ruined her awesome tits with implants .
I 'm still putting her on the list because before the implants , she still had great naturals .
She 's been in Playboy a bunch of times , appeared on tons of websites but has now pretty much retired from nude modeling .
She did recently do a photo shoot with Action Girls so maybe she is coming back .

Twisty 's # 7 Love4Dream
This exotic beauty who goes by the name of Love4 Dream is a bit of a mystery .
I got the following info from a fan site .
She was born 1989 in Paris , France and did her first nude shoot when she was 18 years old .
She quickly became popular because ... wait for it ... she has 34DD boobs !
Since then she has appeared in a lot of European hip - hop videos .
Rumour has it that she is taking a modeling break due to a jealous boyfriend .
I have now put a hit on him so she should start taking off her clothes again soon .

Louis De Mirabert # 6 Felicity Fey
Not too much is known about the real girl behind the alias Felicity Fey .
She is supposed to have a Latin origin but was born in Russia .
Her official website does n't tell us much besides that she likes Vodka .
Who does n't ?
Either way , her tits are mesmerizing .
Kick ass website with Felicity Fey :
Felicity Fey # 5 Anya Zenkova
The top 5 models were hard to rank .
They all got amazing racks and slim bodies .
The reason Anya Zenkova aka Busty Merilyn aka Merilyn Zenkova is only # 5 is mostly because her body is slightly chunkier than the rest .
Can you guess how big her boobs are ?
I doubt it .
She got 32 GG 's on her and that 's a lot as you can see on the pic to the right .
She was born 1985 in Russia wich makes her ....
Russian !
Kick ass website with Anya Zenkova :
Busty Merilyn # 4 Tyra Moore
What separates Tyra Moore from the rest of the ladies on this list is that she is black and she does hardcore porn .
She 's originally from New York and as so many other porn starlets she started stripping when she turned 18 before getting into the porn industry in 2006 .
Hopefully she is here to stay !
Kick ass website with Tyra Moore :
Big Naturals # 3 Yulia Nova Yulia Nova was born in Russia in 1982 and first became known after winning a beauty contest held by a Japanese photographer .
Shortly after she became very popular in Japan because her natural boobs and slim body managed to distract all the males from the tentacle porn they normally watch .
She has released a bunch of DVD's and books in Japan but stays away from the western market for some reason .
Without the internet we would probably still be oblivious to her racktastic body .
Kick ass website with Yulia Nova :
N/ A # 2 Jana Defi Jana Defi is from the Czech Republic who made her first nude appearance on the website busty .pl .
She has modeled under various names such as Maria Swan and Princessa but it seems like she has settled on Jana Defi after appearing in British lad mags .
A while back a blog presented a bunch of evidence claiming that Jana Defi does not have natural breasts but instead got implants .
A website that hosts her pictures responded to these accusations with testimony from a Los Angeles plastic surgeon and radiologist that her breasts are natural .
They also posted an unedited sonogram of her breast tissue .
Kind of nasty but good to know that she has proven herself !

Its most unfortunate but I have basically no info what so ever on Lucy from Met - Art .

Lucy is seriously reason alone to join Met - Art .

A widespread spam campaign claims that a nuclear power plant on the outskirts of London exploded on Tuesday afternoon .
No such plant exists anywhere near London .
The nearest is probably Dungeness B in south east Kent , some 77 miles ( 124 km ) by road from the capital .
The email claims to offer pictures of victims .
In reality , the attached zip file is contaminated with a Trojan horse , identified by net security firm Sophos as Troj / Agent - HQE .
Once the malware is installed , hackers can use it to spy on the victim 's computer and steal information for financial gain .
The emails typically arrive with subject lines such as Reply : A report on radiation contamination of Canada , suggesting that a Chernobyl - style nuclear calamity has befallen the UK and local authorities have succeeded in hushing it up .
" Rather than use a real life event , the hackers have turned to fictional explosions and conspiracy theories in the hope they will strike a nerve with potential victims who will then click on the attachment without a second thought , " commented Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos .
Earlier this week virus writers distributed a contaminated email purporting to contain pornographic footage of presidential hopeful Barack Obama and a Ukrainian woman of easy virtue .
A poor -quality porno clip - not featuring Obama , we hasten to add - was actually offered up , but the main purpose of the attack was to spread a form of spyware designed to intercept bank login credentials .
The two attacks - together with older claims by the Storm Worm gang that World War III had broken out in the Middle East - led us to wonder what spam tagline people are most likely to open .
Sophos 's Cluley said this varied with what was currently in the news , but sport and sex lures were always popular .
" Even though there 's a plethora of porn freely available on the net people are sometimes tempted to click on something they receive by email in the misguided belief that their anti-virus software will always protect them .
Something that 's unusual , topical or glamorous tends to incite interest .
That 's why the Anna Kournikova worm did so well , " he added . ®

FOREIGN POLICY
THE NATIONAL DEBT
PRIVACY
FEDERAL RESERVE
http://www.opednews.com/articles/Ron-Paul-Press-Conference-by-Kevin-Zeese-080910-177.html
Polls Indicate Non-Duopoly Candidates Could Determine Outcome of the Election
Ron Paul held what he described as a “ very important ” press conference on September 10th in Washington , DC .
The event brought four third party and independent candidates “ together in unity ” around a statement of principles .
The event came as polls showed the presidential race tightening and third party / independent candidates getting combined votes of over 10 % in swing states .
The four candidates – Independent Ralph Nader , the Green nominee Cynthia McKinney , the Constitution Party ’s Chuck Baldwin and the Libertarian Party ’s Bob Barr along with Ron Paul agreed on the following four key principles :
Foreign Policy : The Iraq
War must end as quickly as possible with removal of all our soldiers from the region .
We must initiate the return of our soldiers from around the world , including Korea , Japan , Europe and the entire Middle East .
We must cease the war propaganda , threats of a blockade and plans for attacks on Iran , nor should we re-ignite the cold war with Russia over Georgia .
We must be willing to talk to all countries and offer friendship and trade and travel to all who are willing .
We must take off the table the threat of a nuclear first strike against all nations .
Privacy :
We must protect the privacy and civil liberties of all persons under US jurisdiction .
We must repeal or radically change the Patriot Act , the Military Commissions Act , and the FISA legislation .
We must reject the notion and practice of torture , eliminations of habeas corpus , secret tribunals , and secret prisons .
We must deny immunity for corporations that spy willingly on the people for the benefit of the government .
We must reject the unitary presidency , the illegal use of signing statements and excessive use of executive orders .
The National Debt :
We believe that there should be no increase in the national debt .
The burden of debt placed on the next generation is unjust and already threatening our economy and the value of our dollar .
We must pay our bills as we go along and not unfairly place this burden on a future generation .
The Federal Reserve :
We seek a thorough investigation , evaluation and audit of the Federal Reserve System and its cozy relationships with the banking , corporate , and other financial institutions .
The arbitrary power to create money and credit out of thin air behind closed doors for the benefit of commercial interests must be ended .
There should be no taxpayer bailouts of corporations and no corporate subsidies .
Corporations should be aggressively prosecuted for their crimes and frauds .

Skype say they are abiding by Chinese laws over internet use China has been monitoring and censoring messages sent through the internet service Skype , researchers say .
Citizen Lab , a Canadian research group , says it found a database containing thousands of politically sensitive words which had been blocked by China .
The publically available database also displayed personal data on subscribers .
Skype said it had always been open about the filtering of data by Chinese partners , but that it was concerned by breaches in the security of the site .
Citizen Lab researchers , based at the University of Toronto , said they discovered a huge surveillance system which had picked up and stored messages sent through the online telephone and text messaging service .
The database held more than 150,000 messages which included words such as " democracy " and " Tibet " and phrases relating to the banned spiritual movement , Falun Gong .
" These text messages , along with millions of records containing personal information , are stored on insecure publicly accessible web servers , " said Citizen Lab 's report , entitled " Breaching Trust " .
They said that by using one username , it was possible to identify all the people who had sent messages to or received them from the original user .
' Meeting laws '
Skype is operated in China as Tom - Skype , a joint venture involving the American auction site , eBay and Chinese company TOM - Online .
Citizen Lab said it was " clear " that Tom was " engaging in extensive surveillance with seemingly little regard for the security and privacy of Skype users " .
They asked to what extent Tom Online and Skype were co-operating with the Chinese government in monitoring communications .
But Skype president Josh Silverman said China 's monitoring was " common knowledge " and that Tom Online , had " established procedures to meet local laws and regulations " .
" These regulations include the requirement to monitor and block instant messages containing certain words deemed offensive by the Chinese authorities , " he said .
Mr Silverman said that it had been Tom Online 's policy to block certain messages and then delete them and he would be investigating why the policy had changed to allow the company to upload and store those messages .
Although internet use is high in China , the authorities have long prevented citizens from accessing websites which are considered politically sensitive .
Western internet companies such as Google , Microsoft and Yahoo have been criticised by human - rights groups for adhering to China 's strict regulations .

Most of us know by now that a lot of toxic debt has been filling up the balance sheets of our financial institutions creating one heck of a financial meltdown .
What we do not know is what the solutions to those problems are going to create in terms of human emotion .
Everywhere you turn these days you hear cries of " we have to save the homeowners ; we must lower their payments and keep them in their homes . "
Why ?
Why do we have to save these people ?
Why should someone get to have a home that they can only keep if others help pay for it ?
Why do we have to save the institutions that lent to them ?
" They " say they need one trillion dollars or more of my money to bail out a lot of people .
Why on earth do I have to give my hard - earned money to irresponsible people ?
The thought is making me very angry .
Several years ago I bought a house .
I had an option for the financing ; I could take a rather high interest rate ( for the time ) that was fixed or I could put nothing down and pay nearly nothing for an adjustable rate mortgage .
I decided not to gamble .
I knew interest rates can and do rise .
I opted to pay a lot more for my house and to have the security of a fixed rate loan .
That decision cost me a lot of money over the past five years , but it was supposed to save me money when the tide turned .
Now , I am paying for that decision .
I am paying for my neighbor 's house down the road who did not want to pay more at the time .
I am paying so that my neighbor and yours , who took out a mortgage with no down payment and paid next to nothing for the past five years , can get his mortgage reduced with my money .
How is that fair ?
My next - door neighbor decided to take out a huge chunk of change by refinancing when housing prices were high .
He spent nearly a hundred thousand dollars fixing up his home and buying new cars and boats .
He has a lovely new kitchen and a bathroom to die for .
Now he will be bailed out by the government because his house is in foreclosure .
He will get a new loan , a nice low fixed rate ( even lower than mine ) and he will have a significant chunk of his principle reduced .
Who pays for that ?
Me. Why ?
Because the government does n't have a dime and all money it gives to Mr. Smith it must take from Mr. Jones .
( You and I are Mr. Jones in this example . )
Now I am living in a house that is not fixed up .
I have the same kitchen I had when I moved in .
My shower leaks in my outdated bathroom .
I have a twelve - year - old car .
I do not have a boat , but I will have to pay for all those toys my neighbor now has .
I find myself looking at all my neighbors and wondering which of them are taking my money and I am angry .
I am not the first to figure out that I am paying for other 's extravagances .
The government just decided to hand one trillion dollars of Mr. Jones ' ( the people 's ) money to a ton of Mr. Smiths .
The final bill may end up looking more like five trillion dollars .
Who benefits ?
Not me .
All my stocks have taken a huge hit and my IRA looks more like a piggy bank .
What did I get out of this ?
Certainly not a $ 440,000 vacation .
Again , I am not the first to figure this out .
All around me I see people who are growing increasingly angry .
I see people seething when someone says that irresponsible homeowners should be bailed out .
Do n't get me wrong , I feel bad that people are losing their homes , but should I have to pay their mortgage ?
I see people wanting to start a witch hunt for those government officials that created the incentives for this to happen .
People want to hang those on Wall Street that created these toxic mortgage swaps effectively gambling without a dime in their pocket .
An unprecedented number of people called Congress at a 100 to 1 ratio and begged their " representatives " not to bail out these crooks .
Instead , they were terrorized by the chief ruler of this country who told them the sky would fall if they did n't let this theft happen to try to force them to change their minds .
The people spoke and Washington answered : la la la la la la la , I can't hear you with my fingers in my ears .
Both men running to be the next ruler of this country promised that they would not allow business as usual to take place in D.C. Both promised to make changes .
Both said they would not allow bills that contained expensive pork .
Well , the campaign is not even over and they have both lied already .
McCain and Obama happily signed the second bailout bill that contained an additional $ 150,000,000,000 worth of pork barrel spending .
They can't even get through a few weeks of campaigning without breaking their promises .
The people are looking at their " choices " and they are angry because they know there will be no change .
Many are angry because the one hope we had — Ron Paul — was stolen from us by a foolish media who now seek out interviews with him like he is a financial rock star .
( Please forgive my slight against third - party candidates by insinuating that only two men are running for President . )
If the people in charge of our money would just listen to Ron Paul for once , we would all stand a chance .
He knows the cure for our economic ills .
He knew this was coming ; he has been warning Congress for years .
Better yet , he knows how to fix this mess .
Moreover , Dr. Paul knows that stealing from the poor to give to the rich is bad for our morality .
We need to leave the markets alone to let them work .
We need to let bad companies fail .
We will have a bad recession that will probably last a year rather than what could be decades of financial disaster .
We could have hope , but that seems unlikely .
The odds are slim that the Secretary of the Treasury or any other politician in Washington will listen to Dr. Paul no matter how much the markets drop .
They will keep inflating to prop up a failing system and we face the awful possibility of hyperinflation .
People are angry that we have a solution but it is being ignored .
The people of this country are beginning to realize that the irresponsible get rewarded while the hard working stiffs get the shaft .
They are seeing that no matter how loudly they scream , they have no voice in our government .
They taught their children to be responsible and to live within their means , but the folks with six - figure credit card debt and homes they cannot afford are getting all the goodies .
The companies with the worst managers , who took the greatest risks , are getting handed multi-billion dollar checks , while the rest of us cannot afford groceries .
The hardest - working folks , the ones who saved for their future are now realizing that our government can and will take it all away from them in a second .
And guess what , they are angry : Very , very angry .
Guess what else people are figuring out ?
If they are upside down on their home loan — in other words — they owe more than their house is now worth — it makes economic sense not to pay your mortgage .
As soon as you go into foreclosure you will likely get your principle reduced and your interest rate lowered .
Once the word gets out , many will decide not to pay their mortgage .
Now that is a great incentive to get the housing market back on its feet !
Instead of letting housing prices fall for a short time and then rebound , the government has inadvertently set up a situation where houses will continue to go into foreclosure , banks will have to get more money from us to stay in business and we are all in a dangerous downward spiral .
Knowing what I do about Austrian Economics , I know that printing money cannot make a country wealthy .
I am not sure what this toxic anger will do to the country .
We will all end up paying a lot to bail out a lot of irresponsible people and we will not be happy about it .
I am reminded of a scene from Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand .
( I highly recommend the book to anyone who has not read it yet . )
In that book , she talks about a company that decided the best way to exist was to take from each according to his ability to give to each according to their need .
Eventually , everyone ending up needing a whole lot and no one was too keen to be productive .
I worry that we will see something similar in this country .
What are we learning from all of this ?
What lessons are we teaching our children ?
Are we telling them that those that fail the hardest get to steal the most from those that do the best ?
You do n't have to be too bright to decide which side of that equation you want to be on .
Charity used to be something you gave freely and felt good about doing .
Charity at the point of a gun is not done freely and no one feels good about it .
Those that are taken from are furious and those that receive are not grateful ; instead , they feel entitled and ask for more .
Nothing could be worse for us morally as a people .
Forget about the toxic debt , what will we do with all this toxic anger ?

The EU is readying a new set of directives that could spell trouble for Apple 's iPhone and any other gadget that lacks an easily removable power pack .
A new , draft batteries directive mandates that power cells inside electronic devices must be " readily removable " for replacement and safe disposal .
This is n't the case with the iPhone , which does not have a user - replaceable battery .
Neither do Apple 's numerous iPods , or a growing number of handheld devices from other manufacturers .
Under the terms of the directive , by 2012 , at least 25 per cent of all portable batteries - including mobile phone , laptop and car batteries - used annually in each member state must be recycled .
By 2016 , 45 per cent of them have to be .
Mercury , lead and cadmium are by far the most challenging substances in the battery waste stream , the EU says .
Although finer details of the removable - battery mandate have not yet been defined - is it sufficient for the supplier to be able to remove a product 's battery ?
- Gary Nevison of Leeds - based repair services company Premier Farnell believes the requirement is " clearly intended to ensure that users can remove batteries by opening a cover by hand or after removal of one or two screws " . ®
Scientists say they have been able to prove for the first time that human activity is contributing to the warming of both the Arctic and Antarctic .
British researchers say their analysis shows that increasing temperatures cannot be explained by natural causes alone .
The researchers say that they expected this result for the Arctic because of the recent sharp increase in the summer melting of sea ice in the region .
But temperature variations in the Antarctic have until now been harder to interpret .
Today 's study however indicates that there is a clear human influence there too .
Last year , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) presented strong scientific evidence that a recent rise in average global temperature is mostly due to human activities .
At the time there was not enough evidence for the panel to formally say this about the Arctic and Antarctic .
That gap , the researchers say , has now been plugged .

RubyConf is only a little over 2 weeks away .
Time flies !
I ’ve been doing a series of interviews with speakers leading up to the conference .
This time is Ben Bleything .
Ben is going to be speaking at RubyConf about Ruby and Music
What are you currently doing with Ruby and music ?
This is going to be a recurring theme , so I ’ll get it out of the way
here .
I think of myself more as a toolsmith than an actual creator .
I ’m not doing anything with Ruby and music per se …
I ’m trying to
create tools for other people to use .
My creativity manifests in such a way that I ’m actually pretty bad at
creating “ art ” .
I ’m a semi - failed musician , and I do n’t have any
illusions about programming being the path to making sweet , sweet music .
I just think it ’s an interesting problem to solve .
I have this vision of showing up at RubyConf in 2010 and having people
using the stuff that Giles and Yossef and myself and others create to
make some rad music .
You spoke about Ruby and electronics last year .
How did you get into electronics ?
What got you excited about it ?
I ’ve been into electronics since I was 12 or 13 .
I was the kid who
always took stuff apart .
I started frequenting my neighborhood Radio
Shack around 14 , building little lighty - uppy things and noisemakers and
the like .
I grew bored of that pretty quickly , but I got back into it
after college around the time that the Arduino came out .
One of the things that draws me to programming in general is the feeling
of empowerment .
It ’s really cool to be able to make a computer do
your nefarious bidding .
Now apply that feeling to a physical device
and you ’re talking about a whole different level of that empowerment .
I ’ve said before that I feel like I was born 40 years too late … that I
should have been hacking in the ’60s .
Programming for microcontrollers
is , in a lot of ways , as close as I can get to that .
Starting with bare
metal and building an application , even if it ’s as simple as blinking a
light ( the hello world of electronics ) is deeply satisfying .
Being into electronics , have you ever tried to build your own electronic instrument or have the computer play a real instrument with motors ?
Not yet , no .
Both are interesting ideas but getting close to requiring
actual musical knowledge , and that ’s where I start to get scared :)
I am playing around with hooking up video game instruments ( think Rock
Band and Guitar Hero ) to a computer .
This sounds pretty mundane , and I
guess that it is … but the trick is that I ’ll be passing those through
Ruby in order to provide the instruments with a bit more intelligence .
I guess the bottom line is that I ’m much more interested in building
systems ( hardware or software ) that more experienced musicians can use
as tools … which brings us back to the toolsmith point above .
Can computers generate beautiful music ?
Dance beats seem easy .
What about jazz improvisations ?
Classical music ?
Pop songs ?
I ’m sure that a computer can generate beautiful music , but I think it
would be mostly coincidental .
I ’m still undecided on whether you can
program a computer to always generate beautiful music .
It surely
happens by chance sometimes , though .
I suspect that there ’s interesting results waiting down the path of
doing things like markov chaining with music instead of text .
Analyzing
and chaining music is a significantly more complex problem than doing it
with words , but my gut says with the right corpus , you could get some
pretty interesting stuff .
Fundamentally , though , I think music has to have soul to be truly great .
I want everyone to try to prove me wrong , though !
Ruby , electronics , and music is a lot of ground to cover .
Are you passionate and excited about anything else in particular outside of these ?
I ’m passionate and excited about everything that catches my interest ,
honestly .
I ’ve just chosen not to focus any energy on anything else
right now .
I want to find ways to share my experience with others … to
get people excited about doing the things they thought were too hard .
My electronics presentation last year is a prime example of that .
This
stuff is n’t difficult , it ’s just intimidating .
If I can lower the
barrier to entry , either by educating or providing tools , then I feel
like I ’ve done my job .
I ’m really hoping that my talk this year will do
the same for the people interested in music .
87 Million Year - Old Praying Mantis Found
Is the 87 - million - year - old praying mantis recently found encased in amber in Japan a “ missing link ” between mantises from the Cretaceous period and modern - day insects ?
It is a rare find indeed and its true significance is still to be deciphered .
Discovered in January of this year by Kazuhisa Sasaki , director of the Kuji Amber Museum , the fossil mantis measures 0.5 inch ( 1.4 centimeters ) from its antennae to the tip of its abdomen .
It was found buried more than six feet below the surface of an amber mine in a part of Japan that is famous for producing large amounts of amber , the northeastern Iwate Prefecture .
“ I found it in a deposit that had lots of other insects ( ancient flies , bees , and cockroaches ) but this was the only praying mantis ”  said Sasaki .
The fossil mantis is partially well preserved , although its wings and abdomen are badly crushed .
According to Kyoichiro Ueda , executive curator of the Kitakyushu Museum of Natural History , it is the oldest mantis fossil ever found in Japan and only one of seven in the entire world from the Cretaceous Period .
Even more unique is the fact that this mantis is different from the other six , in that it has two spines protruding from its femur and it has mysterious , tiny hairs on its forelegs .
No mantis from this particular time period has ever been found with spines , although modern mantises have five or six on their forelegs , which help them catch prey .
“ The years of the late Cretaceous period were a kind of transition phase between the ancient and modern worlds , and this fossil displays many intermediate elements between the two eras ” said Ueda .
Time alone will reveal the significance of this important find .

PRINCETON , NJ --
There is little change in the Gallup Poll Daily tracking results covering Friday , Saturday , and Sunday interviews , as Barack Obama leads John McCain by a four percentage point margin among registered voters , 48 % to 44 % .
The four - point margin in favor of Obama is the same as in Sunday 's report .
Gallup 's separate tracking of consumer confidence showed little change over the weekend , suggesting that Americans may be taking a breath after last week 's fast - paced barrage of news about Wall Street and the economy .
Obama 's current lead is similar to what Gallup measured for much of last summer before the start of the conventions in late August .
During the convention time period , of course , there was significant change in the candidates ' standings , with Obama moving ahead by as much as eight points after the Democratic National Convention , and then McCain moving ahead by five points after his party 's convention .
Both candidates appear to be focusing their public remarks , at this point , on the extraordinary planned government financial bailout , which could have some impact on the race this week -- but the major event looming on the horizon is the first presidential debate at the University of Mississippi this Friday .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general election results are based on combined data from Sept. 19 - 21 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,740 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

WASHINGTON  For years , a Congressional hearing with Alan Greenspan was a marquee event .
Lawmakers doted on him as an economic sage .
Markets jumped up or down depending on what he said .
Politicians in both parties wanted the maestro on their side .
But on Thursday , almost three years after stepping down as chairman of the Federal Reserve , a humbled Mr. Greenspan admitted that he had put too much faith in the self - correcting power of free markets and had failed to anticipate the self - destructive power of wanton mortgage lending .
“ Those of us who have looked to the self - interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders ’ equity , myself included , are in a state of shocked disbelief , ” he told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Now 82 , Mr. Greenspan came in for one of the harshest grillings of his life , as Democratic lawmakers asked him time and again whether he had been wrong , why he had been wrong and whether he was sorry .
Mr Chertoff said new procedures should cut identification errors Fewer than 2,500 people are on the US " no- fly " list , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has said .
Reports that hundreds of thousands were on lists barring them from flying or subjecting them to extra security were " simply false " , Mr Chertoff said .
His comments came as he outlined new screening procedures aimed at reducing errors in identifying terror suspects .
The American Civil Liberties Union estimates there are some one million people on US government watchlists .
Speaking on Wednesday , Mr Chertoff said that fewer than 2,500 people were on the US " no - fly list " - which prevents them from boarding an aircraft because intelligence indicates they pose a threat .
Of that number only 10 % are US citizens , he said .
The Transport Security Administration ( TSA ) had fewer than 16,000 people on its " selectee " list - which means they are subjected to extra scrutiny at airports - and very few of those were Americans , he added .
Civil rights groups say the actual number on the government 's database is far larger , running to hundreds of thousands .
They also point to the number of cases of mistaken identity where people with names similar to individuals on watchlists are subjected to extra security or even prevented from flying .
Thousands of passengers have asked for their names to be removed from the lists .
Currently , airlines check names against lists sent to them by the TSA to determine if people need additional screening or should be barred from boarding , but procedures vary between airlines and they do not always have the most up - to - date lists .
False positives Mr Chertoff said from next year the responsibility of comparing names on lists would be transferred to the TSA .
Under the programme , called Secure Flight , travellers will have to give their full name , date of birth and gender when making reservations .
Airlines will then send encrypted information to the TSA which will compare the passenger information with the updated watchlists , and notify the airline if there is a problem .
" That 's going to eliminate the false positives , and it 's going to upgrade our security , " Mr Chertoff said .
The Secure Flight programme had been held up amid privacy concerns , which officials say have now been addressed .

What are these ?
recent patent application from Apple reveals that the company is considering adding a proper " At a Glance " notification screen for the iPhone .
The proposed screen would allow users to quickly jump to the desired notification simply by pressing on the corresponding notification .
At present , the iPhone 's notification lists is a list that disappears when the phone is unlocked .
This sort of notification system may become more important once 3rd party " push " notifications are activated , as the number and variety of these notifications will likely increase significantly .
Apple originally had an early version of " push " notifications built into developer builds of iPhone 2.1 .
This feature , however , was later removed and the final version of 2.1 was released earlier this month without this feature .
Apple has not made any announcements if their targeted release date has been changed .

At a campaign stop in Rochester , New Hampshire , today Joe Biden took the gloves off against Sarah Palin , by openly mocking her debate answer on the cause of global warming , and he repeated the campaign ’s promise to end the Iraq war .
“ If my opponent in our debate , I think it was a debate , that we had .
I mean look when the moderator asked us do you think man is the cause of global warming .
I mean to paraphrase her , maybe … not sure .
Look how are you going to solve global warming when you have no idea what in the hell … heck is causing global warming .
How do you change it ?
Folks , it would be funny if it were n’t so deadly serious . ”
He also promised that he and Obama will end the Iraq war , “ Look you ca n’t change the next four years if you simply continue George Bush ’s shoot first and ask questions later foreign policy .
You ca n’t change the next four years if you believe that we should continue to spend $ 10 billion a month in Iraq , when the Iraqis have a $ 79 billion surplus .
Ladies and Gentleman , to quote the elder Bush , the first President Bush , read my lips , we will end this war .
We will end this war .
We will transfer responsibility to the Iraqis . ”

When Palin was first added to the ticket this kind of attack was unthinkable to Biden and Obama , but she has been weakened by her own clueless interview style , and the Troopergate report .
If anyone out there still needed proof that Sarah Palin is a national joke , it came today in the form of Biden ’s complete lack of fear towards mocking her .
Biden ’s comments today about Palin are also a subtle way of questioning McCain ’s judgment .
The more explicit questioning of McCain ’s judgment came when Biden discussed ending the Iraq war .
I think that is little doubt in most people ’s minds that Obama will end the war , and that John McCain intends to continue the policies of President Bush in Iraq .
Talking about the Iraq war in this manner also allows Biden to connect McCain to Bush .
The comments above were only 1:39 seconds long , but in politics a lot can happen in a couple of minutes .

As we 've recently learned , real Americans , in the American heartland of America , eat moose and go snowmobiling .
But in liberal San Francisco , out - of - touch left - wingers prefer to sip wine while discussing their love of terrorists and homosexuality .
Or at least they did until they realised what they were drinking : at Yield Wine Bar in downtown San Francisco , sales of a once - popular organic red from Chile have plummeted in the last few weeks , because its name is Palin Syrah .
" It was our bestselling wine before [ the VP announcement ] , " owner Chris Tavelli laments .
( " One Yield regular suggested that Tavelli amend the wine 's tasting note to read ' moosemeat , salmon , hint of gunpowder ' , " reports the website Serious Eats . )
Pundits have long held that the distinction between " wine - track Democrats " and " beer - track Democrats " is a fundamental cultural cleavage in the US , and frankly , shunning Palin Syrah in appalled horror is typical elitist wine - track behaviour : do you think beer - track voters would shun Miller Lite just because someone called Miller was running for the Republicans ?
Of course not : they 'd get on and drink it .
Anyway , when McCain wins in November it will be necessary to consume very large amounts of alcohol constantly for four years , whatever the brand name , so you might as well start practicing now .

WHEN Greig McArthur gets in his Ferrari 360 Modena , he likes to take his iPhone along .
He might have to call someone , of course , but it ’s certain he ’ll use the phone to see how his car is running .
Mr. McArthur , a programmer who lives in Scotland and works there and in New York , likes to use the Dynolicious application on his phone to test the acceleration of his car and , for that matter , anything he happens to be riding in .
He says his Ferrari went from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 5.2 seconds and the Q train in Queens reached a maximum speed of 42.4 m.p.h when he rode it about a month ago .
Software like Dynolicious is now appearing as programmers begin to appreciate just what can be done with an iPhone and other advanced cellphones that know where they are and just how quickly they are going someplace else .
Dynolicious tracks the changes of speed with the iPhone ’s built - in accelerometer , a silicon - based sensor that measures the motion of a vehicle .
The software constantly measures these changes and converts the information into a good estimate of how fast the car is going .
Another program , called G - Tac , does much the same thing as Dynolicious .
Both G - Tac and Dynolicious also work with iPod Touch models .
But many car lovers question the accuracy of the information provided by such software , because the measurements are so small and because any errors can be compounded as the processor adds them up hundreds of times per second .
This led Mr. McArthur to buy a special bracket that holds his iPhone horizontally because , he said , his wife ’s patience for being told to “ hold it correctly ” was wearing thin .
Eating too much fructose can induce leptin resistance , a condition that can easily lead to becoming overweight when combined with a high - fat , high - calorie diet , according to a new study with rats .
Although previous studies have shown that being leptin resistant can lead to rapid weight gain on a high - fat , high - calorie diet , this is the first study to show that leptin resistance can develop as a result of high fructose consumption .
The study also showed for the first time that leptin resistance can develop silently , that is , with little indication that it is happening .
Leptin as regulator
Leptin is a hormone that plays a role in helping the body to balance food intake with energy expenditure .
When leptin is n't working -- that is , when the body no longer responds to the leptin it produces -- it 's called leptin resistance .
Leptin resistance is associated with weight gain and obesity in the face of a high - fat , high - calorie diet .
Obesity has been a growing problem in the U.S. and in other parts of the world and fructose has been suspected of playing a role .
Fructose is the sugar found in fruit , but it's not the normal consumption of fruit that is the problem .
Table sugar and high - fructose corn syrup are about 50 % fructose and these ingredients have become increasingly common in many foods and beverages .
With sugar and high - fructose corn syrup being added to many foods , people now eat much more fructose than ever before .
The study , " Fructose - induced leptin resistance exacerbates weight gain in response to subsequent high - fat feeding , " was carried out by Alexandra Shapiro , Wei Mu , Carlos Roncal , Kit - Yan Cheng , Richard J. Johnson and Philip J. Scarpace , all at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville .
The study appears in the American Journal of Physiology – Regulatory , Integrative and Comparative Physiology .
The University of Florida researchers hypothesized that a high - fructose diet could lead to leptin resistance , which in turn could lead to exacerbated weight gain in the face of a high - fat , high - calorie diet , a typical diet in industrialized countries .
To test their hypothesis , the research team performed a study with two groups of rats .
They fed both groups the same diet , with one important exception : one group consumed a lot of fructose while the other received no fructose .
Two groups similar over six months
During these six months , there were no differences in food intake , body weight , and body fat between rats on the high - fructose and the rats on the fructose - free diets .
In addition , there was no difference between the two groups in the levels of leptin , glucose , cholesterol or insulin found in their blood .
There was only one difference at the end of the six months :
The rats on the high - fructose diet had higher levels of triglycerides in their blood .
The researchers next tested the animals to see if they were leptin resistant .
They injected all the animals with leptin , to see if they would respond by eating less .
Animals whose leptin response is functioning normally will lower their food intake .
The researchers discovered that the rats on the high - fructose diet were leptin resistant , that is , they did not lower their food intake when given leptin .
The no-fructose animals responded normally to leptin by eating less .
This first six months of the study showed that leptin resistance can develop silently .
" Usually , leptin resistance is associated with obesity , but in this case , leptin resistance developed without obesity , " Shapiro said .
" This was very surprising . "
Role of diet
Having seen that leptin resistance could develop silently , the researchers next wanted to find out what would happen if they switched the rats to a high - fat , high - calorie diet -- the kind many Americans eat .
They found that the animals exposed to the high - fructose diet , the leptin resistant rats , ate more and gained much more weight and fat than the leptin responsive animals on the fructose - free diet .
All told , this study showed that leptin resistance can :
develop by eating a lot of fructose
develop silently , that is , with very little indication it is happening
result in weight gain when paired with a high fat , calorie dense diet
Scarpace said the study suggests it is the interaction between consumption of large amounts of fructose - containing foods and eating a high - fat , high - calorie diet that produces the weight gain .
" This study may explain how the global increase in fructose consumption is related to the current obesity epidemic , " Shapiro said .
How it happens
Other studies have shown that elevated triglycerides impair the transport of leptin across the blood brain barrier .
The researchers hypothesize that the elevation in triglycerides produced by fructose prevented leptin from reaching the brain .
If leptin does not reach the brain , the brain will not send out the signal to stop eating .
" The presence of high fructose alters the way leptin works , fooling the brain so that it ignores leptin , " Scarpace said .
Consumers should be cautious about what they eat , checking labels to see how much sugar the items contain , Shapiro said .
The researchers hope to perform future studies to find out if leptin resistance can be reversed by removing or reducing the fructose content of the diet .

A patch by Eric Mahunin now allows the default values for arguments in lambda s. From the Changelog :
parse.y ( f_block_optarg ) : allow default for block parameters as long as the value is primary .
a patch from Eric Mahurin in [ ruby - core : 16880 ] .
Another debated topic was the " stabby lambda " , ie .
the -> notation for lambda s , introduced in 1.9 .
While some were arguing for its removal , it remains in the language .
Dave Thomas ( PragDave ) mentions that the 3rd edition of the Pickaxe book ( which covers 1.9.x ) is done , and will be available around or after the final 1.9.1 release .
The Rubinius project has reached another milestone in it 's development .
Rubinius founder Evan Phoenix reports :
I ’m super happy to announce that we ’ve gotten the C++ branch stable enough that we ’re making in the default branch . [..]
Here is what was done :
* The old master branch was rename shotgun .
* The cpp branch was copy to the name master .
* The cpp branch was then deleted .
The C++ branch was started to rewrite the VM in C ++.
Previously , the " shotgun " VM was written in C .
The new C++ VM is :
Better organized .
We ’ve learned a lot in the building of the last VM about how to structure things .
For instance , using C++ lets us model Ruby classes as C++ classes , providing the VM with the same familiar structure and execution as their Ruby counterparts . [..]
Better tested .
The old VM , I ’m ashamed to say , had no unit tests .
From day one of the new VM , we ’ve been writing unit and integration tests .
The Rubinius repository is available at GitHub .
Update :
This video was filmed by an amateur in East Congo ( DRC ) , interviewing a Virunga National Park ranger .
As the interview progresses , the cross fire between rebel and government troops comes nearer .
You can almost feel the fear and panic from the people running past the camera .
The conflict in DRC is one of the most underreported civil wars , killing an estimated 45,000 people per month .
Per month !
Fighting in eastern Congo has driven some 200,000 from their homes during the last eight weeks , exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis .
( Full Regarding the actual video shoot :
It was shot to show the plight of the wardens at the Virunga National Park .
Things just got worse .
Rebels took over Rumangabo's ranger station , in what seems a major offensive .
The Virunga rangers have fled into the mountains .

Along with partner Todd Moeller , Vitale was part of the g00dfellas spam gang that specialized in pump - and - dump spam -- artificially boosting a worthless company 's stock price so insiders can dump the shares at a profit .
In July 2008 , Vitale pleaded guilty to violating the Federal CAN - SPAM
Act by flooding 1.3 million AOL e-mail addresses with spam in the space of a week .
Not your typical geek gone bad , Vitale 's rap sheet boasted 22 prior convictions .
He had a reputation for welshing on his partners -- no wonder he got ratted out by a confidential informant working with the U.S. Secret Service .
A plea bargain netted Vitale a 30 - month sentence and a $ 180,000 fine .
( Partner - in - crime Moeller got 27 months . )
At one point , the Brooklyn - born 28 - year - old Vitale boasted about making more than $ 40,000 a week .
Now he 'll be making license plates at a federal penitentiary .

Spam Royalty Rank : Dauphin of Despair
The United Nations has pulled its staff out of Sri Lanka 's rebel - held northern region after being ensured safe passage by government troops and rebels .
Other aid agencies have also left , after being prevented from doing so over the weekend by displaced people .
The agencies ' move comes as the army continues a major offensive against the rebels in northern areas of the island .
The government ordered aid workers out of the north last week saying they could not guarantee their safety .
The army says it is closing in on rebel headquarters in Kilinochchi after other rebel bases fell in recent months .
KILINOCHCHI TOWN
The capital of Kilinochchi District , it is part of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka Serves as the administrative centre and headquarters of the Tamil Tigers Rebels have their own judiciary and police force in the town According to the UN , 90 % of population is Tamil Town surrounded by thousands of landmines , says the UN Town has high rates of infant mortality and malnutrition Government ordered aid agencies to leave , Sept 2008
Aid agency dilemma in Sri Lanka Kilinochchi is the town where aid agencies in the north have been based .
A convoy of some 20 vehicles carrying UN and other staff set off from the town on Tuesday travelling south along the A9 highway .
Later the convoy arrived in Omantai town in government - controlled territory .
UN spokesman in Colombo Gordon Weiss said a total of 40 UN staff had now pulled out .
Some local employees had decided to stay .
" We are pulling out reluctantly " because of aerial bombing and artillery shelling , he told the BBC Tamil service .
A spokesman for the Roman Catholic aid agency , Caritas , said that it was " not possible to get the church out of the north " and its staff would remain .
Meanwhile , a bomb has wounded at least four people on a bus in the capital , Colombo , police say .
There have been a number of such attacks blamed on the rebels in recent months .
Displaced
The BBC's Roland Buerk in Colombo says the military is pushing ahead with a major offensive to defeat the Tigers and end their fight for a separate state for the Tamil minority .
Troops are now near Kilinochchi Fighting has intensified as soldiers continue a slow advance , aiming to crush the Tigers ' de facto mini state in the north .
Key rebel bases have fallen , and the army says the Tigers have been driven from the east .
Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said troops were now just 5.5 km ( 3.4 miles ) away from the rebel headquarters at Kilinochchi .
Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy casualties on the other in fighting in Akkaraayan to the south - west of Kilinochchi district on Monday .
In Kilinochchi town itself , buildings around the hospital were hit by the air force and four civilians killed , a hospital doctor told the BBC Sinhala service .
Earlier , aid workers in the town told the BBC they could hear small - arms fire .
Last week , the government told aid workers employed by international organisations to leave the area , saying it could not guarantee their safety .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) is being allowed to remain in the area .
It operates a checkpoint between government and rebel - held territory .
The UN says the plight of civilians in the north is worsening
The government does not allow independent reporters into conflict areas , and many lines of communication to the north have been cut .
Aid agencies estimate there are 160,000 people in rebel areas who have been displaced by the fighting .
Leaflets have been dropped urging them to move out .
Sources on the ground say civilians are fleeing Kilinochchi into areas to the east , and rebel fighters are going that way too .
Asked if he planned to obliterate the Tigers , Sri Lanka 's President Mahinda Rajapaksa told foreign correspondents the military would try , but it would take time .
" We are focusing on war , " he said , Reuters reports .
" We can crush them .
Why can't we ?
They are in the jungle at the moment , and our forces are in the jungle at the moment . "
Guerrilla warfare The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) have been fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in the north and east for 25 years .
More than 70,000 people have died .
The rebels have come under sustained pressure from the government 's air and ground forces , and they have been gradually forced to cede territory in several areas in recent months .
However , despite recent losses , the Tamil Tigers still hold considerable fighting ability to launch surprise counter attacks .
Contrary to some military claims , their core fighting formations are said to be still intact and they can easily adapt themselves to protracted guerrilla warfare , analysts say .
In July , Sri Lanka 's army commander said the rebels had been defeated as a conventional force - but he conceded that a low - level insurgency could last forever .

Shapeways.com is beta testing a new service allowing people to print three dimensional models .
Customers can upload designs or use a creation tool hosted at the Shapeways website then order a printed model of their designs for less than $ 3 per square centimeter .
The printed items are shipped to the customer in ten days or less , bringing 3 - D printing to consumers and not just companies large enough to afford their own printers .
3 - D Printing on Demand

Even the cheapest three dimensional printers cost $ 20,000 not including the expense of consumables such as the powders used as the base for the printed models .
Shapeways.com brings the cost of model creation down into the hundreds of dollars ( or even less for small items ) , making it accessible to even private individuals .
The online design creator also helps open the market to the general consumer market by removing the need for expertise in 3 - D design software .
Shapeways also allows visitors to their website to view recently created designs , rate them , and even use them as the basis for their own designs if the original design creators allow it .
Shapeways looks to combine their service with a social networking site revolving around 3 - D models , allowing individual users to print items , just participate on the website through commenting and forum posting , or do both .
Indeed , although small businesses and inventors are free to use their service , Shapeways seems to be aiming primarily at the consumer market with products like a light poem , a printed poem or phrase written around a high cylindrical shade that can surround a Phillips Imageo LED candle .
Other consumer - oriented templates are on their way including a decorative bowl that can be reshaped to suit the taste of different customers .

Shapeways includes several tutorials and tip articles including a page highlighting some of the differences between conceptual 3 - D designs and those meant for printing and an extensive table of information about the available materials .
Shapeways currently supports four different materials , each with different properties and different requirements related to size restrictions and the level of detail present in the design .
Three dimensional printing on demand brings this process to the masses – literally .
Instead of baseline costs in the many thousands of dollars , rapid three dimensional models or objects can now be created at a minimal cost and even without experience using 3 - D design tools .
With an eye toward social networking and consumer products , Shapeways is looking to open up a cutting edge market to a much wider audience .
TFOT has written about an MIT student project that creates and recycles plastic plates on demand and programmable bendable polymers that fold into pre-programmed shapes when heated .
You can find out more about three dimensional printing on demand , design and print your own models , or rate and comment other people ’s designs at Shapeways.com .
Wow , brave media .
After treating the press like dirt this morning and refusing to let anyone cover Palin ’s meetings with foreign leaders at the UN , leading CNN to cancel its camera coverage of Palin ’s phony photo opps , the Palin / McCain campaign promised the media that it was all a misunderstanding .
So during the next event , the media was let in to cover it .
All for a grand total of 15 to 20 seconds .
Then they were told to get out .
Have none of you people ever watched any Charlie Brown ?
Are you people stupid or something ?
You never had any clue that Palin / McCain woud pull the football out from under you again .
And again and again .
Seriously , stop covering these phony photo opps .
Stop sending people on McCain ’s bus and plane ( when you ’re not even on McCain ’s bus anyway , real journalists were kicked off of that thing long ago ) .
It ’s like the Stockholm Syndrome with you people .
I ’m expecting the Palin / McCain campaign to release a photo any day now of Candy Crowley with a Tommy Gun .
Even since then , the authorities had tried to insist that the contamination was local , even though by that time infected oranges were on sale across the country .
The full extent of the problem , which has led to tens of thousands of oranges being destroyed , was only revealed at a press conference at the end of last week .
Police DNC T - Shirts Create Stir
Written by investigative reporter Brian Maass
E-mail DENVER ( CBS4 ) —
A tongue - in - cheek t- shirt poking fun at Democratic National Convention protestors is selling fast and creating some minor controversy along the way .
The shirts were created and distributed by the Denver Police Protective Association , the union that represents most of Denver ’s 1,400 police officers .
The front of the black shirt shows the number “ 68 ” with a slash through it .
One of the primary protest groups at last month ’s DNC in Denver called themselves “ Recreate 68 , ” harkening back to the violent , 1968 political convention in Chicago .
The back of the shirt features a menacing - looking police figure , wearing what looks like a Denver police badge and helmet and clutching a baton .
He ’s looming over the city of Denver along with the slogan , “ WE GET UP EARLY , to BEAT the crowds . ”
Also written across the back of the shirt is “ 2008 DNC . ’
One CBS4 viewer , Seth Barnett , contacted the station to complain about the shirts , writing they “ are a terrible representation of our city and its police . ”
Barnett , a 21 - year - old college student , called the shirts “ disrespectful , ” saying they seemed “ like a low blow . ”
Barnett said he was appalled by the shirts and wrote Denver ’s mayor and the police department to complain .
“ I want an answer , ” the Barnett wrote , “ of why they take the harm of our citizens and guests as a joke . ”
He said he thinks the shirts are a poor representation of the city and its police force .
There were 154 protestors arrested during the August convention ; many taken into custody following a Monday night melee with police along 15th Street .
The Denver police detective who produced the shirts , Det. Nick Rogers , says he has received no complaints until now .
He said the shirts are being sold for $ 10 each at the Police Protective Association Offices .
Rogers , who is on the Board of the Police Protective Association , said the shirts were produced because police typically create commemorative shirts to mark big events like the DNC .
He said the PPA will likely sell a couple thousand of the shirts .
They went on sale following the convention and he said every Denver police officer was given one free .
Beyond that , he said officers from other departments like Lakewood police and the Jefferson County Sheriffs Department have been clamoring for the shirts and have ordered dozens more .
He said after the initial printing , there was so much demand he had to reorder more shirts .

MARIA Bartiromo‘s CNBC rival , Erin Burnett , is doing her share to roil the cable business network .
Sources tell Page Six that Burnett , known as the “ Street Sweetie , ” has network suits in an uproar over the narcissistic , money - grubbing feature she penned for Men ’s Health , titled “ Eight Things That Would Impress Me ” – with bosses worried it could hurt her and the station ’s serious news image .
In the jaw - dropping piece , first revealed on this page Monday , Burnett says guys can “ unlock ” her heart by giving her round - trip , business - class tickets to Australia and New Zealand , sending a yoga instructor and personal chef to her apartment , and treating her and her sisters to a long - weekend spa getaway , among other suggestions .
“ This has caused a lot of hand - wringing at the network , ” an insider told us , suggesting Burnett comes off as a trite , gold - digging hussy .
“ There ’s worry she ’s damaged her brand .
Everybody ’s talking about it and asking , like , ‘ Why did you do this ? ’
Everybody think it ’s a major [ bleep ] - up . ’ ”
A mention of the article on Dealbreaker.com ridiculed it as , “ Map to Erin Burnett ’s [ Bleep ] . ”
The site later substituted the word “ heart ” for the vulgarism .
“ The newsroom was talking about ‘ Erin Burnett ’s [ bleep ] . ’
You ’ve got to wonder who gave her the idea for this story , ” our source said .
Burnett , who ’s been dubbed “ Maria 2.0 ” for her rivalry with “ Money Honey ” Bartiromo , would n’t talk to us .
CNBC flack Brian Steel refused to say whether Burnett ’s story set off an uproar , repeatedly telling us : “ Erin is one of the most respected and insightful journalists on television today .
“ It was a fun little piece , ” Steel said , adding that he had pre-approved Burnett ’s writing the article .
Burnett ’s boo - boo takes even more heat off Bartiromo , who last year survived an ethics scandal over globetrotting on Citigroup ’s private jet with its then - wealth - management chief Todd Thomson , who later got the ax .
She also had animal - rights activists screeching for posing in a $ 3,695 Michael Kors wool coat and gushing about its fluffy fox - fur cuffs .
Our source said : “ For the moment it looks like Maria ’s off the hook .
Erin ’s the problem child now . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- A
House committee chairman blasted former chiefs of American International Group Inc. on Tuesday , blaming their huge paychecks and the company 's lavish style for the federal government 's $ 85 billion bailout of the insurer .
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government , said the executives received large bonuses that they did n't deserve .
He also said company officials wined and dined at a posh resort even after the government issued the company a taxpayer - funded $ 85 billion credit line on Sept. 16 .
The ex-CEOs themselves blamed accounting rules and market conditions for the problems that led to the crisis .
In testimony for the committee hearing , ex-CEOs Robert Willumstad and Martin Sullivan said the rules forced AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) to take billions in writedowns and led to a downward spiral that led to the government action .
But Waxman put the blame for AIG 's troubles squarely on its past and present leaders , comparing them to the former Lehman chief executive Richard Fuld , who testified Monday about the investment bank 's bankruptcy .
" In each case , the companies and their executives grew rich by taking on excessive risk , " said Waxman .
" In each case , the companies collapsed when these risks turned bad .
And in each case , their executives are walking away with millions of dollars while taxpayers are stuck with billions of dollars in costs . "
Waxman added , " The AIG CEOs are like the Lehman CEO in one other key respect - in each case , they refuse to accept any blame for what happened to their companies . "
In particular , Waxman singled out AIG 's financial products division , headed by Joseph Cassano .
" This ( bailout ) was a direct result of the mistakes made by Mr. Cassano , " Waxman said , blaming him for putting AIG in a situation where it had a $ 60 billion debt without the money to pay it .
" Yet even today , he remains on the company payroll , receiving $ 1 million a month . "
' Wining and dining '
Waxman also attacked company leadership for throwing a one - week retreat at the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach near San Diego , Calif .
just days after the bailout , at a cost of $ 440,000 .
" Average Americans are suffering economically .
They are losing their jobs , their homes , and their health insurance , " said Waxman .
" Yet less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG , company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation . "
Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Md. , a senior committee member , described the expensive retreat as " outrageous . "
He said it included visits to the spa and golf course , with $ 10,000 in so - called " leisure dining " - which he suspected was actually drinking - with lodgings that cost more per night than some of his constituents spend on their monthly mortgage payments .
" The American people are paying for that , and they 're very upset , " said Cummings .
Willumstad replied that he was unaware of the retreat and that it " seems very inappropriate . "
Sullivan replied that he was not leading the company at the time , adding , " If I had seen bills like that , if I was CEO , I can assure you I would have been asking questions . "
But AIG spokesman Nick Ashooh said that the St. Regis retreat had been " completely mischaracterized . "
He said it was an event to reward top - performing sales agents , and it was not for executives .
" They 're playing it as AIG executives running off to California while all this was going on , " said Ashooh , adding that the event was scheduled a year ago .
" It was n't AIG executives running off for a lavish weekend . "
Four committee Democrats - Waxman , Cummings , Bruce Braley of Iowa and Jackie Speier of California - released a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson about Cassano and the resort stay , urging him to " protect the taxpayers ' money and end this profligate spending . "
On Oct. 3 , AIG said it had already gone $ 61 billion into debt to the government , and was selling off parts of the company to pay for it .
Willumstad , who was CEO from June through the September action by the Federal Reserve , said " mark to market " accounting rules - which require companies to value securities at current prices in distressed situations - forced financial institutions to book billions of dollars in losses for securities that were not in default .
He said those losses led to a spiral that included debt rating downgrades .
Sullivan , who was CEO from March 2005 until June , said the accounting rules were key among several factors leading to AIG 's problems , saying they had " unintended consequences for financial institutions when markets seize up . "
But under blistering criticism from the committee for trying to insulate himself from blame , Sullivan said he was n't trying to criticize the accounting rules , and that he was n't trying to " point fingers at accountants . "
In his testimony , Willumstad told the committee , " I do n't believe AIG could have done anything differently , " blaming instead the " unexpected and unprecedented market - wide crisis of confidence . "
In an unusual move , Willumstad refused his $ 22 million in severance pay .
In a letter written at the time , Willumstad said he did not have the time to launch his restructuring plan and that he preferred " not to receive severance payments while shareholders and employees have lost considerable value in their AIG shares . "
Greenberg 's testimony
Maurice Greenberg , who was CEO of AIG for 35 years until his 2005 retirement , did not attend the hearing because of an illness , according to the committee .
In his written testimony , Greenberg said he was blameless because he was out the door more than three years before the company 's takeover .
" How did this happen ? " wrote Greenberg .
" I was not there , so I cannot answer that question with precision .
But reports indicate that the risk controls my team and I put in place were weakened or eliminated after my retirement . "
He also referred to the $ 85 billion credit line as a " bad deal " because it requires AIG " to pay interest on money it does not borrow , " encouraging the company to take out the full loan even if it did n't need it .
Also , Greenberg said that AIG does n't need the equity , because it has more than $ 1 trillion in assets .
Tuesday 's hearing was the second by the House Oversight panel to examine what went wrong with the economy .
It focused specifically on the Fed 's decision to bail out AIG over concerns that its failure would cause widespread damage to the economy , while allowing Lehman to fail .
" Quite frankly , based on a lot of the decisions you made , you deserved to fail , " said Rep. Tom Davis , R - Va. , ranking minority member of the committee , addressing Sullivan directly .
AIG spokesman Ashooh told CNNMoney.com that the testimony focused on the non-insurance part of the company .
He described the insurance part of AIG 's business as sound .
" We 're focused on the future and on paying off the federal loan , addressing the capital structure and continuing the business , " said Ashooh .
The first hearing , on Monday , grilled Fuld about why his company went under .
The committee said Fuld and Lehman were partly responsible for the economic failure that led to the $ 700 billion bailout of Wall Street .
But Fuld blamed a " crisis of confidence " that had swept through the financial markets .
Waxman also hammered Fuld for reaping about $ 480 million in compensation since 2000 at Lehman , while Fuld disputed that tally .
On Oct. 16 , the House will hold a hearing on the regulation of hedge funds .
An Oct. 22 session will focus on the breakdown of credit rating agencies , and a hearing on Oct. 23 will scrutinize the role of federal regulators .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bank of America proved it was not invulnerable to the credit crunch as it reported a steep decline in earnings on Monday , and announced plans to bulk up on capital by slashing its dividend in half and raising $ 10 billion through a stock sale .
Making the surprise announcement just after the closing bell , the Charlotte , N.C. - based bank said its third - quarter net income fell to $ 1.18 billion , or 15 cents a share , down 68 % from $ 3.7 billion , or 82 cents a share , a year ago .
That was far worse than Wall Street 's consensus forecasts of a net profit of $ 3.22 billion , or 62 cents a share .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) shares , which fell 6.5 % during the session Monday , tumbled more than 9 % in after - hours trading on the news .
Fresh off its recent acquisition of Merrill Lynch , Bank of America also said it planned to raise $ 10 billion in capital through a common stock sale and that it will cut its dividend to 32 cents from 64 cents in recent quarters .
Kenneth Lewis , Bank of America 's chairman and chief executive officer , told investors in a conference call the move would help insulate the company in the current market environment , which has been marked by the disappearance of several major financial institutions in recent weeks .
" We thought it was prudent , " Lewis said .
In addition to Bank of America 's purchase of Merrill Lynch , Lehman Brothers has filed for bankruptcy , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) acquired failed savings and loan Washington Mutual and Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) is in the process of being bought by either Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) or Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) .
Those two banks are battling in court over the rights to buy Wachovia .
Lewis reserved some of the blame for the dismal quarterly results for higher credit costs in such areas as its mortgage and credit businesses as more consumers found it difficult to repay their loans .
All told , Bank of America said it set aside $ 6.45 billion for credit - related losses , more than triple during the same period just a year ago .
Exacerbating that pain was a charge related to buying back auction - rate securities from clients , a $ 320 million hit from the company 's ownership of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and more than $ 1.2 billion in writedowns related to mortgage - backed securities and leveraged loans .
Bank of America execs said they experienced some encouraging trends including new client relationships and a flood of new deposits as both consumers and commercial account holders looked for a safe haven to park their cash .
Over the past 3 months , the company gained $ 21 billion in new deposits - almost three times the industry average .
But those highlights were tempered by a dour outlook .
Lewis , who has served as CEO since 2001 , warned that he expected loan losses to peak towards the latter end of 2009 and that the company would have to continue to set aside money for bad loans through the coming year .
As a result , Lewis acknowledged that consumers may find little relief in the months ahead when it comes to securing credit .
" That is going to continue for some period of time , " he said .
The results , which was originally slated to be released on Oct. 20 , come just as the company announced a massive $ 8.4 billion foreclosure prevention effort .
As part of a legal settlement with 11 state attorneys general who had sued the troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial , Bank of America said it would cut monthly housing payments , a move that is expected to keep as many as 400,000 borrowers across the country .
In January , Bank of America announced plans to acquire Countrywide and completed its purchase in June .
Standing in line for the metal detector at a Texas airport , I am reminded of an incident about 3 weeks ago , where Transportation Security made a woman remove her nipple rings as a security measure .
Which makes me rethink my decision to fly , being that I am an extremely anxious traveler , and the only way I can calm myself from having panic attacks is through the use of several “ intimate ” piercings and attachments .
Some folks take Xanax , I happen to employ a series of studs and plugs .
The thought of having to strip bear in front of strangers while a cold official inspects my Prince Albert , my Arab Strap , my Burmese Anus Wedge , my Vibrating Testicle Cage , and my belly button ring — all of which I need to stay relaxed , is just frighteningly dehumanizing .
Man Texas , why ca n’t you just be cool like LAX Transportation Security ?
When me and my body trinkets come jingling down the line , the Los Angeles staff knows that I ’m no more a threat to the skies than a walking dinner bell .
Once we ’re airborne , I ’m not going to rush the cockpit ; the only disturbance I ’ll cause is my nut - wear clanging around like a bag of jacks as I rub one out in the crapper .
Which brings me back to the lady and her nipple rings .
Now seriously Texas Transportation Security , was that breast metal really a national threat , or did you just want to see some tits on the clock ?
I know we ’re taught not to “ mess with Texas , ” but where in your manual does it say terrorists sport booby steel ?
I enjoy swinging my gilded dick around as much as the next low - level , minimally powered employee , but these are our air rights we ’re talking about , Transportation Security .
You can wave that detective wand like you ’re St. Peter at the pearly gates , but the second you ban pierced labia because you think there might be a pull - pin grenade jammed up there , I ’m moving to Canada .

Biden's Afghan Whopper
Biden is telling absurd lies about Afghanistan tonight .
In particular , he 's repeatedly claimed that " we 've spent less in Afghanistan in seven years than we spend in a month in Iraq . "
He 's made that claim , or claims to that effect , repeatedly .
It is , to put it bluntly , a complete Goddamned lie .
According to the Congressional Research Service , spending on the war in Afghanistan since 2001 has been $ 172 Billion .
Spending in Iraq is , as the Democrats repeatedly mention , a little under $ 10 Billion a month .
In other words , Biden 's number is off by , oh , something like 2000 % .
Perhaps Obama 's Sub -Committee ought to have held some hearings on Afghanistan after all .
.
As a side note , amazingly , Biden just fell apart on foreign policy there .
Did he really promise that Obama would launch a war in Darfur ?
Never mind his whole mess of an answer on his vote for the Iraq War .
Does anyone think that it 's really even remotely credible that Joe Biden voted to give George Bush the authority to go to war because he thought he would n't use it ?
If Joe Biden did that , he 's among the stupidest men alive .
.
Here 's the exact words that Biden used , from the rush transcript :
" With Afghanistan , facts matter , Gwen . "
- Joe Biden
" Look , we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country .
Let me say that again .
Three weeks in Iraq ; seven years , seven years or six - and - a- half years in Afghanistan .
Now , that 's number one . "
- Joe Biden , seconds later .

You could see that Biden was getting mad .
When he gets mad , he says really stupid things .

It seemed to me that Joe was a little vague on the criteria for going to war in the Sudan .
Did n't he say something along the line of if a government is supporting terrorist incursions into the surrounding area , if those same are attacking our soldiers , then that would be enough to support a military responce ?
I was thinking he could be talking about Iran or Pakistan rather then Darfur .
They certainly met his criteria .

you fucking morons
he did not say on combat he said
" we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan BUILDING that country

nlcatter , he 's still wrong ( lying ) .
Try again .

Get your facts right before you blast Joe .
This is what he said ( http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/)
" Look , we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country . "
BUILDING that country !
Posted by : jaxfldesi | 2008-10-03 7:20:52 AM
Yes , the word BUILDING is key here ...
you REALLY need to get your facts straight buddy .
Posted by : John | 2008-10-03 7:43:42 AM
At least he wasnt stupid enough to say that they were in Iraq without nato allies
Palin : " Well , first , McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan .
Certainly , accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are certainly different .
We have NATO allies helping us for one "
Um what are British troops in Iraq then airhead ?
Posted by : Gnarlyswine | 2008-10-03 8:29:16 AM
Yes , Biden did say building , but his error and the reason the statement was missleading at best and fraudulent at worst was that he is comparing BUILDING in Afghanistan with COMBAT in Iraq .
His comparing apples to oranges allows room for him to make dramatic but wildly inaccurate and missleading comparison .
Posted by : andy | 2008-10-03 8:47:12 AM
I caught that Biden comment .
he was so strident about it , repeating it for effect .
Yes it was misleading at best and fraudulent at worst .
And no , you can't defend him by parsing the words , in Clintonian fashion .
Ooooh , he said " building " .
Sorry , wankers , you can't excuse it .
He 's a l - o - s - e-r .
Posted by : Robert | 2008-10-03 10:50:01 AM
OK then , add in the total cost for BUILDING Afghanistan , as some here are arguing , and the ratio of Afghanistan / Iraq spending gets worse ( from the perspective of Biden 's argument ) , not better .
Posted by : Steve | 2008-10-03 11:30:08 AM
Afghanistan is a NATO operation , Gnarlyswine .
We intentionally structured it that way in order to give it the patina of an international effort .
Working really well , there , eh ?
Iraq is primarily a U.S. operation , with help from certain allies .
Posted by : NukemHill | 2008-10-03 1:07:42 PM
It does n't matter to Democrats at all whether Biden knows what he 's talking about or is truthful at all .
Utterly irrelevant to them , the reality - based community .
It 's just win baby , all the while piously citing their high principles and how Rove and Cheney are Satan .
It 's Alinsky 's strategy come of age : lie , cheat , steal , do whatever you have to do to win power , and claim santimonious superiority over your " evil " opponenets .
nlcattter , you are dishonest .
You think that 's what Biden meant ?
You think that 's what 90 % of people heard when he made that point , ever so forcefully ?
Of course not , but you just do n't care .
And you 're not honest or principled enough to even admit it .
Posted by : Victor Erimita | 2008-10-03 5:40:56 PM
he said BUILDING you fucking morons
he was only off some in dollars 6.3 billion a week iraq versus 7 billion was spent in Afghantistan supposedly on " building . "
but with corrupion is was not really even that
much ,
you wanted the format that did not allow followup questions
so STFU !
Posted by : nlcatter | 2008-10-03 11:13:56 PM
and the audience doesnt give a shit on amounts
and your Palin moron , had no clue anyway .
Posted by : nlcatter | 2008-10-03 11:14:59 PM
Biden uses the 1 - month - equal - 7 - years comparison twice .
In the first one , you can argue that it makes sense because he might have been trying to say we need to spend more on non-combat efforts : " He said we need more troops .
We need government - building .
We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan .
Look , we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country .
Let me say that again .
Three weeks in Iraq ; seven years , seven years or six - and - a- half years in Afghanistan .
Now , that 's number one . "
But when he uses it the second time , it does not make sense and is misleading : " Barack Obama was saying we need more troops there .
Again , we spend in three weeks on combat missions in Iraq , more than we spent in the entire time we have been in Afghanistan .
That will change in a Barack Obama administration . "
The only comparison that makes sense to justify the increased troops would be combat expenses in Iraq to combat expenses in Afghanistan .
So is it a whopper ?
You can argue both sides on this one .

Obviously he has done a great job of being a politician as no one seems to know what the hell he meant .
Posted by : JC | 2008-10-04 12:52:17 PM
I can remember when the Bush administration said that the Iraq war would cost no more than $ 20B .
That number is working it's way to a Trillion .
There 's no doubt that Biden 's overall point is correct : that we do n't have the troops to do the job we need to do in Afghanistan , that we are tied down in Iraq without any definition of what constitutes ' victory ' nor any plan for it .
I highly recommend Thomas Ricks ' book " Fiasco " .
This Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who has covered the Pentagon for decades describes in detail what the uniformed military thought about Iraq , not what Bush said they thought .
Petreus is well covered there too , long before he became a household word .

BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
" Why can't I do this at home ? "
Bringing
Skype to the workplace is just one way companies are harnessing " fun " tech .
Employees in the office used to ponder this question about corporate technology not easily available to consumers .
Today the question , usually asked from home or a cafe , is : " Why ca n't I do this at work ? "
Innovative , user - friendly offerings -- Skype , Facebook , Twitter , mash - ups , YouTube , wikis , and the like -- take root and thrive as consumer offerings .
Corporate IT departments meanwhile often seem oblivious to their potential usefulness , even as workers wonder at their absence .
But increasingly such technologies are being used for business .
Partly this is because enterprise versions have emerged with fancier security features .
And partly it 's because as the consumer - side versions keep growing , new users continue to come from within small companies -- or even large enterprises , often to the horror of security - conscious IT departments .
Twitter , the popular micro-blogging service , has seen the emergence of small copycat services focused on businesses .
Yammer , for instance , claims to have better security than the free Twitter , and it charges a small per -head fee .
Users , rather than answering the Twitter question of " What are you doing ? " for anyone to read , answer " What are you working on ? " for colleagues only to read .
Wikis , online pages that any user can edit , surged in popularity among consumers thanks partly to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia .
Not long after businesses hopped aboard with tools geared for them .
One of those , PBwiki , has seen the number of individual business wikis created with it jump to well over 40,000 , up from less than 20,000 a year ago and only about 5,000 two years ago .
A Los Angeles design firm called The Groop , which uses PBwiki for creative collaboration among teams and clients , claims to have realized $ 1 million in annual productivity gains with it .
On the social networking side , Facebook and MySpace became household names seemingly overnight .
This year businesses are expected to spend more than $ 250 million on social networking tools geared towards them , from vendors like Awareness , Communispace , and Jive Software , according to research firm Forrester .
And increasingly vendors offer companies suites of Web 2.0 technologies that have emerged on the consumer side .
For instance HiveLive lets employees create and control blogs , wikis , mash - ups and so on within business social networks .
Skype , the online phone service bought by eBay , noticed that many of its customers were small businesses .
To entice more of them , it created a business version of its software with improved security and a " control panel " application for central management of Skype credit and numbers .
Last month Google launched a YouTube - like video sharing service for businesses .
The idea is that employees can share videos amongst themselves in a secure setting .
A CEO could broadcast a message , for instance , or a technician could post a how - to video .
The iPhone , inevitably , is also forcing its way into the work force .
" The best phone for business .
Ever " claims the typically bomb - throwing ad copy from Apple .
Research firm Gartner foresees consumer adoption driving more technologies into enterprises over the coming years .
Among them are desktop video - conferencing , virtual worlds , 3 - D controllers , and augmented reality .
Gartner analyst Jackie Fenn suggest IT departments should make it their ongoing strategy to take advantage of such consumer technologies , rather than bump into them on a case - by - case basis .
Besides , there 's a nice upside to this approach for IT workers , as long as security and other challenges can be overcome .
As anyone who 's played around on Facebook , YouTube or an iPhone can attest to , the consumer side is where all the fun stuff is .

The ISO C++ committee met in San Francisco , CA , on September 15 - 20 .
You can find the minutes here , including the votes to approve papers .
The most important thing the committee accomplished was this :
Complete C++0 x draft published for international ballot
The biggest goal entering this meeting was to make C++0 x feature - complete and stay on track to publish a complete public draft of C++0 x for international review and comment — in ISO - speak , an official Committee Draft or CD .
As I predicted in the summer , the committee achieved that at this meeting .
Now the world will know the shape of C++0 x in good detail .
Here ’s where to find it :
The September C++0 x working draft document is essentially the same as the September 2008 CD .
This is “ it ” , feature - complete C++0x , including the major feature of “ concepts ” which had its own extensive set of papers for language and library extensions —
I ’ll stop there , but there are still more concepts papers at the mailing page and some more still to come during the CD phase .
( If you get the impression that concepts is a big feature , well , it is indeed easily the biggest addition we made in C++0 x . )
What ’s next ?
As I ’ve mentioned before , we ’re planning to have two rounds of international comment review .
The first of two opportunities for national bodies to give their comments is now underway ; the second round will probably be this time next year .
The only changes expected to be made between that CD and the final International Standard are bug fixes and clarifications .
It ’s helpful to think of a CD as a feature - complete beta , and we ’re on track to ship one more beta before the full release .
And a new convener
On a personal note , I ’m very happy to see this accomplished at the last meeting during my convenership .
I ’ve now served as secretary and then convener ( chair ) of the ISO C++ committee for over 10 years , and my second three - year term as convener ended one week after the San Francisco meeting .
A decade is enough ; I decided not to volunteer for another term as chair .
As of a few weeks ago , P. J. Plauger is the new convener of ISO / IEC JTC1 / SC22/WG21 ( C++ ) .
Many of you will know P.J. ( or Bill , as he ’s known within the committee ) from his long service to the C and C++ communities , including that he has been a past convener of the ISO C standards committee , past editor of the C/C+ +
Users Journal , the principal author of the Dinkumware implementation of the C++ standard library , and recipient of the 2004 Dr Dobb ’s Journal Excellence in Programming Award , among various other qualifications and honors .
He has been a regular participant at ISO C++ meetings for about as long as they ’ve been held , and his long experience with both the technology and the ISO standards world will serve WG21 well .
I ’m very happy to have been able to chair the committee during the development of C++0 x .
Now as we move from “ develop mode ” into “ ship mode ” it will be great to have his experienced hand guiding the committee through the final ISO process .
Thanks for volunteering , Bill !
Ken Ohmae , former head of McKinsey ’s Tokyo office ( disclosure : I have a passing acquaintence with him and he was enormously well regarded in his day despite being a tireless self - promoter ) says that the Paulson program is grossly inadequate and the magnitude of the US crisis is so large that a $ 5 trillion international facility is necessary .
The quid pro quo of any international program is that the US would be put on a short leash , probably not as severe as the one to which Indonesia and Thailand were subject to in the Asian crisis .
But the US is not good at austerity and has never been in the position of not being in the driver ’s seat , so this sort of initiative would no doubt be rejected until it is too late for it to have much impact .
From Bloomberg ( hat tip reader Saboor ) :
( CNN ) --
A national poll of people who watched the vice presidential debate Thursday night suggests that Democratic Sen.
Joe Biden won , but also says Republican Gov. Sarah Palin exceeded expectations .
Poll respondents give Sen. Joe Biden the edge over Gov. Sarah Palin in ability to express views .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. said 51 percent of those polled thought Biden did the best job , while 36 percent thought Palin did the best job .
But respondents said the folksy Palin was more likable , scoring 54 percent to Biden 's 36 percent .
Seventy percent said Biden was more of a typical politician .
Both candidates exceeded expectations -- 84 percent of the people polled said Palin did a better job than they expected , while 64 percent said Biden also exceeded expectations .
How Palin would perform had been a major issue for the Alaska governor , who had some well - publicized fumbles during interviews with CBS ' Katie Couric leading up to the debate .
Respondents thought Biden was better at expressing his views , giving him 52 percent to Palin's 36 percent.iReport.com :
Tell us who you think did best
On the question of the candidates ' qualifications to assume the presidency , 87 percent of those polled said Biden is qualified and 42 percent said Palin is qualified .
The candidates sparred over which team would be the better agent of change , and Biden came out on top of that debate , with 53 percent of those polled giving the nod to the Delaware senator while 42 percent said Palin was more likely to bring change .
Respondents overwhelmingly said moderator Gwen Ifill was fair during the vice presidential debate , repudiating critics who said that Ifill , of PBS , would be biased because she is writing a book that includes Biden 's running mate , Sen. Barack Obama .
Ninety - five percent of those polled said Ifill was fair .
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .
Obama was selected as a winner over Republican Sen. John McCain in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll on the September 26 presidential debate .

Epidemic of ES&S iVotronic Touch - Screen Voting Machine Failures - Now in At Least Two States - Continues to Grow ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/23/2008 , 1:22 pm PT
From WV's Sunday Gazette Mail today , yet another report of vote - flipping on ES&S iVotronic touch - screen machines ...
Martinsburg man says machine switched Democratic vote to Republican 5 times Roger Belozier , a veteran and retired postal worker from Berkeley County , experienced problems with electronic voting machines when he went to vote early in the Martinsburg courthouse .
" I reviewed my vote to make sure it was a straight Democratic ticket .
But it switched my vote to Republican candidates five different times .
I was able to cancel out the Republican votes .
" But I am scratching my head .
Why did the machine switch my votes five different times ?
I asked someone to come over and explain it to me , " Belozier said on Wednesday .
" I am concerned about a lot of people who might not notice or people who might be intimidated .
They have to raise their hands and ask for some help . "
Every county was told by the SOS to recalibrate all touch - screen machines .
This is the ES&S iVotronic machine again and it appears the voter voted straight - party , in this case , as we have warned against , but that 's not entirely clear from the article .
Today 's report follows reports within the last week of votes flipping from Democratic to Republican ( or other ) candidates on ES&S iVotronics touch - screens in at least two different WV counties , and in Davidson County ( Nashville ) , TN .
Just yesterday , there was a report of votes flipping , on the same machines , from Republican to Democratic in Decatur County , TN .
Enough !
We 've called for these machines to be immediately impounded , and taken out of service --- just as the GOP called for when Sen. Rick Santorum ( R - PA ) received similar reports of touch - screen votes flipping during his unsuccessful 2006 re-election attempt --- and for paper ballots to be made available to all voters instead .
To date , neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have called for the impounding / removal of these failed voting machines .
ES&S is the largest voting equipment supplier in the nation , with systems in dozens of states .
9/11 milestone : 2008 , America 's bloodiest year in Afghanistan Associated Press
Published : Thursday September 11 , 2008
Print This Email This By JASON STRAZIUSO , Associated Press Writer
KABUL , Afghanistan - Insurgents killed two U.S. troops in Afghanistan on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks Thursday , making 2008 the deadliest year for American forces since U.S. troops invaded the country in 2001 for sheltering Osama bin Laden .
The deaths brought the number of troops who have died in Afghanistan this year to 113 , according to an Associated Press tally , surpassing last year 's record toll of 111 .
Afghanistan was the launching pad for al - Qaida 's terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
U.S. forces invaded in October 2001 in response and quickly drove the Taliban out of power .
Across Afghanistan , U.S. troops paused in silence Thursday to commemorate the 9/11 attacks .
At a U.S. base in Kabul , members of the New York National Guard , many of whom served at the site of the World Trade Center after the towers came down , remembered the attack on their home state .

Sometimes it ’s fun to just make people think “ WTF ? ” when they see your computer .
That ’s “ WTF ? ” in a good way .
It ’s not hard on Linux to make people say “ woah , ” , but it ’s even easier , if you know the command line , to make people look at you typing away on your laptop and think you ’re some kind of crazy hacker having a go at the Gibson .
The first step is to ditch GNOME or KDE .
Get a nice , minimalist window manager .
I recommend a window manager over a regular tty for two reasons .
The first is that even with screen in a tty , it ’s inconvenient .
The text is huge unless you sit there rebooting over and over trying to get the right framebuffer settings .
The second is so you can have a nice wallpaper .
I prefer Fluxbox for this .
It ’s just like Openbox or Blackbox , except it ’s got tabbed windows like pwm and a toolbar .
Other possibilities include tiling window managers like Xmonad .
Ion2 is a tiling , tabbed window manager , based on pwm .
I do n’t know about the others , but as a Fluxbox user , I can tell you that there is no really useful menu configured by default .
Your Fluxbox menu configuration is in ~/. fluxbox / menu and uses a syntax like this , and no the indentation does n’t matter :
[ begin ] ( fluxbox ) [ exec ] ( Firefox ) { firefox} [ exec ] ( terminator ) { terminator} [ exec ] ( run ) {fbrun} # opens a Fluxbox runbox to launch apps [ nop ] [ submenu ] ( interwebs ) # creates a submenu named interwebs [ exec ] ( firefox ) { firefox} [ exec ] ( finch ) {terminator -m -e finch} # opens a maximized terminator and executes finch inside it [ exec ] ( irssi ) { terminator - m -e irssi} [ exec ] ( deluge ) { deluge} [ exec ] ( lynx ) { terminator - m -e lynx} [ end ] # ends the submenu submenu ] ( fluxbox ) [ submenu ] ( styles ) # creates a “ styles ” ( for themes ) submenu inside the fluxbox submenu [ stylesdir ] ( /usr/share/fluxbox / styles ) # adds all system themes [ stylesdir ] ( ~/.fluxbox / styles ) # adds all themes installed in user ’s directory [ end ] [ submenu ] ( tools ) [ exec ] ( fluxkeys ) { fluxkeys} [ exec ] ( fluxconf ) { fluxconf} [ exec ] ( fluxmenu ) { fluxmenu} [ end ] # end tools submenu [ end ] # end fluxbox submenu [ end ] # ends the menu overall
There is also a script called ~/. fluxbox / startup that controls how Fluxbox starts and what it auto - executes .
Feel free to customize this however you want .
It ’s well - commented by default .
Pay attention to the line near the top about setting your wallpaper .
I find that themes often fail to set the wallpaper properly , but changing it in startup is easy enough .
Find a nice , dark theme .
FreshMeat is the place to look for themes .
There are a ton .
Look for ones that use bright contrasting colours in the menu and window borders .
If it looks like it just came out of the Matrix , that ’s probably a good thing .
Also , configure whatever terminal emulator you use to have a dark background and grey , white , or green text .
Alternatively , set a transparent background on the terminal so your commands float in front of your wallpaper .
Mrxvt and Eterm both handle transparent backgrounds well without relying on GNOME libraries .
If you do n’t mind using something meant for GNOME , Terminator is a very nice terminal emulator , boasting transparency , split screens , and tabs — much more featureful than the others — and the panes could just add to the look .
Next , replace as many common apps as you can with their command line alternatives .
Here ’s some replacements for common apps :
Instant messenger -> finch .
IRC -> irssi
Calculator -> bc
Web browser -> lynx or links2
Text editig -> vim or nano
Volume mixer -> alsamixer
Connecting to wifi -> iwconfig & dhclient
Mail client -> mutt
Spell checker -> aspell
CD burning -> wodim
Doing these things , I once had a conversation sitting in a internet café that went something like this :
Excuse me , but I have to ask .
What are you doing ?
Raising the volume .
Oh .
Uh… Well , what are you using ?
Linux .
Really ?
I ’ve never heard of a girl using Linux .
OK , so I ’m not a fan of that last comment at all , but it was pretty funny to see someone so intrigued by running alsamixer .
For reference , here ’s how that looked to him :
Not so freaky , right ?
It even looks like a normal mixer , except , you know , in a terminal .
I have to warn you , though , looking like a power - user on a * nix system has its risks .
Some of my friends have been kicked out of libraries for using the terminals that were built - in to the library ’s computer .
One was just trying to empty his Firefox cache at the command line .
Of course , using the command line automatically makes you an evil black hat hacker , right ?
OK , so maybe using the command line is the mark of a hacker , but that does n’t make someone a cracker !
I blame movies .
Finally , a system monitoring tool adds to the look very nicely , I think .
Usually I use Gkrellm with Fluxbox , but there ’s also Conky .
Gkrellm is nice because its window can be docked and the others told not to overlap it when maximizing .
There are tons of plugins for it , and there is a GUI way to configure it .
Conky , on the other hand , draws in a borderless window right on the desktop .
This means your normal windows will cover it , but it also looks really cool to see the system stats being updated directly on the wallpaper .
Conky can be configured by editing a text file ( which likely does not yet exist on your system ) called . conkyrc located in your home directory .
Examples of many . conkyrcs can be found online , but there is a thread on Ubuntu Forums with screenshots and configurations that you might want to check out .
I ’m pretty sure I got mine from there and edited it .
Figuring out how to edit the file is n’t hard , though the syntax is a bit interesting .
I know , this is a rather odd topic , right ?
Yeah , it ’s kind of “ how to make your computer make you look like a hacker , ” which will of course make actual hackers groan , so I hope you can back up the looks with some real knowledge .
It ’s really easy to make yourself look like a stupid little script kiddie this way , so be careful !
I ’m at a hacker con right now , and thus I ’m sticking to GNOME and Compiz .
I did get one guy asking why I ’m bothering with irssi instead of X - Chat to go on the #hope IRC channel though .

Obama Campaign Pressures Television Stations to Stop Airing NRA Ads
Barack Obama ’s attack on the freedom of the press and of free speech is in high gear now .
Just yesterday I wrote about the truth squads that Obama has employed in Missouri to harass and intimidate people that they feel are producing negative ads .
As if that was n’t enough there is more .
Now the Stalinists in Barack Obama ’s campaign are trying to convince television stations in Ohio and Pennsylvania to stop airing ads that they do n’t like .
This particular ad is by the NRA and it accuses Barack Obama of wanting to ban some guns and tax others .
Barack Obama himself filled out a questionnaire in which he stated he was for the ban of all handguns , so he is on record with this position .
His campaign still calls the ad misleading and sent a letter to the television station .
“ The advertisement knowingly misleads your viewing audience about Senator Obama ’s position on the Second Amendment , ” wrote Robert Bauer , general counsel to the Obama campaign in a letter dated Sept. 23 to various TV stations in Pennsylvania and Ohio .
( See letter ) “ For the sake of both FCC licensing requirements and the public interest , your station should refuse to continue to air this advertisement , ”
That sure as hell sounds like a threat to me .
It sounds like he is threatening to shut them down , which is n’t surprising considering we already know that is he becomes president he wants to re-institute the fairness doctrine .
To recap ; Barack Obama is threatening television stations in Ohio and Pennsylvania with possible FCC sanctions , he has mobilized the Missouri police and attorneys to harass people who produce television ads that he does n’t like , and he wants to silence conservative talk radio and blogs by re-instituting the fairness doctrine .
All of this before he becomes president .
How far will he go after he becomes president ?
We are no longer able to criticize anything that Dear Leader says .
He will come after us if we do .
Big Brother is watching .
by Ari Rutenberg
UPDATE : It has been brought to my attention that it is a bit naive to assume , as I do below , that Henry Paulson would step up and be a professional when the times called for it .
Instead he has remained a banker to the last .
However I am not the only one to fall for this .
Paul Krugman also assumed that , as the British are doing , the US government would mandate lending requirements .
Krugman quotes NYT reporter Joe Nocera from the article discussed below : " Unlike the British government , which is mandating lending requirements
in return for capital injections , our government seems afraid to do
anything except plead . "
Even when they are being socialist , they manage to pander to those who caused the problem .

The New York Times reports today that national banks are not planning to use the taxpayer bailout money to increase consumer lending .
Instead the large banks are going to use the emergency funds , which we are going into debt to pay , to acquire the weakest banks left at very discounted prices .
These people have no shame and no morals .
This is outrageous , and though not actually criminal , it feels like the companies have defrauded the American taxpayer .
Hank Paulson has cast his lot with the bankers .
Paulson , Bush , and the rest have intentionally put the American people further into debt in order to use this crisis to consolidate their financial power .
This government is so corrupt it almost feels like it a movie .
Except people are really losing their houses , jobs , and life savings .

From the NYT :
It is starting to appear as if one of Treasury ’s key rationales for the
recapitalization program — namely , that it will cause banks to start
lending again — is a fig leaf , Treasury ’s version of the weapons of
mass destruction .
In fact , Treasury wants banks to acquire each other and is using its
power to inject capital to force a new and wrenching round of bank
consolidation .
As Mark Landler reported in The New York Times earlier
this week , “ the government wants not only to stabilize the industry ,
but also to reshape it . ”
Now they tell us .
Indeed , Mr. Landler’s
story noted that Treasury would even funnel some of the bailout money
to help banks buy other banks .
And , in an almost unnoticed move , it
recently put in place a new tax break , worth billions to the banking
industry , that has only one purpose : to encourage bank mergers .
As a
tax expert , Robert Willens , put it : “ It could n’t be clearer if they had
taken out an ad . ”
Friday delivered the first piece of evidence
that this is , indeed , the plan .
PNC announced that it was purchasing
National City , an acquisition that will be greatly aided by the new tax
break , which will allow it to immediately deduct any losses on National
City ’s books .
As part of the deal , it is also tapping the
bailout fund for $ 7.7 billion , giving the government preferred stock in
return .
At least some of that $ 7.7 billion would have gone to NatCity
if the government had deemed it worth saving .
In other words , the
government is giving PNC money that might otherwise have gone to
NatCity as a reward for taking over NatCity .
I do n’t know about you , but I ’m starting to feel as if we ’ve been sold a bill of goods .

Before the year is over , you always have a list of New Year ’s resolutions .
It could be about an oft - repeated promise to lose weight , quit nicotine addiction , or to budget your paycheck and get out of debt .
But even before the first month of the New Year is out , you give up .
These useful but practical tips will bail you out of the overspending trap .
Budgeting a slim paycheck can be frustrating , especially when unexpected money emergencies crop up .
If you are receiving less than $ 1000 every 14 days , the prognosis is grim .
Cutting back on some regular expenses can be very inconvenient for you , especially if you have kids to consider ; but better the one - time inconvenience than a lifetime of never ending debt .
For emergencies like this , it ’s best to be prepared .
Instead of dividing your money into the usual groceries and food , bills and utilities , and rent , add one more money envelope or money clip – this time , one for savings .
Impossible , you say , because you can barely survive on your paycheck .
You are right – it is downright impossible to save money when you ’re already penny - pinching .
Here ’s how to stretch your budget some more .
Go over your previous expenses and trim down the fat , and say goodbye to impulsive shopping .
Make the budgeting fun .
Consider the amount you save as points , and these points should go into the savings envelope .
You ’ll marvel at the way your savings envelope grows , slowly but surely .

Plan a two - week menu to determine how much fresh produce , canned goods , and staple you need to buy , but do n’t stint on the children ’s milk .
Buy fewer sweets and expensive cuts of meat , and go for more fish and vegetables , or try those nutritious one - dish meals .
At the end of two weeks , there will be less unused items in the refrigerator .
Bring home cooked meals to work , instead of crossing over to the deli for your lunch or coffee breaks .
If your office is not issuing freebies like bottomless brewed coffee , take your instant brews to office .
As much as possible , avoid the adjacent coffee shop because you cannot afford a bagel , which adds up to your unnecessary expenses .
Schedule your family activities at home to minimize the use of the TV , and make sure that lights are off by 10 in the evening .
It may sound a bit Nazi-ish , but sticking to your guns and making sure that everybody follows the new regime pays off wonderfully in many ways .
For your daily commute , take the public transport and convert the unused gas money to savings .
Compute the expenses for gas and everybody ’s daily commute to school and work .
If it ’s cheaper to buy gas , then load up the tank .
You can stretch your gas mileage by avoiding the morning and after office rush .
There is no contest when it comes to the rent .
It has to be paid upfront monthly ( no ifs and buts ) , or else you ’ll land a pitiful heap in the streets .
You have other options , though , like looking for a house that ’s cheaper , or one that ’s nearer your place of work .
If you can find a house that is rent - to - own , so much the better , but stick to your rent budget .
When living on a Spartan budget , forget about shopping for new clothes and shoes , unless it is a matter of life and death .
But let everybody try to save their allowances for something they ’d like to buy .
This may take time , but they will learn the value of money and saving it .
\ " During a recent special session called by Palin herself , she faced criticism from several legislators for not showing up personally to push for her agenda .
Someone at the Capitol even printed up buttons asking , ‘ Where ’s Sarah ? ’ ”
Playing hooky pays off for Palin
Despite all of the discussion of Sarah Palin ’s performance as governor of Alaska , there has been little analysis of the simplest measure of performance : attendance .
As Woody Allen said many years ago , “ 80 percent of success is just showing up . ”
The Washington Post recently reported that , in her first 19 months as governor , Palin billed the state of Alaska per diem charges for 312 days she spent at her home in Wasilla .
Palin ’s staff has explained that it was appropriate to bill the state for expenses related to Palin staying in her own house because her “ official duty station ” was at the state capital of Juneau , where the governor ’s official office and mansion are located .
But that argument raises a different question :
How much time did that leave for her to spend at her “ official duty station ” ?
Advertisement
Nineteen months totals 578 days , but after subtracting weekends and holidays , it is only about 397 workdays .
Assuming Palin did not routinely bill the state for staying in her own home on weekends and holidays , she would have spent no more than 85 workdays in the state capital over the course of her 19 months in office , even if she traveled nowhere else in Alaska or outside of the state .
That compares with 168 days that the Alaska Legislature was in session during the same period .
One of the state ’s leading papers , the Juneau Empire , described her attendance like this :
“ Palin has spent little time in Juneau , rarely coming to the state capital except when the Legislature was in session , and sometimes not even then .
During a recent special session called by Palin herself , she faced criticism from several legislators for not showing up personally to push for her agenda .
Someone at the Capitol even printed up buttons asking , ‘ Where ’s Sarah ? ’ ”
Why does the governor of Alaska need to be in the state capital ?
There are two big reasons — and probably many smaller ones .
The first big reason is that she appoints most of the people who manage the 15 departments of Alaska ’s state government , containing more than 100 divisions and employing more than 50,000 people .
Nearly all the department heads and division directors are headquartered in Juneau .
E-mails and telephone calls alone are not effective for the governor to get advice , give directions and follow up to ensure that appropriate policy is being implemented .
It is obvious that the ability to fully monitor the performance of the bureaucracies any governor has chosen to lead is greatly restricted if the governor does not spend significant time on the ground where the operations of government are housed .
But also of great importance is the governor ’s ability to work with the legislature to update state policies and offer new programs for improving governance .
Any effective governor must work on an ongoing basis with not only the leadership of both houses in the state legislature to build consensus and draft the governor ’s proposals into language that both houses can accept , but also committee chairmen and recalcitrant members whose votes are needed to support key portions of the governor agenda .
It appears that in the upside - down situation that has occurred in Juneau over the past year and a half , almost all of the members of the Alaska Legislature were in the state capital far more often than the governor .
One member told the Juneau Empire , “ At a time when [ Palin ’s ] leadership was truly needed , we did n’t know where she was . ”
One has to wonder whether the chef at the governor ’s mansion that Palin takes credit for firing may not have simply left the job out of sheer boredom .
When I was first out of college , I worked for a period as a bill drafter for the Missouri Legislature .
At that time , it was the practice for the governor to apportion thousands of state patronage jobs to members of the Legislature to pass on to their political supporters .
Although some of these jobs paid little more than minimum wage , they were very much in demand because they were so - called no - show jobs :
You could collect your paycheck without regularly reporting for work .
Some individuals were able to obtain two or three such jobs and still work outside of state government as a real estate broker , bank employee or in some other private sector job .
Hopefully , Missouri ’s and all state governments have fully abandoned such corrupt and wasteful practices .
But every governor faces an ongoing challenge to ensure that each employee provides a full day of work for a full day of pay .
That challenge is certainly greater if the governor is found infrequently at the “ official duty station . ”
It is still greater if state employees realize the governor is being rewarded with state revenue for staying at home .

The discovery of an ancient reef north of Adelaide by Australian scientists may push back the evolution of the earliest animals by 80 million years .
The unpublished research , by geoscientists Associate Professor Malcolm Wallace , Estee Woon and Jonathan Giddings from the University of Melbourne , will be presented at the Selwyn Symposium on Thursday .
The researchers say they have uncovered complex organisms that in some ways resemble multicellular life in a large reef located in the Northern Flinders Ranges , 700 kilometres north of Adelaide in South Australia .
If the fossils - which are around 650 million years old - are of multicellular organisms , they would be the earliest examples of primitive animal life discovered so far , the researchers say .
The fossils are yet to be described scientifically , but look like cauliflowers and were probably sponge - like organisms up to two centimetres in diameter , Associate Professor Wallace says .
' Nothing else like them '
He says the reef - building organisms were " certainly more complex than any fossil of their age anywhere on Earth " .
" They 've never been described from anywhere else in the world , " Associate Professor Wallace said .
" There 's nothing else like them . "
The ancient reef , which is now exposed on the surface , was 10 times higher than the Great Barrier Reef , and consisted partly of stromatolites , layered structures built by microbes , and partly of the sponge - like organisms .
The find is especially significant because it may be the missing piece of the puzzle in the evolution of early animal life .
Before the Ediacaran geological period , 635 million years ago , the only life forms were simple , single - celled organisms .
Then suddenly , 570 million years ago , very complex animals appear in the fossil record .
Scientists have long debated just what caused this evolutionary explosion in life .
" When you see the Ediacara they resemble jellyfish and modern arthropods [ the group that contains insects and spiders ] , " Associate Professor Wallace said .
" There is no doubt they are animals .
The real puzzle is why they appeared 570 to 540 million years ago .
" Maybe this reef system will tell us something about that . "
' Extremely important '
Dr Jim Gehling , a palaeontologist from the South Australian Museum in Adelaide , says if verified the find will be " extremely important " and " very exciting " .
" We know these things [ the Ediacara ] must have had ancestors , [ but ] when they occurred is the great debate , " Dr Gehling said .
He says the find would confirm predictions based on the molecular record that pinpoint evolutionary steps based on the rates of DNA mutation .
Most branching of the molecular tree occurred in the Ediacaran when there was an evolutionary explosion in life .
But according to the molecular record , sponges should have branched off 650 to 680 million years ago , which is about when these reefs occur , Dr Gehling said .
" If he 's found evidence of sponges , and that would need to be verified , that 's exactly what the molecular records predict and that would be very exciting , " he said .
The Selwyn Symposium will have international and Australian scientists debating theories on what led to the " evolutionary explosion " of life at the time of the first animals .
If the sweeping surveillance law signed by President Bush on Thursday -- giving the U.S. government nearly unchecked authority to eavesdrop on the phone calls and e-mails of innocent Americans -- is allowed to stand , we will have eroded one of the most important bulwarks to a free press and an open society .
The new FISA Amendments
Act nearly eviscerates oversight of government surveillance .
It allows the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to review only general procedures for spying rather than individual warrants .
The court will not be told specifics about who will be wiretapped , which means the law provides woefully inadequate safeguards to protect innocent people whose communications are caught up in the government ’s dragnet surveillance program .
The law , passed under the guise of national security , ostensibly targets people outside the country .
There is no question , however , that it will ensnare many communications between Americans and those overseas .
Those communications can be stored indefinitely and disseminated , not just to the U.S. government but to other governments .
This law will cripple the work of those of us who as reporters communicate regularly with people overseas , especially those in the Middle East .
It will intimidate dissidents , human rights activists and courageous officials who seek to expose the lies of our government or governments allied with ours .
It will hang like the sword of Damocles over all who dare to defy the official versions of events .
It leaves open the possibility of retribution and invites the potential for abuse by those whose concern is not with national security but with the consolidation of their own power .

I have joined an ACLU lawsuit challenging the new law along with other journalists , human rights organizations and defense attorneys who also rely on confidentiality to do their work .
I have joined not only because this law takes aim at my work but because I believe it signals a serious erosion of safeguards that make possible our democratic state .
Laws and their just application are the only protection we have as citizens .
Once the law is changed to permit the impermissible , we have no recourse with which to fight back .
I spent nearly 20 years as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times , as well as other news organizations .
I covered the conflict in the Middle East for seven years .
I have friends and colleagues in Jerusalem , Gaza , Cairo , Damascus , Tehran , Baghdad and Beirut .
I could easily be one of those innocent Americans who are spied on under the government ’s new surveillance authority .
The reach of such surveillance has already hampered my work .
I was once told about a showdown between a U.S. warship and the Iranian navy that had the potential to escalate into a military conflict .
I contacted someone who was on the ship at the time of the alleged incident and who reportedly had photos .
His first question was whether my phone and e-mails were being monitored .
What could I say ?
How could I know ?
I offered to travel to see him but , frightened of retribution , he refused .
I do not know if the man ’s story is true .
I only know that the fear of surveillance made it impossible for me to determine its veracity .
Under this law , all those who hold information that could embarrass and expose the lies of those in power will have similar fears .
Confidentiality , and the understanding that as a reporter I will honor this confidentiality , permits a free press to function .
Take it away and a free press withers and dies .

I know the cost of terrorism and the consequences of war .
I have investigated Al Qaeda ’s operation in Europe and have covered numerous conflicts .
The monitoring of suspected terrorists , with proper oversight , is a crucial part of our national security .
But this law is not about keeping us safe , which can -- and should -- be done in a constitutional manner and with judicial oversight .
It is about using terrorism as a pretext to permit wholesale spying and to silence voices that will allow us to maintain an open society .

McCain has branded himself “ The Original Maverick ” .
He bases this assertion of his brand on the numerous times he has gone against his party and , in another branding phrase , “ Put Country First . ”
He and his surrogates have asked constantly – and some more independent - minded writers have also asked – “ When has Obama challenged his party in a way similar to McCain ? ”
The implication , and sometimes the outright attack , is that Obama is unable or unwilling to challenge the Democratic party in the same way McCain is willing to challenge the Republican party .
A good example of this is in Rick Warren ’s questions to McCain and Obama at the Saddleback forum .
Warren asked McCain :
John , you know that a lot of good legislation dies because of partisan politics , and party loyalty keeps people from really getting forward on putting America ’s best first .
Can you give me an example of where you led against your party ’s interests — oh , this is hard — ( LAUGHTER ) — and really , maybe against your own best interests for the good of America ?
For John McCain , the answers to this question are clear – he stood against his party on the issue of torture ( although he later qualified his initial opposition to torturing ) ; he stood against his party on the issue of global warming ; he challenged the Bush administration on how they were handling the Iraq war ; he stood against his party on Bush ’s tax cuts ( although he again completely reversed positions on this issue ) ; he stood against the base of his party on the issue of immigration ; and he stood against his party on the issue of campaign finance reform .
In all of these cases , McCain stood against his party and with the Democrats .
His positions were not “ bi-partisan ” – they were examples of a Republican acknowledging his party had the wrong position .
He went against his party ’s interests because he clearly believed his party had the wrong position for America .
It is also worth noting that the Republican party on all of these issues had blatantly wrong and unserious positions .
Defending torture ?
Denying global warming despite the widespread consensus of scientists ?
Rick Warren ’s question presumes that Republicans and Democrats are both equally wrong about the issues – and that we can get past this impasse by compromising .
But that is not , in fact , the situation .
He did n’t compromise and was n’t bipartisan – he took the side of his political opponents because his party had taken an untenable position .
That takes a measure of courage , but to demand Obama take stands against his party , you first have to identify similar no -brainer issues on which the Democratic party has taken a side .
Obama instead is faulted for partisanship , in part , for having the same position on these issues as McCain .
McCain , for coming to the same conclusions , is a maverick .
What few acknowledge is that on the issues on which McCain has stood against his party , they have clearly been in the wrong .
The wedge issues of the 1990s divided the country between conservatives and liberals who competing ideologies – abortion , gun rights , affirmative action , welfare , homosexuality – these were issues in which both sides had entrenched positions – and on which the country was in broad and deep disagreement .
These are issues on which bipartisanship and moderation and federalism are the only solutions – because to legislate either side would leave half of the population in extremely strong disagreement .
And it is worth noting that on these issues Obama has embraced bipartisanship – which he understands to mean finding goals both sides agree on related to these issues ( from his speech in Denver ) :
We may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
( APPLAUSE )
The — the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland , but do n’t tell me we ca n’t uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK - 47s out of the hands of criminals .
( APPLAUSE )
I know there are differences on same - sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
( APPLAUSE )
You know , passions may fly on immigration , but I do n’t know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers .
McCain has rejected bipartisanship on these issues in his presidential campaign – embracing a hard right position on abortion and an enforcement first approach to immigration .
His examples of embracing “ bipartisanship ” are really just examples of him taking the Democratic position .
It ’s worth noting in the days ahead how differently these two men define bipartisanship .
Obama defines it as working with people you disagree with to find common goals ; McCain defines it as standing with the Democrats when he can they are clearly in the right .

How 's Google 's Wikipedia - killer " Knol " doing ?
Not well , apparently .
Slate 's Farhad Manjoo takes a peek and shreds the product as a wasteland of plagiarism , ignorance , self - promotion , and bias .
And that 's when there 's any content at all .
Knol , you 'll remember , was supposed to crush Wikipedia by paying experts ( via ad - revenue - share ) to write fabulous articles on their areas of expertise .
Here 's how the Knol expert on Sarah Palin , Macao , and Facebook does it :
[ Expert Sam ] Goldfarb 's great Palin entry is a copy of the Wikipedia article on the Alaska governor as it appeared on Aug. 29 , the day John McCain picked Palin as his running mate .
That 's why the Knol piece still describes Palin as having " successfully killed the Bridge to Nowhere " ; the Wikipedia entry on Palin has since been updated thousands of times , and it now tells a more nuanced story about her flip - flop on the bridge .
( Wikipedia 's articles are licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License , which allows people to copy an entry 's text as long as they also reproduce the license ; Goldfarb 's Palin article and many others on Knol that copy from Wikipedia do n't follow those rules . )
Goldfarb 's Macau article is lifted from this Macau travel site , his Facebook piece draws from this ad company , and his hotel guides pull from the hotels '
Web sites .
Essentially , Knol wants to be a well - written online magazine , with bang - up articles on all important topics .
The trouble with this ?
Writing well is hard , especially without editors .
On Wikipedia , the crowd can edit entries directly ( which is good and bad , depending ) .
To edit a Knol article , you have to contact the author and have him / her approve your changes .
In other words , you have to tell the expert that he / she is wrong and get him / her to admit it .
And that 's if you can figure out how to get ahold of the expert .
Manjoo tried to contact a couple of Knol experts for a while and then gave up .
Like all crappy Google products , Knol is in beta , so Google will no doubt argue that it 's early yet and it just has to work out the kinks .
Maybe so .
The other possibility is that Knol is yet another would - be killer Google product that has bombed .

The Democrats may take the White House , but a famous Republican could join all the president ’s men and women .
When I was nine years old , I made friends with a boy who was a year older , bigger , and much stronger than I .
He was also the neighbourhood bully , so it seemed like a good strategic move , to that childhood horse sense that seems reasonable when you ’re nine .
We did have some good times — fishing , playing baseball , the usual kid stuff — but our activities were always on his terms .
And they usually ended up with us ( well , mainly me ) getting in some sort of trouble .
Such it is with Canada and the United States .
We live in the same neighbourhood .
The U.S. is older , more muscled , more aggressive , and , quite often , Canada winds up getting the short end of the stick .
As in the schoolyard , our leaders often do n’t play well together : John Diefenbaker and John Kennedy referred to each other as a “ fool ” and a “ prick ” , respectively ; Lyndon Johnson , incensed over Lester Pearson ’s Vietnam policy , grabbed Pearson by the lapels and growled , “ You pissed on my rug ! ” ; and , most famously , there ’s the Watergate tape of Richard Nixon calling Pierre Trudeau an “ asshole ” , to which Trudeau sniffed , “ I ’ve been called worse things by better people . ”
With the November 4 U.S. presidential election rapidly approaching , the question is raised : how will a change in American leadership affect Canada ?
Or , more pointedly , with America weary of eight years of Republican excess , and John McCain having guzzled the Bush Kool - Aid , how would a Barack Obama presidency affect Canada ?
For now , it does seem that Obama and Stephen Harper are interested in keeping their relationship friendly — or , at the very least , they ’ve opened the lines of communication .
First , there was the story that a senior Obama aide tipped off Consul General Georges Rioux that Obama ’s anti-NAFTA stump talk was just campaign bluster .
Then , in August , Harper dispatched Health Minister Tony Clement to the Democratic National Convention to get a foot in the door .
“ The prime minister believes that we have to be more aggressive in representing Canadian values and interests in the American political scene , ” Clement told reporters .
Although the diplomatic tone and policies are set by the leaders of the two countries , it ’s important to note that a lot of the heavy lifting is done by their staffs as servants ( and enforcers ) of their will .
Looking at a potential Obama administration should give us an idea how things may play out .
Obama ’s first major staff decision , Joe Biden for vice president , indicates big changes on the horizon for U.S. foreign policy .
While the duties of the vice president may be pretty much ceremonial ( former VP John Nance Garner described the office as “ not worth a bucket of warm piss ” ) , picking Biden is important symbolically .
An internationalist and harsh critic of Bush ’s unilateral foreign policy , Biden has always preferred to work within a UN framework rather than from staunch American imperialism .
And as far as Canadian interests go , Biden last year led the way in a Senate initiative to spend US $ 552 million with General Dynamics Canada .
Clearly , Biden is someone not afraid to spend a lot of money in Canada .
As for his cabinet , Obama has scattered numerous clues as to whom he ’s leaning toward for some key positions — most importantly for secretary of state , the chief diplomat and the president ’s principal adviser on foreign affairs .
All of the likely candidates , including John Kerry and Republican senator Dick Lugar , would bring a more Canada - friendly agenda to the table , but the best - case scenario for Canada would probably be Connecticut senator Chris Dodd .
A staunch liberal currently sitting on the Senate foreign - relations committee , Dodd has voted in favour of allowing imported prescription medications from Canada , a good indication that he ’s not a strict protectionist .
He also recently spoke out in the Senate against the rendition of Canadian citizen Maher Arar .
( Deported by the U.S. to Syria , where he was tortured , Arar was finally exonerated and returned to Canada after 374 days in captivity . )
Regardless , it ’s likely that whoever is appointed secretary of state will be kept on a short leash .
“ Presidents run their own foreign policy out of the White House , ” says Michael Fellman , an American history expert and professor at Simon Fraser University .
“ That ’s become increasingly the case in the past 30 years . ”
About the Bush foreign policy , Fellman continues , “ the Bush White House group was very small and they were the same people who were setting military policy .
I think Obama ’s a much brighter person ; he may be willing to work with a wider range of talented people and give them more latitude of action , but the office of the presidency , especially in foreign affairs , is extremely powerful . ”
It ’s also unlikely that any great changes to NAFTA will come about , despite the stern rhetoric during last February ’s Ohio and Texas primaries .
Obama always knew that NAFTA was a can of worms better left unopened ( what with concerns about American access to Canadian oil and water ) , and by summer he had changed his tune .
Although he ’s still making some noises about “ opening up a dialogue ” , that ’s just a sop to the rust - belt voters .
For all intents and purposes , a unilateral reopening of NAFTA is off the table .
Along with trade , law and order is always a huge issue in the U.S.
And with John Edwards now suffering from electile dysfunction , there ’s no clear front - runner for attorney general .
Look for the job to most likely be given to a liberal along the lines of former deputy attorney general Eric Holder or Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick .
Although mainly concerned with internal U.S. law , the attorney general can affect Canadians greatly — take , for example , the Arar case .
The U.S. government has still refused to issue an apology , and , in fact , courts in New York have dismissed a lawsuit brought forward by Arar on the grounds of “ national security ” .
( Fun fact : co-named in the lawsuit was Homeland Security boss Tom Ridge , McCain ’s leading choice for VP until he caved in to the John Birchers and fundies and threw in his lot with Sarah Palin . )
“ Yes we can ” is a common refrain from Barack Obama , but it will take more than a mantra to solve the nation ’s economic woes .

A progressive choice for attorney general would go a long way toward repairing the massive security and civil - liberty injustices perpetrated by the Bush administration over the past eight years .
Fellman says : “ The way they ’ve undercut civil liberties , I think Obama would be better on those issues and better for Canada . ”
Of course , these things can work both ways — with all the Bush malfeasance , it ’s easy to forget that it was Canadian intelligence who dropped the dime on Arar to the FBI in the first place .
A few years ago , it would have seemed laughable that the Republican star of such movies as Kindergarten Cop and Jingle All the Way could ever be secretary of anything , let alone in a Democratic administration .
But , in one of the more bizarre possibilities , Obama may actually be considering Arnold Schwarzenegger for a cabinet position , most likely secretary of energy or head of the Environmental Protection Agency .
When questioned by ABC News regarding his potential cabinet , Obama said : “ What he ’s [ Schwarzenegger ’s ] doing on climate change in California is very important and significant ” ¦he ’s taken leadership on a very difficult issue and we have n’t seen that kind of leadership in Washington . ”
In turn , Schwarzenegger ( who has endorsed John McCain ) suggested that he was open to the idea and would “ take his [ Obama ’s ] call now , and I ’d take his call when he ’s president ” .
Although Schwarzenegger is a moderate Republican , his connection to the film industry has resulted in him stridently opposing U.S. film production in Canada .
If selected , he could attempt to push energy practices into a much more protectionist stance .
With anti-Iraq - War Republican senator Chuck
Hegel the leading contender , secretary of defence is a position that can affect Canada immensely .
Take , for example , the current doctrine of “ military integration ” : just last February , Canadian and U.S. military forces signed an agreement that allows either nation to send troops across the others ' border in the vaguely worded case of “ civil emergency ” .
( A natural disaster ?
Zombies ?
Scarier , even : something akin to the martial law declared during the FLQ crisis . )
Although it ’s yet to be seen what agreements like this will mean for Canadian sovereignty , they obviously come with some degree of risk .
And the fact that the treaty was not publicly announced by the Canadian government makes it seem even more ominous .
Although Canada has officially managed to stay out of the Iraq quagmire , it still plays an important role .
By sending troops to Afghanistan , Canada has effectively freed up American troops to be redeployed to Iraq .
“ They can rent our troops for Afghanistan , ” Fellman says .
“ Frankly , that ’s my greatest concern about our bilateral relations . ”
Should Obama be elected , get ready for the emphasis to return to Afghanistan .
For his part , Sen .
Hegel sees Afghanistan as “ the real terrorist threat ” , and although he ’s no hawk , Obama is n’t exactly a dove , either .
His plan to have U.S. troops out of Iraq by mid 2010 is tempered by his desire for more U.S. troops in Afghanistan , and Obama has indicated that he intends to ask other NATO countries to help .
He ’s made it clear that Afghanistan “ has to be our central focus , the central front on our battle against terrorism ” .
Since coming to power in 2006 , Harper has been steadily beefing up the Canadian military .
His new $ 30 - billion , 20 - year “ Canada First ” military plan is a perfect example — and there ’s no better place to get practice , and give your growing officer corps experience , than in battle .
“ It ’s a very important part of the Harper mentality , increasing the military , ” Fellman says , “ and the best way to grow an army is to use it . ”
The Harper government has committed to staying in Afghanistan until at least 2011 , which will undoubtedly put Canadian troops at the sharp end of the American spear .
Definitely a tough place to be , considering how invading armies in Afghanistan have fared in the past .
( Just ask the British and the Soviets . )
Depending on what happens with Pakistan ’s leadership , coalition troops could even conceivably pursue al - Qaeda members into Pakistan , greatly enlarging the scope of the war .
“ There may be increased Canadian involvement in foreign wars , ” Fellman says , “ which had not been the case up to Afghanistan .
That was actually a very important shift . ”
There ’s also the matter of financial cost .
On October 9 , parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page reported that the Afghan mission has cost Canada a lot more than the Harper government has let on .
Page estimates that by the time Canadian troops leave in 2011 , the total cost of the war to Canada could be as high as $ 18.1 billion .
However , as important as policy and personnel decisions are , there ’s still one factor in this election that overshadows all others : the U.S. economy .
As far as Canada is concerned , therein lies the rub : we may share the world ’s largest trade relationship , but with the U.S. having a population of more than 300 million and a gross domestic product of more than US $ 13 trillion , it ’s pretty much one - sided .
Canada will always , in a very real way , be influenced by the economy south of the border .
As Fellman says : “ Our prosperity is tied to the American economy , and that ’s inescapable .
It would be great to think that the Democrats would be fiscally more responsible if they got elected , and that would be good for us . ”
If Obama is able to resuscitate the U.S economy , then Canada will certainly benefit , in a “ rising tide lifts all boats ” scenario .
Unfortunately , the odds are stacked heavily against whoever is elected president this November .
Over the past eight years , America under the Bush administration has amassed a massive amount of debt ( national , corporate , and foreign ) as well as an increased medical and social - security liability .
In October , the U.S. government had to pony up US $ 700 billion to bail out the country ’s banking system , the result of a deregulated industry with all the ethics and foresight of a Ponzi scheme .
Then , within a week , the Treasury Department reported that the U.S. budget deficit is at a mind - boggling US $ 455 billion , and the national debt topped US $ 10 trillion for the first time ( a figure so staggering that an extra digit had to be added to the national debt clock in New York ’s Times Square ) .
Hardly a mess that a freshman president will be able to fix anytime soon — even assuming he has a sympathetic Congress .
Hopefully , as he tells us , Obama will bring “ the change we need ” and usher in a new day for the economy , social issues , and international relations .
Before that day comes , however , we should probably follow Bette Davis ’s famous advice in All About Eve : “ Fasten your seat belts ; it ’s going to be a bumpy night . ”
Kids Sing for Change Obama Video
A " grassroots " music video produced by a group calling themselves " Sing for Change , " which shows 22 children singing praises tois leaving many people scratching their heads .
“ We ’re gonna spread happiness !
We ’re gonna spread freeeeeeedom !
Obama … ” sings a young girl .
The video , which was not produced by the Obama campaign , " chronicles a recent Sunday afternoon , " according to the YouTube description , " when 22 children , ages 5 - 12 , gathered to sing original songs in the belief that their singing would lift up our communities for the coming election .
Light , hope , courage and love shine through these nonvoting children who believe that their very best contribution to the Obama campaign is to sing . "
I found the video quite disturbing , and I find I am not alone in my assessment .
From AOL :
... it is eerie .
What on earth are children doing praying to a political candidate ?
I 'm not sure what bothers me most :
Is it their glassy - eyed stares ?
Is it their Children of the Corn - fed good looks ?
Their hypnotized vibrato - less tones ?
Be Afraid , Be Very Afraid
It is possible to criticize one side without endorsing the other , right ?
Just to keep things in perspective , take a glance at this vision of our future in Obamaland .
All those who find Christian camps terrifying , brace yourselves .
It creeped me out in 2000 when people stood on a streetcorner handing out lyrics and singing songs about how Hillary Clinton was “ a human statue of liberty … ” who would solve all the world ’s problems .
It creeps me out even more to see children exploited - to serenade and “ lighten the community ” - about Dear Leader Obama , and the glorious “ we ” who are going to spread “ happiness . ”
Or , more accurately , the glorious “ they ” who will spread happiness - partly , it seems , through control of media .
Because “ spreading happiness , ” apparently , is the role of government .
Not to protect the shores , build the infrastructure and get out of the way , but to make us “ happy . ”
This has more than a little whiff of Havana and Moscow about it , sorry .
From The Washington Post From The Anchoress
From Hot Air :
Their music ?
No , the music came from the people who wanted to indoctrinate these children , and many others , in the faith of the New Messiah .
From Wizbang :
These kids are already being taught to worship Obama as if he were some kind of god .
That 's what kids in North Korea , Cuba , Saddam Hussein 's old Iraq , and other totalitarian regimes were taught to do as well .
The purpose is if they grow up seeing their leaders as god - like they 're less likely to rise up against them .
From Pajamas Media :
Watching this video has disturbed me more than almost anything I have seen in recent years .
It is the kind of exploitation of children that reminds me of Young Pioneer Camps I saw when visiting the Soviet Union in the Eighties .

WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THE WORLD

A little - known open - source project became the subject of intense interest recently , following a session at Apple 's developer conference in San Francisco , California .
That project ?
SproutCore .
Apple offered to show WWDC attendees a way to deliver a " first - class user experience and exceptional performance " in web applications using HTML 5 and SproutCore , a platform - independent , Cocoa - inspired JavaScript framework .
Put this together with Apple 's aversion to Adobe Systems ' Flash or Sun Microsystems ' Java on the iPhone , and it seems plausible SproutCore will be Apple 's official route to Rich Internet Applications ( RIAs ) on its increasingly popular phone .
There 's even more room to conclude this , given SproutCore appears to be used in Apple 's MobileMe service .
It 's time to take a look at SproutCore .
It turns out that SproutCore is not just a JavaScript framework .
It is also a set of development tools , written in Ruby , that generate HTML and JavaScript from templates .
The project also includes a test framework and a build tool that generates optimized code ready for upload to a web server .
A SproutCore application is deployed as static files ; Ruby is not used at runtime .
SproutCore in Apple 's MobileMe - is it for you , too ?
OK .
Let 's not get carried away with the facts SproutCore is open source , it uses JavaScript , and Ruby , and that it works on the iPhone .
SproutCore is a work in progress .
Internet Explorer is not properly supported , and although IE7 at will be supported soon , SproutCore framework co-founder Charles Jolley has said IE6 may never be catered for .
That is understandable , bearing in mind the quirks of IE6 , yet Microsoft 's obsolete browser still has a 27 per cent market share , according to the latest figures from HitsLink .
Windows is not ideal for developing with SproutCore either , because of differences in the build environment , path structure , and the use of symbolic links .
I used Ubuntu Linux , running as it happens on Windows Vista in VirtualBox .
The prerequisites are Ruby , Rubygems , and a standard set of build tools , all of which let you install SproutCore with a single command : gem install sproutcore .
Alternatively , it runs nicely on a Mac .
That aside , creating a " Hello World " application in SproutCore is a trivial task .
A single command generates a skeleton application , with resources neatly arranged into several folders .
SproutCore uses a Model View Controller ( MVC ) architecture .
Each web page has its own folder , with sub - folders for models , views , controllers , tests , and language resources .
A SproutCore page may be an entire application , since it leans towards the desktop model , in which many actions are possible within a single window .
In the language folder is body . rhtml , where you can start adding content .
Here is a label :
<%= label_view : my_label , : tag => ' p ' , : bind => { : value => ' Example.detailController.sMessage'} %>
This code is actually embedded Ruby syntax , which SproutCore parses using the Erubis library .
This Halloween , parents everywhere have cause to be scared .
Not of the rising obesity rate among kids or the costly tooth decay that comes with mainlining M&Ms .
Even more chilling ?
That moment when your 8 - year - old daughter puts her tiny hands on her tiny hips and asks , “ Why ca n’t I be a French maid this year ? ”
Well , where to start ?
Nevermind that she has never made her bed .
Or that at Halloweenexpress.com , the $ 18.29 “ French Maid Child Costume ” is out of stock .
( Whew . )
And do n’t even think about trying to explain the pivotal role of the French maid in a Fellini film and then persuading her to be a pirate or a princess instead .
“ When my daughter told me she wanted to be Snow White this year , I was worried that she would want to be a sexy version , ” says magazine editor Glynis Costin .
“ She ’s at that age when it becomes an issue . ”
Thankfully , her 13 - year - old preferred the old - school version of the Disney character .
But Costin had to wade through dozens of provocative princess get - ups -- packaged with thigh - high stockings and midriff - baring tops -- before she found a suitable costume .
In the last couple of years , the Halloween costume industry has figured out a way to sexualize almost every conceivable option .
Witch costumes now feature fishnet stockings and velvet miniskirts .
( Needless to say , warts and stringy hair are out . )
Pirate costumes are short , off - the - shoulder dresses and long gloves .
Ahoy , tarty !
Devil looks range from scanty red satin short - shorts to velvet gowns with side slits and feather - trim necklines .
Even a honeybee suit for teens , with thigh - high , striped stockings and an ultra miniskirt , seems better suited to turning tricks than trick - or - treating .
This hypersexualizing of teens and tweens is hardly new .
Marketers have long understood that sex sells , even to kids who have yet to be kissed .
“ KGOY " -- or kids growing older younger -- is a buzzword among executives who target the preteen set .
And what ’s more , most 8 - to 10 - year - olds have no desire to look “ sexy . ”
They associate bare midriffs and thigh - highs with being fashionable , rather than playing a modern - day Lolita .
“ They advertise these costumes with 3 - inch heels , and the kids look like prostitutes , ” says screenwriter Jill Mazursky Cody , who recalls an 8 - year - old French maid causing a kerfuffle at a party about two years ago .
She ’s thrilled her 10 - year - old daughter plans to be a garden gnome this year .
“ Some parents do n’t care . ”
Others may not be prepared to explain to a tween that purple pleather platform boots are for exotic dancers and that a “ sugar daddy ” is n’t just a caramel lollipop .
“ If she wants to be a sexy pirate , you should ask your daughter what identity she wants to create , ” suggests Lyn Mikel Brown , coauthor of “ Packaging Girlhood : Rescuing Our Daughters From Marketers ’ Schemes . ”
“ You two can work together to create a costume that reflects who she wants to be . ”
Still , it ’s tricky .
Boys do n’t get branded as aspiring serial killers for smothering themselves in blood , which , incidentally , many schools have banned on Halloween in recent years .
This year , the Los Angeles Unified School District has sent Halloween guidelines to principals that take on the trend in revealing costumes .
“ Costumes may not cause significant disruption or distraction to the school program , ” it reads .
Oh , and French maid costumes are banned .
Unfortunately , the Halloween retailers did n’t get the memo .

New Lighting Technology Offers Alternative To CFLs and LEDs
August 1st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Residential Lighting reports that a new energy - efficient lighting technology , dubbed ESL ( electron - stimulated luminescence ) was patented in June by a startup company called Vu1 .
The technology works by using accelerated electrons to stimulate a phosphor coating on the inside of the glass bulb .
In contrast , incandescent bulbs run a current through a filament inside the bulbs , and LEDs stimulate semiconductors to create light .
The first ESL prototype is expected to output 40 lumens per watt with a 6,000 hour lifetime .
So why is the ESL bulb any better than CFLs or LEDs ?
Vu1 claims that their bulbs do not have the trace amounts of mercury that CFLs contain , and they do not require the manufacturing energy of LEDs .
At $ 12 , the ESL bulbs cost about the same as dimmable CFLs .
We can expect to see these on the market fairly soon — Vu1 says the first screw - in models could be available as early as September 2008 .
With all the news about the growing popularity of LED bulbs , this development could be just the thing to keep the public eye on energy - efficient alternative lighting .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Freddie Mac's FRE.N bill sales drew fewer bids than similar issues a week ago , but these bids as well , as demand for a note deal on Tuesday , showed the company maintains debt market access , analysts said .
“ Freddie Mac saw demand ebb week - to - week in its bill auctions , but there were no panic signals in the results , ” according to IDEAglobal .
Concerns that a lack of fresh equity capital could lead Freddie Mac and its larger mortgage funding rival Fannie Mae to suspend dividend payments spurred Fitch Ratings on Tuesday to cut its ratings on the companies ’ preferred shares .
Moody ’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor ’s late last month took similar actions .
On the debt side , where senior securities maintain top - notch credit ratings , Freddie Mac sold $ 1 billion each of 3 - month and 6 - month bills early Tuesday .
Interest rates were mixed from similar auctions a week ago , but demand was weaker based on bid - to - cover ratios that measure the amount of bids compared with the amount offered .
Still , demand did not fall off sharply from recent sales .
The bid - to - cover on the shorter maturity declined to 3.73 from 3.95 last week .
Demand for the six - month bills was lower based on a bid - to - cover ratio of 2.67 compared with 3.42 .
The ratio for the three - month issue was “ still above average and decent even for smaller three - month auctions , ” and for the six - month issue was little changed from a 2.80 average over the past three months , Nancy Vanden Houten , analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates , wrote in an auction review called “ Move Along , Not Much to See Here . ”
Among more extended maturities , Freddie Mac also sold $ 1 billion of five - year notes on Tuesday in a reopening of an existing issue that is now $ 4 billion in size .
The offering was auctioned via the Internet at a 3.975 percent rate , or about 95.6 basis points more than Treasuries , and drew 3.545 bids for every note offered .
Freddie Mac tests demand for its shorter - dated debt again on Wednesday when it sells $ 3 billion of new two - year notes through underwriters led by JPMorgan , Lehman and UBS .
Rails 2.2 is almost ready for its final release , but before we christen the gems , we ’d like to have everyone test out a release candidate .
Rails 2.2 is a major upgrade that includes a wealth of new features and fixes .
Chief inclusions are an internationalization framework , thread safety ( including a connection pool for Active Record ) , easier access to HTTP caching with etags and last modified , compatibility with Ruby 1.9 and JRuby , and a wealth of new documentation .
Mike Gunderloy has compiled an exhaustive list and walk - through of many of the interesting new features for the Rails 2.2 release notes .
To help test the Rails 2.2 release candidate , please install with :
gem install rails -s http://gems.rubyonrails.org -v 2.2.0
Hopefully there will not be too much folly in the RC and we can quickly move to a final release .
But it requires your help to get there .
Note that this release is called 2.2.0 , not 2.1.99 as our previous naming scheme would have dictated .
So the final release of Rails 2.2 will actually be 2.2.1 ( if we only need one RC ) .
Rachel Maddow , a woman who does not own a television set , has done something that is virtually unheard of : she has doubled the audience for a cable news channel ’s 9 p.m. hour in a matter of days .
More important for her bosses at MSNBC is that “ The Rachel Maddow Show , ” her left - leaning news and commentary program , has averaged a higher rating among 25 - to 54 - year - olds than “ Larry King Live ” on CNN for 13 of the 25 nights she has been host .
While the average total audience of her program remains slightly smaller than that of Mr. King ’s , Ms. Maddow , 35 , has made MSNBC competitive in that time slot for the first time in a decade .
The channel at that hour has an average viewership of 1.7 million since she started on Sept. 8 , compared with 800,000 before .
Given that advertising dollars  and the reputations of networks  rise and fall on prime - time ratings , Ms. Maddow ’s rise has been closely watched by media executives .
“ I ’m pinching myself , ” said Phil Griffin , the president of MSNBC , who used to caution that it “ takes two or three years for a show to find its audience . ”
That was certainly true for Keith Olbermann , whose five - year - old “ Countdown ” program at 8 p.m. ( which leads into Ms. Maddow ’s program ) now beats CNN in the 25 - to - 54 - year - old demographic segment every evening .

Cool Earth Solar : Solar Power from " Balloons "
September 13th , 2008 by Tom Schueneman
This is a guest post by Tom Schueneman , publisher of GlobalWarmingisReal.com
Cool Earth Solar says it ’s technology will “ reshape solar energy ” – literally .
One of the more thorny issues with any form renewable energy is collecting it .
There is plenty of wind to meet our energy needs , the trick is “ harvesting ” it .
The same goes of solar .
As Cool Earth Solar ’s CEO Rob Lamkin says , “ If you ’re going to replace hydrocarbons with solar , you ’re going to need a lot of collecting surface . ”
Cool Earth Solar , based in Livermore , California addresses the need for “ a lot of collecting surface ” , claiming the ability to cheaply harvest solar energy not in terms of kilowatts or megawatts , but gigawatts of power .
Focusing Sunlight
Instead of using flat collector panels or “ boxes - with - lenses ” requiring heavy , expensive materials to work , Cool Earth Solar uses what is essentially an eight - foot - tall balloon – called a concentrator – made of a thin plastic film similar to the kind of stuff used for potato chip bags and such .
The concentrator has a transparent upper hemisphere and reflective lower hemisphere that , when inflated , forms a shape that naturally focuses sunlight on a photovoltaic cell held at the focal point .
The design is simple in its concept , requires no new technology , and produces 300 to 400 times the electricity that same cell could produce without the concentrator .
The concentrator ’s light infrastructure and use of fewer expensive PV cells , along with its scalability , makes it already competitive with electricity generated from natural gas , as Lamkin said in the latest issue of Discover magazine : “ … the bottom line is that today we can generate electricity as cheaply as , or more cheaply than , we do natural gas – and we expect to pass coal soon . “
Ruffians with BB guns
Some of the challenges Lamkin sees with the with the concentrator is the longevity of the thin film , estimating that it would need replacement every couple of years .
But since a single unit only uses a few dollars worth of plastic , says Lamkin , “ … it ’s not something that is going to hurt us . ”
Then there ’s the problem of young ruffians with BB guns .
But that sort of problem is n’t exclusive to this technology .
Solar Balloon Farm
Solar concentrators weigh about 20 pounds each when inflated and are supported by wire cable strung between wooden poles or lightweight aluminum towers .
Each unit is capable of generating up to 1 kilowatt of electricity and withstanding 125 mile - per - hour winds .
Cool Earth Solar is currently working on a quarter - million - watt demonstration plant in Livermore as well as a utility scale 1.5 - million watt plant in Tracy , California .
Within a year ’s time , Lamkin hopes to start building standardized 10 to 30 megawatt plants .
A 30 megawatt plant will require 30,000 balloons .
If things go as planned , Lamkin hopes Cool Earth will add hundreds of megawatts of generating capacity every year , selling the power directly to utility companies .

Over 50 in Florida ?
Some pretty striking numbers from a new Quinnipiac swing state poll , which shows Obama pulling away in Florida ( 51 - 43 ) , Ohio ( 50 - 42 ) and Pennsylvania ( 54-39 ) .
Quinnipiac already had Obama leading in these states before last Friday ’s presidential debate , and gave Obama wider leads in Florida and Ohio than other polling outfits .
What ’s driving Obama ’s rise ?
Quinnipiac cites a number of factors , including a drop in McCain ’s favorability ratings and a positive reaction to Obama ’s handling of the economic crisis .
In Florida , Obama gets a net +33 percent rating for his role in responding to the economic crisis , compared to +14 for McCain .
In Ohio those numbers are + 27 for Obama and +10 for McCain .
And in Pennsylvania , voters approve of Obama ’s response to the tune of +36 , compared to just + 4 for McCain .

The copper plate is the positive (+ ) contact for the chess pieces .
I had a difficult time thinking of the best way to get the checkerboard pattern on a single conductive surface .
The plate could easily be divided into 64 uniform squares , but that would look terrible .
I briefly considered using two separate conductive metals ( copper & steel , or similar ) , and making a checkerboard pattern by alternating squares of them , but that would take too much time and effort .
I finally decided that sandblasting , the same technique used to make the original glass chessboard ( I think , although it may have been chemical etching ) , would be the best way to get the pattern down on a conductive metal surface .
Sandblasting a checkerboard pattern into the copper sheet will result in 32 squares with the original shiny copper gleam , and 32 frosty squares that were exposed to the abrasive .
The hardest and most time consuming part about this step was not sandblasting , but setting up a stop .
A stop is what prevents the abrasive material from etching / frostifying unintended areas of the plate .
There are many ways of setting up a stop .
The technique I describe involves using a large format printer with a vinyl sticker medium .
While this method is probably inaccessible / unfeasible for most of the people reading this , the entire process should not be too hard to replicate with common household tools and materials ( printer , exacto knife , tape , and ( at most ) a trip to Kinkos ) .
( Like always , the pictures say a thousand words , and are much more descriptive then I could ever hope to be with written instructions ) -
Polish the nicer of the two faces of the copper sheet with some steel wool , so that it is shiny .
Shiny things are fun . - Using Illustrator
I made a checkerboard pattern file with the same dimensions as the original glass chessboard .
The printer I used was able to cut the lines on the adhesive sticker medium , so , once printed , all I needed to do was peel off every other square from the pattern .
If you do not have access to a printer with automatic cutting then you can use a regular printer to print out the pattern onto an adhesive medium , and trace the lines with an exacto knife .
The vinyl sticker paper I used was a perfect material for this job because it can be peeled off without leaving behind any residue , but it is strong enough to stay attached to the copper while being sandblasted .
Make sure to test your material before using it , otherwise you will either end up with adhesive residue left behind on the copper plate , or a fuzzy edged out of focus looking checkerboard pattern ( The out of focus appearance will happen if the edges of the square stickers begin to peel up while being sandblasted ) .-
I used a large sheet of transfer paper to get the vinyl sticker pattern squared perfectly with the copper plate .
Transfer paper is just like very large masking tape .
If transfer paper is unavailable , overlapped masking tape can be used instead .
Overlap the tape so that it so it forms a large square which is a bit bigger than the checkerboard sticker .
Place the nonadhesive side of the checkerboard sticker against the adhesive side of the transfer paper , so that both sheets are sticky side up ( The pictures should make this process very clear ) .
Remove the backing on the checkerboard sticker , and peel away every other square .
Lay the checkerboard sticker / transfer paper combo on a hard flat surface , sticky side up ( duh ) .
Carefully lay the copper sheet directly over the checkerboard sticker , so that the sheet aligns with it perfectly , and press down firmly .
When you are confident that sticker has completely adhered to the copper sheet , flip it over and peel away the transfer paper at a sharp angle .
Make sure all the checkerboard pattern stickers remain completely stuck to the copper sheet .
Sandblasting -
By far the most fun part of this step .
If all the preparation was done correctly , the process of sandblasting is hard to screw up , and provides very impressive visible results .
Take the copper sheet and sandblasting apparatus outside to a smooth flat area that you do not mind getting covered in garnet .
One of the good things about sandblasting ( copper at least ) is that it is hard to overdo it .
Unless the stickers start to fall off , it is almost impossible to " overfrost " the copper .
You will reach a certain level of " frostiness " and will not be able to go beyond it .
It is possible to " underfrost " though , and once you take the stickers off it is hard to go back , so just be sure that every exposed part of the board is evenly blasted .
From this point on you should probably handle the copper plate by the sides , as fingerprints have a tendency of turning into nasty black smudges .
Quantum cryptography is back in the news , and the basic idea is still unbelievably cool , in theory , and nearly useless in real life .
The idea behind quantum crypto is that two people communicating using a quantum channel can be absolutely sure no one is eavesdropping .
Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle requires anyone measuring a quantum system to disturb it , and that disturbance alerts legitimate users as to the eavesdropper 's presence .
No disturbance , no eavesdropper — period .
This month we 've seen reports on a new working quantum - key distribution network in Vienna , and a new quantum - key distribution technique out of Britain .
Great stuff , but headlines like the BBC's " ' Unbreakable ' encryption unveiled " are a bit much .
The basic science behind quantum crypto was developed , and prototypes built , in the early 1980s by Charles Bennett and Giles Brassard , and there have been steady advances in engineering since then .
I describe basically how it all works in Applied Cryptography , 2nd Edition ( pages 554-557 ) .
At least one company already sells quantum - key distribution products .
Note that this is totally separate from quantum computing , which also has implications for cryptography .
Several groups are working on designing and building a quantum computer , which is fundamentally different from a classical computer .
If one were built — and we 're talking science fiction here — then it could factor numbers and solve discrete - logarithm problems very quickly .
In other words , it could break all of our commonly used public - key algorithms .
For symmetric cryptography it's not that dire : A quantum computer would effectively halve the key length , so that a 256 - bit key would be only as secure as a 128 - bit key today .
Pretty serious stuff , but years away from being practical .
I think the best quantum computer today can factor the number 15 .
While I like the science of quantum cryptography — my undergraduate degree was in physics — I do n't see any commercial value in it .
I do n't believe it solves any security problem that needs solving .
I do n't believe that it 's worth paying for , and I can't imagine anyone but a few technophiles buying and deploying it .
Systems that use it do n't magically become unbreakable , because the quantum part does n't address the weak points of the system .
Security is a chain ; it 's as strong as the weakest link .
Mathematical cryptography , as bad as it sometimes is , is the strongest link in most security chains .
Our symmetric and public - key algorithms are pretty good , even though they 're not based on much rigorous mathematical theory .
The real problems are elsewhere : computer security , network security , user interface and so on .
Cryptography is the one area of security that we can get right .
We already have good encryption algorithms , good authentication algorithms and good key - agreement protocols .
Maybe quantum cryptography can make that link stronger , but why would anyone bother ?
There are far more serious security problems to worry about , and it makes much more sense to spend effort securing those .
As I 've often said , it 's like defending yourself against an approaching attacker by putting a huge stake in the ground .
It 's useless to argue about whether the stake should be 50 feet tall or 100 feet tall , because either way , the attacker is going to go around it .
Even quantum cryptography does n't " solve " all of cryptography :
The keys are exchanged with photons , but a conventional mathematical algorithm takes over for the actual encryption .
I 'm always in favor of security research , and I have enjoyed following the developments in quantum cryptography .
But as a product , it has no future .
It 's not that quantum cryptography might be insecure ; it 's that cryptography is already sufficiently secure .

I do n't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 , while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us .
That was Sen. McCain 's judgment and it was the wrong judgment .
When Sen. McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq , he suggested it was going to be quick and easy , we'd be greeted as liberators .
That was the wrong judgment , and it 's been costly to us .
Atkinson Reaches New Low , Freezes R18 + Discussion Paper
No , I wo n’t be running a picture of his goofy grin and awful suspenders on this one …
We all knew South Australia ’s Michael Atkinson would n’t be swayed by mere facts and idle research papers .
But even I was shocked by his latest stunt .
According to Jason Hill over at the Age / SMH Screenplay blog , Atkinson has now withdrawn his support for a discussion paper and public consultation on the subject of an R18 + rating for video games .
We ’ve all been wondering when this public consultation was going to begin , with the next SCAG meeting just weeks away .
But Atkinson ’s withdrawal of support effectively places an indefinite ban on the subject even being discussed .
As Hill ’s piece points out , this is effectively censorship of the debate over censorship .
But was he ever likely to be convinced to shift his position anyway ?
Perhaps this is just the extreme move the industry needs ?
Pressure can and must now shift to broader government pressure on Atkinson ’s abuse of the system .
That one man can stand against the will of 91 % of the country on a petty crusade shows that the letter of these laws do not reflect their intent .
The unanimous requirement for change was meant to protect a forced change by a majority of governments with a shared political standpoint .
This now shows how the entire system can be held to ransom by a fringe factor .

Letterman 's initial assault
NEW YORK ( AP ) -- " Late Show " host David Letterman kept up a verbal assault on John McCain Thursday , saying he felt like an " ugly date " because the GOP presidential candidate backed out of a scheduled appearance on his talk show .
The night before , Letterman had said McCain 's decision to suspend his campaign to deal with the economic crisis " did n't smell right . "
Letterman substituted MSNBC's " Countdown " host -- and critic of the Arizona senator -- Keith Olbermann when McCain called him to say he would n't appear Wednesday .
The comic was unhappy when McCain sat for an interview with Katie Couric instead of him Wednesday -- and even more perturbed to learn that McCain did n't leave New York until Thursday .
He said he felt like a " patriot " to let McCain off his commitment to deal with the economy and " now I 'm feeling like an ugly date . "
" That 's what I feel like , I feel like an ugly date , " he said .
" I feel used .
I feel cheap .
I feel sullied . "
McCain spokeswoman Nicole Wallace said Thursday that the campaign " felt this was n't a night for comedy . "
" We deeply regret offending Mr. Letterman , but our candidate 's priority at this moment is to focus on this crisis , " Wallace said on NBC's " Today " show .
The late - night comic banged away at McCain on Thursday from the opening of his monologue .
" You 're here on a good night , " he told the audience .
" So far none of our guests have canceled . "
He talked about daredevil David Blaine 's feat of hanging upside down in New York 's Central Park for 60 hours .
" They just left the guy hanging there , " he said .
" It 's the same thing McCain did to me last night . "
He described socialite Paris Hilton -- Thursday 's guest whose celebrity was once used in a McCain campaign ad to mock Obama -- as McCain 's first choice for a running mate .
" Here 's how it works : you do n't come to see me ?
You do n't come to see me ?
Well , we might not see you on Inauguration Day , " Letterman said .
Noting that McCain wanted to postpone Friday 's first debate with Barack Obama , Letterman said running mate Sarah Palin wanted to put off her debate with Democrat Joe Biden until after Election Day .
Letterman said McCain taking Palin to meet world leaders at the United Nations was like " take - your - daughter - to - work day . "
Letterman 's Top 10 list was " surprising facts about Sarah Palin , " read by citizens of Wasilla , Alaska , where she was once mayor .
No . 10 : Palin " sometimes calls John McCain grandpa . "
Later in the show , Letterman could n't resist another mention of " that John McCain " while chatting with Hilton , who replied , " I heard he dissed you .
He dissed me . "
Milking the moment , Letterman consoled her : " You had a little run -in with him , too , did n't you ? "

A front page story in the New York Times today begins :
Senior White House officials played a central role in deliberations in the spring of 2002 about whether the Central Intelligence Agency could legally use harsh interrogation techniques while questioning an operative of Al Qaeda , Abu Zubaydah , according to newly released documents .
In meetings during that period , the officials debated specific interrogation methods that the C.I.A. had proposed to use on Qaeda operatives held at secret C.I.A. prisons overseas , the documents show .
The meetings were led by Condoleezza Rice , then the national security adviser , and attended by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , Attorney General John Ashcroft and other top administration officials
" Harsh interrogation techniques " ?
I know our current president and his administration wants to distance from the " t - word , " but why are we , the people and the press , afraid to just call torture torture ?
Link to related items in the Times about the CIA 's destruction of tapes that document the use of torture in the Zubaydah case , Salon has this related piece , also good background reading .
Even this former CIA agent who believes torture is helpful calls it " torture . "
What kind of cowards are we ?

Seven aides to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have reversed course and agreed to testify in an investigation into whether the Republican vice presidential nominee abused her power by firing a commissioner who refused to dismiss her former brother - in - law .
There is no indication , however , that Palin or her husband will testify in the legislative inquiry , which has dogged her for several months and could hurt John McCain in the final weeks of the presidential race .
Palin is the focus of the investigation into her firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan a year after she , her husband and key advisors began questioning him about getting rid of a state trooper who had divorced her sister .
Monegan says he was dismissed because he would n’t fire the trooper .
Palin contends that Monegan was dismissed for insubordination on budget issues .

Lawmakers subpoenaed the seven state employees , but they challenged the summons .
After a judge rejected the challenge last week , they decided to testify , Alaska Atty .

Democratic state Sen. Hollis French , who is managing the probe , said he again asked Palin and her husband , Todd , whether they would testify .
“ We ’ve had no response , ” French said .
Palin says the legislative inquiry has become too political ; she believes the state ’s personnel board should investigate the firing .
Todd Palin has agreed to speak with investigators for that panel but not for the legislative inquiry .

In that instant he was directly aware of the passage of History gently flowing through him in a mighty current , and of his own life welling like a wave in the flow of this vast tide . ”
So did Arnold J. Toynbee describe his almost spiritual union with History .
And so it was with me and the rich tapestry of two centuries of Supreme Court decisions .
The mere mention of the Supreme Court by Katie Couric triggered a flood of thoughts and associations within me , like the madeleine in À la recherche du temps perdu ( incidentally , do not waste your time with the various English translations ; nothing can compare to Proust ’s original prose ) .
In an instant my mind was saturated by the vicissitudes of our highest court ’s past : key precedents , long - dead Justices , blistering dissents , the watershed 5 - 4 decisions , the rise of judicial review , the debate over “ original intent . ”
I paused for a moment of reflection , mesmerized by this astonishing legacy of jurisprudence .
I kept my thoughts to myself , as instructed .
But even so …

It would be akin to citing a single publication I read .
GUWAHATI , India ( Reuters ) -
At least 15 Indian train robbers looking to steal diesel from a freight carriage died Saturday after inhaling poison gas stored in another tank they accidentally broke open , police said .
A police patrol party said they found 30 other people lying unconscious on both sides of a forested train track in India ’s Assam state .
“ We found many empty drums which they must have brought with them to fill with oil , ” a local police officer said by phone .
The train was earlier stopped by dozens of armed people who police believe were members of a gang which frequently steals crude oil from trains and pipelines carrying oil to refineries in the oil - rich state .

The following is the spin of military spokespeople in response to questions about the deployment of the First Brigade on US soil for the first time in over 200 years .
The Army Times initially reported that the First Brigade would handle domestic crowd control and subduing ‘ unruly individuals ’ and that they had ‘ lethal and nonlethal technologies ’ to do so .
Then it issued a correction declaring that the ‘ nonlethal ’ package was not for domestic crowd control .
Then after a hue and cry was raised by many citizens , Northern Command ( NorthCom ) offered a wholesale revision of their mission – and the mainstream media is eating it up .
Here is an excerpt from the articled linked to in the previous sentence :
Despite conspiracy theories that this could be a first step toward martial law in the U.S. , there wo n’t be tanks on Main Street or active - duty troops putting down demonstrations .
That is barred by federal law banning the military from being used on U.S. soil for domestic law enforcement .
Instead , the soldiers of the 1st Brigade , 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart , Ga. , have been training to back up civilian authorities in providing medical care and dealing with chemical , biological , high explosive or nuclear attack .
Not only does this entirely contradict the first Army Times reports , it also egregiously misrepresents to readers the status of US law in regards to this deployment .
Yes , there are laws against military policing on US streets — they are part of both the 1807 Insurrection Act and 1879 ’s Posse Comitatus Act — but the Defense Authorization Act of 2007 gutted them .
Congress restored some limitations on the President ’s ability to deploy troops to engage in military policing in 2008 — but President Bush issued a signing statement declaring he did not feel bound by those limitations .
He also can direct these troops — and the National Guard , and Blackwater — to engage in military policing of civilian populations simply by verbally and unilaterally declaring a national emergency of whatever kind he wishes .
Unfortunately , the US Army spokespeople are parsing their words and misleading us .
And , whatever the stated mission is today , the fact remains that military up the chain of command report to the Commander in Chief — not to Congress or to you and me , and not to the Governors as most of the National Guard do .
( Article continues below )
Why do I insist on raising an alarm about this deployment in spite of a great deal of opposition and criticism ?
( Though I am grateful , too , for a great deal of support . )
I insist on raising an alarm because I am aware of world events and not just blinded by American recent history .
In Zimbabwe , a nominal democracy , President Mugabe sent troops to harass , arrest and even kill voters during a closely contested election .
Mugabe ’s challenger called off his own supporters , telling them they should not risk being killed just in order to vote .
In Sierra Leone , a nation I visited shortly after elections , during a fragile democratic voting process troops and militias were both deployed by the contesting political parties to intimidate , beat and arrest voters .
In Azerbaijan , troops were sent to intimidate the opposition during the elections — and now there is no meaningful opposition .
Do n’t trust me — ask Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International .
Troops are sent by leaders in power , even in weakening democracies , to intimidate voters , arrest and harass opposition leaders in tightly fought elections , all over the damn world .
And nothing , nothing , nothing prevents the First Brigade from being positioned around poll locations , intimidating or silencing or threatening or worse those who challenge their voting outcome or their having been purged from the rolls .
This at a time when Prof.
Mark Crispin Miller of NYU and Robert Kennedy and many others are documenting MILLIONS of voters being systematically purged from rolls — overwhelmingly by Republican actions — and early voting is already showing machines flipping selections from Democrat to Republican , and voters becoming upset .
I am having a surreal experience with the mainstream media , as well , as I try to raise questions .
A source at The Philadelphia Inquirer says that nothing has appeared on the wires about the First Brigade — so they ca n’t cover it .
A source at The New York Times says they are ‘ looking into it ’ — but no coverage yet .
“ The Today Show ” asked if I was a ‘ fear - monger ’ and ‘ paranoid ’ for raising alarms and reproduced NorthCom ’s soundbite intact about the First Brigade being here to help with communities affected by weapons of mass destruction — but did no independent reporting of their own .
I know from hearing from citizens across party lines that I am not the only American concerned about what information the Army may have about such threats to lead to this deployment now — the first time since the Indian Wars that troops have been sent onto US soil .
If you would like to see how average Americans are responding to the news about the deployment of the First Brigade , check out some of the posts from readers on a military - oriented Web site that posted the recent Colorado Springs Gazette article on the subject :
‘ Since 9/11 the Department of Homeland Security has spent billions to prepare civilian law enforcement , local fire departments and civilian agencies to deal with such [ crises ] .
This smells of despicable mission creep for the Armed Forces .
In the late 1980 ’s , I participated in several exercises focused on “ counter insurgency ” operations that specifically dealt with demonstrators and civil unrest .
Backing up law enforcement officials is a end run around Posse Comitatus and this should be exposed for what it is , unconstitutional . ’
‘ Just why is a combat brigade being tasked for these scenarios and not Chemical , Biological and Nuclear Warfare commands ?
Medical Commands ?
Construction Battalions ?
‘ This seems much too similar to the use of troops to put down the Bonus March of WW I veterans in which Army Troops fired on and killed veterans in DC protesting the government ’s failure to pay their promised [ bonuses ] . ’
‘ This job can AND SHOULD be handled by National Guard troops ( domestic issues ) . ’
‘ This smells …no , it stinks .
Posse Comitatus is in place for very valid reasons .
This looks like pre-positioning equipment in preparation for a fight .
‘ The Defense Authorization Act of 2006 empowers the president to impose martial law in the event of a terrorist “ incident , ” if he or other federal officials perceive a shortfall of “ public order , ” or even in response to antiwar protests that get unruly as a result of government provocations .
‘ The terms “ incident ” and “ public order ” are left wide open to interpretation under the Military Commissions Act … ’
“ Just why is a combat brigade being tasked for these scenarios and not Chemical , Biological and Nuclear Warfare commands ?
Medical Commands ?
Construction Battalions ? ”
‘ Back in the late seventies I was apart of a force that had a similar responsibility , except we were trained to handle “ civil disturbance ” , thank god we were never needed .
This is not the first time something like this has happened , the only difference , we were Arty .
Every Batt . had to train so many troops , from Inf. to Medical .
I enjoyed it , we all did because for the time we were apart of it , we were exempt from all duty .
To have the troops on stand - by is not a problem , to deploy the troops to take over civil responsibilities is …’
‘ This is quite disturbing .
4000 troops may not be enough to impose martial law on an entire country , but they could do it to a moderately sized city . ’
‘ There is already a group to do this its called the National Guard Civil Support team .
They are all over the country and are more trained than these rotating people will ever be . ’
‘ As a former member of the 10th Civil Service Detachment / Weapons of Mass Destruction , I do feel a bit insulted .
The unit is a full time National Guard unit that was in place for two years before the 9/11 attacks .
We were trained to do exactly what this article says this combat brigade is being trained to do .
Is this another example of the services not talking to each other , or are these commanders really that ignorant of the world around them ? ’
‘ Reorganize FEMA and keep the Combat Military out of the picture .
Our Combat troops are for Combat .
SeaBees are Construction Battalions that have the expertise for disaster related occurrences .
They understand support missions and are the best in the world when it comes to Can - Do .
If the Combat Military has to become involved , it means Martial Law is a scribble away with the pen .
‘ If we actually need this Brigade , take it away from the Combat Army and assign it to the SeaBees . ’
‘ Did anyone catch the articles in the Army Times in September about this .
The first article on 8 Sept. mentioned the Oct 1 deployment was to be prepared for any civil unrest during the election .
The Next article I read on line around 26 Sept Changed 3 times in one day .
From explaining about the extensive training they have received in IRAQ , the new non lethal weapons for use against ( American Citizens ) for civil unrest to a final article of they just here to help for emergencies . ’
“ Despite conspiracy theories that this could be a first step toward martial law in the U.S. , there wo n’t be tanks on Main Street or active - duty troops putting down demonstrations .
That is barred by federal law banning the military from being used on U.S. soil for domestic law enforcement . ”
‘ Did you read the Army Times article ?
Have you read the Military Commissions Act 2006 ?
Have you read the Military Budget Act of 2007 ?
Have you read the Patriot act ?…
‘ What they are saying is that the local , state and federal police departments can’t handle a crisis ? ’
‘ If you ’re reading these posts , you ’ve already read the words “ mission creep , ” “ end - run around Posse Comitatus ” and “ unconstitutional ” ‘ .
‘ I joined the Navy to make sure NO GOVERNMENT WOULD NEVER DEPLOY TROOPS ON OUR SOIL .
Why did you join ?
I believe every Governor should recall all National Guard troops to defend your states … .
This detachment must stand down .
This is an illegal order . ’
So do n’t take the warning from me .
Take it from many these patriots in military circles .
They 're angered by journalist ...
Metallica cancelled an interview with a Swedish publication after one of their journalist 's admitted to illegally downloading the band 's new album .
Metallica At Leeds Festival 2008
In a review of ' Death Magnetic ' , which is currently number one in the UK , Jonn Jeppsson confessed to downloading a different version of the record – and said he preferred it to the official one .
It 's understood that the songs had been edited by a Metallica fan , who then uploaded them onto the internet .
In a statement Per Sundin , president of Universal Music Sweden , called Jepssonn 's review for Sydsvenskan “ totally unacceptable ” .
" The reviewer is referring to a BitTorrent where someone has altered the original songs .
The reviewer explains exactly where one should go in order to download the file that totally infringes on a copyright , ” he told Blabbermouth .
"
It 's not only an illegal file , but an altered file .
The reviewer also writes that this is how the album should have sounded .
" File - sharing of music is illegal .
Period .
There 's nothing to discuss .
That fact - that Sydsvenskan has a writer that has downloaded this music illegally and then makes mention of an illegal site in his review . ”
As previously reported on Gigwise , Metallica will perform their new album at the O2 Arena in London tonight .
The Transportation Security Administration , starting last December , decided to try out the approach at about a dozen airports , including Logan .
At each airport , it used six officers who had once been routine screeners , had received an extra four days of classroom training in observation and questioning techniques , and had three days of field practice .
T.S.A. officers do not have law enforcement powers , so if they observe someone suspicious , they can chat with the person but cannot conduct a more formal interrogation .
That leaves them with the option of requiring the passenger to go through a more intense checkpoint search , as they did with the man at Dulles on Wednesday .
Or if the suspicion is serious enough , they call the local police assigned to the airport to take over the inquiry .
In nine months — a period in which about seven million people have flown out of Dulles — several hundred people have been referred for intense screening , and about 50 have been turned over to the police for follow - up questioning , said John F. Lenihan , the transportation agency ’s security director at Dulles .
Of those , half a dozen have faced charges or other law enforcement follow - up , he said , because the behavior detection officials succeeded in picking out people who had a reason to be nervous , generally because of immigration matters , outstanding warrants or forged documents .
“ It is an extra layer of security that is on top of what we have , ” Mr. Hawley said of the program .
But Rafi Ron , the former director of security at Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv , who was a consultant who helped train the officers at Logan Airport , said that the agency ’s system , while a welcome improvement to airport security , was still flawed .
Most importantly , he said , too few of the passengers pulled aside were more formally questioned as in the Israeli system , and when questioning was done , it was handled by local police officers who might not have had the necessary behavioral analysis skills .
He cited the case of Richard Reid , known as the shoe bomber , who aroused suspicion when he arrived at Charles de Gaulle International Airport outside Paris , but was ultimately allowed to board after the police had questioned him .
“ If you do n’t do the interviews properly , you are missing what is probably the most important and powerful part of the procedure , ” he said .
