The next time Michael Vick calls you " chicken " -- take it as a compliment ... because dude believes they 're " uncanny " thinkers and even more spectacular athletes .
Seriously .
PETA just released the handwritten answers Vick gave to a " Developing Empathy " test he took just after he pled guilty to dogfighting charges in 2007 -- and he scored a whopping 73.5 out of 100 ... that 's about a " C . "
Among the highlights , Vick explains " The Golden Rule " as doing " on to others as u want them to do on to u .... ( as long the feeling is mutual ) . "
But that 's only the beginning -- check out some unedited highlights :

As the years pass by , people try to make predictions about how search engine optimization is going to change .
There are always changes in the algorithms that are going to affect the way that people are able to rank on the search engines .
Algorithms typically target things such as content , the number of links that you have pointing to your website , and a host of other factors .
However , there are certain predictions that are made that often come true .
Here is what you need to know about predictions for the SEO industry and its growth in the coming years .
Why Do The Search Engine Algorithms Constantly Change ?
If you would like to know the secret to why the search engine algorithms are constantly changing , there are a couple of solid theories .
First of all , Google , in particular , does not like to have anyone understand why or how it is ranking content .
If that was ever released , savvy marketers could create hundreds or thousands of websites , allowing them to reach the pinnacle of the search engines and generate millions of dollars in revenue .
The other reason that they may want to keep this a secret is that it allows a diverse number of people , from different backgrounds to all compete together in order to reach the top .
Regardless of why they do this , it is important to know what they are looking for with each passing year .
In 2017 , there seems to be a heavy emphasis on complexity .
Let ’s look at this idea in depth to show you what you need to do in order to achieve top rankings .
An Emphasis On Extensive Content
When you are creating engaging content for your website , it ’s always good to include as much content as possible .
In the past , articles that were 300 words were considered permissible , which later grew to 500 words as a standard .
Today , many articles are over a thousand words each , and the thinking behind this strategy is that it is more likely that content that is longer is going to be well written .
This will give the reader more information , plus if there are outbound links to authority sites , this is going to also help with ranking any website that you make .
The prediction is that this may actually be much longer than 1000 words for articles , and this may also relate to interlinking the pages that you have on your website .
More Extensive Interlinking
It has been very common for people to link different articles together by simply connecting those that have similar keywords or tags .
Today , many people are thinking about using multiple links , interconnecting multiple pages for an assortment of keywords .
Essentially , this is an extension of outbound links to authority sites , yet it is all within the context of the website you are creating .
Only an authority website could do this properly , and therefore they will be forcing people to create larger websites that have more quality content if they ever have a hope of ranking .
Multiple Videos And Images
Following this trend of creating larger websites , it is likely that they will also require you to add more images and videos .
If you think about any website that you have gone to , one that you were able to gather a lot of information from , it is likely there were many different images and videos that you could access .
Every page that you create needs to be as comprehensive as possible .
They should not simply be based on one keyword and one topic .
Again , thinking from the perspective of the search engine algorithms , the more comprehensive that your website is , the more likely it is that it will be indexed .
Create Longer Videos
One final marketing strategy that you should use is to actually create longer videos .
However , there is a drawback to this marketing strategy .
“ People have a very short attention span , especially if they have never seen your videos before , and therefore shorter videos would seem to make more sense ” says Director of Broadcast SEO ( found here ) .
From an indexing point of view , it seems that longer videos , those that are two minutes or longer , seem to be able to reach higher places in the search engine rankings .
By adding this to your repertoire of strategies , it is likely that you will be able to use all of them together to get the highest rankings possible .
Search engine optimization strategies are always going to change .
However , the only thing that is consistent is their desire to provide more quality content for people using the search engines .
This started with eliminating thin websites with the Panda update and then eliminating the possibility of generating thousands of links using the Penguin update , and now we are looking at the necessity of complex and diverse authority sites becoming the norm .
As long as you are able to do this , it is possible that you will have the ability to build and rank as many sites as you want by simply creating extensive websites that have quality content and interlinking .
Inspired by this Atlanta photo project by Jay from The Plug* , we left two disposable cameras on park benches -- one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn .
We were curious to see what would happen !
Would they be stolen ?
Would people take rude photos ?
Here 's what we found ...
*** During the day , my intern Matt left a note saying : " Good afternoon !
I attached this camera to the bench so you could take pictures .
Seriously .
So have fun .
I 'll be back later this evening to pick it up . "
That night , when we returned to the scene , both cameras were there , and the rolls of film had been shot .
We got them developed , and here 's what we found ...
Are n't these New Yorkers cute ?
Does n't this make you trust in the kindness ( and puppy - loving nature ) of strangers ?
Of course , there was this one ...
P.S. Also , we hit the streets to ask strangers questions about nicknames and winter .

10 cities where you dont want to raise a family
Choosing to have children is one of the most challenging decisions many couples face .
To be sure that you are ready to have children , couples need to weigh several important questions like :
Do we have enough money to provide for our children needs ?
Can one of us take time off from work to care for a child ?
And finally are we emotionally prepared for parenthood ?
If you live in one of the 10 cities listed below , that we listed as worst to rasie a family , then ur decision to have chidlren is even harder .
Few additional questions to confront :
How can we raise our children in such a challenging environment ?
Should we consider moving ?
The rankings are based on graduation rates ( according to the EPE Research Center ) , number of playgrounds ( according to the Center for City Park Excellence ) , overall crime rates ( according to Sperling ’s Best Places ) , and cost of living ( according to the ACCRA Cost of Living Index ) .
1. Detroit , Michigan .
The city of Detroit has by far the lowest graduation rate , with only a dismal 21.7 percent of students finishing high school .
With such poor educational performance coupled with its high crime rate , it ’s no wonder Detroit topped our list .
Even its relatively high number of playgrounds ( nearly four per 10,000 residents ) did n’t make it child - friendly .
2. Miami , Florida .
Miami ’s bar scene may be a tropical playground for adults , but it does n’t have many playgrounds for children ( only 1.4 per 10,000 residents ) .
In addition , it has one of the worst crime rates and a shoddy graduation rate of 45 percent .
3. Baltimore , Maryland .
To fans of HBO ’s The Wire , it ’s probably not a surprise to see Baltimore on this list .
With merely 38.5 percent of its students completing high school , Baltimore ’s graduation rate is second only to Detroit’s .
Its high crime rates make it an even less desirable place to raise children .
4. Memphis , Tennessee .
Like all the cities on this list , Memphis graduates less than half its students ( 48.5 percent ) .
Despite having the lowest cost of living , it ranks as one of the worst cities for kids by having the highest crime rate .
5. Dallas , Texas .
Dallas is the first of three Texas cities to make the list , proving that the Lone Star State is n’t a shining example of a place to raise your family .
Few playgrounds , a 46 percent graduation rate , and high crime allow Dallas to round out the top five .
6. New York City .
It may come as a surprise to some , but New York City is actually the safest place on our list .
However , its exorbitant cost of living and meager graduation rate ( less than 40 percent ) still make it a bad place to raise children .
7. Fort Worth , Texas .
Not surprisingly , Fort Worth has a lot of the same problems that Dallas has : low graduation rates and high crime .
One area where it does do better is in the number of playgrounds .
8. Houston , Texas .
Not everything is bigger in Texas .
Sure , the dropout rate in Houston is bigger and the crime rate is bigger , but the number of park playgrounds is certainly smaller .
9. Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
Milwaukee graduates only 43 percent of its students and can’t boast that it has many playgrounds for its children .
10 . Los Angeles , California .
With the second highest cost of living , only one playground per 10,000 residents , and a meager graduation rate , it ’s no surprise that the City of Angels completes the top 10 worst cities for children .
Most politicians would rather do anything than make a difficult choice , and it seems President Obama has n't abandoned this Senatorial habit .
To wit , yesterday 's executive order on interrogation :
It imposes broad limits on how aggressively U.S. intelligence officers can question terrorists , but it also keeps open the prospect of legal loopholes that would allow them to press harder in tough cases .
While that kind of double standard may resolve a domestic political problem , it 's no way to fight a war .
The human - rights lobby and many Democrats are still experiencing hypochondria about the Bush Administration 's supposed torture program , and their cheering about this " clean break " means they may be appeased .
But the larger risk is that Mr. Obama 's restrictions end up disabling an essential tool in the U.S. antiterror arsenal .
Effective immediately , the interrogation of anyone " in the custody or under the effective control of an officer , employee , or other agent of the United States Government " will be conducted within the limits of the Army Field Manual .
That includes special - ops and the Central Intelligence Agency , which will now be required to give prisoners gentler treatment than common criminals .
The Field Manual 's confines do n't even allow the average good cop / bad cop routines common in most police precincts .
The Army Field Manual is already the operating guide for military interrogations .
The crux of the " torture " debate has been that the Bush Administration permitted more coercive techniques in rare cases -- fewer than 100 detainees , according to CIA Director Michael Hayden .
Yesterday Mr. Obama revoked the 2007 Presidential carve - out that protected this CIA flexibility .
The techniques that had been permissible until yesterday remain classified but were widely believed to include such things as stress positions , exposure to cold and sleep deprivation .
Senior officials have said they stopped waterboarding in 2003 -- which in any case was only used against three senior al Qaeda operatives and succeeded in breaking these men to divulge information that foiled terror plots .
This is normally a column about technology and technology business but I can’t help noticing that the global economy is in the toilet and not much rational thought is going into fixing the problem .
I do n’t mean to insult the bozos currently pretending to run our economy or the new group of bozos about to take their places when the Obama Administration starts up this month , but my Mom could do a heck of a lot better job than either group and she ’s 84 years old .
COME ON !
At least do a better job than Mom !
So let ’s solve the problem right here and now , get it fixed and out of the way so we can get back to pondering DRM and Windows 7 and whatever else is more interesting than saving the world economy .
I ’ll just present my plan .
If you like it then start calling it your plan and send it to everyone you know .
I do n’t need any credit for this , especially if I turn out to be a bozo , too .
But I do n’t think that ’s likely .
So here ’s the problem .
Coming out of a credit bubble we have no credit .
People and businesses that HAVE money wo n’t lend any of it to people and business who DON ’T HAVE money so the economy suffers , enters a period of deflation , everything goes to hell and we lose our houses .
After that we ’re set up for an eventual period of inflation that none of us will be prepared to handle , etc. , etc .
Against this the government ’s idea is to spend a lot of money to stimulate the economy , putting even more financial stress on our kids and their kids through $ 1 trillion deficits into the sunset .
And all of this is justified because of two ideas : 1 ) we do n’t know anything else to do , and ; 2 ) this way the same people who made the bubble are benefitting from its aftermath .
Hank Paulson is not Lucifer in this story , but he IS Belial .
Bone - up on your Milton and figure that one out .
The solutions being offered are n’t good .
It ’s not that I am saying all these companies that have been judged as too big to fail should have been allowed to fail any more than I am saying those companies judged just right to fail ought to have been saved .
I think there ’s a little too much God-playing going on around here and what we really need is a simple solution that pays for itself along the way .
I want a revenue - neutral route out of the current recession .
And I want that route to involve a lot less government intervention and potential manipulation .
Government has n’t shown itself to be very good at fixing things so far and the plans being presented going forward do n’t look much better so let ’s just do it my way , okay ?
What we need is a lateral solution because the current bag of tricks is empty and was n’t that good to begin with .
All this spending of money IN THE HOPE that it will inspire certain actions by banks and consumers just does n’t make any sense to me .
I ’m all for rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure , but I do n’t think we can do so fast enough to make much of a difference .
We need to pack $ 2 - 3 TRILLION in spending into the next 12 months , ideally with as little of that amount as possible being paid for with government money .
Think about it .
The point of economic stimulus is to stimulate the damned economy , NOT to spend government dollars .
It ’s much more efficient to get other people to spend that money and to spend it on most anything , it really does n’t matter .
Just spend it .
Now how to make that happen …
A federal study of the 2001 tax year concluded that Americans were underpaying their federal taxes by $ 290 billion per year and had been for many years .
Given that the Bush administration entered in 2001 and cleverly cut the budget for IRS enforcement I can guess with some certainty that tax cheating has become worse , not better .
So let ’s pin it at $ 300 billion per year or $ 3 trillion for the last decade .
My proposal to end the recession will cost $ 20 billion , not $ 775 billion .
I would allocate $ 20 billion in extra funding for federal tax compliance in the coming year .
I ’d also open - up such compliance enforcement to private firms .
That ’s the stick .
The carrot comes in the form of a quite specific form of one - time tax amnesty .
Taxpayers who have shorted Uncle Sam will be asked to come forward and report their crimes , which will result in no additional tax payments or penalties – none .
If you are a tax cheat and do n’t come forward , that $ 20 billion will go toward hunting you down .
If you are a tax cheat and do come forward but lie about the extent of your cheating , that $ 20 billion will be used against you , too , so there is a huge incentive to be honest and a large penalty for not being so .
This is not a free lunch : you have to report IT ALL .
That should be about $ 3 trillion for the last decade , remember .
Taxpayers who choose to participate in the amnesty program will be still subject to random audits but in general their accounts will be wiped clean IF they within the next six months take 50 percent of the tax money they admit to having owed but not paid and use it to buy goods and services in the United States .
These purchases would have to be documented .
No investments or savings would qualify – just buying stuff .
Sure you can then turn around and sell the same stuff , I do n’t care .
e Bay will LOVE this idea .
It would be a $ 1.5 trillion stimulus plan that does n’t fix any roads but sure buys a lot of Jonas Brothers tickets or anything else that people really want .
It would be distributed geographically much like the U.S. population .
It would generate secondary taxes ( taxes on income earned by the people selling all that stuff — many of them the original scofflaws if you think about it ) that could still be used to fix roads and bridges .
And it would put no additional liens on our kids .
That ’s my idea , what ’s yours ?
If you thought the Annoy - a - tron was the ultimate in fiendish office prank technology , you 'll love the evil new Phantom Keystroker V2 .
Rather than just merely annoying your coworkers with random hidden beeps throughout the day , you can now drive them absolutely insane with a small device that looks like a harmless USB thumb drive .
Simply plug the Phantom Keystroker V2 into any USB port on someone 's computer ( preferably in the back ) and just walk way .
Once installed it emulates a keyboard and mouse to make random mouse movements , toggle the caps - lock on and off and type out odd garbage text and phrases .
There are setting switches that allow you choose it to do one thing or everything and an adjustment dial to set the duration between events .
The hardest part with this prank is trying not to laugh when the anger , frustration and screaming begins .
The caps lock toggling on and off alone would be so irritating .
Let us know in the Comments if you know of any more fun office pranks or devious gadgets .
Over £ 1 million have been spent already on defense in a case brought against a UK council by families of kids born with webbed hands , or without fingers altogether , even though toxicology experts say that the rate of abnormality in Corby runs 10 times as high as the national average .
[ social_buttons ]
The families seek a multi-million pound award for the birth defects , claimed to be caused by a mismanagement of toxic waste dumps from the steel industry in Corby .
Mothers say that they were exposed during the 80s and 90s , and the lead solicitor says he has medical evidence that proves the defects are linked to the dumps .
“ We have now got medical reports that rule out alternative explanations for what caused the limb deformities in these children . ”
– Des Collins
Corby Borough Council denies any responsibility and has already spent £ 1 million on lawyers and a public relations firm to defend against the allegations .
“ We have a great deal of sympathy with every child involved in this litigation , as well as with their families .
However , for the past five years we have thoroughly investigated every aspect of the claims they are making and we know that there is no link between the reclamation work that was carried out in Corby , over a period of 20 years , and these children ’s birth defects . ” – Chris Mallender , Corby council ’s chief executive
Some are comparing this case to the thalidomide case of the 60s and 70s , but critics are saying that the only teratogen known to have produced human limb defects in the UK is thalidomide , and therefore this lawsuit should be dropped .
“ It would need to be proven that during the crucial stage of their pregnancy they were subject to huge doses of offending teratogens . ” – Dr Anthony Emmerson , St Mary ’s Hospital

DALLAS – A former fund raiser for the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) testified Friday that money from the foundation went to Palestinian charities controlled by Hamas .
Mohamed Shorbagi said he knew this through Hamas literature , a London - based Hamas website and word - of mouth .
Shorbagi pleaded guilty in August 2006 to providing material support to Hamas by routing money to HLF .
According to his plea agreement , he " made regular monetary contributions to the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) on behalf of himself and others , knowing that HLF then supplied some or all of that money to HAMAS , including donations made after October 26 , 2001 . "
He agreed to testify for the government in hopes of reducing his seven - year prison sentence .
But that does n't mean he has changed his views .
Under questioning from federal prosecutor James Jacks , Shorbagi unapologetically stated that he is an Islamist , a supporter of Hamas and Sharia law .
As a former HLF insider , his testimony could help the government 's case against HLF and five former officials .
They are accused of illegally sending millions of dollars through Palestinian charities , called zakat committees , controlled by the terrorist group .
In Palestine , most organizations are run by either Hamas or the secular Fatah movement , Shorbagi said .
Based upon the charities and individuals who received HLF money , Shorbagi concluded they were connected to Hamas .
" When you know money goes to Mahmud Zahar , you know money goes to Hamas . "
Some of those organizations were charities that distributed food and others were schools where children were taught Islamist ideology .
Shorbagi became the imam for a mosque in Rome , Georgia in 1993 .
Among his responsibilities was the collection of zakat , or charity , at the mosque .
He said he sent all the money collected to HLF .
Haitham Maghawri , a named defendant in the case who lives abroad , and defendant Mohamed El - Mezain were his main contacts .
By sending money to HLF , he said he felt he was helping organizations that had " clean hands . "
He defined " clean hands " as not being a corrupt organization like those run by the Palestinian Liberation Organization , which ran the Palestinian Authority .
In his view , Hamas would use the money for the appropriate behaviors that he wished to support .
Shorbagi was asked whether HLF changed its behavior after Hamas was designated a terrorist organization in 1995 and 1997 .
He replied that defendant Shukri Abu Baker , HLF 's former executive director , set up an office in Gaza to distribute money rather than HLF sending directly to individuals .
The recipients of the HLF funds were still tied to Hamas , he said .
In addition , HLF continued to advertise in publications by the Islamic Association of Palestine ( IAP ) , another U.S. - based charity that Shorbagi said was part of Hamas .
Exhibits already in evidence show that the IAP and HLF were parts of a " Palestine Committee " in America created to help Hamas both politically and financially .
The IAP played a propaganda role , publishing the Hamas charter , communiqués from the group and other articles in support .
In addition , HLF and IAP had an agreement to work together on fund raising .
In civil litigation , a federal judge has found that IAP " desired to help Hamas ' activities succeed , and … engaged in some act of helping those activities succeed . "
To help Hamas succeed , Shorbagi said he turned to the owner of a successful carpet company where he worked in Rome .
The owner of Alexandria Carpet provided donations ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars at a time , which Shorbagi routed to HLF .
When HLF officials learned that Shorbagi 's boss had made a donation to another organization , Shorbagi testified they were n't happy .
" HLF was supposed to get his money to Gaza , " he said .
At one point , defendant Ghassan Elashi suggested creating a fund using his boss ' money that HLF could invest and profit from the interest .
Jurors seemed attentive during Shorbagi 's testimony , which began Thursday afternoon .
A soft - spoken man with a slight accent , Shorbagi told jurors that he came to America after he was 18 and attended several colleges .
He became involved with an organization known as the Muslim Arab Youth Association ( MAYA ) .
MAYA helped Muslim students preserve their identities as they came to America from conservative Middle Eastern countries and faced " culture shock , " he said .
Most of the people who spoke at MAYA events were from the Muslim Brotherhood , Shorbagi said .
At some of the MAYA conferences , Shorbagi said he attended unadvertised , closed - door sessions .
One such closed meeting in 1992 was described as " a meeting from Hamas inside . "
Shorbagi testified that he saw defendants Elashi and Baker at the event , which featured Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzook as the speaker .
Marzook discussed " how Hamas was becoming a major player in the Middle East . "
He talked about how they needed to help Hamas grow in political power .
At another meeting in 1994 , Shorbagi saw defendants Mohamed El - Mezain , Baker and Elashi .
Marzook introduced the Hamas political leader , Khalid Mishaal , as the speaker .
Mishaal spoke about how Palestinians were sacrificing all they had " so we need to keep up with that . "
Defense attorneys had just started cross examining Shorbagi when court recessed for the weekend .
The early questioning emphasized that Shorbagi 's sentence already has been reduced , and could be trimmed more in exchange for his testimony .
In other testimony , prosecution expert witness Matthew Levitt returned to the stand Thursday over defense objections .
Levitt was the trial 's first witness , offering jurors a primer on the Middle East and Hamas .
It was clear , Levitt said Thursday looking at telephone records and documents found inside HLF offices , that the defendants had access to private contact numbers for top Hamas officials .
El - Mezain , for example , had the personal telephone number for Marzook , the Hamas deputy political chief .
And a document found at HLF had Hamas letterhead and an office number .
That number " was not made public to the world , " Levitt said .
" It does clearly establish a connection between Hamas and this phone number . "
The defense did not cross examine Levitt after his second appearance .
On Wednesday , Steve Simon , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a deputy at the National Security Council ( NSC ) during the Clinton Administration , testified about U.S. - led efforts to peacefully resolve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in the 1990s .
Middle East security and peace is important to U.S. interests and foreign policy , he said , explaining that America has a keen interest in facilitating talks between Palestinians and Israelis .
Those efforts led to the Oslo Accords , which were " followed by a lot of terrorist violence by Palestinian groups that were looking to bring the peace process to a halt if they could , " Simon said .
Hamas was one of these organizations .
Shorbagi 's cross examination is expected to continue when court resumes Monday morning .
What is the best treatment for panic attacks ?
Are there medications for panic attacks ?
As the result of years of research , there are a variety of treatments available to help people who suffer from panic attacks learn how to control the symptoms .
This includes several effective medical treatments , and specific forms of psychotherapy .
In terms of medications , specific members of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SSNRI ) , and the benzodiazepine families of medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for effective treatment of panic disorder .
Examples of anti-anxiety medications include
SSRIs
fluoxetine ( Prozac )
sertraline ( Zoloft )
paroxetine ( Paxil )
escitalopram ( Lexapro )
citalopram ( Celexa )
vortioxetine ( Brintellix )
vilazodone ( Viibryd )
SSNRIs
duloxetine ( Cymbalta )
venlafaxine ( Effexor )
desvenlafaxine ( Pristiq )
levomilnacipran ( Fetzima )
Benzodiazepines
Although alprazolam ( Xanax ) is often used to treat panic attacks , its short duration of action can sometimes result in having to take it several times per day .
Medications from the beta - blocker family ( for example , propranolol [ Inderal ] ) are sometimes used to treat the physical symptoms , like racing heart rate associated with a panic attack .
Some individuals who suffer from severe panic attacks may benefit from treatment with gabapentin ( Neurontin ) , which was initially found to treat seizures , or benefit from a neuroleptic medication like risperidone ( Risperdal ) , olanzapine ( Zyprexa ) , quetiapine ( Seroquel ) , aripiprazole ( Abilify ) , paliperidone ( Invega ) , asenapine ( Saphris ) , iloperidone ( Fanapt ) , or lurasidone ( Latuda ) .
Before SSRIs and SSNRIs became available , medications from the group known as the tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) were often used to address panic disorder .
Although TCAs have been found to be equally effective in treating panic attacks , SSRIs and SSNRIs have been proven to be safer and better tolerated .
Therefore TCAs are used much less often than they were previously .
When used in the appropriate person with close monitoring , medications can be quite effective as part of treatment for panic disorder .
However , as anything that is ingested carries a risk of side effects , it is important for the individual who has panic attacks to work closely with the prescribing health care professional to decide whether treatment with medications is an appropriate intervention and , if so , which medication should be administered .
The person being treated should be closely monitored for the possibility of side effects that can vary from minor to severe , and in some cases , even be life - threatening .
Due to the possible risks to the fetus of a mother being treated for panic attacks with medication , psychotherapy should be the first treatment tried when possible during pregnancy and the risk of medication treatment should be weighed against the risk of continued panic attacks in regard to the impact of a developing fetus .
For people who may be wondering how to avoid panic attacks using treatment without prescribed medication , natural remedies may be an option .
While herbal supplements that contain kava have been found to be helpful for some people with mild to moderate panic disorder , the research data is still considered to be too limited for many physicians to recommend treatment with other natural remedies like valerian or passionflower .
Also , care should be taken when taking any dietary supplements , since supplements are not regulated in terms of quality , content , or effectiveness .
The psychotherapy component of treatment for panic disorder is at least as important as medication .
In fact , research shows that psychotherapy alone or the combination of medication and psychotherapy treatment are more effective than medication alone in the long - term management of panic attacks .
In overcoming anxiety , cognitive behavioral therapy is widely accepted as an effective form of psychotherapy treatment , for both adults and children .
This form of psychotherapy seeks to help those with panic disorder identify and decrease the irrational thoughts and behaviors that reinforce panic symptoms and can be done either individually , in group therapy , in partner - assisted therapy , and even over the Internet .
Behavioral techniques that are often used to decrease anxiety include relaxation techniques ( like breathing techniques or guided imagery ) and gradually increasing exposure to situations that may have previously triggered anxiety in the panic disorder sufferer .
Helping the person with anxiety understand how to handle the emotional forces that may have contributed to developing symptoms ( panic - focused psychodynamic psychotherapy ) has also been found to be effective in teaching an individual with panic disorder how to prevent an anxiety attack or how to calm down in order to decrease or stop a panic attack once it starts .
There are also things that people with panic disorder can do to learn how to handle it and to make treatment more effective .
Since substances like drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages , or using illicit drugs can worsen panic attacks , those things should be avoided .
Other tips to prevent or manage panic attacks include engaging in aerobic exercise and stress - management techniques like deep breathing , massage therapy , and yoga , since these self - help activities have also been found to help decrease the frequency and severity of panic attacks .
Although many people use home remedies like breathing into a paper bag when afflicted by the hyperventilation that can be associated with panic , the benefit received may be the result of the individual believing it will remedy the symptoms ( placebo effect ) .
Also , breathing into a paper bag when one is already having trouble breathing can make matters worse when the hyperventilation is the result of conditions of oxygen deprivation , like an asthma attack or a heart attack .
People with panic disorder may also need treatment for other emotional problems .
Depression has often been associated with panic disorder , as have alcohol and drug abuse .
Fortunately , with proper treatment , these problems associated with panic disorder can be overcome effectively , just like panic disorder itself .
Sadly , many people with panic attacks do not seek or receive appropriate treatment .

Some of the cases we ’ll look at do n’t require much consideration .
Serving a printable version of a page , for example , is straightforward and easily accomplished .
Putting a pumpkin in your site header at Halloween or using a heart background around Valentine ’s Day can make your site seem timely and relevant , especially if you are in a seasonal business .
Other techniques , such as serving different templates to different browsers , devices , or user - agents might create serious debate among content authors .
Since serving content to mobile devices is becoming a new standard of doing business , we ’ll make it the focus of this article .
Serving mobile devices
The Mobile Web will remind some old timers ( like me ! ) of the early days of web design where we ’d create different sites for Netscape and Internet Explorer .
Hopefully , we take lessons from those days as we go forward and do n’t repeat our mistakes .
Though we ’re not as apt to serve wholly different templates to different desktop browsers as we once were , the mobile device arena creates special challenges that require careful attention .
One way to serve both desktop and mobile devices is a one - size - fits - all approach .
Through carefully structured and semantically correct XHTML markup and CSS selectors identified to be applied to handheld output , you can do a reasonable job of making your content fit a variety of contexts and devices .
However , this method has a couple of serious shortcomings .
First , it does not take into account the limitations of devices for rich media presentation with Flash , JavaScript , DHTML , and AJAX as they are largely unsupported on all but the highest - end devices .
If your site depends on any of these technologies , your users can get frustrated when trying to experience it on a mobile device .
Also , it does n’t address the varying levels of CSS support by different mobile devices .
What looks perfect on one device might look passable on another and completely unusable on a third because only some of the CSS rules were applied properly .
It also does not take into account the potentially high bandwidth costs for large markup files and CSS for users who pay by the amount of data transferred .
For example , putting display : none on an image does n’t stop a mobile device from downloading the file .
It only prevents it from being shown .
Finally , this approach does n’t tailor the experience to the user ’s circumstances .
Users tend to be goal - oriented and have specific actions in mind when using the mobile web , and content designers should recognize that simply recreating the desktop experience on a smaller screen might not solve their needs .
Limiting the information to what a mobile user is looking for and designing a simplified navigation can provide a better user experience .
Adapting content
You know your users best , and it is up to you to decide the best way to serve them .
You may decide to pass on the one - size - fits - all approach and serve a separate mobile experience through content adaptation .
The W3C ’s Mobile Web Initiative best practices guidelines suggest giving users the flexibility and freedom to choose their experience , and provide links between the desktop and mobile templates so that they can navigate between the two .
It is generally not recommended to automatically redirect users on mobile devices to a mobile site unless you give them a way to access the full site .
The dark side to this kind of content adaptation is that you will have a second set of template files to keep updated when you make site changes .
It can also cause your visitors to search through different bookmarks to find the content they have saved .
Before we get into multiple sites , let ’s start with some examples of showing alternative templates on our current site .
Setting up our example Since we want to customize the output of our detail page based on the presence of a variable in the URL , we ’re going to use a view function instead of a generic view .
Let us consider a press release application for a company website .
The press release object will have a title , body , published date , and author name .
In the root directory of your project ( in the directory projects / mycompany ) , create the press application by using the startapp command : $ python manage .
py startapp press
This will create a press folder in your site .
Edit the mycompany / press / models .py file : from django.db import models class PressRelease ( models .
Model ) : title = models .
CharField ( max_length = 100 ) body = models .
Text Field ( ) pub_date = models .
DateTimeField ( ) author = models .
CharField ( max_length = 100 ) def __unicode__ ( self ) : return self .
title Create a file called admin.py in the mycompany / press directory , adding these lines : from django .
contrib import admin from mycompany.press.models import PressRelease admin .
site .
register ( PressRelease )
Add the press and admin applications to your INSTALLED_APPS variable in the settings.py file : INSTALLED_APPS = ( ' django.contrib.auth ' , ' django.contrib.admin ' , ' django.contrib.contenttypes ' , ' django.contrib.sessions ' , ' django.contrib.sites ' , ' mycompany.press ' , )
In the root directory of your project , run the syncdb command to add the new models to the database : $ python manage .py syncdb
We will be prompted to create a superuser , go ahead and create it .
We can access the admin site by browsing to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and add data .
Create your mycompany / press/urls.py file as shown : urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ( r ' detail /(? P< pid>d+ ) /$ ' , ' mycompany.press.views.detail ' ) , ( r ' list / $ ' , ' django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list ' , press_list_dict ) , ( r ' latest / $ ' , ' mycompany.press.views.latest ' ) , ( r ' $ ' , ' django.views.generic.simple.redirect_to ' , { 'url ' : '/ press/list/' } ) )
In your mycompany / press / views .py file , your detail view should look like this : from django.http import HttpResponse from django.
shortcuts import get_object_or_404 from django.template import loader , Context from mycompany.press.models import PressRelease def detail ( request , pid ) : '''
Accepts a press release ID and returns the detail page ''' p = get_object_or_404 ( PressRelease , id = pid ) t = loader .
get_template ( ' press/detail.html ' ) c = Context ( { ' press ' : p } ) return HttpResponse ( t . render ( c ) )
Let ’s jazz up our template a little more for the press release detail by adding some CSS to it .
In mycompany / templates / press/detail.html , edit the file to look like this : < html > < head > < title > {{ press.
title }} </ title > < style type = " text /css " > body { text - align : center ; } # container { margin : 0 auto ; width : 70 % ; text - align : left ; } . header { background - color : #000 ; color : # fff ; } </ style > </ head > < body > < div id = " container " > < div class = " header " > < h1 > MyCompany Press Releases </ h1 > </ div > < div > < h2 > {{ press.title }} </ h2 > < p > Author : {{ press.author }} < br />
Date : {{ press.pub_date }} < br /> </ p > < p > {{ press.body }} </ p > </ div > </ div > </ body > </ html >
Start your development server and point your browser to the URL http://localhost:8000/press/detail/1/.
You should see something like this , depending on what data you entered before when you created your press release :
If your press release detail page is serving correctly , you ’re ready to continue .
Remember that generic views can save us development time , but sometimes you ’ll need to use a regular view because you ’re doing something in a way that requires a view function customized to the task at hand .
The exercise we ’re about to do is one of those circumstances , and after going through the exercise , you ’ll have a better idea of when to use one type of view over another .
Serving printable pages
One of the easiest approaches we will look at is serving an alternative version of a page based on the presence of a variable in the URL ( aka a URL parameter ) .
To serve a printable version of an article , for example , we can add ? printable to the end of the URL .
To make it work , we ’ll add an extra step in our view to check the URL for this variable .
If it exists , we ’ll load up a printer - friendly template file .
If it does n’t exist , we ’ll load the normal template file .
Start by adding the highlighted lines to the detail function in the mycompany / press / views .
py file : def detail ( request , pid ) : '''
Accepts a press release ID and returns the detail page ''' p = get_object_or_404 ( PressRelease , id = pid ) if request .
GET . has_key ( ' printable ' ) : template_file = ' press/detail_printable.html ' else : template_file = ' press/detail.html ' t = loader .
get_template ( template_file ) c = Context ( { ' press ' : p } ) return HttpResponse ( t . render ( c ) )
We ’re looking at the request .
GET object to see if a query string parameter of printable was present in the current request .
If it was , we load the press / detail_printable .
html file .
If not , we load the press / detail .
html file .
We ’ve also changed the loader .
get_template function to look for the template_file variable .
To test our changes , we ’ll need to create a simple version of our template that only has minimal formatting .
Create a new file called detail_printable .
html in the mycompany / templates / press / directory and add these lines into it : < html > < head > < title > {{ press.
title }} </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > {{ press.title }} </ h1 > < p > Author : {{ press.author }} < br />
Date : {{ press.pub_date }} < br /> </ p > < p > {{ press.body }} </ p > </ body > </ html >
Now that we have both regular and printable templates , let ’s test our view .
Point your browser to the URL http://localhost:8000/press/detail/1/ , and you should see our original template as it was before .
Change the URL to http://localhost:8000/press/detail/1/?printable and you should see our new printable template :
Creating site themes
Depending on the audience and focus of your site , you may want to temporarily change the look of your site for a season or holiday such as Halloween or Valentine ’s Day .
This is easily accomplished by leveraging the power of the TEMPLATE_DIRS configuration setting .
The TEMPLATE_DIRS variable in the settings .py file allows you to specify the location of the templates for your site .
Also TEMPLATE_DIRS
allows you to specify multiple locations for your template files .
When you specify multiple paths for your template files , Django will look for a requested template file in the first path , and if it does n’t find it , it will keep searching through the remaining paths until the file is located .
We can use this to our advantage by adding an override directory as the first element of the TEMPLATE_DIRS value .
When we want to override a template with a special themed one , we ’ll add the file to the override directory .
The next time the template loader tries to load the template , it will find it in the override directory and serve it .
For example , let ’s say we want to override our press release page from the previous example .
Recall that the view loaded the template like this ( from mycompany / press/ views.py ) : template_file = ' press/detail.html ' t = loader .
get_template ( template_file )
When the template engine loads the press / detail .
html template file , it gets itfrom the mycompany / templates / directory as specified in the mycompany / settings .py file : TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( '/ projects/mycompany/templates /' ,)
If we add an additional directory to our TEMPLATE_DIRS setting , Django will look in the new directory first : TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( '/ projects/mycompany/templates/override /' , '/ projects/mycompany/templates/' , )
Now when the template is loaded , it will first check for the file / projects / mycompany / templates/override/press/detail.html .
If that file does n’t exist , it will go on to the next directory and look for the file in / projects / mycompany / templates / press/detail.html .
If you ’re using Windows , use the Windows - style file path c:/ projects / mycompany / templates / for these examples .
Therein lies the beauty .
If we want to override our press release template , we simply drop an alternative version with the same file name into the override directory .
When we ’re done using it , we just remove it from the override directory and the original version will be served ( or rename the file in the override directory to something other than detail .
html ) .
If you ’re concerned about the performance overhead of having a nearly empty override directory that is constantly checked for the existence of template files , we should consider caching techniques as a potential solution for this .
Testing the template overrides
Let ’s create a template override to test the concept we just learned .
In your mycompany / settings.py file , edit the TEMPLATE_DIRS setting to look like this : TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( '/ projects/mycompany/templates/override/' , '/ projects/mycompany/templates/' , )
Create a directory called override at mycompany / templates / and another directory underneath that called press .
You should now have these directories : / projects / mycompany / templates/override/ /projects/mycompany/templates/override/press/
Create a new file called detail .
html in mycompany / templates / override / press / and add these lines to the file : < html > < head > < title > {{ press.
title }} </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > Happy Holidays </ h1 > < h2 > {{ press.title }} </ h2 > < p > Author : {{ press.author }} < br />
Date : {{ press.pub_date }} < br /> </ p > < p > {{ press.body }} </ p > </ body > </ html >
You ’ll probably notice that this is just our printable detail template with an extra “ Happy Holidays ” line added to the top of it .
Point your browser to the URL http://localhost:8000/press/detail/1/
and you should see something like this :
By creating a new press release detail template and dropping it in the override directory , we caused Django to automatically pick up the new template and serve it without us having to change the view .
To change it back , you can simply remove the file from the override directory ( or rename it ) .
One other thing to notice is that if you add ? printable to the end of the URL , it still serves the printable version of the file we created earlier .
Delete the mycompany / templates / override / directory and any files in it as we wo n’t need them again .

Serving different templates by domain name
An increasingly common need for web applications is to serve a set of alternative templates for mobile devices .
A common way to serve this alternative view of your site is to use a different domain name , such as mobile.mydomain.com , m.mydomain.com or mydomain.mobi .
Django makes it very easy to serve a secondary domain name from the same base project .
When you configure your web server to serve your Django site , you tell it what settings file to use , so you can create a second settings file in the same directory and give it a different value for the TEMPLATE_DIRS setting .
For example , your main site would point to mycompany / settings.py and have a TEMPLATE_DIRS setting like this : TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( '/ projects/mycompany/templates /' , )
Your mobile site would point to mycompany / settings_mobile.py with a TEMPLATE_DIRS setting like this : TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( '/ projects/mycompany/templates/mobile/' , )
This technique gets even better when you realize that you do n’t have to completely duplicate your settings.py file when creating settings_mobile.py .
Because the only thing we need to change between the two files is the TEMPLATE_DIRS value , the only lines you need to put in your settings_mobile .py file are these : from settings import * TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( '/ projects/mycompany/templates/mobile/' , )
The first line imports all the existing values from the mycompany / settings .py file .
The second line overrides the value of TEMPLATE_DIRS with our new directory .
This technique has the added benefit that changes to the settings .py file do n’t have to be duplicated into settings_mobile .py .
They will be automatically picked up .
Serving different sites with the development web server
We can test how this works by using the development web server that we ’ve been using all along and specifying which settings file to use .
( You can also make your production web server , such as Apache or lighttpd do this .
You ’ll find configuration information in Django ’s online documentation . )
We ’ll start two instances of the development server on different ports to simulate the real - world example of using two different domains .
Step 1 : Cloning the settings File Create a new file in your mycompany directory called settings_mobile.py .
In that file , insert these lines : from settings import * TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( '/ projects/mycompany/templates/mobile/' , )
Because this file exists in the same directory as settings.py , it ’s able to use a simple import statement to bring in all its values .
Step 2 : Create a mobile template
We wo n’t go into the details of creating templates that are friendly to mobile web browsers , as there is plenty of information available online on this .
( If you ’re interested , dev.mobi is an excellent resource for information on that subject as well as Mobile Web Development by Nirav Mehta , printed by Packt Publishing . )
To test our setup , we ’ll create a different template so that we can see that it served properly .
Create a new directory in mycompany / templates / called mobile .
Create a press directory in the mycompany / templates / mobile / directory .
You should now have these directories : mycompany / templates / press / mycompany /templates/mobile/press/
Create a new file called detail .
html in your mycompany / templates / mobile / press / directory and add these lines : < html > < head > < title > {{ press.
title }} </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > MyCompany Mobile </ h1 > < h2 > {{ press.title }} </ h2 > < p > Author : {{ press.author }} < br />
Date : {{ press.pub_date }} < br /> </ p > < p > {{ press.body }} </ p > </ body > </ html >
Step 3 : Configuring the development web server
When using the development web server , it ’s possible to tell it what settings file to run against by passing a command - line argument : $ manage .py runserver --settings=settings_mobile
Using two separate terminal windows , run two different instances of the web server at two different ports so that we can test the differences : $ manage .py runserver 8000 -- settings=settings $ manage .py runserver 8001 --settings=settings_mobile
If we point our web browser at the URL http://localhost:8000/press/detail/1/ , we ’ll get the regular version of our press release .
If we use the URL http://localhost:8001/press/detail/1/ , we ’ll get the new mobile version of the site like this : ( I was introduced to this method by Matt Croydon ’s blog at postneo.com .
He agreed to let me share it .
Thanks , Matt ! )
Redirecting users to the mobile site I saved this section for last because it ’s entirely optional and uses some advanced concepts .
You can consider it as an extra credit exercise .
Now that we have a second site set up for mobile users , we may want to automatically redirect our users to it if we can tell they are using a mobile device .
This technique is n’t foolproof and could cause difficulties for some of your users who want to be able to choose their mobile experience .
We ’ll code a way with which they can get back to the main site , but consider this when deciding if you want to use the technique .
Detecting mobile devices
The HTTP_USER_AGENT is the key piece of information we will use to determine how the user is accessing the site .
It ’s a string containing the identity of the browser being used ; consider it the “ fingerprint ” of the browser .
In Django , the user agent string is available from the key request .
META[‘ HTTP_USER_AGENT ’ ] .
Here ’s the user agent from iPhone ( There is no line break , it ’s one long , continued line . ) : Mozilla /5.0 ( iPhone ; U ; CPU like Mac OS X ; en ) AppleWebKit /420 + ( KHTML , like Gecko ) Version / 3.0 Mobile / 1A543a Safari/419.3
Notice that the string is full of version numbers .
If you try to match on these strings directly , you could end up with hundreds or thousands of strings to check against , as new versions are released on different platforms .
Inside the string , however , are two strings that we might use to give us a clue whether this is a mobile device , Mobile and iPhone .
Instead of seeing if the current user agent is equal to this string , we ’ll use regular expressions to look inside the string for patterns we know match common mobile user agents .
Here ’s a Python snippet from the interactive shell to illustrate the point : >>> import re >>> user_agent = ''' Mozilla /5.0 ( iPhone ; U ; CPU like Mac OS X ; en) AppleWebKit/420 + ( KHTML , like Gecko ) Version /3.0 Mobile / 1A543a Safari/419.3 ''' >>> re . search ( 'i Phone ' , user_agent ) < _sre .
SRE_Match object at 0x736b0 >
When we searched for the term iPhone inside of the user_agent string , we found a match .
We can use this kind of test to determine if the request is coming from a mobile device .
We could check this in each of our views , but that would require a lot of redundant code .
Instead , we ’ll write it into a piece of Django middleware that will run before each request is processed .
Regular expressions can be tricky to work with , and you may want to read up on how they work before diving in .
They can be incredibly powerful , so it ’s probably time well spent !
Writing the middleware Middleware functions allow you to “ tap in ” or inject functions into the request and response cycle .
We ’ll use a process request middleware function to check for a mobile device before any views are executed .
The first thing we ’ll need to do is create a directory under our project in which to put our middleware file .
Create a new directory under the existing mycompany directory called middleware .
Inside the new directory , we ’ll create two files : mycompany / middleware/__init__.py and mycompany / middleware/mobile_redirect.py
The first file , __init__.py , is just a blank file that Python needs for its importing process .
Do n’t worry too much about it ; just create it as a blank file .
The second file , mobile_redirect.py , will contain the logic to do our redirection .
Here ’s the first pass at our code .
Enter these lines in mobile_redirect.py : from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect import re mobile_url = ' http://localhost:8001/'
agents_list = [ ' Nokia ' , 'b MOT ' , '^ LGE?b ' , ' SonyEricsson ' , ' Ericsson ' , ' BlackBerry ' , ' DoCoMo ' , ' Symbian ' , ' Windows CE ' , ' NetFront ' , ' Klondike ' , ' PalmOS ' , ' PalmSource ' , ' portalmm ' , ' S [ CG ] H -' , 'b SAGEM ' , ' SEC -' , ' jBrowser - WAP ' , ' Mitsu ' , ' Panasonic -' , ' SAMSUNG -' , ' Samsung - ' , ' Sendo ' , ' SHARP -' , ' Vodaphone ' , ' BenQ ' , 'i PAQ ' , ' AvantGo ' , ' Go. Web ' , ' Sanyo -' , ' AUDIOVOX ' , ' PG -' , ' CDM [ - d ] ' , '^ KDDI -' , '^ SIE -' , ' TSM [ - d ] ' , '^ KWC -' , ' WAP ' , '^KGT [ NC ] ' , 'i Phone ' , ] def is_mobile ( user_agent ) : for agent in agents_list : if re . search ( agent , user_agent ) : return
True return False class MobileRedirect ( object ) : def process_request ( self , request ) : if is_mobile ( request .
META [ ' HTTP_USER_AGENT ' ] ) : return HttpResponseRedirect ( mobile_url ) else : pass return None Starting at the bottom , we ’ve created a generic object called MobileRedirect that has a process_request method .
( Django ’s middleware system requires us to set it up this way . )
We ’re calling a function is_mobile_device that takes the user agent as an argument , determines if it matches against a list of known mobile agents , and returns a Boolean True or False .
If it matched , we redirect the user to our mobile site .
If not , the middleware will return None and Django will continue .
The is_mobile_device function iterates through a list of regular expression patterns and looks for a match .
Notice that the user_agents list contains regular expression patterns just like the one we worked with a minute ago .
You ’ll see some regular expression syntax such as b and d that match the pattern as a word ( not a piece in the middle of a string ) and match digits , respectively .
Checking only once
There are a couple of potential downsides to this technique .
First , most visitors to your site will probably not have browsers with user agent strings that match against this list and get redirected to your mobile site .
Running this piece of middleware on every request is a waste of resources and could negatively impact performance .
Second , it does n’t give your user the option of viewing your desktop site on his / her mobile device as they are automatically redirected .
Users with advanced mobile browsers such as the iPhone may want to use your full site .
Every time they try to access the full site , they will get redirected to the mobile site .
The easiest way to get around both these problems is to use a session variable to record that we have already performed the user agent check .
Sessions are turned on by default in Django , so we ’ll just add a couple lines : class MobileRedirect ( object ) : def process_request ( self , request ) : if not request .
session .
get ( ' checked_ua ' , False ) : if is_mobile ( request .
META [ ' HTTP_USER_AGENT ' ] ) : request .
session [ ' checked_ua ' ] =
True return HttpResponseRedirect ( mobile_url ) else : #
Make sure it does n't try this again request .
session [ ' checked_ua ' ] =
True return None
Here we ’ve added a session variable checked_ua that we can check before we run the is_mobile_device function .
If the session variable evaluates to True , we skip over the processing and Django continues on its way .
If it ’s not True , we check the user agent and use the checked_ua variable to record that we ’ve done the processing .
This solves our second problem , which we identified :
If the user goes back to our full site , they wo n’t get redirected again because the session variable will indicate that the check was already performed .
We ’ll know they were redirected and they came back , so they probably do n’t want to be redirected again !
Django ’s session framework requires cookies to work properly .
Most modern mobile browsers support cookies , so this technique should work well .
If the mobile browser does n’t support cookies or they are disabled , the user will not be able to get back to your full site because the session wo n’t exist .
Installing the middleware
The last thing we need to do is add our function to the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES setting inside our mycompany / settings .py file .
We also need to override the setting inside of our mobile_settings .py file , otherwise it will keep trying to redirect to itself !
In your mycompany / settings.py file , add the highlighted line to the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES setting : MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = ( ' django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware ' , ' django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware ' , ' middleware.mobile_redirect.MobileRedirect ' , ' django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware ' , )
Notice that we put the mobile redirect middleware after the session middleware .
If we do n’t , we will not be able to write the session variable that we need .
The order matters !
Finally , in our settings_mobile .py file , add the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES setting without the mobile redirect : MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = ( ' django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware ' , ' django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware ' , ' django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware ' , )
You may be wondering why we did this with a session variable instead of a cookie .
In order to set cookies , we need to have access to the HTTP response object that is written , as that ’s where cookie writing happens .
Since we do n’t have this object in the process_request middleware , we kept it simple by using session variables .
To test the middleware in your web browser , you ’ll need to change the browser ’s user agent string .
An easy way to do this in the Firefox browser is to install a plug - in called the User Agent Switcher .
This browser add - in allows your desktop web browser to masquerade as a different user agent .
You can find the add-in at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59
I installed the add- in in my Firefox application , and followed the directions provided to add a new user agent .
I used these settings : Description : iPhone
User Agent : Mozilla /5.0 ( iPhone ; U ; CPU like Mac OS X ; en )
like Mac X ; en ) AppleWebKit /420 + ( KHTML , like Gecko )
, like Gecko ) Version / 3.0
Mobile / 1A542a Safari/419.3
With these settings in place , I went up to Firefox ’s Tools menu , chose User Agent Switcher , and chose the new iPhone setting .
With this setting , my browser tricks web servers into thinking it ’s an iPhone .
Browse to the URL http://localhost:8000/ , and the middleware should immediately try to redirect you to http://localhost:8001/.
Summary
In this article , we ’ve explored the topic of serving content with multiple templates .
We looked at the different approaches available to serve content to mobile devices , including using basic templates and content adaptation .
We learned how to detect the presence of a URL parameter to dynamically choose the template loaded in a view , and how to use the TEMPLATE_DIRS setting to override a template on demand without having to change any code .
Finally , we leaned how to serve a second set of templates to a separate domain name by creating a settings file to override the default settings .
We also explored a technique using middleware to redirect users to a different URL based on their browser ’s user agent string .
Poll : Lieberman would ' get crushed ' by Connecticut AG Ron Brynaert
Published : Tuesday February 10 , 2009
Print This Email
This A new poll shows that Independent Senator Joe Lieberman , who left the Democratic Party after losing the Senate primary to businessman Ned Lamont in 2006 , would " get crushed " if challenged by Connecticut 's State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal in 2012 .
" If Joe Lieberman decides to run for a fifth term in 2012 , a new Quinnipiac poll suggests that it may be a lost cause , " Eric Kleefeld writes at Talking Points Memo .
According to the Quinnipiac poll , " By a narrow 48 - 45 percent margin , voters disapprove of the job Sen.
Joseph Lieberman is doing and give him a negative 43 - 49 percent favorability .
Republicans approve 75 - 20 percent .
Democrats disapprove 70 - 21 percent and independent voters split 48 - 46 percent . "
" By contrast , State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal gets a 79 - 12 percent approval rating and 71 - 13 percent favorability rating , " Quinnipiac 's website notes .
" Republicans approve of the Democrat 66 - 25 percent .
Democrats approve 85 - 6 percent and independent voters approve 81 - 10 percent . "
The poll determines , " If Sen . Lieberman faces Blumenthal in 2012 , the Democratic challenger has an early 58 - 30 percent lead .
Republicans go with Lieberman 67 - 23 percent while Blumenthal leads 83 - 9 percent among Democrats and 55 - 29 percent among independent voters . "
" Sen . Lieberman 's approval is negative , but up slightly .
It 's a long time until 2012 , but this poll shows that if Connecticut 's popular Democratic Attorney General Richard Blumenthal takes on Lieberman , as the buzz suggests , Lieberman would get crushed , " Quinnipiac University Poll Director Douglas Schwartz , Ph.D said .
At TPM , Kleefeld concludes , " A lot can happen in four years , but right now it does n't look like Lieberman has too many options .
He can't run as a Democrat , he would still lose as a Republican , and there 's no reason to believe that staying as an independent will provide much more of an opportunity . "

A leading Christian activist has made a formal complaint about the atheist bus adverts which were launched nationwide this week .
The 800 buses launched for the campaign feature the slogan : " There is probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
Now Stephen Green of Christian Voice , who formerly hit the front pages by launching a legal challenge against Jerry Springer the Opera on the BBC , has complained to the Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) and is calling for the adverts to be withdrawn .
Mr Green released a statement saying : " I believe the ad breaks the Advertising Code , unless the advertisers hold evidence that God probably does not exist .
" The ASA does not just cover goods and services , it covers all advertising .
The advertisers cannot hide behind the ASA 's ' matters of opinion ' exclusion , because no person or body is named as the author of the statement .
It is given as a statement of fact and that means it must be capable of substantiation if it is not to break the rules . "
Mr Green has challenged the adverts on grounds of " truthfulness " and " substantiation " , suggesting that there is not " a shred of supporting evidence " that there is probably no God .
Speaking to politics .co.uk distinguished philosopher A C Grayling defended the slogan , saying there was ample justification for the claim .
" The evidential basis for God is the same as for believing there are fairies at the bottom of the garden , and if you do n't believe the latter , you should n't believe the former , " he said .
Professor Grayling admitted secretly welcoming any Advertising Standards inquiry into the adverts , because it would necessarily impact on Christian adverts as well .
Most notably , it could effect the adverts of the Alpha Foundation , an organisation whose advert prompted the atheist response .
It organises Christian seminars nationwide and is described by God Delusion author Richard Dawkins as " a pretty dopey sort of organisation " .
Hanne Stinson , chief executive of the British Humanist Association ( BHA ) , said : " I 've sought advice from some of our key people here , but I 'm afraid all I 've got out of them so far is peals of laughter .
" I am sure that Stephen Green really does think there is a great deal of evidence for a God ( though presumably only the one that he believes in ) but I pity the ASA if they are going to be expected to rule on the probability of god's existence . "
The spate follows a week of religious controversy in the UK , with prominent atheist Richard Dawkins describing creationist science teachers as ignorant and a successful campaign to have secular speakers on BBC Radio 4's
Thought for the Day .
Mr Green was unavailable for comment .
This is part of a series I started in March 2008 - you may want to go back and look at older parts if you 're new to this series .
- exps = [ : do ] + zero_or_more ( : defexp ) + exps = zero_or_more ( : defexp ) + vars = deep_collect ( exps , Array ) { | node | node [ 0 ] == : assign ?
node [ 1 ] : nil } + exps = [ : let , vars ] + exps
# Visit all objects in an array recursively .
# yield any object that #is_a ? ( c ) def deep_collect node , c = Array , & block ret = [ ] if node .
is_a ? ( c ) ret << yield ( node ) end if node .
is_a ? ( Array ) node .
each do | n | if n . is_a ? ( Array ) || n . is_a ? ( c ) ret << deep_collect ( n , c , & block ) end end end ret .
flatten .
uniq .
compact end
The code as at the end of this part can be found here I wo n't promise to keep up the posting frequency I 've kept over the last week or so , but here 's a tiny little part showing the next step .
This time we 're getting rid of " let " .
Well , sort of .
I wo n't remove it from the syntax tree , but I will hide it , by making the compiler identify all : assign nodes in a function and creating a let for the variable referenced .
Note that the current version is simplistic :
It will ignore any : let nodes , and so may introduce redundant variables if you embed s-expressions with : let nodes , and it also ignores expressions on the left hand of an assign - % s ( index arr 0 ) for example is a valid expression on the left hand of an assign .
But it 's a start .
If you 're following my Github repository , you may already have seen the code , but here 's a quick explanation .
First we make this change to the parsers # parse_defexp method :
It leaves the method looking like this : # def ::= " def " ws * name args ?
ws* defexp * " end " def parse_def return nil if [ email protected ] ( " def " ) @s.ws raise " Expected function name " if !( name = parse_name ) args = parse_args @s.ws exps = zero_or_more ( : defexp ) vars = deep_collect ( exps , Array ) { |node| node [ 0 ] == : assign ? node [ 1 ] : nil} exps = [ : let , vars ] + exps raise " Expected expression of ' end ' " if [ email protected ] ( " end " ) return [ : defun , name , args , exps ] end As you can see the new thing is a call to a new function - deep_collect - that is used to collect the variable names .
Lets take a look at deep collect :
I am sure there 's cleaner way of doing this , but the purpose is to walk through the tree of arrays we use as a syntax tree , and yield any object that #is_a ? ( c ) .
# parse_defexp use that to check if one of the Array nodes in the tree starts with : assign , and assumes that the first argument to : assign will be a variable name ( in the future we 'll need to expand on that to walk through any trees there instead of just expecting a variable name ) , and return an array of the identified variable names .
Then # parse_defexp will create a : let node instead of a : do node like it used to .
That 's all there 's too it .
The next part will look at something more interesting : I 'm plugging in an adaptation of my operator precedence parser .
Also note that code is already on Github to handle " while " - I wo n't be going through those changes as they 're pretty straightforward , and uses exactly the same approach as I did to handle " def " .

I often give talks to audiences explaining that research by me and others shows that guns are used much more often to fend off crimes than to commit them .
People are very surprised to learn that survey data show that guns are used defensively by private citizens in the U.S. anywhere from 1.5 to 3.4 million times a year .
A question I hear repeatedly is : " If defensive gun use occurs so often , why have n’t I ever heard of even one story ? "
Obviously anecdotal stories published in newspapers can’t prove how numerous these events are , but they can at least deal with the question of whether these events even occur .
During 2001 , I did two detailed searches on defensive gun uses : one for the period covering March 11 to 17 of that year , and another for the period July 22 to 28 .
While these searches were not meant to be comprehensive , I found a total of 40 defensive gun uses over those two weeks .
Some representative examples :
Clearwater , Florida : At 1:05 a.m. , a man started banging on a patio door , beat on a family ’s truck , then tore open the patio door .
After numerous shouted warnings not to break into the home , a 16 - year - old boy fired a single rifle shot , wounding the attacker .
Columbia , South Carolina :
As two gas station employees left work just after midnight , two men attempted to rob them , beating them about the head and neck with a shovel handle .
The male employee broke away long enough to draw a handgun from his pocket and shot at his attacker , who later died .
Detroit , Michigan : A mentally disturbed man yelled that the President was going to have him killed , and started firing at people in passing cars .
A man at the scene who had a permit to carry a concealed handgun fired shots that forced the attacker to run away .
West Palm Beach , Florida :
After being beaten during a robbery at his home , a home owner began carrying a handgun in his pocket .
When another robber attacked him just two days later the homeowner shot and wounded his assailant .
Columbia Falls , Montana : A woman ’s ex-boyfriend entered her home to sexually assault her .
She got away long enough to get her pistol and hold her attacker at gun point until police arrived .
Baton Rouge , Louisiana : At 5:45 a.m. , a crack addict kicked in the back door of a house and charged the homeowner , who shot him to death .
Gainesville , Florida :
A newspaper carrier was dragged from his car and beaten by five men at 3:15 a.m .
The victim then shot one of the attackers in the chest with a concealed weapon .
Tampa , Florida :
Two teenage armed robbers went on a four - hour crime spree , hijacking cars , robbing people , and hospitalizing one victim with serious injuries .
They were stopped when one intended victim , a pizza - store owner , shot and wounded one attacker .
Charleston , South Carolina :
A carjacking was stopped by a 27 - year - old victim who then shot one of his attackers .
The victim had paused to ask directions when several men , one with a lengthy criminal record , jumped into the car .
These life and death stories represent only a tiny fraction of defensive gun uses .
A survey of 1,015 people I conducted during November and December 2002 indicates that 2.3 million defensive gun uses occurred nationwide in 2001 .
Guns do make it easier to commit bad deeds , but they also make it easier for people to defend themselves where few alternatives are available .
That is why it is so important that people receive an accurate , balanced accounting of how guns are used .
Unfortunately , the media are doing a very poor job of that today .
Though my survey indicates that simply brandishing a gun stops crimes 95 percent of the time , it is very rare to see a story of such an event reported in the media .
A dead gunshot victim on the ground is highly newsworthy , while a criminal fleeing after a woman points a gun is apparently not considered news at all .
That ’s not impossible to understand ; after all , no shots were fired , no crime was committed , and no one is even sure what crime would have been committed had a weapon not been drawn .
In other words , airplane crashes get news coverage , while successful take - offs and landings do not .
Even though fewer than one out of 1,000 defensive gun uses result in the death of the attacker , the newsman ’s penchant for drama means that the bloodier cases are usually covered .
Even in the rare cases where guns are used to shoot someone , injuries are about six times more frequent than deaths .
You would n’t know this from the stories the media choose to report .
But much more than a bias toward bad news and drama goes into the medias selective reporting on gun usage .
Why , for instance , does the torrential coverage of public shooting sprees fail to acknowledge when such attacks are aborted by citizens with guns ?
In January 2002 , a shooting left three dead at the Appalachian Law School in Virginia .
The event made international headlines and produced more calls for gun control .
Yet one critical fact was missing from virtually all the news coverage :
The attack was stopped by two students who had guns in their cars .
The fast responses of Mikael Gross and Tracy Bridges undoubtedly saved many lives .
Mikael was outside the law school returning from lunch when Peter Odighizuwa started shooting .
Tracy was in a classroom waiting for class to start .
When the shots rang out , chaos erupted .
Mikael and Tracy were prepared to do something more constructive : Both immediately ran to their cars and got their guns , then approached the shooter from different sides .
Thus confronted , the attacker threw his gun down .
Is n’t it remarkable that out of 208 news stories ( from a Nexis - Lexis search ) in the week after the event , just four mentioned that the students who stopped the shooter had guns ?
A typical description of the event in the Washington Post .
“ Three students pounced on the gunman and held him until help arrived . ”
New York ’s Newsday noted only that the attacker was “ restrained by students . ”
Many stories mentioned the law - enforcement or military backgrounds of these student heroes , but virtually all of the media , in discussing how the killer was stopped , said things such as : “ students tackled the man while he was still armed ” “ students tackled the gunman ” the attacker “ dropped his gun after being confronted by students , who then tackled him to the ground ” or “ students ended the rampage by confronting and then tackling the gunman , who dropped his weapon ”
In all , 72 stories described how the attacker was stopped , without mentioning that the heroes had guns .
Yet 68 stories provided precise details on the gun used by the attacker :
The New York Times made sure to point out it was " a .380 semiautomatic handgun " ; the Los Angeles Times noted it was " a .380 - caliber semiautomatic pistol . "
A week and a half after the assault , I appeared on a radio program in Los Angeles along with Tracy Bridges , one of the Appalachian Law School heroes .
Tracy related how " shocked " he had been by the news coverage .
Though he had carefully described to over 50 reporters what had happened , explaining how he had to point his gun at the attacker and yell at him to drop his gun , the media had consistently reported that the incident had ended by the students " tackling " the killer .
When I relayed what the Washington Post had reported , Tracy quickly mentioned that he had spent a considerable amount of time talking face - to - face with reporter Maria Glod of the Post .
He seemed stunned that this conversation had not resulted in a more accurate rendition of what had occurred .
After finishing the radio show , I telephoned the Washington Post , and Ms. Glod confirmed that she had talked to both Tracy Bridges and Mikael Gross , and that both had told her the same , story .
She , said that describing the students as pouncing , and failing to mention their guns , was not " intentional . "
The way that things had come out was simply due to space constraints .
I later spoke with Mike Getler , the ombudsman for the Post .
Getler was quoted in the Kansas City Star as saying that the reporters simply did not know that bystanders had gotten their guns .
After informed him that Glod had been told by the students about using their guns , yet excluded that information , Getler said , " She should have included it . "
However , Getler said that he had no power to do anything about it .
He noted that readers had sent in letters expressing concern about how the attack had been covered .
But none of these letters was ever published .
The Kansas City Star printed a particularly telling interview with Jack Stokes , media relations manager at the Associated Press , who " dismissed accusations that news groups deliberately downplayed the role gun owners may have played in stopping " the shooting .
But Stokes " did acknowledge being u2018 shocked ’ upon learning that students carrying guns had helped subdue the gunman .
u2018 I thought , my God , they ’re putting into jeopardy even more people by bringing out these guns . ’ "
Selective reporting of crimes such as the Appalachian Law School incident is n’t just poor journalism ; it could actually endanger people ’s lives .
By turning a case of defensive gun use into a situation where students merely " overpowered a gunman " the media give potential victims the wrong impression of what works when confronted with violence .
Research consistently shows that having a gun ( usually just showing it ) is the safest way to respond to any type of criminal assault .
It ’s no wonder people find it hard to believe that guns are used in self - defense 2 million times a year : Reporting on these events is systematically suppressed .
When was the last time you saw a story in the national news about a private citizen using his gun to stop a crime ?
Media decisions to cover only the crimes committed with guns — and not the crimes stopped with them — have a real impact on people ’s perceptions of the desirability of guns .
To flesh out this impression with some data , I conducted searches of the nation ’s three largest newspapers — USA Today , the Wall Street Journal , and the New York Times — for the year 2001 and found that only the Times carried even a single news story on defensive gun use .
( The instance involved a retired New York City Department of Corrections worker who shot a man who was holding up a gas station . )
Broadening my search to the top ten newspapers in the country , I learned that the Los Angeles Times , Washington Post , and Chicago Tribune each managed to report three such stories in a year .
To gain further perspective , I did deeper searches comparing the number of words newspapers published on the use of guns for committing crimes versus stopping crimes .
For 2001 , I found that the New York Times published 104 gun-crime news articles — ranging from a short blurb about a bar fight to a front - page story on a school shooting — for a total of 50,745 words .
In comparison , its single story about a gun used in self - defense amounted to all of 163 words .
USA Today contained 5,660 words on crimes committed with guns , and not a single word on defensive gun use .
The least lopsided coverage was provided by the Washington Post , with 46,884 words on crimes committed with guns and 953 words on defensive stories — still not exactly a balanced treatment .
Moreover , the few defensive news stories that got coverage were almost all local stories .
Though articles about gun crimes are treated as both local and national stories , defensive uses of guns are given only local coverage in the rare instances they run at all .
In the full sample of defensive gun-use stories I have collected , less than 1 percent ran outside the local coverage area .
News about guns only seems to travel if it ’s bad .
This helps explain why residents of urban areas are so in favor of gun control .
Most crime occurs in the biggest cities , and urbanites are bombarded with tales of gun-facilitated crime .
It happens that most defensive gun uses also occur in these same big cities , but they simply are n’t reported .
This imbalance is n’t just limited to newspapers .
Take the 1999 special issue of Newsweek entitled " America Under the Gun . "
Though over 15,000 words and numerous graphics were provided on the topic of gun ownership , there was not one mention of self - defense with a firearm .
Under the heading " America ’s Weapons of Choice , " the table captions were : " Top firearms traced to crimes , 1998 " ; " Firearm deaths per 100,000 people " ; and " Percent of homicides using firearms . "
Nothing at all on " Top firearms used in self - defense , " or " Rapes , homicides , and other crimes averted with firearms . "
The magazine ’s graphic , gut - wrenching pictures all showed people who had been wounded by guns .
No images were offered of people who had used guns to save lives or prevent injuries .
To investigate television coverage , I collected stories reported during 2001 on the evening news broadcasts and morning news shows of ABC , CBS , and NBC .
Several segments focused on the increase in gun sales after September 11 , and a few of these shows actually went so far as to list the desire for self - defense as a reason for that increase .
But despite slightly over 190,000 words of coverage on gun crimes , merely 580 words , on a single news broadcast , were devoted to the use of a gun to block crime — a story about an off - duty police officer who helped stop a school shooting .
Not one of the networks mentioned any other defensive gun use — certainly not one carried out by a civilian .
Another place where the predilections of reporters color the news about guns is in the choice of authorities quoted .
An analysis of New York Times news articles over the last two years reveals that Times reporters overwhelmingly cite pro-gun - control academics in their articles .
From February 2000 to February 2002 , the Times cited nine strongly pro-control academics a total of 20 times ; one neutral academic once ; and no academic who was skeptical that gun control reduces crime .
Not once .
The same pro-control academics were referenced again and again : Philip Cook of Duke , Alfred Blumstein at Carnegie Mellon , Garen Wintemute of the University of California at Davis .
This imbalance in experts interviewed cannot be explained away by an inability to find academics who are dubious about most gun control laws .
Two hundred ninety - four academics from institutions as diverse as Harvard , Stanford , Northwestern , the University of Pennsylvania , and UCLA released an open letter to Congress in 1999 stating that the new gun laws , being proposed at that time were " ill advised . "
These professors were economists , lawyers , and criminologists .
None of these academics was quoted in New York Times reports on guns over a two - year period .
Polls frequently serve as the basis of news stories .
While they can provide us with important insights about people ’s views , polls can also mislead in subtle ways .
In the case of weapons , poll questions are almost always phrased with the assumption that gun control is either a good thing or , at worst , merely ineffective .
The possibility that it could have bad results and even increase crime is never acknowledged .
Consider these questions from some well - known national polls :
Do you think that stricter gun control laws would reduce the amount of violent crime in this country a lot , a little , or not at all ?
( Pew Research Center / Newsweek )
Do you think stricter gun control laws would reduce the amount of violent crime in this country , or not ?
( ABC News / Washington Post )
Do you think stricter gun control laws would , or would not reduce violent crime ?
( CBS News )
I reviewed 17 national and seven state surveys and found that all asked only whether gun control laws reduce crime ; not one offered respondents a chance to consider whether gun control might increase crime .
This notion apparently never entered the pollsters ’ minds .
The omission in such polls of a " would increase crime " option creates a bias in two different ways .
First , there is an " anchoring " effect .
We know that the range of options people are offered in a poll affects how they answer , because many respondents instinctively choose the " middle ground . "
By only providing the choices that gun control reduces crime somewhere between " a lot " to " not at all , " the middle ground becomes " a little . "
Second , when the possibility that gun control could cause crime is removed from polls , this affects the terms of national debate .
When people who hold this view never even hear their opinions mentioned in polls and news stories , they begin to think no one else shares their view .
Repeated surveys that imply gun control either makes society better or has no impact gradually acculturate Americans to accepting the view that is constantly presented .
There are other subtle biases in the construction of these surveys .
When a survey questions whether gun control will be " very important " for the respondent at the voting booth , the media often hear a " yes " answer as evidence that the person wants more gun control .
Rarely do they consider that someone might regard a politician ’s position on gun control as important because he or she opposes it .
This same blurring of opposite positions in one question causes gun control to be ranked more highly as an election issue than it should be .
Polls typically compare issues such as " increased defense spending " ( which captures supporters on just one side of the issue ) with questions on " gun control " ( where both anti- and pro-control partisans say the issue is important , yet believe entirely different things ) .
A final area strongly affected by the media ’s anti-gun bias is that of accidental shootings .
When it comes to this , reporters are eager to write about guns .
Many have seen the public service ads showing the voices or pictures of children between the ages of four and eight , implying that there is an epidemic of accidental deaths of these young children .
Data
I have collected show that accidental shooters over - whelmingly are adults with long histories of arrests for violent crimes , alcoholism , suspended or revoked drivers licenses , and involvement in car crashes .
Meanwhile , the annual number of accidental gun deaths involving children under ten — most of these being cases where someone older shoots the child — is consistently a single digit number .
It is a kind of media archetype story , to report on " naturally curious " children shooting themselves or other children — though from 1995 to 1999 the entire United States saw only between five and nine cases a year where a child under ten either accidentally shot themselves or another child .
The danger of children stumbling across guns pales in comparison to many other risks .
Over 1,260 children under ten died in cars in 1999 .
Another 370 died as pedestrians hit by cars .
Accidents involving residential fires took 484 children ’s lives .
Bicycles are much more likely to result in accidental deaths than guns .
Fully 93 children under the age of ten drowned accidentally in bathtubs .
Thirty - six children under five drowned in buckets during 1998 .
In fact , the number of children under ten who die from any type of accidental gunshot is smaller than the number of toddlers who drown in buckets .
Yet few reporters crusade against buckets or bathtubs .
When crimes are committed with guns , there is a somewhat natural inclination toward eliminating all guns .
While understandable , this reaction actually endangers people ’s lives because it ignores how important guns are in protecting people from harm .
Unbalanced media coverage exaggerates this , leaving most Americans with a glaringly incomplete picture of the dangers and benefits of firearms .
This is how the media bias against guns hurts society , and costs lives .

Rather than spreading out evenly across all the oceans , water from melted Antarctic ice sheets will gather around North America and the Indian Ocean .
That ’s bad news for the US East Coast , which could bear the brunt of one of these oceanic bulges .
Many previous models of the rising sea levels due to climate change assumed that water from melted ice sheets and glaciers would simply run into the oceans and fill them uniformly .
These models predict a 5 - metre rise in sea levels if the West Antarctic ice sheet melts , but fail to acknowledge three important factors .
First , Jerry Mitrovica and colleagues from the University of Toronto in Canada considered the gravitational attraction of the Antarctic ice sheets on the surrounding water , which pulls it towards the South Pole .
As the ice sheet melts , this bulge of water dissipates into surrounding oceans along with the meltwater .
So while the sea level near Antarctica will fall , sea levels away from the South Pole will rise .

Once the ice melts , the release of pressure could also cause the Antarctic continent to rise by 100 metres .
And as the weight of the ice pressing down on the continental shelf is released , the rock will spring back , displacing seawater that will also spread across the oceans .
Redistributing this mass of water could even change the axis of the Earth ’s spin .
The team estimates that the South Pole will shift by 500 metres towards the west of Antarctica , and the North Pole will shift in the opposite direction .
Since the spin of the Earth creates bulges of oceanic water in the regions between the equator and the poles , these bulges will also shift slightly with the changing axis .
Washington awash
The upshot is that the North American continent and the Indian Ocean will experience the greatest changes in sea level – adding 1 or 2 metres to the current estimates .
Washington DC sits squarely in this area , meaning it could face a 6.3 - metre sea level rise in total .
California will also be in the target zone .
“ Policy - makers must realise that the effects could be greater or smaller in different areas , ” says team member Natalya Gomez .
The team have so far only considered one ice sheet , so the effects of other ice sheets across the world could also have a similar impact , she says .
However , these models assume that all the West Antarctic sea ice will melt , but Peter Convey from the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge points out this may not necessarily be the case .
“ It would be dangerously easy to get people to focus on the 6 - metre figure , but it just might not happen like that , ” he says .
Jonathan Gregory from the University of Reading in the UK , who is part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , however , thinks the work should be helpful once this has been reliably evaluated .

In no way should we take the actions of the Bush administration as an attempt to silence a brilliant man who is trying to save humanity for the purpose of making more money selling coal and oil … no nothing to see here people .
OH WAIT !
Yes we should !
In your face Bush Administration !
James Hansen does n’t give a shit about you trying to silence him anymore .
Frankly this is year too late .
Parhelic Circle over the Dead Sea imaged by Koby Harati ( imaged by Koby Harati ( Photography site ) on March 7 , 2007 .
The camera is pointing straight upwards .
The white parhelic circle passes through the sun and circles around sky , everywhere at the same altitude .
The coloured halos at top right are fragments of a 22 degree halo , circumscribed arc and , on the parhelic circle , two sundogs .
Had the sun been any higher the sundogs would not have formed .

The parhelic circle is a white band circling the sky and always at the same height above the horizon as the sun .
Most of the time only fragments are seen , usually extending from sundogs in the directions away from the sun .
When you see these long tails it is worth checking carefully all around the sky because the colourless parhelic circle can at first be difficult to distinguish from cloud .
Millions of ice crystals with their vertical faces each mirroring the sun around the sky form the circle .
The GOP ’s use of abortion as a wedge issue hurt them more than it helped them in the November election .
I believe Barack Obama would have won anyway .
But I also believe that had John McCain chosen Joe Liberman or Tom Ridge — both pro-choice — as a running mate instead of Sarah Palin , the vote among Independents would have been a lot closer .
Given what looks to me to be a clear reality , what will Republicans do ?
What will Democrats do ?
Digby says the White House issued this statement today ( I ca n’t find it elsewhere ) :
“ On the 36th anniversary of Roe v. Wade , we are reminded that this decision not only protects womenâ€™s health and reproductive freedom , but stands for a broader principle : that government should not intrude on our most private family matters .
I remain committed to protecting a womanâ€™s right to choose .
“ While this is a sensitive and often divisive issue , no matter what our views , we are united in our determination to prevent unintended pregnancies , reduce the need for abortion , and support women and families in the choices they make .
To accomplish these goals , we must work to find common ground to expand access to affordable contraception , accurate health information , and preventative services .
“ On this anniversary , we must also recommit ourselves more broadly to ensuring that our daughters have the same rights and opportunities as our sons : the chance to attain a world - class education ; to have fulfilling careers in any industry ; to be treated fairly and paid equally for their work ; and to have no limits on their dreams .
That is what I want for women everywhere . ”
This sounds good to me .
Even so , there is some twitchiness on the Left that talk about reducing the number of abortions is somehow going to lead to making concessions to the anti-reproductive rights crowd .
In the same post linked above , Digby writes ,
But , as you all know , I mistrust all this “ common ground ” business .
So far , it ’s perfectly fine .
We have always been for access to contraception , comprehensive reproductive health care and education and help for expectant mothers .
Let ’s hear it for the progressive agenda being considered “ common ground . ”
But , I am curious as to what the people who believe abortion is murder think they are getting out of this .
We know that many of them do not believe in birth control and the last thing they want is to educate people in anything but abstinence .
Yet they have supposedly signed on to this common ground concept , so they must feel they have made serious concessions .
What do they want in return ?
I had n’t heard the anti-reproductive rights crowd had “ signed on ” to anything .
I sniffed around , and apparently some religious policy wonks in Washington came up with some “ third way ” manifesto that is being pushed as the “ common ground ” on which pro- and anti-reproductive rights people are supposed to meet .
As Fred Clarkson says , what ’s being left out of the “ common ground ” is a clear support for a woman ’s unfettered right to elective abortion , at least until the late second trimester .
Thus , “ abortion reduction ” is being taken as a code for “ abortion restriction . ”
A few points : First , it ’s important for everyone to understand that the hard core of the anti-reproductive rights movement has n’t “ signed on ” to anything .
This third - way , common ground business is being promoted by what Fred C. calls the Religion Industrial Complex — “ that sprawling array of political manufacturers and journalistic conveyor belts that deliver their products to market from Inside the Beltway . ”
This RIC is made up of people like Jim Wallis and Amy Sullivan , who have promoted themselves to media as spokespersons of some vast and reasonable moderate religion movement but who in fact are n’t speaking for anyone but themselves and their careers .
I know a great many genuinely religious progressives ( including Fred Clarkson , who is very nice ) , and they are as fond of Wallis as they are of heartburn .
So , basically , no one is behind the common ground manifesto except the people who wrote it .
But news media have n’t caught on to that yet , and probably a lot of politicians have n’t , either .
The anti-reproductive rights movement never will compromise , because they are fanatics .
There have been several times since the Roe v.
Wade decision in which some do - gooders attempted some kind of “ common ground ” approach , in which the emphasis would shift from banning abortion to reducing the rate of abortion through various programs .
It seems like such a fresh , original idea every time someone thinks of it .
These attempts are always futile , because anti-reproductive rights people cannot be reasoned with and will not budge from their extremist positions .
( And see ?
I ’m even being nice and not calling them “ Fetus People . ” )
In another article , Fred quotes the Rev. Anne C. Fowler :
“ … the moral reality of womenâ€™s lives is that sometimes abortion is the best moral choice . ” … â€What is missing from this document , â€  she continued , â€ œis recognition of the sacredness of all life , and a moral tradition that allows us to weigh relative values , of potential life versus a lived life in its full spiritual complexity .â€ 
I can already see the religious absolutists latching on to that word “ relative . ”
They cannot abide “ relative . ”
In their world , everything is either absolutely right or absolutely wrong ; absolutely good or absolutely evil .
But the real world is n’t like that , nor are all systems of morality based on absolutes .
Fred continues ,
The idea that abortion is sometimes the best moral choice is the view of many major religious institutions representing tens of millions of American Christians , Jews , Unitarians , and others .
Many of these institutions are represented in the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice ( RCRC ) , including major mainline Protestant denominations ( such as the Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ ) , the major bodies of American Judaism , and such organizations as the YWCA .
As I believe I ’ve already written , Buddhism generally discourages abortion but considers imposing moral absolutes on people to be worse .
I agree with the Rev. Fowlers that it must be said that sometimes abortion is the best moral choice .
I think most people understand that , even if they cannot articulate why it is true .
However , I do n’t think that talking about reducing the rate of abortion is necessarily a bad thing or always a code word for “ selling out women ’s rights . ”
If we really did “ expand access to affordable contraception , accurate health information , and preventative services ” it would almost certainly reduce the rate of abortions .
And I do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with saying that .

Jiddu Krishnamurti 1895 -1986
Jiddu Krishnamurti ( 1895 -1986 ) was a philosopher , writer and international lecturer .
Krishnamurti said : " I maintain that Truth is a pathless land , and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever , by any religion , by any sect . "
He was free from conditioning influences of the different systems of philosophy , religious dogmatism , political ideology , intellectual speculation and cultural bias .
When man becomes aware of the movement of his own thoughts he will see the division between the thinker and the thought ... the observer and the observed
Jiddu Krishnamurti was born on May 12 , 1895 about 250 km north of Madras ( Chennai ) India .
Krishnamurti was raised within the Theosophical Society to become an incarnation of Maitreya , the messianic Buddha .
In 1929 Jiddu Krishnamurti , tapped to be the messianic " World Teacher " , shocked the Theosophy movement by dissolving the Order of the Star , the organisation established to support him and began to emerge as one of the 20th century 's most iconoclastic and influential teachers .
He repudiated not only all connections with organized religions and ideology , but denied his own spiritual authority as well .
Travelling constantly , he also rejected ties to any country , nationality or culture .
Although he wrote and lectured widely , he accepted no fees for his talks , nor royalties on his books and recordings .
His aim was to set humanity free .
He maintained that the individual is freed by becoming aware of their own psychological conditioning , and that this awakening will enable them to give love to another .

More than print , TV or any other medium , online journalists are now the most - jailed category of journalists worldwide .
A study by the Committee to Protect Journalists said that the online reporters , editors and bloggers make up 45 % of the 125 journalists it found behind bars , the first time the Web category has eclipsed print ( 42 % ) since the study began in 1997 .
CPJ director Joel Simon observed that without organizational support , online journalists are easier targets .
" The image of the solitary blogger working at home in pajamas may be appealing , but when the knock comes on the door , they are alone and vulnerable , " Simon said in a news release .
The study notes that in China , which leads the world in captive journalists , 24 of the 28 currently behind bars did their work online .
Cuba , Burma , Eritrea , and Uzbekistan round out the top five countries on the list of journo jailers .

In copyright lawsuit , McCain claims he was n't aware RNC ad ' existed ' John Byrne
Published : Tuesday February 24 , 2009
Print This Email
This " My friends , I did n't do it .
I did n't even know it was going on . "
That 's the line former Republican presidential nominee and Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) is taking in a federal lawsuit that claims he violated the copyright of Jackson Browne 's 1977 hit song , " Running on Empty , " when it aired in one of his presidential campaign commercials .
A federal judge allowed the suit to move forward Friday .
" I was not involved at all in any way in the writing , creation , production , distribution or dissemination of the video , nor do I have any knowledge whatsoever of how this video was written , created , produced or disseminated or who was involved in any aspect of the writing , creation , production , distribution or dissemination of the video , " McCain said in a statement acquired by Wired 's David Kravets .
" I was completely unaware that this video even existed until I was informed of it after this lawsuit was filed . "
McCain claims the Republican Party is solely responsible for his campaign ad , not him , and has asked that he be stripped from the case .
The federal judge handling the case disagreed .
Judge Gary Klausner said McCain and the GOP have an " agency relationship , " meaning that " once an agency relationship is established , the principal is liable for the acts of her agent , even if the principal does not expressly authorize or instruct her agent to take any action . "
He also questioned how using 20 seconds of the song in a TV ad constituted fair use , as the RNC claims .
Brownes attorney , Lawrence Y. Iser , said last August he believes McCain knew of the ad and should be held responsible .
 We have sued the Ohio Republican Party as well , and we have been informed and believe that McCain and his campaign were well aware of the ad ,  he told a reporter last August , adding that the litigation was not politically motivated .
It s a copyright infringement lawsuit , pure and simple , but the fact that Sen.
McCain has used this song in a hit - piece on Barack Obama is anathema to Jackson . 
Browne says the ad also falsely implies his support for McCain .
" Nothing could be farther from the truth , " he 's remarked .
In the song , Browne croons , " Honey you really tempt me / You know the way you look so kind / Id love to stick around but I m running behind / You know I dont even know what I m hoping to find / Running into the sun but I m running behind . "
Running behind , indeed .

Obama ’s record - setting stimulus plan is getting such astonishingly quick treatment from House Democrats that officials say it could go from draft to final passage in one week .
| POLITICO Staff House plans to fast - track Obama plan
President - elect Barack Obama ’s record - setting stimulus plan — the biggest special spending bill in history — is getting such astonishingly quick treatment from House Democrats that officials say it could go from draft to final passage in one week .
The bill has no text or details yet , but it does have a name : Obama revealed Saturday in his YouTube / radio address that it will be called the “ American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan . ”

When asked about the title , Frank Luntz , a Republican consultant who wrote a treatise on political linguistics called “ Words That Work , ” told Politico : “ Obama 's team are the best linguists I 've ever seen .
Republicans are n't in his league right now . "
“ Recovery says putting the country back on track , and reinvestment is the next step up from investment , ” Luntz explained .
The 111th Congress begins Tuesday with the swearing - in of new members .
The stimulus plan — with a price tag of up to $ 850 billion — is likely to be ready for a vote the following week , officials said .
No draft or outline or outline was circulating this weekend , but House Democratic officials said they hope to have one by early next week .
“ We are hoping for a House vote on Week 2 ( week of Jan. 12 ) , ” a House official said .
“ It could slip if we decide to hold regular approps hearings .
But I think a vote is likely the week of Jan. 12 . ”
Republicans are suggesting that ’s too hasty .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) issued a statement Friday headlined , “ Protect the Taxpayer Against the Rush to Spend Their Money . ”
“ Every dollar needs to be spent wisely and not wasted in the rush to get it spent , ” McConnell said .
And House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) said in a statement that he was concerned the legislation would get “ little debate or public scrutiny . ”
“ Congress should have public hearings in the appropriate committees , ” Boehner said .
House Ways and Means Committee staff members worked through the holidays to prepare a framework and options .
And the president - elect will travel to Capitol Hill on Monday to tell leaders what he wants included in the bill .
Obama aides want a starting point of $ 675 billion to $ 775 billion over two years , but say they recognize it could grow to $ 850 billion as legislators add goodies .
Obama aides want to keep it under $ 1 trillion , although some lawmakers think the final bill could be nearing that psychological barrier .
Obama aides have said they want to get 80 votes in the Senate to demonstrate bipartisan support and so that Democrats alone cannot be blamed for the breathtaking spending .
In Obama ’s address on Saturday , he said the No. 1 goal of his plan “ is to create 3 million new jobs , more than 80 percent of them in the private sector . "
Theoretically , that could mean 600,000 new government jobs .
But aides say that probably a lot more than 80 percent of the new jobs would be in private industry .
And a lot of the government jobs would be state and local workers whom the plan saves from layoffs .
In the past , Obama has said his goal was to “ save or create ” 3 million jobs over two years .
Aides say today ’s formulation is no change in policy .
They just assume everyone understands by now .

It took four years for Google to address the " Google bomb " that was lobbed at former President Bush .
But it took the Internet behemoth only a few days to defuse the same attack on President Obama .
Four years versus a few days ... Some Googlers are asking why .
In 2003 , President Bush 's detractors successfully gamed the Google search engine by arranging to have countless Web sites link the words " miserable failure " to Bush 's official biography on the White House Web site .
The result was that when someone typed the search term " miserable failure " into the Google search box , Bush 's bio rose to the top of the search results .
And that 's how it stayed until 2007 , when Google developed an algorithm to detect what became known as " Google bombs " and re-directed the term " miserable failure " to non-political pages .
People may be unaware that the top leadership of the LDS church has made banning gay couples from having any legal rights in California a supreme issue , part of a determined political campaign of unprecedented ferocity and organization .
In California , this letter was sent to every congregation in California with direct instructions that it be read last June .
Money quote :
The Church ’s teachings and position on this moral issue are unequivocal .
Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God , and the formation of families is central to the Creator ’s plan for His children ...
Local Church leaders will provide information about how you may become involved in this important cause .
We ask that you do all you can to support the proposed constitutional amendment by donating of your means and time to assure that marriage in California is legally defined as being between a man and a woman .
Mormon church leaders put out a broadcast across the country earlier this month insisting that Mormons contribute to and support Proposition 8 .
The broadcast featured two Elders from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles :
BYU students from California listened in Provo stake centers on Wednesday , as LDS Church leaders led a broadcast regarding the church 's support of Proposition 8 ...
" You do n't expect the church to get behind things like this , " said Chelsea Martinez , 20 , a statistics major from Gonzales , Calif. , who viewed the broadcast at a local stake center .
Similar to other students attending the broadcast , Martinez 's parents have participated in the church 's effort by going door - to - door to identify voter preferences and are working to persuade undecided voters to help pass Proposition 8 .
The LDS Church , from its very top , is waging war on the civil rights of gay Americans and gay Californians .
If you want to do something to resist the organization behind 77 percent of the funding of this Proposition , you can donate to the fight for civil equality here .
I might add that if gay Californians actually cared about this as much as straight Mormons appear to , the race would not be close .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

( CNN ) -- American TV viewers have four extra months to get ready for the day their local stations shut down their analog transmitters , thanks to a delay in the digital TV transition approved by Congress Wednesday .
The government 's fund to give people $ 40 coupons to help buy converters ran out of money in recent weeks .
The House , by a vote of 264 to 158 , passed a Senate bill that would reset the death of analog TV to June 12 , a measure President Barack Obama is expected to sign .
An estimated 6.5 million homes -- including many elderly , poor and disabled Americans -- would lose TV service after February 17 without the delay , supporters argued .
People who pay for cable or satellite TV service will be unaffected by the change .
The delay was opposed by Republicans who said the government has already given people years to prepare for the switch to digital TV .
" If you do n't know this date is coming up , you 're probably not watching television , " said Rep. Roy Blunt , a Missouri Republican .
" And if you 're not watching television , you probably wo n't know on February 18 whether it occurred or not . "
The Commerce Department ran out of money last month for its program to help people pay for converter boxes needed to make older TVs receive the new digital signals .
There are 3.7 million homes on the waiting list for the $ 40 coupons , said Rep. Rick Boucher , a Virginia Democrat .
" It 's clear that the only way to avoid a massive disruption affecting 5.7 percent of the TV viewing public is to delay the transition and provide the funding to assure that , when it occurs , it occurs smoothly , " he said .
Federal Communication Commission acting Chairman Michael Copps said the delay gives the government " an opportunity to do it better . "
" The additional four months provided by the law affords urgently needed time for a more phased transition , including a consumer - friendly converter box coupon program , stepped - up consumer outreach and support -- particularly for vulnerable populations -- and dealing with coverage , antenna and reception issues that went too long unaddressed , " Copps said .
He had sent a letter to Congress last month " to express our deep concern " that the FCC was " nowhere near " ready for the deadline " to pull the plug on television service in millions of American homes . "
The Federal government raked in $ 20 billion by selling licenses for the frequencies being vacated by local television stations for other commercial uses .
Some of the frequencies were also reserved for emergency agencies to use for communications .
Republicans said the delay would prevent some emergency agencies from using their new communications systems .
Rep. Anthony Weiner , a Democrat from New York , said having a working TV is also important for the safety of those with older sets .
" They are going to lose the most important connection to the outside world and emergency response -- the television , " he said .
Opponents noted the new date for the end of analog TV will come just as the hurricane season begins .
Forcing conversion in February would be safer , they said .
All local stations will eventually pull the plug on the analog transmitters they 've used since the invention of television .
The stations have begun digital broadcasts over the past several years .

Obama oversold bipartisanship , Frank says
Barney Frank offers a blunt assessment of President Barack Obama 's performance during the stimulus fight -- saying the rookie chief executive provoked a " partisan reaction " by over - promising to deliver Republican support for the bill .
" I do n't think he should have set the expectation he was going to get Republican votes , " the Financial Services chairman told Politico right before the vote on Friday .
" He set himself a high bar -- and an irrelevant bar .. and he did n't achieve it , " the Massachusetts Democrat added .
" He should not have legitimized [ the notion of bipartisanship ] , that prompted their partisan reaction ...
I do n't think he 's going to make that mistake again . "
Frank , who is close to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , added that the sharp partisan division in the House -- exemplified by the lack of a single GOP " yes " on either stimulus vote -- was n't necessarily a bad thing .
" I want lines drawn ! " he said .
" There are real ideological differences here . "

Where do you rank on the entrepreneurial scale of 1 to 10 ?
Find out .
If you are trying to finance your startup in today 's depressed economy , I feel your pain .
It 's tough out there .
Even the Venture Capitalists are seeing their money supply reduced dramatically .
Angel investors are n't as liquid as they used to be .
With all the cash taps basically shut off where do you find startup capital for your business ?
As the economic news becomes bleaker by the day and the word " depression " no longer feels like hyperbole , it 's time for entrepreneurs to hunker down and become very realistic about how they will finance their startups .
The days of writing a business plan , traipsing into an investor 's office , and dropping off a copy are over .
Indeed here at the opening of 2009 , we are in a situation which is the exact opposite of 1999 when there was loads of capital available to fund even the silliest of ideas .
Back then it seemed as if at least half the workforce was walking around with a stack of business plans under their arms knocking on venture capital firms ' doors .
Well , not anymore .
Only the tough and financially savvy will be able to cobble together the financing that their startups need to launch and survive in this economy .
This is not an economy for wannabes .
With this reality in mind , I am starting up a new newsletter which will cover startup financing lessons for a depression or deep recession .

The younger Mr. Black denies being a white supremacist .
“ I am a white person who is concerned about discrimination against white people , ” he said in an interview at a local Starbucks .
And yet , Mr. Black , speaking softly , wearing a black leather hat , boots and a sports coat a size too big , could not identify a single ideological difference with his father or the K.K.K. ; nor could he bring himself to agree with the tenet that all men , regardless of race , are equal .
Last month , at a “ Euro - American ” conference in Tennessee organized by David Duke , one of the nation ’s best - known white supremacists , Mr. Black gave a speech comparing his campaign to George C. Wallace ’s resistance to desegregation in the 1960s .
In an audio recording posted online , Mr. Black can be heard telling the crowd that he sees local Republican politics , “ especially with the election of Obama , as the way white people will have to respond . ”
“ We can infiltrate , ” he said , adding , “ We could politically take the country back . ”
Deborah Lauter , director of the civil rights division of the Anti-Defamation League , said that only a handful of other white extremists had tried ( and mostly failed ) in the last few years to join mainstream politics .
She described them as “ stealth candidates , ” and Mr. Black acknowledged that his racial views were not a prominent part of his campaign .
In fact , Republican leaders here say they had never heard of him , or his family , until reporters from The Palm Beach Post told them he had won one of the party ’s 111 seats in the Aug. 26 election .
Then the game changed .
Mr. Duke , who was once married to Mr. Black ’s mother , Chloe Hardin Black , appeared in West Palm Beach this month to broadcast a radio show describing Mr. Black as a victim of discrimination .

As Microsoft keeps working on the development of Windows 7 , I am starting to hear all sorts of reviews and feedback .
Most people that tried it are happy with the OS , I wo n’t deny that .
But then another day I came across an article on The Inquirer titled Windows 7 is enough to kill Linux on the desktop .
I did n’t want to be a basher , so I took the time to read it despite getting annoyed by the title .
So what are the arguments of the author ?
Basically he says that Windows 7 is somewhat stable , has some nice graphics , and also runs fine with open source applications .
Then , and do n’t ask me how on Earth , the guy concludes that given those factors , user friendly Linux distributions like Ubuntu wo n’t be worthwhile anymore .
Say what ?
I do believe that Windows 7 will be an improvement for Microsft .
After all they are launching an OS after Vista , so it is not like it would be too hard to achieve that …
Regardless , I do n’t see Windows 7 removing the main two advantages that Linux has over Windows , even if you consider desktop users .
One : Linux is open source , and therefore free and supported by the community
Two : Linux is one of the most secure desktop operating systems out there
If you then consider the fact that with each new release most Linux distros are also getting very user friendly and graphically appealing , well , I do n’t see how Windows 7 is going to hurt it .
Now I am not arguing that Linux on desktop is mainstream , or that it will become anytime soon .
But you ca n’t deny that is does have its market , and its market share ( albeit small ) has been growing steadily .
I wonder why that guy has not checked the numbers , in fact .
The W3Counter reports that in May 2007 1,26 % of the Internet users from around the world were using Linux as their OS .
In December 2008 this number is up to 2,13 % , with a growth of almost 70 % .
The overall number might not seem big , but Apple ’s OS X is not far away , with 5,24 % of market share .
If anything , therefore , Linux is growing steadily , and I do n’t think Windows 7 will change this pattern .
I see from my friend Sheryl Canter 's blog that the print edition of PC Magazine is being euthanized .
I 'm not sure I would have noticed otherwise .
In January 1984 I sent PC Magazine an unsolicited article about the new DOS command PROMPT and the neat things you could do with it .
They sent me a check for $ 600 .
It was the first time I was paid for my writing .
Several months later I got a call from John Dickinson .
He had been hired by the magazine to put together an issue reviewing every printer available for the PC .
They needed writers who lived in the New York City area to come into the PC Magazine offices and review printers .
That was lots of fun and I met all the editors and other writers .
One day I showed John some assembly language programs I had written for the PC and he steered me into Paul Somerson 's office .
At that time , both programmers and regular users read PC Magazine , and the “ back of the book ” ( Somerson 's bailiwick ) had a bunch of columns for programmers .
I started writing little assembly language programs for the magazine as well as hardware and software reviews .
I had a “ real ” job at New York Life Insurance Company , so I would often take vacation days to go into the PC Magazine offices .
( New York City 's a small town :
The two offices were only about 500 yards apart . )
By June 1985 I had used up all my New York Life vacation days that were supposed to last through the following March .
This did n't bother me too much because I was making enough money writing for PC Magazine to quit that job and write full time , which I 've been doing ever since except for some consulting work this year to compensate for a ( ahem ) temporary slump in book sales .
For two years I did the PC Tutor column , which answered reader 's technical questions .
( One question got me thinking about writing a book that later became Code : The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software . )
Then for 8 years or so I did a column called Environments , about OS / 2 and Windows programming .
I never counted the number of articles and columns I wrote for PC Magazine , but considering that it was published 22 times a year ( unbelievable now ) and I had at least one article in almost every issue for 10 years , I usually just say I wrote " hundreds " of articles for the magazine .
The glory days of PC Magazine were under the editorship of Bill Machrone .
I thought then — and I still think now — that Bill Machrone was one of the true geniuses of magazine publishing .
He was able to make that magazine target a sweet spot of comprehensiveness and integrity .
Bill Machrone 's PC Magazine was required reading .
That Bill does n't even have a Wikipedia article is a gross injustice and characteristic of the short memories of this industry .
My last work for PC Magazine ( ending in 2002 ) were some utilities for Windows .
But I always thought the little free utilities we wrote for the magazine were primarily for pedagogical purposes .
The magazine instead used them for promotions and eventually began charging money for them .
Yuck !
So I guess PC Magazine and I parted out of creative differences .
By that time I had n't actually read the magazine for many years , and I guess I was n't the only one .
From CNN Supervising Producer Adam Levine
President - elect Obama ’s campaign speeches often mentioned reducing the influence of lobbyists and special interests on the federal government .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) — President - elect Barack Obama , who campaigned on lessening the influence of lobbyists in government , has chosen a defense expert who is currently a vice president and lobbyist for one of the country ’s biggest defense contractors to be his deputy secretary of defense .
Obama ’s transition office announced that William Lynn , an undersecretary of defense in President Bill Clinton ’s second term , is nominated to Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’ deputy .
Lynn is currently a senior vice president at Raytheon , which has billions of dollars in Defense Department contracts and is the maker of the Army ’s Patriot Missile system and the Tomahawk missile used by the Navy .
The company is also developing a global positioning satellite communication system with the Air Force .
As deputy secretary , Lynn would be involved in the process of budgeting and acquisitions , in addition to running the day - to - day operations of the Defense Department .
Obama ’s transition office acknowledged that appointing a lobbyist did not , on the face of it , seem in line with the president - elect ’s ethics stance but that Lynn ’s qualifications and the recommendations that came from both Republicans and Democrats made him the top candidate .
“ Because Mr. Lynn came so highly recommended from experts across the political spectrum , the president - elect felt it was critical that he fill this position , ” said Obama transition spokesman Tommy Vietor .
Vietor said Lynn and the transition team would create guidelines that would fit the ethics standards of the new administration .
“ We are aware that Mr. Lynn lobbied for Raytheon and are working with Mr. Lynn to craft a role for him that is consistent with the president - elect ’s high standards while balancing the need to fill this critical national security position , ” Vietor said .
During the campaign , candidate Obama took a hard stance against the influence of lobbyists in Washington .
His campaign
Web site included a promise that “ no political appointees in an Obama - Biden administration will be permitted to work on regulations or contracts directly and substantially related to their prior employer for two years . ”
Creating that distance could be difficult given that Gates , who was appointed by President Bush , is making cutting the Pentagon budget a priority and Lynn would be involved at some level .
The announcement noted that Lynn ’s experience both in the public and private sector means he can make “ the tough choices necessary to ensure that American tax dollars are spent wisely . ”
Lynn ’s supporters , including Sen. Jack Reed , R - Rhode Island , and Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Massachusetts — whom Lynn worked for on Capital Hill — said in statements that Lynn ’s experience both in public and private sector make him a strong candidate .
“ He ’s a proven leader in both the public and private sectors of the national security community and his previous service in the Department uniquely qualify him to help the Department run more efficiently and effectively , ” said Kennedy .
The transition office also announced other Defense Department nominations , including former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Robert Hale for undersecretary of defense and Michele Flournoy , who was part of Obama ’s Pentagon transition team , for the undersecretary devoted to policy .
Gates interviewed Lynn and the other appointments , according to the Pentagon
spokesman .
“ He interviewed each of them , came away impressed with their personal character and professional credentials , and recommended the president - elect hire them , ” said spokesman Geoff Morrell .

Scientists have already hooked brains directly to computers by means of metal electrodes , in the hope of both measuring what goes on inside the brain and eventually healing conditions such as blindness or epilepsy .
In the future , the interface between brain and artificial system might be based on nerve cells grown for that purpose .
In research that was recently featured on the cover of Nature Physics , Prof. Elisha Moses of the Physics of Complex Systems Department and his former research students Drs. Ofer Feinerman and Assaf Rotem have taken the first step in this direction by creating circuits and logic gates made of live nerves grown in the lab .
When neurons – brain nerve cells – are grown in culture , they do n’t form complex ‘ thinking ’ networks .
Moses , Feinerman and Rotem wondered whether the physical structure of the nerve network could be designed to be more brain - like .
To simplify things , they grew a model nerve network in one dimension only – by getting the neurons to grow along a groove etched in a glass plate .
The scientists found they could stimulate these nerve cells using a magnetic field ( as opposed to other systems of lab - grown neurons that only react to electricity ) .
Experimenting further with the linear set - up , the group found that varying the width of the neuron stripe affected how well it would send signals .
Nerve cells in the brain are connected to great numbers of other cells through their axons ( long , thin extensions ) , and they must receive a minimum number of incoming signals before they fire one off in response .
The researchers identified a threshold thickness , one that allowed the development of around 100 axons .
Below this number , the chance of a response was iffy , while just a few over this number greatly raised the chance a signal would be passed on .
The scientists then took two thin stripes of around 100 axons each and created a logic gate similar to one in an electronic computer .
Both of these ‘ wires ’ were connected to a small number of nerve cells .
When the cells received a signal along just one of the ‘ wires , ’ the outcome was uncertain ; but a signal sent along both ‘ wires ’ simultaneously was assured of a response .
This type of structure is known as an AND gate .
The next structure the team created was slightly more complex : Triangles fashioned from the neuron stripes were lined up in a row , point to rib , in a way that forced the axons to develop and send signals in one direction only .
Several of these segmented shapes were then attached together in a loop to create a closed circuit .
The regular relay of nerve signals around the circuit turned it into a sort of biological clock or pacemaker .
Moses said , ‘ We have been able to enforce simplicity on an inherently complicated system .
Now we can ask , ‘ What do nerve cells grown in culture require in order to be able to carry out complex calculations ? ’
As we find answers , we get closer to understanding the conditions needed for creating a synthetic , many - neuron ‘ thinking ’ apparatus . ’
President Bush on Tuesday declared the District a federal emergency area , clearing the way for the city to receive federal money to help cover the overwhelming cost of providing security for official inauguration events .
Officials said it was the first time the designation had ever been used for anything other than a national disaster , such as a hurricane or widespread flooding .
More than 100 police agencies from across the country already have been mobilized to help provide security for the Jan. 20 presidential swearing - in of Barack Obama , which is expected to attract 1 million to 2 million people to the District .
Authorities will essentially seal off the downtown and prevent motorists from entering the city from Virginia .
“ An emergency exists in the District , ” White House press secretary Dana Perino announced .
White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said Tuesday night that D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty had requested the declaration of the city as an emergency zone last week .
Preliminary planning for the inauguration had not taken into account the likelihood of unprecedented crowds , now expected to run as high as 1.5 million to 2 million people , Mr. Stanzel said .
“ Because of this anticipated influx of people , declaring an emergency permits the federal government to provide additional requested support … to ensure that the inauguration is not only safe and secure , but that the health and well - being of visitors is preserved , ” he said .
D.C. officials have said since November that their only guaranteed money is the annual federal appropriation of $ 15 million - about $ 2.3 million less than they spent on security for President Bush ’s relatively small second inauguration in 2005 .
“ We really just do n’t know how much we ’re going to have to spend , ” Mafara Hobson , spokeswoman for Mr. Fenty , said at the time .
“ All we have right now is the $ 15 million the federal government allows us . ”
Mr. Fenty has said the event will cost the city as much as $ 75 million .
Maryland officials expect state costs to be more than $ 12 million .
Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley , a Democrat , asked Congress last week for about $ 12 million to help with the costs .
The estimates include costs for emergency services and Maryland State Police personnel .
Hundreds of Maryland state workers will be assisting with work related to the inauguration .
Miss Hobson said the city made its request under the Stafford Act and that the Fenty administration was “ pleased the White House has supported our request … for federal support and reimbursement if needed . ”
The act , an amended version of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 , allows a president to declare a disaster , which triggers financial and physical assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
In addition to making available additional money , Mr. Bush ’s declaration authorizes FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security to provide emergency assistance from Jan. 17 to Jan. 21 .
FEMA officials said the declaration authorizes the agency to assist the District in emergency efforts “ to save lives and protect public health and safety . ”
Officials said the agency ’s role will be to respond to a natural disaster , act of terrorism or other man-made disaster .
White House officials said they would either pay for the needed services or reimburse the District for sums it spends beyond the $ 15 million appropriation .
The Secret Service , the lead agency for official inauguration events , is already on high alert for inauguration week , having declaring it a national security special event .
Inauguration Day 2005 attracted about 300,000 people and cost $ 17.3 million for security and public services .
Mayor Anthony A. Williams had to dip into the city ’s Homeland Security fund to cover all the costs that year .
The total cost of Mr. Bush ’s second inauguration was about $ 40 million , including concerts , dinners and balls that were financed by private donations .
The record attendance at any Inauguration Day attendance was that of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 , which attracted 1.2 million visitors to the District .
Much of the cost to the city will come from the Metropolitan Police Department , which will have all 4,000 officers on duty for most of the five days , much of that on overtime .
The department also has hired an additional 4,000 officers from more than 93 jurisdictions across the country .
The Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department , the National Guard , the U.S. Coast Guard and the Air Force are among those contributing to the security effort .
FEMA Administrator R. David Paulison named Donald L. Keldsen as the federal coordinator for the inauguration events .
The agency also activated its National Response Coordination Center and Regional Response Coordination Center for Region III and its East Coast National Incident Management Assistance Team .
The White House announcement came hours after Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan met in the District with Mr. Fenty , Mr. O’Malley and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine to finalize the preparations .
City officials reported a surge in registration for charter bus parking over the past week .
Mr. Fenty said more than 3,000 buses have registered .
The D.C. Department of Transportation has plans to put buses in such place as RFK Stadium and Nationals Park , but Mr. Fenty expressed concern about unregistered buses arriving in the District .
Initial plans called for buses to park at Metro lots , but these lots will now be available for car parking , said Karyn Le Blanc , DDOT spokeswoman .
Mr. Kaine defended the bridge closings , saying the move was essential to managing traffic .
“ If Virginia were to allow unimpeded access of personal and commercial vehicles on I -395 and I - 66 inbound , … we would experience massive gridlock on the roads , ” he said .
Even if the bridges were kept open , the parking situation for personal vehicles would be confusing , he said .
“ No one is being restricted from entering Washington , D.C. , or attending the inaugural events , ” Mr. Kaine said .
When asked if he would encourage people to come to the inauguration , Mr. Kaine said that “ if people want to come , they should come , but you just need to have a plan .
Do n’t wake up that day and say , ‘ By gosh , we want to come down . ’
It ’s just not going to work . ”
Mr. O’Malley asked area residents to be considerate of people who were traveling long distances .
“ On Inauguration Day , if there is any way you can avoid traveling on I - 495 , you would be doing all of your neighbors who are coming from around the country a tremendous service , ” he said .

Dear Reader ,
Thank you for your interest in my website .
I take great pride in developing quality content that appeals to readers with both a sense of Fiscal Conservatism — a leaner California government with lower taxes and less involvement– and a belief in Social Centrism — that every individual can do whatever they want as long as it does n’t affect the rights or wallet of anyone else .
Hopefully the same interest in California Politics that brought you to the site will inspire you to both comment on the site and to contribute your own work .
You will notice some changes coming to the site in the coming weeks .
My hope is to make it more than “ just a blog ” , but rather a community where users can exchange opinions .
Feel free to Register as a member and begin posting your own opinion on California public policy or comment on someone elses .
Feedback is always appreciated .
Thanks again for your interest in California Politics and The Policy Report .

Sly says : I wanted to hear more about their positions in general and not just about their special interests .
This time it worked in reverse , and revealed that many are against reining in Big Tech , especially Google .
Too many victims whose private information has been revealed through Google searches , have been financially destroyed .
My cousin can't get a normal day job because the search for his name in Google carries a 15 year old DUI record .
Businesses get harmed because a family member of the company has declared bankruptcy .
These search results last years and are a ball and chain around the ankle of their Google 's victims .
Google offers no way to clear an old record or any personal information appearing in the search results .
So the only option , for those who can afford it is to hire a takedown service to remove negative search results for a fee .
These services are expensive and their very existence is a sign that something is rotten at Google .
If the only way to remove harmful results is to pay a 3rd party , then only the wealthy can clean their results .
This is unfair and contributes to the inequality within our society .
Laws and policies should protect us .
But now the politicians see a way to hammer their rivals over whether or not to regulate Big Tech .
Good Policies , Please !

ThePolicyReport.net
Back when I was in college , I used facebook every now and then , maybe updating my profile once a week , and seeing what my friends were up to once every few weeks .
Afterall , I saw them just about every day , and really did n't need to be using Facebook to keep in touch with them .
This was back in the early days of Facebook where 95 % of your friends were from your college , and you had to write a letter to Mark Zuckerberg just to get a network for your college to be created .
Now , like most people , my friends list is compiled of virtually anyone I 've said " hello " to in my life time , and I check my Facebook every few seconds .
Mostly because these days I sit infront of a computer from 9 - 6 , and can steal some Facebook glances every now and then .
And with all this Facebooking , I 've started to notice two very obvious categories that all my friends fall within .
The political , and the apolitical .
As a quick clarifying , or a definition in terms , when I say apolitical , I do n't mean those who have no interest in politicals or world events .
Rather , I mean those who do not make their political leanings very clear on Facebook .
I myself , would fall into that very group .
While I love to engage in political debate , and do have my strong opinions , Facebook is not my forum for it .
Afterall , my bosses are my Facebook friends , and they too have apolitical accounts .
Now it 's not to say that there are n't the occasional debates I find myself in - currently , I 'm following and have thrown my cents into a large censorship debate - but I find myself avoiding any strong political convictions within these forums .
For me , Facebook is n't the place for politics , or a forum for advocacy .
It 's a place where all those things should be checked at the door for the simple fact that there are too many people with too many views who are all exposed to one another 's opinions - and things can easily get out of hand .
But then I have a large number of friends who fall deeply into the political group .
While I call them political , I do n't mean they wear their politics on their sleeves , but just about any issue they feel passionate about .
Whether it 's vegetarianism / veganism , advocating human / animal / environmental rights , campaigning for political groups and leaders , and even those who are members and advocate particular charitable foundations / scientific research / medical research .
And while I highly doubt anyone would be offended by someone joining a group related to curing cancer , I find myself more reluctant than I would be outside of Facebook , as I could foresee it opening the " opinion " door - which I 'm working hard to keep closed .
I 'm not sure if there 's a middle ground here ... from what I 've seen , people fall into either extreme , despite it 's evident absurdity .
Clearly , when you compare too extremes you can't claim one is better than the other , as they both are at beyond the point of ridicule .
And while I think Facebook should be apolitical , I 'm constantly feeling as though I 'm being goaded into debate from those friends which update their profile pictures to relate to the latest currently world issue , post articles , invite me to join groups ( some which I would join , and some which I would never join ) .
I 'd very much rather just use it as a tool to keep up with the very friends who are asking me to vote no on a particular issue - partly out of fear of offending other friends who would want me to vote yes , partly out of fear of offending current and prospective employers , and partly because I feel that if I were to engage in issues , I 'd be using Facebook even more than I do .
Those are my thoughts ... what are yours ?
When Iran successfully orbited its Omid satellite earlier this month , many in the U.S. responded with indifference .
David Albright , a noted analyst of nuclear proliferation , downplayed the Iranian space launcher as " not that sophisticated " and the satellite itself as " Sputnik technology , a little metal ball that goes ' beep beep beep . ' "
Unnamed U.S. officials concurred , stating that " There are no alarm bells ringing because of this launch , " calling the event " largely symbolic . "
But such equanimity is entirely unwarranted .
...
Many of you may know Kurt Wild from his work in such classics as My Brother ’s Hot Friend and Young , Dumb & Hung , but the St. Louis - based 22 - year old also made a living toiling at popular sandwich chain Subway .
That is , until Subway , which prides itself on its foot longs , found out about Wild ’s gay porn gigs . .
Writes Wild :
I just wanted to tell everyone that I was just fired from my work at subway because I have done gay porn .
A customer said they would n’t even eat there at subway anymore because of my past work and said that if I was n’t fired then they would boycott the store .
What I say is , if one person can try to ruin me everywhere I work … maybe I should take a stand and boycott their store too if they ca n’t let people ’s privacy be treated right .
I should have the right to work anywhere I can and it is n’t right or fair that people can keep me from working simply because of a “ gay ” issue .
If a girl did what we do it would probably be ok .. and if a guy does straight porn .. he is bragged about .
When I do gay porn , I feel a bit lynched for the rest of my life .
Alright , being fired from Subway is not the same as being lynched .
Regardless , we appreciate your boycott , but must say you ’re probably better off not slinging meat for strangers .

Its value is the accompanying chart ( below ) but the rest of it is , how can I politely phrase this ?

I find all the happy talk in the accompanying article nonsense .
Why ?
Three simple reasons :
1. Excess housing inventory is currently at or near historic levels .
2. The Housing Affordability Index is still very elevated .
( The index measures median household income relative to the income needed to purchase a median - priced house ) .
While it is off of its recent highs , it is still above its historic mean by significant amounts .
3. The House Price to Rental Ratio .
As the nearby chart shows , we are not remotely close to normalized levels yet .

It may be freezing here but it 's too warm for some polar bears :
Amazing pictures of the world 's most endangered creatures
By Mail Foreign Service
A formidable hunter and powerful swimmer , the polar bear is perfectly adapted to the harsh demands of the wild Arctic landscape .
And these extraordinary pictures give a more intimate portrait of its life than ever before .
Whether diving under water , rolling in the ice alongside a cub or moving in for a breathtaking close - up , these images capture its raw beauty and amazing grace .
Deep sea diver : Steven John Kazlowski spent five years photographing polar bears in the Arctic for his new book
The photographs were taken by Steven John Kazlowski , 39 , who has spent the last 16 years travelling to the Arctic to take pictures of the amazing wildlife in the region .
His new book ' The Last Polar Bear ' features images taken over the last five years which he hopes will highlight the animal ' plight .
Global warming is weakening the ice in the Arctic and shortening the season during which it is close enough to shore for bears to move easily between floes and the shore .
Up close and personal :
One bear gets a little to close for comfort ( above ) while another plays on the ice with a young cub ( below )
Many bears find themselves stranded either on land , where adequate prey is difficult to find , or on ice miles out at sea .
' The polar bears ' plight is a wake - up call , ' Mr Kazlowski said .
' The changes in the Arctic are just the start of the global climate changes we will see , and it's not too late for us to make some smart choices .
An adult bear frolics on the ice with a cub ( above ) while another is stalked by an Arctic fox ( below )
' My hopes are that people will understand that there is an environment as amazing as the one great buffalo herds once roamed across North America , and that it 's changing extremely rapidly because of the way we have chose to live as a society , and that we are all connected .
' The intelligence and social abilities of polar bears are quite something .
Photographer Steven J. Kazlowski who has spent the last 16 years travelling to the Arctic
' I have watched polar bears break holes in ice to thaw out frozen meat .
They can wait for days at a seal hole without moving , which puts them in my mind to be a more zen - like animal .
' Compiling this book has pushed me in many new directions in the Alaskan Arctic , and has been a very difficult yet wonderful existence .
' It is not only the story of the polar bear but this amazing environment found off the coast of Alaska , along 800 miles from east to west above the Continental shelf .
' It hosts a rich web of life - animals and people included . '
Mr Kazlowski splits his year between Washington , Seattle and the Arctic and has now embarked on a lecture tour to publicise the threats facing the polar bear .
Many biologists and climatologists believe that by the end of the century , the creature could be the first to disappear altogether from the Arctic .
Retailers from Amazon to Real have launched their own DRM - free MP3 music stores in recent years .
Faced with the competition , Apple finally put the last nail in the coffin of á la carte music DRM earlier this month with the iTunes Store , but do n't tell Microsoft .
The world 's largest software maker just launched a mobile phone - based music store in the UK that charges nearly twice the price for media while offering even fewer rights .
Dubbed MSN Mobile Music and tied to Microsoft's MSN Mobile portal , the service offers over one million songs and 10,000 videos to UK cell phone users from the big four labels .
MSN Mobile Music was launched in partnership with VidZone Digital Media and offers songs for $ 2.07 ( £ 1.50 ) , ringtones for $ 4.05 ( £ 3 ) , and videos for $ 2.77 ( £ 2 ) .
These prices include a fairly steep premium over the standard 99 ¢ charged for most MP3s , though MSN Mobile Music is compatible with over 130 handsets .
The service can be reached via mobile browser at msn.co.uk if you 're in the UK , otherwise it redirects to uk.msn.com .
While MSN Mobile Music has the advantage of broad device compatibility , it is quite possibly the most limiting media store yet to be introduced .
Not only are purchased items locked to the mobile handset they were purchased on , but they cannot be transferred to another device or backed up on a PC .
On the bright side , however , a support document at the MSN Mobile site states that " When you purchase the music , you get unlimited plays for the content whilst it remains on the device . "
Oh boy !
MSN Mobile Music is certainly not the only DRM - laden music or media store in town still .
Many stores that offer " all you can download " subscriptions — including Microsoft 's Zune Marketplace and Nokia 's cell phone - based Comes With Music — use DRM to prevent users from signing up for just a month and making off with thousands of songs .
But even these subscription services offer better terms than MSN Mobile Music , as the Zune Marketplace allows customers to keep ten tracks each month , and Comes With Music tunes will continue to play even after one 's subscription runs out .
In an interview with PC Pro , Hugh Griffiths , Head of Mobile at Microsoft UK , attempted to explain Microsoft 's position on MSN Mobile Music .
" It 's a first step , " Griffiths explained in response to why Microsoft went with DRM .
" We 're doing this in conjunction with a third - party provider .
We 'll be looking to enhance the service if we get some interest from consumers . "
Griffiths goes on to explain that there is " a whole bunch of people " who are " very loyal " to MSN on the web and so it was a natural evolution to introduce a store .
Microsoft is also " constantly reviewing " its pricing policy and will look to amend it if need be .
Perhaps a little more review before releasing the service could have saved Microsoft a lot of post - launch work .
Mayor Richard M. Daley is proposing new anti-gun legislation , while at the same time blasting the federal government for what he says is a lack of focus in combating violence in America .
The mayor all but suggested that federal prosecutors are spending more time on anti-corruption investigations than in rooting out the drug kingpins responsible for the carnage in U.S. cities .
" Someone takes a hundred dollars , could be a Chicago policeman or anybody else , the feds are right there knocking on your door , " he said .
" But they can't find the person accumulating all the money . "
Daley is backing five new laws in Springfield aimed at curbing gun violence .
He is asking that gun dealers be licensed by the state , not just by the federal government ; that gun purchasers be limited to one gun a month ; that law enforcement close the loophole wherein private sellers transfer guns between each other ; a new statewide ban on assault weapons ; and increased penalties for shootings on school property anywhere in the state .
" This is not Iraq ! " he said .
" This is not Afghanistan !
This is not some third - world country . "
The gun industry suggested the mayor 's newest legislative agenda is a response to previous defeats in Springfield , especially his unsuccessful attempt to sue gun dealers for the cost of handgun violence .
" The civil lawsuit was unsuccessful in running gun dealers out of business in the state of Illinois , " said Todd Van Der Myde , of the National Rifle Association .
" So what you have is the mayor trying to set up another regulatory scheme , by which they can harass gun dealers who have n't done anything wrong . "
On Daley 's " one gun a month " proposal , Van Der Myde said , " You 're talking about rationing an enumerated Constitutional right .
I do n't think the court would accept a limit on one magazine per day , one newspaper per day , or one book per month . "
Daley counterd that gun violence is " a national epidemic , " arguing that he supports the Second Amendment and its guarantees on gun ownership .
" All of these proposals protect the rights of law abiding citizens , including hunters , to purchase guns , " Daley said .
Already this year , the Chicago Police Department has seized 1,100 weapons , 263 more than this same time last year , the mayor said .
The automaker reported a $ 5.9 billion dollar loss in the fourth quarter , hemorrhaging even more money than gloomy analysts had been expecting :
Ford Motor Co. , which has already slashed thousands of jobs , will cut even deeper and draw on available credit lines after the auto maker burned through $ 5.5 billion in cash in the fourth quarter and posted its third consecutive annual loss .
For the fourth quarter , Ford recorded a net loss of $ 5.9 billion , or $ 2.46 a share , as its full - year loss ballooned to $ 14.6 billion compared with $ 2.72 billion for 2007 .
Ford , which succeeded at easing its cash burn during the fourth quarter , now has $ 13.4 billion on hand to get it through 2009 .
Keep in mind that this is the auto company in the best shape of all the US domestics .
Whether through luck or wily strategy , Ford managed to mortgage everything but the little blue logo before the financial crisis hit .
They 're drawing down about $ 10 billion in credit to supplement the $ 13 billion worth of cash they finished up the fourth quarter with .
Meanwhile , back at the ranch , GM has announced that it 's putting an end to the program that has annoyed anti-union forces more than any other : the jobs bank .
About sixteen hundred workers are going to have to go on unemployment , which GM will top up to about 72 % of salary and benefits .
There 's little realistic hope that those people will ever work as auto workers again :
The automakers instituted jobs banks at a time when they were modernizing their factories and needed to win labor support for innovations that would mean a loss of jobs .
The auto companies provided nearly all of an autoworker 's pay and benefits when he or she was put into a jobs bank .
UAW members went into a jobs bank if they remained laid off beyond 48 weeks .
Jobs bank compensation is different from the money the company pays workers who are laid off -- which is known as sub pay -- to offset government unemployment benefits .
" There 's a huge difference in terms of what the supplemental unemployment -- the sub pay -- was doing and the jobs bank .
The jobs bank was when they completely eliminated your plant and they had almost no hope of ever being called back , " said Arthur Wheaton , a labor expert from Cornell University .
" Sub pay was :
You 're on unemployment and it's going to have all of the same rules and requirements , you 're only allowed so long , and there 's a big component in there to say , ' OK , you 've got to go back and get some retraining or you 've got to get some education or do something to get back to work . ' "
The elimination of the jobs bank was one of the conditions that were placed on government money .
Though I do n't think the defenders of the UAW were correct to say that labor relations are n't a serious problem at the Big Three , they are right that cuts like this will not be enough to save the firm .
The credit contraction has been catastrophic for auto sales -- I do n't believe , as some news reports claim , that no one with a sub - 800 credit score can get a loan , but there 's no denying that the cutoffs for credit quality are locking a major percentage of potential buyers out of the market .
The pandemic - related trend that saw more people trying their hand at home gardening may have led to a bountiful harvest of fresh produce , but it ’s left some scrambling to find canning supplies as they try to save the last of their colorful crops to enjoy during the winter .

A parents group is warning about explicit footage in a new Grand Theft Auto video game , even as a California law banning such material from being sold to children was struck down as unconstitutional .
Common Sense Media , a nonprofit group that reviews games , movies and other entertainment for children , sent out a message late Thursday warning against Grand Theft Auto IV : The Lost and Damned .
" Heavy violence , strong language -- and now nudity , " the group said .
" Thought this M - rated game series could n't go any lower ?
Think again . "
Common Sense Media reviewer Marc Saltzman said that The Lost & Damned , developed by Rockstar Games and published by Take - Two Interactive Software , contains depictions of full - frontal male nudity .
It also includes graphically violent scenes , including one in which a gang member 's face is pressed against the spinning wheel of a motorcycle -- splatter !
The game , Saltzman said , " should be kept away -- far away -- from children . "
The Lost and Damned is a $ 19.99 add - on game , released Tuesday , that 's available only as a download on Microsoft 's Xbox 360 game console .
To play , one must already have Grand Theft Auto IV , which launched in April with little protest from parental groups .

Because of the computational power of today 's GPUs , GPUs are starting to be harnessed more and more to help out CPUs with some hardcore number crunching .
That is the concept behind Nvidia 's CUDA , ATI 's Stream , and Apple 's OpenCL frameworks .
There are n't many apps available yet that take advantage of these relatively new technologies , but the ranks are slowly growing .
The latest GPU - assisted app to come available is one designed for IT managers to make sure their wireless networks are secure -- and inevitably for hackers to try to break into wireless networks .
" Advanced dictionary attacks with deep mutations attempt multiple variants and combinations of each dictionary word .
The mutations can be fine - tuned to employ all or some of the settings such as different letter cases , number substitutions , changing the order of characters , using abbreviations and vowel mutations ; 12 configurable mutation settings altogether . "
Russian - based ElcomSoft has just released ElcomSoft Wireless Security Auditor 1.0 , which can take advantage of both Nvidia and ATI GPUs .
ElcomSoft claims that the software uses a " proprietary GPU acceleration technology , " which implies that neither CUDA , Stream , nor OpenCL are being utilized in this instance .
At its heart , what ElcomSoft Wireless Security Auditor does is perform brute - force dictionary attacks of WPA and WPA2 passwords .
If an access point is set up using a fairly insecure password that is based on dictionary words , there is a higher likelihood that a password can be guessed .
Brute force attacks that send random dictionary words to an access point can eventually successfully guess the password , if given enough time -- the more computational power behind it , the faster the software can send passwords attempts and possibly guess the password .
*
ElcomSoft positions the software as a way to " audit " wireless network security .
However , we 're fairly certain that at least some users will use the software for more nefarious means , such as trying to break into someone else 's wireless network .
If you manage a wireless network , you should use passwords that use a combination of upper and lower - case letters , numbers , and symbols ( if it supported ) , use relatively long passwords , and avoid dictionary words -- in fact , this is good advice for nearly any type of password -- not just for wiresless access points .
ElcomSoft Wireless Security Auditor runs on Windows NT SP4 , Windows 2000 , Windows XP , Windows Vista , Windows Server 2003 , and Windows Server 2008 .
The software ordinarily sells for $ 1,199 , but is currently selling at half price ( $ 599.5 ) until March 1 , 2009 .
Israel headed for political gridlock today after its election produced rival winners .
Analysts said the country was split as the prospects of Palestine and Israel making peace were dimmer than ever .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Centrist Tzipi Livni's Kadima party won the most votes but had little chance of building enough support for a coalition .
Right - winger Benjamin Netanyahu can get the support , but analysts said the likely coalition would prove dysfunctional .
" I won , " read the headline of the country 's biggest newspaper , Yedioth Ahronoth , next to photos of both leaders .
But some commentators said the rival claims showed Israel had lost .
" One thing is clear to all Israeli voters , " said the paper 's Eitan Haber .
" The political system is shattered . "
President Shimon
Peres must decide whether to call on Livni or Netanyahu , who then has 42 days to form a government .
Israeli media said he would have no choice but to tap Netanyahu if rightist parties all back him .
But it would be the first time in Israel 's 60 - year history that the winner of an election ends up sitting in opposition .
" With God 's help I will lead the next government , " Netanyahu , 59 , told supporters of his Likud party .
Nearly final results gave him 27 seats in the 120 - seat Knesset , while Livni's Kadima won 28 .
She said she would be prime minister and invited Netanyahu to join a " unity government " .
But Netanyahu said he would lead the " nationalist camp " in parliament , and control 64 seats .
" Tzipi Livni has only the slightest chance , or none at all , of forming a government under her leadership , " said Abraham Diskin , a political scientist at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University .

Avigdor Lieberman 's far - right , anti-Arab Yisrael Beiteinu party , now third largest , emerged as a potential kingmaker .
" We want a nationalist government .
We want a rightist government ... and we are not hiding this , " he said .
But keeping his options open , he added : " The decision will not be simple . "
Lieberman and religious parties in a Netanyahu coalition would oppose any peace moves with the Palestinians , a fact not lost on the people of the occupied West Bank .
" Israelis voted for the right and against peace .
We will not see progress in the peace process in the coming years , " said Ali Zaidan , an office worker in Ramallah .
Netanyahu would also face demands from Jewish religious parties for a big slice of the budget to fund their studies .
If no budget passes in 45 days there must be another election .
The outcome was bad news for US President Barack Obama , who plans to revive peace talks aiming for a two - state accord .
" The Obama administration is going to inherit the worst of both worlds , " said former US mediator Aaron David Miller .
" They have already inherited a dysfunctional Palestinian house , made worse by Gaza , and now what they are inheriting is a dysfunctional Israeli house , " he said .
The Palestinian side is split between hardline Hamas Islamists in Gaza and Western - backed President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank , a leader who seems to be losing support .
" I 'll talk with whatever government emerges in Israel , " Abbas was quoted as telling Italy 's La Repubblica .
" The ascent of the Israeli right does not worry us . "
" Take for example Netanyahu : in the past he took important steps , he signed two accords with us . "
Netanyahu and Livni were both meeting leaders of potential coalition parties on Wednesday , and Peres was also due to start hearing the views of the 12 parties which won seats .
His discussions with Knesset factions could take about a week , but coalition talks might drag on for more than a month .
Ehud Olmert of Kadima , who resigned in September in a corruption scandal but stayed on as caretaker prime minister , will remain in the post until a government is in place .
The election was held in the middle of delicate , indirect talks with Hamas to agree on a durable Gaza ceasefire .
Israel 's January war in Gaza cost 1,300 Palestinian lives versus 13 Israelis killed , and had strong public support .
Netanyahu was cruising to victory until Olmert 's centre - left coalition , including Livni , launched the three - week offensive .
Livni also led peace talks with Abbas 's Palestinian Authority and would try to revive them .
Netanyahu is cooler on ceding occupied territory and curbing Jewish settlement .

Four hens , bobbing about the garden in a loose group , seem unfazed .
The entire lush and green backyard is on an upslope and looks out across the Castro district and a San Francisco panorama to Bernal Heights , a semi-suburban neighborhood in the city ’s geographic center .
As I stand in the yard , two hawks circle overhead .
The lawn and the neat , framed garden beds are smattered with chicken poop .
Kate has four birds .
Two planned , two unplanned .
The first pair came to her last year , from a science program at the school her young kids attend .
Families from the school often adopt a couple of birds once summer rolls around , she says .
The second pair were adopted later .
A family who ’d also taken in a couple of chicks asked Kate to babysit their birds for a week .
She agreed .
But soon after , they called , hoping she would keep them — their deck , they realized , did n’t offer much space for growing chicks .

The hens now roost and lay eggs in a spacious , two - room coop Kate ’s husband designed and built and have a free run in the garden during the day .
Given that each hen typically lays at least an egg a day and that they ’re not particularly expensive to feed and house , I ’m not sure I ’d have given up on young chicks so quickly .
Of course , at this point I ’m also no more than talk .
Later , when the rain has subsided , I wander back outside with a couple of slices of American cheese for the hens .
I ’m trying to take this seriously , because it ’s my first unchaperoned encounter with hens , and so I suppress the urge to eat cheese and trudge through the light rain to the coop .
The hens crowd me , wheezing and clucking and snapping up the torn - up slices , and then wander off when it ’s clear I ’m no longer useful .
Yet they ’re more sociable than I ’d expected .
And expressive , too , as they flick their heads from side to side and wobble around the yard in search of food .
Kate agrees .
If she ’s working outside the hens come and sit near her .
Hang out .
Cluck .
“ They ’re creatures of habit , ” she says .
“ The easiest pets I ’ve had . ”
Uh-oh .
Pets ?
She ’s hit upon the very question that ’s been nagging me .
***
Across the city , in Bernal Heights , Maureen ’s three hens scratch in a low wire and molded plastic coop filled with paper scraps , carrot tops and a fair scattering of poop .
Sustaining the chickens and garden is full - time work , and Maureen ’s full - time job .
But this is no pastoral whimsy .
Her urban garden also cuts her family ’s food costs .
In fact , she ’s a little embarrassed at having paid for the coop , an ocean - blue Eglu , because virtually everything else in her yard is salvaged , reused , or donated .
The birds muck about in torn - up phone books , gleaned from nearby streets .
They eat kitchen scraps .
And they are n’t coddled .
“ They ’re not pets , ” Maureen says .
She does n’t name her hens , does n’t let her son name them , and is adamant that the three birds will be processed .
Processed ?
For a second I ’m thrown by the term and think of Foster Farms , Pilgrim ’s Pride , Oscar Meyer … Like “ harvest , ” it ’s one of those apt but elusive terms commonly used by people who spend a lot of time cheek - to - jowl with the food they eat .
It ’s a clever term , too — it masks the fact the hens will be slaughtered while also serving as a reminder that some hens are n’t pets , but rather animals walking a slow road toward the dinner table .
Maureen is calmly matter - of - fact about her birds .
She ’s clearly deeply committed to transforming her yard in to a self - sustaining garden , to transforming her young son ’s understanding of the life cycle of food , upending her family ’s entire pattern of consumption .
Her small garden was little more than a concrete slab until she went at it with a cement buster a year - and - a - half ago .
Now , blueberry stalks grow in wine barrels .
Peas climb a small trellis in a corner of the yard .
Broccoli , kale , carrots , garlic and leeks are patches of green amid old planks , torn - up newspaper and rabbit droppings , a garden - ready fertilizer .
Gutting the chickens is n’t easy , she says .
It ’s dark inside the bird and you ’re in there with your hand feeling your way around , trying not to bust the gall bladder because the spilled bile spoils the flavor of the meat .
You have to tug the organs to get them out .
Once I found a whole line of eggs inside a hen , she adds .
“ It was like one of those Russian dolls . ”
Oh babushka !
Could I do this — gut , drain and pluck a dead chicken ?
Would I have to ?
Ca n’t I just hang onto the birds until they ’re doddering around and die of their own accord ?
Maureen ’s comments are a wake - up call .
She is utterly practical and I ’m realizing I ’m not .
I ’d figured I could probably take a deep breath and kill a bird — if I had to .
But in my fear of harvesting a hen I had n’t thought beyond the chopping block .
I remind myself that I do n’t particularly like chicken meat .
Part of me , I realize , is bothered by the thought of the work that goes into raising — and eventually processing — hens .
But another part of me is bothered at being bothered about the responsibility of it all .
I ’d clearly been thinking of chickens as egg dispensers , not pets .
Harvesting them was the elephant in the room .
Later that afternoon , I step outside alone to take another look at the Eglu .
The hens scatter nervously as I approach .
Maybe I ’m imagining it , but these birds do n’t seem like pets .
As I leave , I backtrack to a poster hanging on Maureen ’s kitchen wall , an original and a gift from her husband .
“ Plant a Victory Garden .
Our Food is Fighting .
A Garden Will Make Your Rations Go Further , ” it declares .
***
Over at Bernal Beast , a nearby pet supply store , I talk about the full monty hen kill scenario with Abe , a store coworker .
“ I think it ’d be kind of tedious , ” he remarks , of having to pluck and prepare a bird .
He has a point .
The chicken is likely to be tough .
A soup bird .
No more than a meal or two .
Tony , the store ’s owner , is more circumspect .
He does n’t own chickens himself but calls his customers “ forethinkers . ”
“ They can see that not only nutritionally but economically it ’s the way to go , ” he says .
“ It also goes along with having a garden . ”
He thinks he ’s onto something too .
Demand for hen supplies has been rising over the past one - and - half to two years , if his sales are anything to go by .
He now stocks 50 - pound bags of scratch and crumble chicken feed .
Customers come in from all over San Francisco , he says .
He seems wistful when he remembers the hens his extended family raised when he was growing up .
“ They just have the whole world to themselves .
They ’re just hysterical . ”
***
I ’m getting the sense this sentiment is pretty widespread .
Dana , a friend of a friend , raises hens on a small urban lot in Gardnerville , near Lake Tahoe .
Her two 11 - month - old Rhode Island Reds and her dog hang out — supervised — in the backyard together .
“ I let them in the yard as they enjoy eating grass and bugs and if they ca n’t get back into their coop , they come up onto my deck and come to the window and holler at me , ” she writes in an email .
But processing them ?
She does n’t see herself killing unproductive hens .
She ’s considering retiring older birds to a friend ’s 2 - acre property on the other side of town .
***
So am I back to square one ?
Can I get out of harvesting my hens ?
Or am I just lazy and reluctant to face up to what farming is really about ?
I call up the first person I ’d spoken to about chickens .
“ I ca n’t imagine killing them , ” Jeannine says .
Her young daughters helped raise the soft , fluffy pullets in their home this winter and while the hens , now outside , do n’t have names , the family knows each one by the quirks of its personality .
Raising birds , she says , is a fantasy of living in a rustic setting that can’t ever be played out .
But it ’s practical too , she adds .
After all there are the eggs .
And raising hens has inspired her to think about making other things , like a victory garden .
We are old friends and it ’s her three hens , a Wyandotte , a black sex - link and a Buff Orpington , that have inspired me to try raising my own .
One afternoon we sit on an old , salvaged cast - iron bench at the top of her yard watching the chickens go about their business .
We ’re inside an enclosure that crosses into her next - door neighbor ’s yard , and which is shared between six hens in all .
Eric , Jeannine ’s husband , tells a story about his grandfather , who as a young man immigrated to the California from Germany by way of a sponsorship that attested he could farm chickens .
He had no idea how to raise hens , Eric says .
He was busy reading chicken farming books on the ship .
The older generation , he adds , are not caught up in the new urban romance of chicken - rearing .
It occurs to me that raising hens is a different way of being “ practical ” about food .
If picking up a dozen from the supermarket saves time and money , how practical is it to build a coop from scratch , to commit to cleaning birdshit from a coop , to be OK with slowing egg consumption as the hens get older or the weather colder ?
I ’d probably be happy to build a coop , to clean it , to wait for eggs .
But chickens as pets ?
Is that practical ?
If I get attached to the hens , harvesting them at a year old seems unlikely .
So when egg production tapers off within a year or two , then what ?
I ’d hate to see my new hens as broken egg machines .
I realize I ’m still pretty entrenched in the rigid efficiencies of food production .
Keeping old hens as pets might not be going the whole urban egg hog , but it seems the most practical path for now , a cautious reality of this generation ’s new urban farm .
Newswise —
In a an analysis of the size , shape and asymmetry of the cranium of Homo floresiensis , Karen Baab , Ph.D. , a researcher in the Department of Anatomical Scienes at Stony Brook University , and colleagues conclude that the fossil , found in Indonesia in 2003 and known as the " Hobbit , " is not human .
They used 3 - D shape analysis to study the LB1 skull of the hobbit and found the shape of the skull to be consistent with a scaled down human ancestor but not modern humans .
Their findings , reported in the current online edition of the Journal of Human Evolution , add to the evidence that the hobbit is a new species .
The question as to whether the hobbit was human or another species remains controversial .
Some scientists claim the hobbit was a diminutive human that suffered from some type of disease that causes microcephaly , which results in abnormal growth of the brain and causes the cranium to be much smaller than the normal human cranium .
But Dr. Baab and co-author Kieran McNulty , Professor of Anthropology at the University of Minnesota , believe their findings counter the microcephaly theory .
" A skull can provide researchers with a lot of important information about a fossil species , particularly regarding their evolutionary relationships to other fossil species , " explains Dr. Baab .
" The overall shape of the LB1 skull , particularly the part that surrounds the brain ( neurocranium ) looks similar to fossils more than 1.5 million years older from Africa and Eurasia , rather than modern humans , even though Homo floresiensis is documented from 17,000 to 95,000 years ago . "
To carry out the study , Dr. Baab and colleagues collected 3D landmark data on the LB1 skull and a large sample of fossils representing other extinct hominin species , as well as a comparative sample of modern humans and apes .
They performed several analyses of different regions of the skulls .
Taken together , these analyses indicated that the LB1 skull shape is that of a scaled down Homo fossil not a scaled down modern human .
The results of the analysis of the asymmetry of the skulls , which refers to differences between the right and left sides of the skull , refutes the suggestion that the LB1 skull was that of a modern human with a diagnosis of microcephaly .
In modern humans , a high degree of asymmetry may indicate that the individual was diseased .
At least one scientific study on the asymmetry of LB1 supported the argument that this individual had microcephaly .
Conversely , Dr. Baab and colleagues found the degree of asymmetry of the LB1 skull was not unexpectedly high and therefore not supportive of the diagnosis of microcephaly .
" The degree of asymmetry in LB1 was within the range of apes and was very similar to that seen in other fossil skulls , " says Dr. Baab .
" We suggest that the degree of asymmetry is within expectations for this population of hominins , particular given that the conditions of the cave in Indonesia in which the skull was preserved may have contributed to asymmetry . "
Dr. Baab recognizes that the controversy as to the evolutionary origins of Homo floresiensis will continue , perhaps without an answer .
However , all the evidence that she and colleagues illustrate in their article " Size , shape , and asymmetry in fossil hominins :
The status of the LB1cranium based on 3D morphometric analyses , " suggest that Homo floresiensis was most likely the diminutive descendant of a species of archaic Homo .
The results of this study are also in line with what other researchers in the Department of Anatomical Sciences at Stony Brook University have found regarding the rest of the hobbit skeleton .
Drs. William Jungers and Susan Larson have documented a range of primitive features in both the upper and lower limbs of Homo floresiensis , highlighting the many ways that these hominins were unlike modern humans .
The Department of Anatomical Sciences is one of 25 departments within the Stony Brook University School of Medicine .
The department includes graduate and doctoral programs in Anatomical Sciences .
Fields of study include research on human evolutionary anatomy , morphology and vertebrate paleontology .
Many faculty members in the department are also participants in an interdepartmental graduate program in anthropological sciences that is recognized worldwide for its faculty and research strengths in functional morphology and human evolution .

Eighth Australian soldier dies in Afghanistan amid calls to boost troop numbers
By James Cogan
13 January 2009
The eighth Australian soldier lost his life in Afghanistan on January 3 .
Thirty - year - old Private Gregory Michael Sher , from a Melbourne - based Army Reserve company of the 1st Commando Regiment , was killed by 107 mm rockets fired into an Afghan army base in the southern province of Uruzgan .
He had reportedly been in the country for several months .
According to reports ,
Sher was part of the 300 - strong Australian special forces detachment that is operating in Uruzgan and mainly comprised of units from the Special Air Service ( SAS ) and the army 's regular commando battalion , 4RAR .
Its primary mission is to locate and capture or assassinate insurgent leaders and bomb - makers .
Some 800 other Australian troops are in Afghanistan performing engineering , logistical or support roles .
The previous conservative Australian government authorised the deployment of the special forces into frontline combat in Uruzgan in mid-2007 .
The Labor government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , which took office in November 2007 , has continued and expanded their deployment .
As a result , casualties have spiked sharply .
Only one soldier was killed between October 2001 and October 2007 .
In the past 15 months , seven more have lost their lives and more than 50 have been wounded .
While the number is still small , Afghanistan is now the most costly conflict for the Australian military since its operations in Vietnam from 1962 to 1971 , when 500 died and some 3,100 were wounded .
Sher 's death has prompted another round of speculation in the Australian media as to whether the incoming Obama administration will request that Rudd deploys even larger numbers of combat troops to the Afghan war — with the prospect of greater casualties .
Under Obama , Afghanistan will be central to the US strategy of asserting its influence in Central Asia at the expense of its main rivals in the region — Russia and China .
Establishing supply lines to Afghanistan , independent of the increasingly unstable route across Pakistan or a contentious path through Russia , is being exploited to bolster the pro-US client state in Georgia , strengthen ties with Azerbaijan and oil - rich Kazakhstan , and develop relations with Uzbekistan and gas - rich Turkmenistan which both border Afghanistan .
( See : " US ‘ surge ' in Afghanistan threatens wider war " )
Theoretically , a complex " East - West corridor " for both military supplies and oil and gas pipelines could be developed , stretching from Europe to northern Afghanistan .
As Indian diplomat M.K. Bhadrakumar noted in the Asia Times on December 20 : " The project , if it materialises , will be a geopolitical coup — the biggest ever that Washington would have swung in post -Soviet Central Asia and the Caucasus .
At one stroke , the US will be tying up military cooperation at the bilateral level with Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan . "
The US military is already preparing for a dramatic escalation in the Afghan war and stepped - up incursions into Pakistan to target insurgent safe - havens .
It has announced that its troop numbers in the country will double from 30,000 to 60,000 .
Pressure on Australia to boost its commitment as well is considered virtually inevitable .
The January 6 editorial of the Melbourne Age commented : " With most Australian troops having left Iraq ...
Washington would be well aware Canberra has capacity to increase forces in Afghanistan .
The military protection that Australia derives from the US alliance also carries expectations of reciprocity , so Mr Rudd will find it hard simply to deny any request from Mr Obama for more help in Afghanistan . "
Sections of the Australian establishment support sending additional forces as they consider the protracted Afghan war an opportunity to finally dispense with the " Vietnam Syndrome " — the reluctance of governments to deploy troops into combat out of fears this could ignite domestic political opposition .
The Army 's infantry battalions and armoured squadrons , for example , have not gone into battle for 37 years .
Two Army officers wrote papers last year denouncing the policy of not sending the infantry battalions into frontline roles .
The Murdoch press widely publicised their criticisms and supported the officers with a column in the Australian calling for Rudd to " let the infantry do its job " in Afghanistan .
Last month , the campaign was stepped - up by retired Major General Jim Molan , who for a time commanded the Australian task force in Iraq and was prevented from undertaking offensive operations by the then Howard government .
While giving full support to the Bush administration 's occupation of Iraq , Howard was acutely conscious that Australian casualties would have galvanised political opposition .
In late 2002 and early 2003 , some of the largest demonstrations internationally against the impending invasion took place in Australia .
Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald , Molan complained that Howard 's deployments to both Afghanistan and Iraq had " lacked military logic " , as they did not allow troops to engage in combat .
The Rudd government , he declared , had to consider the " option to deploy a joint combat group of up to 2,000 capable personnel permitted to fight and give itself the option of increasing its commitment up to 6,000 by about 2011 " ( emphasis added ) .
Again the Australian signalled its support .
In an editorial on December 27 , it declared : " There is one request the Rudd government must be ready to answer as soon as President - elect Barack Obama takes office next month — a call for more Australian combat troops to join the allied effort in Afghanistan ....
" Major General Molan argues that Australia has got used to deploying the ADF [ Australian Defence Forces ] in international peacemaking and peacekeeping operations , and that we need a culture where the armed forces are equipped and expected to fight long wars . "
The remedy , it declared , " could be to add one of the six regular infantry battalions , plus support troops , to supplement , or rest , the hard - working SAS " in Afghanistan .
The Australian speaks for powerful sections of the political establishment who want the population to become accustomed to troops dying in overseas interventions .
In a period of economic and political upheaval , they expect Australian governments to be prepared to deploy military force to defend their economic and strategic interests , especially in the Asia - Pacific region — regardless of the human cost .
A stepped - up involvement in Afghanistan is viewed as both a training ground to blood the Australian Army and a down - payment for future US assistance .
The Rudd government has not ruled out a major escalation .
When questioned over Molan 's column , Minister for Defence Joel Fitzgibbon emphasised only that , thus far , Canberra had " received no approach from the US ... to increase our troop commitment " .
The main reason for the row was a property dispute between the Catholic and Orthodox churches in Ukraine , where the Greek Catholic church , which was banned by Stalin and dispossessed , took back hundreds of parishes from the Orthodox church at the beginning of the 1990s .
OAK HARBOR -- Helicopters and boats are working to rescue hundreds of fishermen stranded on an ice floe that broke free west of Sandusky , authorities said .
Rescue units from Cleveland to Detroit have been dispatched .
The ice floe broke free about 10:45 a.m , near Crane Creek State Park , near the Davis Besse nuclear power plant in Ottawa County , authorities said .
" We have begun to move some of the people , " said Coast Guard Petty Officer Bill Colclough .
" We 're doing everything we can to get to the people . "
Police and fire units from dozens of municipalities , as well as the Canadian Coast Guard , have joined in rescue efforts .
There are no reports of injuries at this time .
Unprecendented numbers of fishermen have taken to the ice this winter , as thicker ice allowed fishermen to go further out onto the lake .
But today 's unseasonably high temperatures appear to have caused chunks of ice to melt .
Yesterday , law enforcement officials worried that the high tempertures and shifting winds could cause problems .
Ice fishermen towing trailers with snowmobiles and all - terrain vehicles filled the parking lot at Catawba Island State Park Friday .
" It 's really busy for a Friday morning , " said park ranger Christopher Desh .
" I expect the weekend will be a madhouse . "
More worrisome than increasing temperatures were 25 - knot winds from the southwest that are bringing the higher temperatures , as well as ice - melting rains over the next week .
" It 's not a good combination , " said Ottawa County Sheriff Robert Bratton .
" Big winds can mean shifting ice , large cracks opening up and stranded ice fishermen .
Everyone will be ready , just in case . "
Volunteer fire departments along the western Lake Erie shoreline and the U.S. Coast Guard do the heavy lifting when anglers are stranded on the ice .
The ice - fishing scene has been relatively quiet for a couple of years , mostly because of poor ice for big - water anglers .
Fatalities are rare , but three ice anglers wandering in fog off Middle Bass Island in February 2001 went through the ice and drowned .
In 2005 , about 45 anglers were rescued from an ice floe near Crane Creek State Park .
Jennifer Ellis-Seitz Identified as Woman Missing from Cruise Ship ( PHOTOS )
Jennifer Seitz
, 36 , is the woman who went missing on the Norwegian Pearl cruise ship on Christmas night .
Jennifer , who was originally identified as Jennifer Feitz , her husband Raymond Seitz , and her mother , Donna Ellis , were staying in cabin 11122 , a 231 square foot mini-suite with a 54 square foot balcony .
Ray and Jennifer were participants on a cruise ship game show called " The Not So Newlyweds " where it was learned they have been married for about a year , and had their first date in Orlando , FL .
Jennifer was reported missing by her husband at 3:50 a.m. Friday morning .
News agencies are reporting that cruise ship surveillance cameras show a woman in a white nightgown going overboard around 8:00 p.m. on Thursday , however , our sources were told by crew members that the video shows the woman going over at 2:00 a.m on Friday .
Although it is unclear where the woman went overboard , passengers we have spoken to say the FBI boarded the ship when it docked in Miami Sunday morning and focused their efforts on the balcony of cabin 11122 .
One passenger noted that one of the balcony chairs was pushed sideways up against the Plexiglas railing , although he was unsure if the chair had been moved before or during the FBI investigation .
Jennifer , a Central Florida native , graduated from Queens University of Charlotte with a degree in English in 1995 .
After graduation , she formed her own company , Newshound Communications , a freelance editing , writing and media relations business specializing in Central Florida ’s travel and tourism industry .
Most recently Ellis - Seitz became a trainer / writer for the Supervisor of Elections - writing , creating and presenting training relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act and HAVA , and teaching classes to poll workers .
Interestingly , she recently wrote a freelance piece about staying in shape while cruising , called " Battling the Bulge On Board . "
Although there is currently no information available about Raymond Seitz , we believe he works for a parking area construction and maintenance company in Longwood , FL .
One of the passengers who was on board the Norwegian Pearl is currently on a plane heading back home and will be sending us photos of the scene at cabin 11122 taken this morning during the FBI investigation .
Below is a typical mini-suite on the Norwegian Pearl , as well as another photo of Jennifer Seitz .
UPDATE : I have added the photos from the FBI investigation , as promised .
Note the position of the chair on the balcony .
Thanks to passenger Rob for the pictures .
UPDATE 2 : More info about Ray Seitz
UPDATE 3 : EXCLUSIVE photos and information about what happened the night Jennifer disappeared
UPDATE : True Crime Report has uncovered more details about Jennifer and Raymond Seitz

デブサミは本当に素晴しいカンファレンスだった。いろいろな人と出会い、いろいろな話をした。そして考えた。わたしは、このようなカンファレンスが必要だ。だけど、何かが足りない。自分の場所と違うなにかを感じた。それは何かを考えた。
端的に言えばワクワクするものとワクワクしないものだ。
バズワードは全然ワクワクしない。カネにもあんまりワクワクしない。例えば、猫も杓子もクラウド、クラウドと言うが全然ワクワクしない。
しかし、クラウド(何それ) を構成する要素技術には、ワクワクする。OSの技術、CPUコアを増やすとそれに比例してスケールするOSとかRDBMSとかWebサーバとかアルゴリズムにはワクワクする。大規模サービスを提供するためのCPU技術(それって何だ？)
、RDBMS、Web技術。キャッシュ、コンパイラ、JIT、VM、省電力プログラミング、省メモリプログラミング、有用なアルゴリズム、枚挙にいとまがない。
温故知新である。ロック。キャッシュ。SMP。NUMA。
例えば 、Rubyという言語は素敵だし、それがかもしだしているエコシステムは大好きだ。しかし、わたしの興味は、スケールするrubyの実装とか、高速化とか、キャッシュミスの削減とか、省エネルギーとか、そーゆー観点からの言語の実装である。
興味はどんどん下の方へ行っている。Webサービスとか、業務アプリケーションとか、部品を組み合わせて構築する魔法ではなく、部品そのもの、部品の構成要素にどんどん興味の重心が移っている。それを仮に基盤技術あるいは要素技術と言えば、その技術そのものに興味がある。そして、その基盤技術について、日本という地域でガラパゴスと揶揄されようとも徹底的に議論してみたい。そのような場が欲しいと強く願っている。
幸いなことに今年の10月に日本で初めてLinux Kernel Summitが開催される。Linuxについて徹底的に議論する場が日本という地域で持てるという僥倖。OSだけではなく、RDBMS(MySQL/PostgreSQLなど)
、Apache、Perl/Rubyなどなどのバイナリハッカーを一同に介して技術的なお祭騒ぎをやってみたい。
どのように、それを実施するかのアイデアは正直一切ない。しかし、そのような場はわれわれプログラマに絶対必要だ。技術者として自立するためにも、日本という地域に絶望しないためにも、われわれは、そのような場を必要としている。
The federal investigation that prompted Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico to withdraw his nomination as commerce secretary offers a rare glimpse into a long - simmering investigation of possible bid-rigging , tax evasion and other wrongdoing throughout the municipal bond business .
Three federal agencies and a loose consortium of state attorneys general have for several years been gathering evidence of what appears to be collusion among the banks and other companies that have helped state and local governments take approximately $ 400 billion worth of municipal notes and bonds to market each year .
E-mail messages , taped phone conversations and other court documents suggest that companies did not engage in open competition for this lucrative business , but secretly divided it among themselves , imposing layers of excess cost on local governments , violating the federal rules for tax - exempt bonds and making questionable payments and campaign contributions to local officials who could steer them business .
In some cases , they created exotic financial structures that blew up .
People with knowledge of the evidence say investigators are not just looking at a few bad apples , but also at the way an entire market has operated for years .
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - China ’s central bank has noted recent comments by Timothy Geithner , President Barack Obama ’s choice to head the U.S. Treasury , on the yuan and has reported them to relevant Chinese government departments , a central bank official said on Friday .
“ We have noticed such reports .
We have reported them to relevant government departments and are awaiting a response , ” the official told Reuters by telephone .
He declined to elaborate .
President Obama believes China is “ manipulating ” its currency , Geithner said on Thursday , using a term the Bush administration had deliberately avoided for years to describe Beijing ’s foreign exchange practices .
Washington will aggressively use all its diplomatic tools to press Beijing to move faster on currency reform , Geithner , the New York Federal Reserve Bank president , said in response to written questions from the Senate Finance Committee , which voted 18 - 5 on Thursday in favor of his nomination .

Here 's a great article about investing in HYIPS ... the risks associated with it .
Enjoy !

If you are interested in money making programs which are actually accessible on the web , you might consider some new programs and options that are used by many folks interested in having some cash generated through playing gold games or actually investment programs that are also called the hyips and by searching the web , you can find some websites that are dedicated to such matters and provide information and details on the high yield investment programs .
The story dates back to some years ago and the money making programs and sites are not newcomers to the online arena and around the year of 2000 , you could find some newly launched sites and web directories providing listings of such hyip programs and as mentioned earlier , they still are running and functioning on the net and many people visit such websites .
As a matter of fact , the mechanism of the hyips is not that difficult because they can be compared to some games you play online and the rewards can be very high sometimes because you might be able to double your cash within some days or even hours in some cases through joining the high yield investment programs and at some other times , you might completely lose your cash over the programs because as we will later on explain in details , there are also many risk factors involved in the hyip world and it can be very useful and great knowing about the possible dangers and problems present in such games and certainly , when you approach the hyips programs with insight and knowledge , this will increase your chances of success dramatically and in a really great manner which would be equal to adding to your cash .
It might be difficult trying to fully explain how some programs might be working in order to generate huge amounts of cash and profits within some short periods of time and this matter becomes very confusing especially when you attempt comparing the hyip programs with other normal investment plans offered in the real offline world because the mechanisms are different from each other and so do the programs features and functions .
One thing is certain and that is the ease to join the high yield investment programs because using your e-currency accounts and some small amounts of cash in your digital payment system , you can find the hyips programs and then after doing the initial registration process , you can actually make a payment to the programs and become a member and after this step , you will be paid according to the timelines and periods specified in the programs tables and charts .
There are many other programs besides the hyips which can be joined for earning some cash online but they still are among the most popular forms of money making online , especially among the folks interested in online investment plans and projects .
There are many factors involved while trying to make selection from among tens and dozens of choices and high yield investment programs and sites and sometimes you might be interested in examining which programs have better chances of success and remaining online and active among other companies and competitors and this matter can be very important .
Please note that the matter of hyips is a very delicate and rather complex one which might have various meanings and outcomes and the perspective and idea of wining some cash or totally losing some or all amounts of the money and capital you are going to invest into the online plans must make you think carefully before joining any of such plans online because rush and hurried decisions are not recommended .
If you take a look at the backgrounds and records of the programs coming into and going out of the high yield investment world since a few years ago till now , you will notice that the hyip space can be associated with an online entity or business project which is definitely accompanied by risk factors and no one can guarantee anything in this world .
After initiating the talk regarding some programs which can be used for joining , it can be nice pointing out some notes about the monitoring and rating systems as well .
You know , although we have mentioned about the difficulties and complexities prevailing in the high yield investment world and how confusing it could be selecting from among many plans and programs , but you can also take a look at some of the hyip monitoring and rating websites which do a daily listing of the powerful and important investment programs on a regular basis and usually , some statistics and information on each of the programs are being prepared and you can easily read them .
Please do not forget the essential matter of exchanging views as well as speaking with other folks on the web before joining any program because the folks who are experienced and also are knowledgeable in the hyips arena , will naturally assist you having better chances of success for earning some good amounts of cash from the hyip programs and systems .
You know , although it can be difficult , but you can discover some formulas which would definitely help you make some great guesses on the future of a specified hyip program for example and after some times , you will be joining the programs which would be the ones increasing your initial capital and this is not a thing to be achieved overnight .
If you take a look around the web , visiting some of the bulletin boards covering subjects and points about the hyip programs and investment plans , you will notice that there are also thousands of professional players online who have been on the market for some years now and their advice and guidelines could be invaluable if you are just new to the high yield investment world and zone .
In the following articles and discussions we will take a better look at the online investment programs as well as the guidelines which could help you making better decisions when you find a new hyip program online and might be doubtful over joining or not joining that special investment plan .
We will also elaborate on the matters of digital currencies used for joining the programs as well as the ways of better protecting your e-currency accounts and cash amounts when you 'd like to join some gold games or high yield investments as well as many other subjects relevant to the topic .

Love , Scott Recent Posts Untitled ( 2 ) by eightofnine on What the fuck was that shit 1500 - Baby Mykle 2020 ( 12 ) by wednesday on Hey baby girl ,
Your dad started a massive group text with all his family and your moms family this morning .
Your mom checked into the hospital for her C- section about 6:30 am .
You came into this world at 7:58 am , Friday September 25 , 2020 .
Your dad sent out pictures of you being weighed at 8:10 am .
7lbs 10 oz. 20 inches long .
Your Grandma stayed home with your older siblings and got them off to school .
We got pictures of happy big brother and big sister too .
I think you look like your dad 's side of the family already .
The cheeks .
You look a like a screamer too . :P
I think the screaming you get from your mom 's side .
One of these pictures your dad took of your exhausted mom holding you suggests she is just thrilled to have another screaming child in her ear .
She loves you so much .
You can't even imagine .
Your dad is sending us pictures through out the day of you .
He does it on the pretense of sharing you with the whole family , but I think he secretly could take pictures of you and watch / stare at you all day long .
He adores you .
You 're probably going to be the last baby on this side of the family .
Unless your mom decides to have another kid .
Or unless I , your aunt , comes up with a baby in the future ....
I would n't hold my breath for that .
There are 20 of us now altogether on your dad 's side of the family .
6 nephews / grandsons and now 5 nieces / granddaughters .
The boys were ahead for the longest time , but the girls have been catching up .
You made a nice round number of 20 .
It was either you or my potential husband making # 20 .
You won the race .
Perfect timing .
I was so excited for your arrival I went and bought some clothes for you already .
I gave your parents a onesie that says " My Aunt Loves Me " for you to wear as soon as you get here .
I told them I want a pic with you in it since I can't come see you anytime soon with COVID - 19 / quarantine and such .
The history books , newspapers , journals , social media will all say this year sucked .
2020 will always be remembered as the year that sucked because of illness / pandemic , death , fires , flooding , hurricanes , earthquakes , infestations , hatred , fear , protests , riots , etc .
A year when the world shut down .
I 'm sorry if this taints peoples ' view on your birth year , but hey , I 'm pritti sure everyone will remember it !
You are the great , wonderful , miracle we all needed this year .
You are our symbol of love and hope for the future .
Our joy .
No pressure .
I just read about a baby girl in Poland named Tikva during World War II .
a jewish name , a hebrew word meaning " hope " .
During times of turbulence and unrest we look for any sign of hope .
I can't wait to meet you .
I can't wait to hold a baby in this family , a baby that 's " mine " if you will , prolly for the last time .
Summer 's nearly over ( 117 ) by hellboy on 'i met a girl who sang the blues and i asked her for some happy news , but she just smiled and turned away .
I went down to the sacred store where i'd heard the music years before , but the man there said the music would n't play . '
Hard times are timeless ... how I dearly wish I was not here ( 55 ) by overrated on Inspirational Quote of the Day :
Come , Armageddon , Come
Summer of 2020 ( 69 ) by hellboy on This year is obviously ' for the arse ' as we say in german .
At least i was lucky with not losing my job until now and also my wife had the opportunity to do homeoffice and school our little one at home .
We had a quite normal summer holiday and now school will hopefully start again in two weeks so he will be able to come back to wisdom and knowledge after this turbulent year .
I think germany did quite well with the pandemic and is still ongoing doing a good job .
On the one hand the germans are still carrying that prussian gene with follow all orders of the government , behave and function .
On the other hand , this oldfashioned attitude is not implemented in all generations and a lot of people complain about these ' restriction ' we all have to bare .
I think it 's quite ridiculous to go on protest , because the government did a good job in healthcare and crisis planning .
But thats also german .
Complain complain complain .
My wife 's and my soul are in italy , where we plan to live , when we 're old .
It 's simple , relaxed and beautiful .
Just as you may know it from hollywood movies .
My thoughts are always with the american people , you have to suffer under a bad crisis management and you do n't have all the protection regarding job loss , healthcare and so on .
All the benefits , we germans complain about .
I saw that ' meme ' the last days again , in which they worte down a timeline of our grandparents :
Started with ww1 when they were children , world business crisis in the 1929's , ww2 when they were young adults , nuclear strike and korea war , vietnam and cold war .
That is so true .
I never understood , why my grandmother , which was a woman out of a good house and had a good education married my grandfather who was a farmer .
She told me then , shortly before her death in 2007 that she just never thought he would come back from war .
They just married so she would have the security and he so that he would have a goal to keep hanging on .
She did for herself the right thing after the war and stayed with her husband , which she really didnt know .
Most important thing , she never stopped appreciating life , however poor it was with luxury .
She handcrafted picture frames out of the plastic covers of chocolat candy and she worked her garden for the vegetables .
She always said , she would never , ever chose that life again , but was still happy .
With all these struggles , we have in these days , and there will be surely more to come on for all of us : we should never , ever give up on appreciating life .
Never stop wondering how beautiful the sky is and how sedulously a bumblebee is just carrying on , even if it is just for on summer .
I could cry sometimes , for no particular reason .
I love cuddling with my son , when i bring him to bed ad night .
I enjoy him reading better with every word he is exploring in a book .
And i'm always stunned how much truth he is telling .
I wish you all the strength to carry on and to find something worth living for .
Life is n't over .
Life is ongoing and we are just the bumblebee carrying on for one summer .
now this mark remains and it will never ever go away ( 89 ) by dolefulutter on I wish I could 've stolen a kiss .
You have the most beautiful eyes , and an even more beautiful spirit .
Sitting beside you in silence has been the best first date I 've ever had .
It 's strange , but that 's when I knew you were someone special .
In the middle of a global pandemic unable to touch with 2 metres closing in between us , I felt butterflies in my stomach once again .
I 'm realy happy to have met you .
Although many friends have attempted to reassure me many times that I wo n't have to settle for someone or be alone forever , you made me realize that someone like you actually does exists .
I do n't know much about you , but the little I do know made me hopeful .
You made me feel alive .
I wish the best for you and I hope you ultimately choose to give me a chance with you .
All in divine timing , you once said .
I 'll carry that with me as I await the verdict on your relationship with this lovely lady who waltzed back into your life .
Until then , I 'll have to keep looking .
Faith ( 105 ) by daysleeper on It never rains , but it pours .
No sooner had I finished furiously writing out my years - belated and repressed grief for Loryn , than I found out that Faith had also committed suicide .
On the second Friday in June. 12 years to the weekday after Loryn .
I met Faith here on SitDiary , 18 years ago .
Her username was silentears , and her favorite book was The Perks of Being a Wallflower .
Faith was a poet , an artist , a sculptor , an all - around creative .
They were compassionate , loving , a little bit crazy , and absolutely gorgeous .
I had the hugest crush on them from the pictures they would occasionally post .
We added each other on myspace , livejournal , and eventually facebook , and against all odds , we kept in touch .
Sporadically , since we both had our mental health issues and difficulty reaching out .
When we were teenagers , Faith and I used to discuss our experiences with mental illness , processing our traumas together across the internet and writing notes and poetry back and forth .
We truly understood each other 's thoughts and ways of relating to the world .
We would constantly talk on AIM , exploring our feelings and how to deal with them , Faith sharing their art that gave such beautiful creative expression to their innermost feelings of pain , hope , love , desire , and wonder .
I remember one conversation where Faith told me they did n't remember all the details of some traumatic events , just that certain things had happened and been forgotten .
I remember about 9 years ago randomly going to livejournal , though I had n't in ages , and reading that Faith was pregnant .
I remember being so scared for them during that pregnancy , as I knew that Faith had never had the opportunity to have a healthy and stable relationship , and that it would be harder for them to get out of the relationship with their baby 's dad , a guy I did n't really trust .
I never trusted anyone to be good enough for Faith .
Maybe it was because I was secretly in love with them since we were 12 and 13 .
Faith never regretted having their son , a beautiful and wonderful child who inherited his Mama 's love and compassion for others , and who looks so much like Faith .
They were such a good mom , always putting in the work and effort to make sure that he felt loved and safe .
Until the last few months .
A few months back , Faith had a major mental health crisis .
Some things in their life were going on , and triggered some of the other things .
They got diagnosed with DID after a suicide attempt , and they were working so hard on trying to recover but facing so many obstacles .
They still could n't remember all the details of that trauma we had talked about so many years earlier , and they tried desperately to fill it in .
They had a psychotic episode and fought hard to get through and out of it .
They were trying to rebuild .
Trying to be the Mom and artist and friend they knew they could be .
But some part of them was always suicidal , always had been .
And at some point , that part of them took control and ended their life .
I have n't really had time to process this yet .
I was just in the middle of processing this other catastrophe .
I am so hurt and broken from all of it , and everything I am going through with all of this just hurts so much .
My body physically hurts right now .
I miss being broken together .
Very few know the pain of dissociative amnesia and can talk about it , the way Faith did with me .
It 's a cruel and terrible process .
The past is stolen from us , and we have to fight every day to hold on to the present , and that shimmering sliver of hope for the future .
I am so unfathomably sad that they ended the fight where they did .
Diagnosis is the beginning of hope , the beginning of a new era of recovery , but it is always darkest before the dawn .
I can't feel any of my emotions right now except as physical pain , because I know it would be too much to bear emotionally .
Faith , I love you .
I miss you .
I hope that I will find both you and Loryn again .
I know that my soul knows where to find you .
1495 ( 186 ) by wednesday on Family Vacation .
Road Trip 2020 cuz what else you gonna do this year ?
Nothing like testing the limits of your love by taking a long road trip together .
It 's like the Grinch stole Christmas and all the Whos in Whoville sing anyway .
Well , we created memories and it was fun .
A moment to be marked down in history for this family .
I need a vacation long enough that I forget all my passwords .
There should be sympathy cards for having to go back to work after vacay .
Loryn ( 49 ) by daysleeper on I never got to tell you
I love you .
You are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen .
You have the only smile I will ever need to see .
When you kissed me on the swings with your slightly crooked mouth that so perfectly mirrored my own , it would have been my sexual awakening .
But I was being molested at rhe time .
The feeling I had in my nether - regions triggered what I did n't know then was a PTSD flashback .
I associated sexual pleasure with being taken advantage of by wicked men .
I did n't know how to act or what to say to you .
I was sure we were both too young to be interested in sex and romance , and you were 3 years younger than me .
I wish I had said , would you wait for me ?
I wish I had said , someday I will be ready to be loved by you in every way .
I wish I had said that I fell in love with you the moment I met you , even though at that time I had no idea what sex or romance were .
I wish I had told you that one of the top reasons on the list of why I wanted to be a boy when we were little was so that someday I could grow up and marry you .
I did n't know about lesbians yet , back then .
But I could n't get any words out with any meaning , so I rambled dumbly , clumsily pointing out that we are too young and I do n't even know if I like girls or boys or anyone that way yet .
And you cried and ran away .
And I came back , either later or the next day , because you were my best friend and I loved you and I was going to tell you about being molested and I was going to ask you to hold my hand and help me tell your dad so he could protect me , since my family had failed .
But you had locked yourself in your room and you would n't talk to me , and your dad did n't let me go up and see you , even though I begged him and I told him it was important .
He said you told him to send me away .
And I kept being molested , every time I visited that house where we were neighbors .
And I never got to tell you , that 's why I stopped coming over .
It was n't because I did n't want to see you .
I got so dejected and numb and shut off to the world that I forgot anything existed outside the hell that was home and the hell that became of my second home , the place where I felt safe and alive , the place where I got to see you .
And I never undersrood why I so clearly remembered my aunt asking me if I was gay , as we drove past your house .
At the time when she asked , I had forgotten that you had kissed me that day on the swings .
Everything from that time was so jumbled .
I did n't even remember that you lived in that house .
I did n't remember that I had a friend who I loved and who loved me .
And I told her I was n't gay .
I did n't think I was , anyway .
Not at the time .
I never got to tell you that our chance backyard meeting , when you were at your grandma 's house and I was at some relative 's house , just on the other side of the fence , was the happiest moment I had had in months , and having to say goodbye so quickly was the worst I had felt in years .
We did n't even have time to exchange phone numbers .
Or maybe I gave you mine .
But I can't remember if you ever called me .
Until you did .
And when you called me , I still did n't remember that we had kissed , but hearing your voice flooded me with excitement and then dread .
I was so happy to hear from you , but it was so out of the blue , and I had taken a suicide prevention training class in high school because I knew how it felt to want to die and I wanted to help other people survive long enough that we could all get out of our parents houses and start our own lives .
When you called me I still lived with my horrifically abusive grandma .
I was 19 .
I must have been 19 , because I recently found out that 's how old I was when you died .
It must have been that night .
Because I remember now , though I 'd forgotten for many years .
I remember hearing so many of the telltale signs , so rapidly .
I remember you asked me if I remembered something .
I bet the question you asked was if I remembered the time we kissed on the swings .
I could n't remember it then , it would have been too traumatic - I had so suppressed and stuffed and pushed aside my reactions to the sexual abuse of my childhood that anything that reminded me of it in any way had to be locked out of my conscious memory , so I could survive .
I remember that I started to tell you , I was going to let it all flood out because I needed to keep you on the phone .
I had missed your voice so much .
I missed you so much .
I said , " to be honest , I ca n't remember much of my childhood , bec - - " and I think you were crying and I tried to say wait please hold on I need to tell you something I need to talk to you I need you I love you but again you ran away and said goodbye so soon .
And I ran to the living room and I said , " Grandma I need to borrow the car , it 's an emergency " and she said no , and I said " I think my friend is going to commit suicide . "
And I told her about the warning signs that I recognized from training .
I do n't know how she stopped me .
I was ready to grab the keys and yell " call the cops I do n't give a fuck " and sprint out the door to you .
But I can't remember what happened .
I do n't know if I ever had the keys in my hand and if I ever did I do n't know how she could ever have stopped me .
Maybe I could n't find them .
Or maybe I did find them .
She minimized the situation , she said you were n't going to do it .
I do n't remember how she stopped me .
I know I did n't believe her .
I remember laying in bed awake all night , scared .
I think I tried to * 69 you but it did n't work .
I did n't have your number .
I did n't have your address .
I do n't know if I called 911 .
I could have .
I might have .
I do n't remember .
I did n't know your address , but I knew the address across the street from you .
I do n't know what happened .
I do n't know if I could have gotten there in time .
I do n't know how you did it .
I do know I never heard from you again .
I do know you were 16 when you died .
It was a Friday the 13th .
I do n't know why I was n't at work .
I worked on Fridays when I was 19 .
If I had been at work and missed your call , would your need for closure have prompted you to wait another day ?
Would you wait for me ?
I remember not remembering .
I do n't know when I forgot the terror of that night .
Was it when I finally , exhausted , fell asleep under the grey dawn skies ?
Why did n't I go to your house that night ?
Why did n't I try to go check on you the next day ?
Why did n't I find out what happened until 12 years later ?
I went on living as if it had never happened .
I probably went to work the next day .
I probably studied for finals that week .
Why did n't I look you up , all those years ?
I mean .
I did .
But I did n't remember your last name .
I did n't remember how you spelled your first name .
Even though at your birthday party at the bowling alley I listened to each of your parents explaining the spelling to people and why they chose it and why it was meaningful to them .
I remember my aunt making some comment belittling unconventional spellings of common names , but I thought it was cool .
I did n't even remember that you were 3 years younger than me , even though I must have known how old you were turning each time I went to your birthday parties .
I never got to tell you those were the best parties I have ever been to in my life , to this day .
I never got to tell you I wanted to spend every day of my life eating cake with you and showering you with gifts and decorating easter eggs and swinging on the swings even if it was raining and laughing together and admiring your perfect dimples when you smiled .
I never got to tell you that you set the foundation for my taste in women and men for my whole life , and I 'm pretty sure it 's because I always only ever wanted you .
I never got to tell you I 'm sorry I did n't steal the car and speed directly to your house .
I do n't know if I would have made it in time .
I do n't know how you did it .
I do n't know if it was fast or slow .
I know you did n't know I loved you .
I think you thought I did n't .
I 'm so sorry you ever felt that way .
I never got to show you I loved you .
But I love you .
From the moment I saw you I have loved you and I will love you until the day I die .
I have missed you since I was about eleven , even when I did n't know it was you I was missing .
And I will miss you until the day I die .
I stopped being a Christian long ago , but from what I have read , you were Christian when you died .
So I prayed to the Christian God and I asked for us to be together in the next life .
I begged , and I cried , and I finally started to grieve .
Because I remember .
I remember now and I hope I never forget again .
I love you , Loryn Nicole Anderson .
The world has been without you for 12 years and 9 days .
I have been without you for about 23 years .
I will never stop missing you .
At least not until I can see you again .
Would you wait for me ?
Untitled ( 168 ) by lastchance4sanity on April actually got even worse that following week if you can believe it .
I have a brother who causes issues with the choices he and his family make and some things came out that caused a huge rift .
In a way the rift is the same size except me and the rest of the family now know what it really is .
None of us have seen them in years ... we try ... but there 's always an excuse .
Now though my sister and I have plans for a Yellowstone trip and they might be part of it .
Only time will tell but hope springs eternal .
My plan is to be positive and open to healing and when they 're ready I 'll be waiting .
Of course 2020 continues to feel like the end of days lol but at least my town seems to be doing well .
We just got a notice that someone is Covid positive in my building ... so we will see how that goes .
We 're locally seeing a spike but it feels like no one is talking about it and we 're all moving forward with reopening ....
Untitled ( 321 ) by madeforsilver on Slowly falling out of love with the person I thought was my person has got to be the most heartbroken I 've ever felt .
After eight years , I 'm not sure where or how to restart .
1493 ( 170 ) by wednesday on Grandpa passed away during the night .
I was going to go see him .
We all thought he 'd last longer on hospice .
I even bought him flowers .
But I was too late to say goodbye .
I wish I could / knew how to put pictures in journal entries .
I only have pictures to describe how I feel , I have no words right now .
Maybe The Little Prince can help , as he has helped me title my journal site here ( " Such a secret place , this land of tears " ) :
" You run the risk of weeping a little if you let yourself get tamed . "
( tamed = create ties = love )
clarity ( 63 ) by perfectblue on it's been a little over two months and we 've kept clear of nonsense .
I am proud of us .
In the first few weeks I would have dreams where I would make mistakes and I remember feeling a great deal of shame and sadness .
Had I actually tumbled , I am sure the intensity of the feelings would be multiplied eight - fold .
I love my brain , my languages , and being present .
These treasures will be preserved .
Now there 's someone very dear to me that 's in danger .
It 's crazy , it 's like my subconscious has been preparing itself for decades .
I 've heard a great deal of people assert that there is this flow of water , " do n't go against the current " .
It is mad to go against the current , I understand that now .
I can not be in control , I can only respond and even then those actions must be taken with great care and consideration .
The truth is that I care .
I am fine with saying it and writing it .
To love is to be generous .
Just as when a word is repeated , unmeasured generosity can lose meaning as well .
Love .
To open up my heart is to welcome vulnerabllity .
Hahaha my thoughts .
I can see the patterns .
The flags are waving .
The time to plan is here .
All I can do is express compassion , offer an analysis , and plant as many seeds as possible .
I have death on my side .
I can say this because I have taken that path and I know what I would do in the case that it were a possibility .
I am aware that my actions can create a ripple effect .
I can also say that the acceptance of death is freeing my essence from the box that is my ego .
I will not be consumed by my ego again .
I must find my way through these distractions .
The words will come .
I must read more and learn as much as I can so that I can organize the words needed to share the seeds .
What is the objective ?
Share the seeds .
I am not the person that is control of the reaction or repsonses ...
I will learn to let go .
I accept death .
I accept life .
I have been on both ends of that spectrum and have made my way out of that prison .
I am here . [ 932 ] trampoline ( 514 ) by katgirl on another year , another update .
i should remember to do all my vague blogging here instead of on twitter or tumblr , except if i do that , then i do n't have the satisfaction of you seeing it .
i can't believe the only closure i needed was to know that you still think of me .
the satisfaction of that is sweeter , because i do n't think about you .
sometimes , maybe , but so much less than i did last year .
i do n't even miss you .
time does heal all wounds , i guess , even if it takes more time than i think it should .
you still think about me , enough to check my tumblr once a week for the last year .
what were you looking for ?
what were you hoping to see ?
did you send her every post that you thought was about you ?
what 's it like , being unable to move on and be an adult ?
what 's it like still feeling so petty when you were the one who dumped me ?
cannot relate , and thank fuck for that .
you 're going to live in your parents house for the rest of your life , not because circumstance forced you ( i think you could be something if you were able to commit to anything ) but because the other options are too difficult .
it 's too hard to tell your parents you have a girlfriend .
it would be too difficult to live together , even live in the same city .
you are incapable of having an adult relationship because having an adult relationship means accepting that sometimes , you 're wrong and you cannot have that .
i know i did some things wrong .
not the things you think , of course , but i should 've set better boundaries at the beginning .
i just could n't concieve that you would devolve so quickly into someone i did n't know and furthermore , did n't want to know .
my mistake for giving you too much credit when everyone else around me could see the writing on the wall .
ah well .
i'm going back to school .
i want a bachelors degree .
i want a masters degree too , but right now i want a bachelors degree so i can apply for the jobs i know i can do .
i want it to prove that i'm smart enough and hardworking enough and just overall enough .
i can do it .
i'm not stupid or lazy .
concerta was a gamechanger .
knowing about adhd is a game changer .
it does n't fix everything ( stares pointedly at the pile of plates on the table ) but now that i know at least i can deal , you know ?
i can cut myself a break .
i can come up with better strategies to handle it .
i can think through and solve the problem , and i'm very good at problem solving .
there is nobody better in a crisis than me either .
i felt very alive when i had to help move the entire office out for corona in like 4 hours .
i'm good at that .
sometimes i want to make friends with someone so bad that i forget how to be like .
cool .
like i'm not a cool person by any means , but i can at least usually hold a conversation but this bitch got me like .... here let me scour pinterest for something funny to show you so i have an excuse to start a conversation .
she writes better than you ever did .
that might not be true but , you know , i'm a sucker for a complicated fake relationship .
the fun part did come back .
it took time , and it will never be what it was with you , but you know what ?
what it was with you was n't real either .
not really .
looking back , you left me hanging a lot , especially the last two years ; at least with these people , i do n't have the same expectations .
it 's nice when someone likes your writing so much they specifically request you for something .
i feel like ... i do n't know .
something i have n't felt in a while .
well - liked .
i always know i have friends , and i love my friends , and i would never trade any of them for anything but sometimes a girl just wants to feel like ... kind of popular ?
it 's nice .
feeling wanted .
i forgot about it for a while .
anyways .
my head hurts and i should go to sleep .
i sleep easy these days ( when i go to bed on time ... quarantine got me fucked up ) .
~katja 13 Years ( 230 ) by hellboy on today , thirteen years ago , i got a phone call at 5 am .

Fare thee well , ' Bap ' world is a lonelier place without you .
1491 ( 114 ) by wednesday on " Over in Killarney , many years ago
my mother sang a song to me in tones so sweet and low
just a simple little diddy in her good old Irish way
And I 'd give the world if she could sing that song to me today
Oft ' in dreams I wander to that cot again
I hear her softly hummin ' to me as when she did back then
I I fell her softly huggin ' me as in days of yore
when she used to rock me fast asleep outside that cabin door
Too ra loo ra loo ral
too ra loo ra lie
too ra loo ra loo ral
hush now do n't you cry
Too ra loo ra loo ral
too ra loo ra lie
too ra loo ra loo ral
that 's an Irish lullaby " 1490 ( 80 ) by wednesday on Aftershocks are still happening since the 5.7 earthquake .
Yesterday a 4.2 aftershock about 9 pm .
Update : Apr 16 : Another aftershock at 4.2 mag at 7:40 am .
I felt that one while getting ready for work .
Got internet for the house for the first time in my life .
One for the history books .
Internet for the first time in 2020 .
Call it a birthday present .
Takes nothing less than a pandemic for me to be willing to pay for internet .
Lots more things to do when I 'm bored , a way to connect to people so I do n't drown in fear or depression , opportunity to take some online classes , and giving me the opportunity to work from home if I need to .
Did I mention internet is a huge time suck ?
Partly the reason I did n't have it before .
My birthday is coming up .
Feliz 's birthday too .
Kinda sucks to watch a 7yr old have a virtual bday party and lack of presents .
I went out and bought lots of presents for her just to spoil my baby girl .
She 's not getting much else .
A birthday party with her siblings and cake and ice cream .
Jackie just had his virtual bday party that they particpated in .
Nicky says the worst part of a virtual bday party is no cake and ice cream for party guests , only the birthday person .
I 've been gorging on desserts this week .
By the end of COVID - 19 I think we 'll all have gained 19 pounds .
Stress eating and celebratory food for my bday since nothing else is gonna happen on my bday .
That 's my story and I 'm sticking to it .
Kind of mourning my bday or lack thereof .
I usually go out and do something special , something fun .
I was planning a little stay - cation within the state , a long weekend , but not anymore ...
Now its a perpetual stuck in my house thing .
I 've expressed my depression of my birthday and my age to others and they have surprisingly stepped up in trying to make me feel better about it .
I appreciate it .
I feel cared about .
They know I like excuses to travel , do things , have fun , and how sad it is for me when I can't .
Its like they know me a little bit .
On a positive note my stimulus check from the government came today direct deposit .
Hey , if Trump is giving out money to stimulate the economy into working again ...
I 'll take it .
Since I 'm not travelling this year I guess I can focus on paying off my mortgage .

" Millennials are not partying .
We and our anxiety issues are holed up working from home , watching Hulu , and yelling at our parents not to go outside .
It 's Gen Z you want . "
" A note to society : Please stop saying that Millennials are behaving irresponsibly and risking the spread of the virus by springbreaking in Florida .
Most of us Millennials are in our 30's , have n't had college springbreak in 8 - 12 years , have bad backs , and are sitting in our makeshift home offices trying to teach our older colleagues how to videoconference .
I do n't know who those kids are on the beach , but it ai n't us .
Our student loan debt would n't even allow us to take a week - long vacation ... "
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
How weird is 2020 ?
It 's April 15th .
The IRS just sent me money ....
the big Q ( 158 ) by skrewedangel on todayhas been another day of high emotions .
i guess we are all a little more than frustrated with being trapped in side .
all of the time .
bad enough theres a virus .
theres also shit weather .
tediously dreary weather that just seems to make the situation even more depressing .
im not sure .
what to say or do .
not even for my own down mood .
the brd seems under the influence again and my anger piled with emotional delay seems to be getting the best of me .
Things I Did n’t Text My Ex ( 124 ) by lastchance4sanity on " I miss you "
" How relieved are you you 're not quarantined with me and a six month old right now ? "
Yes , I am a superhero of restraint .
Untitled ( 88 ) by lastchance4sanity on So " Monday 's " suck right ?
Things that are true about last Monday
- It would have been my moms 60th B - Day
- My grandma died ( not corona just old ) and I can't do anything because ...
- It 's week 3 of stay home
- Mr. Beliez gets sent down south probably wo n't see him for 2 months minimum
- My computer crashed
I got the news as I was headed to work I thought I 'd be ok but as my sister and I texted about it everything was coming into focus about how utterly crazy everything feels and how out of my control everything seems .
My brother , sister , and dad all live too far to go to the funeral ... and I 'm too far to be useful .
I can go to the funeral , which I hope we will still be able to have .
I will be 3 miles from my last living grandparent who will turn 90 in July and I wo n't be able to visit her .
Most of my office has left to work from home , there are lots of logistical problems with my job but I 'm trying to do the best I can .
I 'm staying in touch as much as I can ,
trapped ( 106 ) by skrewedangel on it seems like a weird state to be in .
stuck in between panic and not panic .
the purgatory of emotions .
this virus is travelling around and at first it was a joke .
a conspiracy theory wrapped in memes .
now .
i see the list of those dying keeps growing .
the list of infected doubles .
by the end of this week .
what will we be facing .
if it was just me i could not care less .
but .
it isnt just me .
its my tribe .
if something happened to one of them .
i know my rage would explode .
i know what it feels like to have your heart ripped out and handed back to you .
i have been there before .
but .
never let them see you sweat .
we stay inside .
we keep to ourselves .
we hold on .
we hope for the best .
Blast from the past ( 81 ) by shesamaverick on Uh , so I just found this online journal that I had when I was in high school and well ... what ??
Who knew that I 'd rediscover this nearly 14 years later ?
I am sufficiently embarrassed and incredibly emotional ?
Ah , well I 've enjoyed this trip .
Maybe I will return 14 years down the line .
( If I survive .
Apparently there 's a pandemic and it's making half the country sick and we 've been quarantined for the past two weeks which is why i found this )
until the future ... later days
If the world was ending youd come over , right ?
( 103 ) by lastchance4sanity on I put on an Apple Music playlist that seems made for me called in my room ... the first 3 songs just embody my feelings lately
everything I wanted Billie Eilish I had a dream
I got everything I wanted Not what you 'd think And if I 'm being honest
It might 've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly ( fly )
So I stepped off the Golden , mm Nobody cried ( cried , cried , cried , cried )
Nobody even noticed I saw them standing right there Kinda thought they might care ( might care , might care )
If the world was ending by JP Saxe and Julia Michaels
I know you know we know you were n't down for forever and it's fine I know you know we know we were n't made for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending you 'd come over , right
You 'd come over and you 'd stay the night Would you love me for the hell of it All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending you 'd come over right
The sky'd be falling and I 'd hold you tight
And there would n't be a reason why We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending you 'd come over , right Right If the world was ending you 'd come over , right Right
Dancing with your ghost by Sasha Sloan
I stay up all night
Tell myself I 'm alright Baby , you 're just harder to see than most I put the record on Wait ' til I hear our song Every night I 'm dancing with your ghost Every night I 'm dancing with your ghost
Never got the chance
To say a last goodbye I gotta move on But it hurts to try
Untitled ( 77 ) by lastchance4sanity on Well 2020 , you already were n't my fuckin favorit but cudos to you for taking it to an unforeseen level .
While Mr. Belize are n't in a capital R relationship it is currently the relationship keeping me sane .
He 's quite possibly a sex addict but in the absence of a Xanax prescription and my gym being closed he 's my primary stress reliever .
It does n't hurt that he thinks I 'm hilarious and he 's a great listener .
He 's really my only person here in this very lonely time .
I 'm a bit worried I will loose him in the next month or so because he is a respiratory therapist for the national guard .
But at this point he has n't been sent anywhere .
He is getting very tempting offers from all over right now though that honestly I can't believe he has n't taken .
One offered 4,000 / week and would also pay housing and food .
With him getting accepted into PA school for the fall it seems too good to pass up to me .
It 's incredible to me how many people think we 're overreacting and that it's " just " a bad flu .
Bad flus do n't do what has happened in Italy .
It 's not hypothetical there are real time examples of how fuckin bad it can get .
A friend argued that Italy is an older population than the US , which is accurate - but we 're a sicker population with less equality in access to care .
So we very likely more vulnerable .
Our 40 - 60 year olds have heart disease and diabetes in insane numbers so while they 're not " old " they 're just as vulnerable as a healthy over 65 year old .
Boomer ... it 's coming for you .
Also ... what does it say about us that we suddenly find ways to shelter the homeless when it seems beneficial to the health of the rest of us ?
Maybe it was n't as unsolvable problem as y'all have been saying .
Maybe this will be the thing that makes people earnestly develop ways to make Universal Basic Income happen .
... or maybe next year at this time it will be a distant memory we all repress .
1488 ( 127 ) by wednesday on And just to make 2020 even more interesting ....
Woke up to an aftershock from a 5.7 magnitude earthquake at 7:09 am .
Aftershock I felt at 7:15 am being 3.7 magnitude .
A generous shake to the house , but not really violent like closer to the epicenter / main quake .
Enough to wake up most of the state .
My phone went off for a little while after that with family asking about me .
Some people say bad timing in the middle of the coronavirus issue , but because of the virus we had most of the community shut down and started quarantining already so not everyone was out and about and there 's another reason to stay home .
Well , given the stores are empty , we should all be good with at least 72 hour kits .
Still feeling aftershocks , hours , maybe days , after .
Kinda making me motion sick .
No fatalities .
Minor damage .
Assessing structural damage at this point .
The worst it seems to be a mobile home park shaken off their foundations with gas and power issues .
Many people displaced because of structural issues ( so much for home quarantine ) and power is out for approximately 40 K people .
All the while , with this latest upset , we are all still trying not to get the virus .
Coronavirus hit more close to home and a week later an earthquake .
We will recover .
One day at a time ...
Corona , what else ?
( 115 ) by hellboy on It is weird , that it takes a pandemic to connect people worldwide with their feelings and behavior .
The germans did n't have a lockdown or school closing since the WW2 and most of them do n't accept it .
As i can see on TV , a lot of young people still meet up in the park and having ' corona parties ' .
I guess that is just the youth , dancing on the edge , still not realising , that life is n't endless at all .
I 'm quite happy to live on the countryside , my wife is at home since Monday and teaches our little one at home .
We have a friend with two sons living in our village , that is so far the only contact were having atm .
We have the opportunity to go to the forst , through the fields and meadows , look at the closed down playgrounds ( they really put fences up ) .
We will have a BBQ this evening , the weather is georgeous today and it was yesterday .
We stocked up some food , alcohol and toilet paper of course ;-)
I even ordered some seed for beans , cabbage , salad , carrots , tomatoes and herbs yesterday and will plant something in our garden , just for the case ...
I regret , that i did n't finish the chicken coop , so we do n't have chicken , but well .
They say , the food stores and everything else necessary wo n't be shut down , so i try to trust this halfway .
What i wanted to say is , i really do n't want to live in the big cities right now , clamped into your flat , with maybe a small balcony and no green or fresh air .
I think after this crisis , a lot of people will move back to the countryside .
We also have a small Cabin in the woods where we can go inbetween and just see something else , make some fire with the kids , so they can still have their freedom .
It is funny , i always liked the solitude and it did n't really change , even in this situation .
What i realise often during the day is , how that virus is going through every winding of my brain , just the thought of the virus so far .
Everything is careful in my mind , everything is concerned .
That is really the hardest thing for me at the moment .
What if ?
What then ?
and so on .
skrewedangel asked what is gonna happen if we do n't make it ?
I think we will make it .
And i hope we will learn from that , how important it is to take care of each other , show respect and step back sometimes for the elderly and weak .
Im still proud of you and your reached goals .
No booze !
Good one !
Like to read good news at the moment .
Also thank you , Wednesday for sharing your thoughts and concerns here .
I 'm glad we all can share our headaches here .
- be well all .
1487 ( 92 ) by wednesday on I was just commenting on the Coronavirus from my point of view so far , as some of this reaction and media is raising my anxiety , not to the point of hoarding TP and hand sanitizer and noodles , but still it helps me feel better to write things down , get it off my chest so to speak .
The facts and my feelings so I can separate logic from my emotions .
I appreciate hearing about others ' experiences also , so I do n't feel so alone .
It helps to know other countries are doing similar type of lock downs and hearing about their coping mechanisms .
I do feel for the victims and those that have succumbed to the illness .
This came suddenly and spread fast , catching people off guard , little time to react and dying as a consequence .
Victims of time , or lack thereof .
I recognize that shutdowns will slow the virus , which is imperative right now , so we can take this on one day at a time and not collaspe the health care system and economy .
I too do not feel the pressure of trying to protect and feed a family during these times and I can see how that might be the cause of some panic .
It 's just me and I can take care of myself .
I feel for the businesses and those workers who live from paycheck to paycheck .
Work is all Americans really know .
They do n't know what holiday / vacation is .
So I can see this impacting them in many ways as a result .
I feel for all the businesses out there who make bank this time of year on St. Patricks Day but have had to close its doors .
I support all these decisions to prevent and protect , but I do think the hoarding and panic is a little out of control .
I 'm not the only one who thinks so when our government leaders are asking the public to calm down .
Grocery stores are still open and will continue to be so , they just want to you to stay at home as much as possible and only wander out to the grocery store when needed .
It 's social distancing , avoiding situation , not completely disappearing , extinction situation .
Not a bunker down and never come out situation for the majority of people , so far .
I 'm afraid it will get worse before it gets better though and I feel recovery time is going to be a long road for the country , for the world .
This is just the beginning .
After 9/11/2001 there came the recession for years and this virus might bring similiar consequences , but globally .
The financial bailout with similiar results may come .
It is all a cause and effect chain and it will effect us all probably for a long time .
We definitely need more National Prayer days .
Maybe there 's a nicer way to say calm down ....
Let 's not forget what is most important .
the world is on lock down ( 96 ) by skrewedangel on here we are .
waiting to see how much longer or how much further these regulations go .
im hoping the stores dont close .
because then people will really panic .
worse .
im grateful that im sober .
facing this situation .
our money by now wouldve been spent even more .
on booze .
the weed is next .
im striving for complete independence from all of this nonsense .
i hope we succeed .
but .
why shouldnt we .
ive been free from my first love .
for a half of a year now .
i should be able to stop smoking shitty weed .
overpriced .
shitty weed .
i hope all of this nonsense passes quickly .
but .
what if it doesnt .
what will become of us .
1486 ( 124 ) by wednesday on Dear Diary ,
The beginning of 2020 began with the Coronavirus ( COVID - 19 ) a strain of the flu we 've never seen before and therefore have no antidote or vaccine .
It started in Wuhan China , in a seafood market they say , and it is spread , I believe , like most common illnesses with the coughing , sneezing , touch , etc .
It 's symptoms seem the same also " fever , cough , shortness of breath " , a general not feeling well .
Honestly I 'm not sure how they separate it from any other common cold or flu other than testing it .
This flu is fatal , just like the normal flu does , but this one tends to take down the older people , esp who have had previous health issues " underlying medical conditions " like respiratory issues or who are immunosuppressed .
People in their 60's and older are dropping dead .
But most recover from Corona , like the normal flu .
And on the subject of testing , because of how rare this random strain is and how fast it spread in China there may not be enough testing kits as it spreads throughout the world .
But I 'm sure the CDC is very proactive when it comes to that .
It spread from Asia to Europe to the US .
China and Italy I believe got hit the first and hardest .
The only solution we have so far is isolation .
Quarantine . 14 days they suggest .
People on the cruise ships got a lot longer vacation than they anticipated .
The old folk 's homes , rest homes , retirement communities , hospice , BEWARE .
Maybe this is the world 's harvest and reaping of the baby boomers and elderly off the earth so something else will happen , something bigger , something glorious .
I 'm trying to talk like the dooms dayer people .
But on a worldwide scale it has infected over 100,000 and killed thousands .
Jan 11 2020 was the first death from the virus , a frequent customer at the seafood market .
Jan 20 , 2020 was the first case in the US , a man in Washington .
Of course they wanted to keep all that awesomeness in China , but they quickly learned this was going to be a global issue , which was declared said global health emergency on Jan 30 , 2020 .
The next day the President restricts entry into the US from China or anyone who has been there the last 14 days .
Then there began the deaths outside of China .
Feb 5 , 2020 was a mass exit from China .
Run for your lives !
China is going to kill us all !
They have a huge contaminated population they can't contain !
There were little upsets all over the world at the beginning of all this about eating at Chinese restaurants or interacting with any chinese person or participating in the Chinese New Year or other cultural activities .
Oy vay .
On a side note , Mother thinks China is testing in chemical warfare tactics and accidently created something and it got loose .
Some people think this was created and released on purpose .
Trump thinks it was to thwart his presidency and re-election this year .
Cuz it 's all about him .
The first American died in Wuhang while living there on Feb 11 .
Feb 15 was the first death outside of Asia , a chinese tourist in Paris .
( and boom !
There goes Europe ) But then Feb 23 , Italy is in an uproar with incoming illness .
By Feb 27 people are considering cancelling major events that have to do with large crowds .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints discouraged attendance to their semi-annual General Conference here in the state , esp international travelers , and soon other Utah state companies followed suit with their major events , asking people to stay home if at all possible .
On Feb 29 ( leap day ? ) the first person to die in the US because of the virus and the governor of Washington declares a state of emergency .
We 've had the virus in the US , and we 've had an American die , but this is the first American to die IN the US .
As far as ties to my home state , we had Utahns from Tooele and St. George quarantined and eventually ended up contracting the virus , but they were on a cruise ship by Japan at the time .
But they were the first Utahns to be diagnosed with the virus on Feb 14 .
March 5 , 2020 is the first person to be tested positive in my home state , Utah .
A man coming back from a cruise ship tested positive just hours before the Governor declared a state of emergency .
( He did n't know we had a case in the state at the time )
By declaring such it helps with funding to prepare , to be on defense for when it does hit our state .
By then the other cruise ship passengers from Utah had come home and were in quarantine and taking test after test until they passed .
March 10 , a second person tested positive in UT .
Of course , President Donald Trump is all up in arms and is ready to solve this problem .
How ?
The American way .
Money of course !
Throw money at it .
8.3 billion to be exact .
Okay okay the money is helping to make testing kits and find a cure .
I guess .
But of course , Trump does n't want to go down for this tanking his country so he throws his VP under the bus and tells him to be in charge of this virus thing .
Some say the VP is not very good at public health crises .
By March 9 , the stock market has taken a plunge sending the economy into a dither .
The worst since the global financial crisis of 2008 ( The recession , I remember clearly ) .
In response , Americans ( I 'm sure the rest of the world is responding just as enthusiastically ) went into a panic and raided ALL the stores of ALL their hand sanitizer , cleaning products , cold medications , bottled water and even the toilet paper .
The last two do n't even make sense to me , but okay .
The fear is protecting yourself from others and therefore you need lots of hygiene products I guess .
The CDC ( Centers for Disease Control ) came out early on giving the normal speech they do during the regular flu season of avoid touching , cover your mouth when you cough , wash your hands often .
We all roll our eyes and continue our lack of hygiene like usual .
But now !
The people have interpreted the CDC as practically screaming " Do n't touch each other !
Do n't touch yourself ! "
Do n't breathe on each other .
Do n't cough , clear your throat or sneeze !
Hang out with your friends at 20 feet apart .
It has become common place to apologize for shaking hands on accident now .
Isolation will be next .
If did n't have social issues before .... we definitely will now .
The General Surgeon asked people to stop buying masks ( as they do not effectively stop the spread of the virus ) and the people that actually need them for daily procedures do n't have any because the public went into a panic .
They now have restrictions on how many medications and masks you can buy .
My dentist could n't order his usual order of masks and his reason is legit .
He deals with peoples mouths , salvia , noses , faces , petri dishes of bacteria .
Personally though , the impact of all this did n't sink in for me until Wed March 11 .
The President interrupted normal TV broadcasting to announce a ban on travel from Europe to the US .
First China , now Europe .
Nobody can come to the US for 30 days , with some exceptions .
( And he was worried about the Mexicans )
This news sent families fleeing off airplanes while on the tarmac .
The same day the Church announced General Conference to be via technology only .
No one in the building .
But the kicker for me was the breaking news was that Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz basketball NBA team tested positive for Coronavirus .
Just before a game !
Which caused an exodus of the arena and the cancelling of the whole NBA season .
During March Madness !
I thought for sure , if the NBA has quit then the US is going down .
Up to this point people are considering cancelling certain things and discouraged from large gatherings , but with this announcement of suspending altogether ...
This was big .
I could feel it .
And everyone followed suit .
The next day everyone is sending out mass emails cancelling everything , universities are going online , businesses telling employees to not come to work but to work via online while at home , to customers telling them they will help them via the internet , telephone conference , or video .
Even the Church cancelled everything on the books ( til April 13 is the date most ppl are going with ) .
TV shows like Jimmy Fallon are not having audiences anymore .
Mandy Moore interviewed with Jimmy and performed on tv in front of like 5 people and the Roots band .
Donovan Mitchell , another Jazz player , tested positive the next day .
And the stock market is said to be the worst they say since Black Monday of 1987 .
Within hours of the Wed night announcements , the stores were raided yet again for said products as before but now also the food , moreso the shelf stable foods .
I have n't been to a store since Monday when I bought lots of food for the Relief Society activity we probably should n't have held .
But my roommate has been and she 's seen the long lines , many shopping carts to one person , and the empty shelves of everything .
I 'm sure Costco was crazy on March 12 , 2020 .
The fear now being they will have to self quarantine for weeks , if not months , and they need all the food to take home and survive , ride it out .
They talk about " postponing " ( cancelling everything ) for a few weeks and some have stretched it out to 30 days , so I 'm not sure if we 'll all be isolated for 14 or 30 days or even more .
Nobody knows the timeline so therefore they prepare by emptying the stores .
Better safe than sorry .
Ironically , by March 13 the stock market took a little boost , I ’m assuming with all the consumers buying out the stores the last 42 hours in mass hysteria .
Friday the 13th !
Everything and everyone is spiraling very quickly I feel like after March 11 .
Feeling the impact moreso in the U.S. now , moreso in my home state .
I mean they cancelled church !
The WHO ( World Health Organization ) declared this flu a pandemic .
114 countries reported 118,000 have contracted Covid - 19 .
Nearly 4,300 people have died .
In the US just over 1,000 cases been diagnosed and 29 people have died .
( Facts in this entry I 've gathered from the news , cuz ya know , the news never lies . )
This feels like closer to the end to me ( even then though it does n't feel detrimental to me yet ) than any other time I 've been alive .
I survived Y2 K , essentially the " end of the world " , the recession , natural disasters plaguing the country , financial emergencies , etc .
Nothing really , compared to those who survived the wars and depressions .
The consensus around here is this is all ridiculous , the panic is unnecessary , and the world is not ending .
There 's maybe 3 people in UT with the virus and we have more warning and instruction than China did .
We are considered brave to go into work now .
But now having a less risk state / country shutting everything down and creating a ghost town essentially out of caution already has made me feel just a little uneasy .
CALM DOWN PEOPLE .
a round about day ( 123 ) by skrewedangel on i dont know what it is im supposed to be doing with my life .
ive spent so much time doing so little and so much drinking that thats all that i think about or know .
and now im waking up and finding out that this sober life isnt as i thought it would be .
nor is it the worst .
but im not nearly 28 anymore or even 35 .
and time seems a little more important these days .
i wish i had a friend .
a real friend .
one i didnt have to be pretend around .
one that wasnt so easily tired or offended .
someone different .
but i guess thats what everyone wants .
someone different like me .
someone different like them .
are any of us really that different tho .
really .
1485 ( 112 ) by wednesday on Watching my roommate being unemployed coming up on six months now is making me want to fly away from here .
If I were unemployed for six months I would n't sit around the house .
I 'd go to another country for at least a month .
So not everyone could afford to go play for a month or more , but both she and I have the means ( $ ) and she prefers to be homebound ( even tho she declares to be a traveller ) .
I could n't sit at home all day like she does .
I 'd go crazy .
I 'm going crazy just watching her .
Imagining all the things I would do , the places I would go , if I did n't have to go to work every day .
I 'm saving up for something big one day tho .
When the boss retires I 'm taking at least one month off and then maybe a few more trying to find another job .
I dream about Italy , Greece , Scotland , Ireland ...
Boring tourist stuff .
But still .
History is important people !
Take a train and zoom through as many countries as I can in Europe before I run out of money .
Italy , Switzerland , Austria , Germany , Belgium , Netherlands all the way up to Denmark .
Copenhagan maybe .
Or Greece up to Bulgaria , Romania , Hungary , Slovakia , Poland .
Sigh .
Dreams .
Well I 'm not dreaming about traveling currently with the whole coronavirus ( Covid - 19 ) out there spreading throughout the world .
I 'm glad I do n't have any overseas trips planned this year ...
So for now I 'll stick with dreams of NYC , Niagara Falls , Canada , The Redwoods , other National Parks in all the states as soon as I learn of them ...
.... maybe avoid Washington state for now ...
This song describes my roommate perfectly .
Another dream ; to get rid of her .
Maybe there 's some ethics of kicking an unemployed person out the house and totally cruel to make her move back home with her parents , but maybe it 'll get her butt in gear and stop being lazy and picky and just take whatever job she 's offered and place she can find .
Way too comfortable being jobless .
" I 'm in love [ I live ] with a girl I hate ,
She enjoys pointing out
Every bad thing about me
I 'm in love [ I live ] with a critic and a skeptic
A traitor ,
I 'd trade her in a second
She 's a backseat driver ,
A drama provider ,
An instant update of the world
She 's a first class liar
A constant forgetter
( She 's attractive , but bitter ) "
- She 's a Lady : Forever the Sickest Kids

I think this song applies to another person I know of also , but I do n't know him very well .

Valentines Day 2020
Said guy was at the gym doing more exercises and exerting way more energy than I normally see him do throughout the week .
I figured it was because its VDay and there 's no one to go home to or take out .
I 'm in the same boat .
I know how he feels .
Maybe feeling bummed .
So on my way out , maybe it'll make him feel better about life , I wrote a quick note that says " I like your face " and put it on his car .
( We 've left the gym at the same time a few times so I knew which was his ) A harmless little Valentine , if you will .
His car has n't been seen since that fateful day .
He 's still at gym .
I see him there .
But his car is no where to be found .
Sooo ... ?
Did I take it too far ?
Or is he just super paranoid ?
A coincidence ?
It was supposed to be a flattering note .
On a holiday .
Not a stalker note .
Randomly during the year .
Maybe he's had stalking issues with other ppl at the gym before ?
( maybe he 's so conceited he thinks its a stalker situation ?
Maybe he thinks every girl that flirts with him is a committment monster ? )
Maybe my note implied I knew where he parked , what he drove , what he looked like and I might know where he lives next ?
( And I thought girls analyzed things too much ) Maybe his car died that day ?
Maybe he felt pinpointed when I could 've wrote that note like 10 times and put it on 10 other cars and he'd never know ?
Its been a few weeks now and I think HE 's the one taking this " Valentine " thing too far .
Seriously .
Did he get a new car ?
Park blocks away ?
Taking public transportation now ?
Is he suspecting everyone at the gym and giving everyone that talks him the evil eye ?
Does he have a list of suspects ?
Wow .
He seems a bit touchy .
But that only makes me want to push his buttons more ....
I should feel bad .
I should leave him alone .
But it just makes me giggle so much .
Whatever will be will be ( 104 ) by lastchance4sanity on My best friend and I went to NYC over the last weekend .
It was a pretty good trip overall .
I had never been so it was nice to do something new ... it was my first real trip without Brian though and by the flight home I 'm not sure if it was exhaustion or what but I was a bit of a mess .
Luckily it was late and dark on the plane and my friend was all about minding her own business so I was able to sit there and silently cry with no one noticing at all .
On one hand that was a relief because how do I explain what 's wrong ?
But on the other hand it compounded the loneliness that I feel even when surrounded by and in close proximity to other humans .
I 'm trying to move on ... I really am ...
I have Mr. Belize who though he's not in it for the long term is someone I enjoy talking with almost as much as sleeping with - he listens really well .
Then there 's Mr. HR who is at " the place in his life " that honestly I would want a man to be - he 's 40 , good job , just bought his dream family home and is looking for something serious .... but idk ... there 's something he 's holding back and trying to cover up - maybe it's not a big deal but it 's something ....
Then there 's the ever - present Angel ... who idk what he gets out of it , Idk what I really get out of it ... but we do it ... maybe just habit ??
Then there 's a date with a new guy coming up , Idk how excited I am ... but it 's more options I guess ... just working the numbers at this point , right ?
I tried to daydream about having kinds when talking to Steph in NYC and she was a complete downer ... not even entertaining the possibility of it not being horrible ...
I 'm just terrified the opportunity is / has passed me by and that 's maybe one of the harder things in life : dealing with the possibility that some dreams may never be .... Oooooooooo ( 146 ) by daysleeper on I finally learned the chords to my song

Feb 14 2013 - Feb 14 2020
It 's been 7 years in this house I bought when I was 24 yrs old .
I think I " own " 20 % of the house now .
After 7 years .... man... you'd think I 'd have paid off more on the mortgage by now .... ( I suppose I spent my money travelling instead )
Happy Valentines
Day to mmeee .
I had new carpet put into the house on 14th and signed my life away the day before .
So I had n't moved in yet and only one piece of furniture in the house , super tall , handmade , wood table .
But the Seller / bank left the oven and microwave appliances , so I came home with a pizza and nothing to cut it with .
I shared the pizza with the carpet installer .
Poor guy .
I just had the utilities set up that day so the place was freezing cold in the middle of winter so we cranked up the heat and all the heat went upstairs and he about died putting in carpet by the time he got up the stairs .
Wait ,
How long does carpet last ?
I still had to get a fridge and washer / dryer .
I had to replace the water heater a few years later .
I hope I do n't have to replace the furnace or A/C anytime soon .
Yaaayy home ownership ....
I bought me a house for Vday in 2013 , I bought myself lasered eyes for my Bday 2013 .
And Vday 2015 I bought myself a car .
My Bday in 2016 I went to Paris and stayed up in the Eiffel until my Bday was over .
My Bday 2018 was the Hawaii trip , but I did n't get to go until June .
Maybe my gifts to myself paint me as a little high maintenance .
Screw it !
I earned that money , saved it , and I deserve those gifts .
I feel with house prices the way they are I 'll never leave .
I can't afford anything else on one income .
The only way I got this house was because the U.S. was in a recession .
The only reason I 'd want to move is the whole HOA issue though .
Never buy a place with an HOA .
Never again .
The condo is just the right size , place and price for me .
I could do with some better neighbors tho ...
But that 's always rolling the dice every time you move .
I could do with a new roommate , scratch that , I 'd be happier with no roommate , but I do like her money .
I 'd like a roommate with four legs .
I like roommates that are n't so ... verbal .
I think men and cats fit that category .

" I 'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin ' if I 'd get there quicker if I was a man
I would be complex
I would be cool
They 'd say I played the field before
I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay
For me to do
Every conquest I had made
Would make me more of a boss to you
I 'd be a fearless leader
I 'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What 's that like ?
They 'd say I hustled
Put in the work
They would n't shake their heads
And question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing , if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

Untitled ( 118 ) by lastchance4sanity on I feel another sexual revolution coming on ... it has been almost 2 years since I really hoe'd it up by my standards .
I 'm going to sleep with 3 different guys by the time the week is out ... and 2 are already regulars .
Is it fulfilling ?
No , not really .... at some point for just a moment I realize I 'm closing my eyes and imagining Brian .
Sex is nice ... kind of refreshing and revitalizing ... but it does n't hold a candle to making love ....
Even their experience is different ... they get flexible and uninhibited - which is great , I 'm sure ... but they also get the cold brick wall of emotional unavailability .
Regular Meg is sexy .... but Vulnerable Meg is a drug .
I 'm a little worried about the new one ... idk that I can avoid doing a little damage when it ends .
Fuck it all up in one night ( 244 ) by taxi on I just want to be okay .
I 've got the opportunity now .
I 'm going to Colorado . < 3 . Formative ( 231 ) by madeforsilver on The Format is getting back together for a few shows and one of said shows requires only a short trip from St. Louis to Chicago .
I am ridiculously happy and excited and it 's bringing about all kind of nostalgia .
A very important person in my younger life introduced me to them .
I fell in love with them as my young heart fell in what I knew to be love with him .
I believed I related to some of their more angsty lyrics about drugs and alcohol and suicide ( I did n't ) .
I now relate to their lyrics about moving on and loving friends and loving life and dealing with bullshit ( I do ) .
One of my first concerts was The Format .
My first tattoo was Format lyrics .
David calls their music " too hipster - dipster " for his liking .
Everyone has their flaws .
They broke up 12 years ago and my 21 - year - old heart was shattered .
But now they 're back .
And my best friends in Wisconsin and I are going to see them again .
And I 'm so happy .
Thanks again , Nick .
Who Am I Even ? ( 115 ) by lastchance4sanity on A doctor at work today told me that life has peaks and valleys and it's important to be strong in the valleys .
Stand firm .
Do n't waver .
You 'll be high on a peak again one day .
Lately I 've been looking around at my life , my world and I 'm surprised at the loneliness .
It 's one of the lonelier times of my life , I think .
I have friends , I do .
I have plans .
I 'm doing things ....
I 'm dating ...
I 'll go to NYC with a friend in a few weeks ... work is going alright ... my family feel distant but they 're okay .
One day I 'll be high up on a peak looking back on this valley thinking how lovely it looks from far away .
it 's real ( 121 ) by perfectblue on i did n't dream it up - all of it is real .
although i feel a great deal of guilt and shame , I also feel relief and peace .
i can't change the past but i can see it from a different lens .
this shift is fair , compassionate , and not absolute .
That gives me peace .
knowledge can be painful if resistance is blind .
in the end what is done is what counts .
yes , i've continued with my habit .
i've let go of soul - crushing practices .
i have a plan which is more of a roadmap with several forks .
when i get there I 'll work on making a decision - i'm taking this one step at a time .
i could go back and apologize however I do n't have the desire to .
in fact , I am at peace knowing that my feelings have been shown .
in short :
do n't expect any help from me , be satisfied with my attendance haha .
generating happiness for you was never my job .
your counselor can help you with that - there 's not enough money or light in the world to get me to take on that task for you .
let me go ; like really let me go - we ain't hanging out or even talking for more that three minutes .
and finally to everyone : leave me alone .
2020 ( 238 ) by hellboy on let 's start something good .

1483 ( 364 ) by wednesday on October / Columbus Day 2009 - 2019
My 10 year work anniversary for this office .
I do n't know how I feel about that .
Untitled ( 342 ) by lastchance4sanity on About 6 months ago a once close friend from school confirmed that her marriage of 12 years had ended and the father of her three children and the man she thought she was going to do ministry with had walked away from their family ....
I remember talking to Brian about how shocking and unsettling I found it .
I had always admired them as a couple .
I patted myself on the back a few days ago because I cry only about once every other week now ... which I was counting as great progress ...
I ’m not quite as obviously depressed - I ’m hanging out with people , working out , even volunteering ... but I ’m still very ... very ... sad ....
My friend posted today about how happy and at peace she is with everything and it ’s been hard but she ’s seeing how much better things are now yadda yadda sunshine and sugar plums ...
REALY ??
She ’s over the dissolution of 12 years and I ’m over here still mourning my 9 months ( though I and most should say the sadness is usually about the loss of what might have been not what actually was - which is so so so true ) Untitled ( 454 ) by notlaudable on I ’m slightly embarrassed that the last several posts are all me it ’s a very intimate look into my days and it makes me self conscious .
But between the lack of anything interesting in these posts and the fact that I need to learn to share , I ’m letting it be .
Today was much better .
I woke up early and shared coffee and puttered around a while .
Finally I managed enough productive juice to prime some panels and then I spent the better part of the day worrying about what to do with booth .
I never came up with a solution but I looked at it a while .
Never came up with a framing solution either .
It lets me know that I ’m not actually as unproductive as I think .
I just engage in a lot of creative procrastinating .
Or at least that ’s how I feel today .
If there ’s anything I ’m sure of it ’s that I ’m not often sure of anything .
I took Caity to PT and we managed not to fight .
I started work on a self portrait I can use for merch and hopefully I ’ll manage to get some things nailed down .
Maybe tomorrow I ’ll work on logo or business cards .
I know Caity said she would work on it but I tend not to trust the quality of what I ’ll get back .
After dinner I decided to take some time to chill out and decompress .
I may be slightly late to sleep , but it was nice to spend some me time .
Untitled ( 188 ) by notlaudable on I 've decided to take the week and wake up early .
The original plan was to schedule everything and attempt to make and stick to very conscientious decisions .
I have n't taken the time to sit down and plan anything though .
Yesterday Caity and I got headed home from my parents late and when we got home I decided bed would be a better place than trying to find some closure from another argument .
We 've taken to fighting a lot and I want to assume it 's just the budget .
But i worry that it 's something more .
I do n't think I 'll know until later so it 's nice for now that it seams like something Caity is working on .
The other thing I decided I would do is make a point to write every night as a way to wind down from my day .
It will also let me look at my mental state as I attempt to change my sleep schedule for a minute .
Today was awful .
I 'd hoped to get something big on my Urban Arts fest to - do list checked off .
I 'd really hoped for either booth walls or frames .
Instead I spent the day arguing with Caity over how it should be done and not really getting anywhere .
It took until 5 or so for me to give up working and she spent some time taking pictures of my old works while I stewed .
We finally aired some dirty laundry and decided to take some distraction time before she headed to bed .
The last couple hours have been alright but I 'm still exhausted and no closer to having a plan .
I guess I 'm off to try and get some sleep but I do n't feel ready for any of it .
Untitled ( 218 ) by notlaudable on I always love staying up way too late .
That point in the morning when everything else is quiet and your brain is slowly losing the fight against reality in favor of some sort of half delusioned optimism .
Everything seems more meaningful .
More like things felt when I was a kid .
Somebody once said that to live a purposeful life it helps to have a defined narrative of what your life has already been .
I wish I could say I have a narrative but mostly I just think it was a shit show .
And I do n't see that changing any time soon .
Money has been pretty tight lately and Its really been dragging me down .
Aside from that I feel like there is n't any room for me to breath .
To be me .
I 'm not sure who that is anymore .
I spent a lot of my life trying to be some sort of " good . "
But the more I tried to be good the more I realized I was doing it for some sort of reward and I was n't getting anything in return .
Losing that part of me that strived to be vaguely wholesome is equally as exhausting .
Maybe the truth is I just want to be noticed .
Maybe I 'm just rambling Untitled ( 310 ) by lastchance4sanity on This weekend would be a year from when I met Brian ...
It ’s also when I would have been due ....
The family is getting together this weekend to celebrate and plan for my sisters engagement and I ’ll get to spend time with my one month old niece .
I am so incredibly happy for those things but I fear it will just be pouring salt in this wound that is not healing .
The suffering of temptations ( 404 ) by hellboy on Hey there .
Long time no write .
My little one started his school career now and he is in the first grade now , yay :-)
He is growing up so fast , turning 7 now this year , i cannot believe that time flies so fast and leaves nothing but memories .
On the one hand it is really nice seeing him growing up and learn new things , experience and develop to the gron up human he is becoming in a few years .
On the other hand you really realise how mortal we all are and how you self grow older and will vanish one day .
He said some days ago to me that i surely will become 1 Mio years old and live forever .
Anyway he wants to have my clothes when i'm dead and i told him he could have the half of them and share the other half with his brother .
He is quite a rebel in school and we already had the first notice of the teacher within one week : he thought it would be a great trick to just lock up all the toilet doors from the inside and crawl underneath the open space .
So hell yes , he is definitely my son ...
My wife is still very into her control - force about me .
I understand that , due to my history and the history of writing with other women .
But it is getting on my nerves .
I dress better lately and wear what i like , i found out that waistcoats are quite nice and wabash pants and everything from the 30s to the 50s .
She lets me now , after she tried to change me the last 12 Years .
I saw some beautiful mothers in school and they recognized me .
I take that as a compliment and will not try anything else .
I think i've learned my lessons .
But one of them with this ice grey eyes .
She is a classy woman , i guess end 40 .
She is the center of every room she enters , a really beautiful woman .
Oh my .
Well he ´re i can write that and let it out a bit .
Work is mostly boring .
I have a managin position right now and just tell people what to do .
It doesnt make me happy to work like that , as i dont recognise it as work .
Strange um ?
In my last vacation i renewed the facade of our house with red wood .
Never done that before and it turned out quite nice .
Looks a bit like the houses in sweden .
I enjoyed that .
Next project will be to newed the kitchen .
After that it will be close to winter again and i'll have to manage the firewood .
Strange that i cannot be satisfied with what i achived here in my ' job ' .
I watched ' A Star is born ' and i have to say i was totally impressed .
The music , the actors and the story itself was great .
I woke up with one sentence the older brother tells the musician at one point about his dad :
' The only thing he did for you was making you his drinking pal '
I 'm really afraid , even though my dad did this already with my mum , that i will follow his steps and become an alcoholic one day .
I crave sometims for a cold beer after work or just to come down in the evening .
My wife is strict enough to say i'm not allowed to drink during the week .
I have to be careful with that .
I know how quickly i got used to pot back in the days .
That 'll be it so far .
Love you all .
- be well Dear Nick ( 309 ) by dolefulutter on i do n't know why you 've been on my mind lately .
i've since been able to stomach the idea that i wo n't find someone like you .
it was expected .
i'm aware that you 're not unique .
there 's a million versions of you running through my mind , and a million more that i've crossed in my daily life , but i'm fighting a cold , my thoughts , and my feelings and i do n't have the guts to fight tonight .
you left , and took with you , the heart of a 24 year old me .
come to think of it , maybe that 's what i'm really missing .
unfortunately , whether i miss you or the heart , the result is the same : i still think about us from time to time .
i've been reminded over and over not to dwell on regrets , can i just dwell on your aging face ?
let 's not get back together and borrow each other 's mind for a bit ; we are overdue .
the library is about to close and you are my favourite book .
all this to say ,
I love you ; do n't ever change .
Heaven help me ( 312 ) by iplaygames on Said whoa . '
A blindside .
a hook to the ego
you hit me with the truth of where our
friendship died .
when you stopped believing in me
when i stopped hiding behind our friendship
I think youre my first love .
Connecting with another at the realest level
shared experiences .
Miles apart .
living together
until we met eachother .
I miss you .
I might hate you .
Can your best friend be the love
of your life .
in the most platonic of ways ?
or your worst enemy .

XNA : Makes Games Programming Easier , Not Easy .
January 29 , 2009
This is in response to the article over at TechRadar.com entitled “ How to code games for the PC and Xbox 360 ” by Paul Hudson ( published in PC Format magazine ) .
I ’m all for the promotion of the XNA framework but TechRadar ’s take on this is completely out of touch with reality .
I ’m still not convinced it ’s not being intentionally sensational ( the sub - heading does make a claim of “ unlimited riches ” ) but since the article does seem to go into genuine detail , I ’m going to give a genuine response .
To sum it up , the article claims that games programming is suddenly easy thanks to XNA and anybody who tells you otherwise , including those in industry , is a lying idiot .
Now maybe you think I ’m being sensational here , but in Tech Radar ’s own words :
We get asked this question a lot : “ What ’s the best way to start programming ? ”
Some people like to buy books .
Some people like to get a computer games programming degree .
But they are – and we do n’t want to put too fine a point on this – stupid .
The article goes on to say how you can make anything in XNA , mentioning Halo 3 as an example , and have it work on the 360 to boot .
What gets me is the author clearly has done a least a little cursory research in preparing this .
He mentions the Xbox 360 having a “ curious superset of shader model 3.0 ” .
They do n’t print that on the front page of creators .
xna.com , so either the author actually does have some experience developing with XNA or else they ’ve picked out some choice phrases from someone else who has the experience and is no doubt weeping softly in a corner after reading the resulting article .
Other infuriating excerpts :
[ … ] we ’re not going to explain to you what every line of code does , because , quite frankly , it ’s irrelevant .
Do n’t worry about debugging for now – a wise man once said that debugging is harder than coding , so if you write your code as cleverly as you possibly can , then you are – by definition – not smart enough to debug it .
The rest of the article goes on to explain how the sample “ tutorial ” project works , though it ’s glossed over to the point where it ’s not worth reading .
There are so many other better resources out there for learning the basics of XNA , including ziggyware.com and the creators .xna.com website itself ( and its forums ) .
So the article is n’t very helpful ; what ’s the big deal ?
There are three main problems :
1 . It misrepresents games programming
Contrary to the article , games programming is n’t about stealing code from others , ignoring the debugger , and making the next Halo .
It really is as hard as people say to make a AAA game , even with massive budgets and large teams .
Comparing the ease of drawing a few sprites on screen with developing a modern real - time engine is a disservice to the industry .
2 . It fails to promote XNA properly
How you can have an article devoted to XNA development and completely fail to mention the XNA community at creators .
xna.com is baffling .
I ’ve mentioned it three times already .
The article does n’t even provide any sources of follow - up information for budding developers .
The days of developing in a vacuum are long gone .
If the intention is to “ sell ” XNA to readers , why not show them where to get more tutorials , projects , documentation , and community help ?
3 . It misrepresents XNA
XNA ’s great .
I love it .
But it wo n’t make a game for you , nor should it .
You ca n’t make a decent game without understanding how to code , nor would you be able to get it onto the Marketplace thanks to peer review .
XNA is only a framework and as such , it ca n’t possibly have everything a budding game designer might want .
Texture loading ?
Sure .
Skeletal animation ?
Not so much .
I can look past the half - hearted jabs at the games industry , forgive the useless tutorial and the lack of any pointers to helpful resources .
But I ca n’t look past encouraging enthusiastic newcomers to ignore learning how to code and making wild claims about the capabilities and ease of the XNA framework .
That sort of advice is what sends kids ( and adults ) off to try it out only to get frustrated and give up once they hit their first roadblock .
It can turn them off programming , much less game development , for years , if not forever .
Teach them how to do things properly and give them access to they help they need ( and they will need it ) .
Sorry lads .
Games programming has gotten easier , but it ai n’t easy .
Mr Raju said he would subject himself to the laws of the land
The boss of Satyam , India 's fourth - biggest software firm , has quit after revealing false accounts including some $ 1bn ( £ 663 m ) in fictitious reserves .
Chairman Ramalinga Raju apologised and said " the gap in the balance sheet has arisen purely on account of inflated profits " during several years .
He said he was subjecting himself to the laws of the land and would " face the consequences " .
India 's benchmark index fell nearly 7 % on the news , as Satyam stock shed 82 % .
In a letter to the board of directors , Mr Raju said that neither he nor the managing director took any money from the company and did not benefit in financial terms following the " inflated results " .

He added that no board member had been aware of the situation the firm was in .
" What started as a marginal gap between actual operating profits and the one reflected in the books of accounts continued to grow over the years , " said Mr Ramalinga 's statement , which was sent to the stock exchange .
" It was like riding a tiger , not knowing how to get off without being eaten , " he said .
Satyam specialises in business software and benefited from the IT outsourcing boom .
Implications " We have to go beyond this letter and find out what actually has happened , " the Securities and Exchange Board of India told reporters .
" This is an issue which has very serious implications ...
It also raises the issue of authenticity of accounts that have been audited and certified by the auditors . "

Becomes official IT services provider for the FIFA World Cups , 2010 and 2014 Ramalinga Raju , Satyam 's founder and chairman , won Ernst & Young 's 2007 entrepreneur of the year award Hitesh Agrawal , head of research with Angel Broking , said : " Indian corporate governance standards have been put at stake here , the role of the auditors have also come under serious question " .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says analysts see this as one of the worst crises to have hit corporate India , at a time when the country was hoping to attract foreign investors looking for quick gains in emerging markets .
Our correspondent says many fear that the international community will now take a harder look at Indian companies and think twice about placing their money there .
' Fictitious assets '
The news comes after plans to acquire Maytas Properties and plans to acquire a 51 % stake in Maytas Infra failed .
" The aborted Maytas acquisition deal was the last attempt to fill the fictitious assets with real ones , " said the letter .
Mr Raju said a task force investigating the failed deal had been set up .
He also recommended to the board that Merrill Lynch be entrusted with the talk of " quickly exploring " merger opportunities .
BBC correspondent Karishma Vaswani in Mumbai says the consequences for corporate India are extremely dire , given that Satyam is not just listed on Indian stock markets , but was also the first Indian technology firm to list in New York .
Satyam said its managing director and co-founder B Rama Raju , Raju 's brother , had also resigned .
The company did not give any reason for the resignation .
Just three months ago , Satyam received an award from a group of Indian directors for excellence in corporate governance .

Table
Consider this problem : Fix a regular expression R. Suppose you have a string of length N.
There 's not much you can do about it , you 'll likely have to scan all N characters to test so see if the string matches R.
But once you 've performed the test , how fast can you test the string again if a small edit is made to it ?
It seems that in general you 'd have to rescan the entire string , or at least rescan from where the edit was made .
But it turns out that you can do regular expression matching incrementally so that for many changes you might make to the string , you only require O ( log N ) time to recompute whether the string matches .
This is true even if characters at opposite ends of the string interact to make a succcessful match .
What 's more , it 's remarkably straightforward to implement if we make use of fingertrees and monoids .
I 'm going to assume a bit of background for which resources can be found on the web : understanding some basics about monoids , understanding apfelmus 's inspiring introduction to fingertrees or the original paper , and you 'll need to be completely comfortable with the idea of compiling regular expressions to finite state machines .
As usual , this is literate Haskell .
But you need to have the fingertree package installed and we need a bunch of imports .
So let 's start with an example regular expression : .
We 're looking for " 007 " enclosed between parentheses , but the parentheses could be millions of characters apart .
A standard technique for finding regular expressions is to compile them to a finite state automaton .
It takes quite a bit of code to do that , but it is completely standard .
So rather than do that , here 's a finite state machine I constructed by hand for this regular expression : I 've used the convention that an unlabelled edge corresponds to any input that is n't matched by another labelled edge .
We can express the transitions as a function
The initial state is 0 and a match corresponds to state 5 .
We can test a string in the standard way using TryandWe can thing of the inputs as being functions acting on the automaton .
Each input character is a function that maps the automaton from one state to another .
We could use the Haskell composition function , , to compose these functions .
Butdoes n't really do anything , is just a closure that says " when the time comes , applyand thenOn the other hand we could tabulate our transition functions as follows :
We have one such tabulated function for each letter in our alphabet :
Given two tabulated functions we can easily form the table of the composition function .
In fact , our tabulated functions form a monoid withfor composition .
I used unboxed arrays for performance : Note that we 've cheated a bit .
An object of typecould be any array ofindexed by .
But if we promise to only build arrays indexed by elements ofand containing elements of the same range then our claim to monoidhood is valid .
Given any string , we can compute whether it matches our regular expression by looking up the correspondingin ourarray , composing them , and then checking if the tabulated function maps the initial state 0 to the final state 5 : This is slower and more complex than our original implementation of .
But what we 've now done is ' tease out ' a monoid structure from the problem .
If we store a string as a sequence of characters represented by a fingertree , we can store in each subtree the element ofcorresponding to the substring it represents .
Every time the tree is rebalanced we need to recompute the correspondings .
But that 's fine , it typically involves only O ( log N ) operations , and we do n't need to write any code , the fingertree will do it for us automatically .
Once we 've done this , we end up with a representation of strings with the property that we always know what the correspondingis .
We can freely split and join such trees knowing that thewill always be up to date .
The only slight complication is that I want to be able to randomly access the nth character of the tree .
apfelmus explains that in his post .
The change I need to make is that I 'm going to use both themonoid and themonoid , so I need the product monoid
We need to implementas in the fingertree paper
And now we can define our strings as :
The insertion routine is more or less what 's in the paper :
Note how I project out the size from the product monoid in order to insert at the correct position .
Here 's an example string .
Adjust the length to suit your memory and CPU horsepower : ( I use a strict form ofto ensure the tree actually gets built . )
The actual match function simply projects out the second component of the monoid and again tests to see if it maps the initial state to the final state : I recommend compiling with optimisation , something likeNow you can run this interactively .
Input values liketo insert an 'f ' at position 100 .
It can take a good few seconds to compute the initial tree , but after that the matching process is instantaneous .
( Actually , the second match might take a few seconds , that 's because despite thethe tree has n't been fully built . ) A suitable sample input is : Note there is quite an overhead for this example .
I 'm storing an entirefor each character .
But you can easily store chunks of string ( like in a rope ) .
This means that some chunks will be rescanned when a string is edited - but rescanning a 1 K chunk , say , is a lot less expensive than scanning a gigabyte file in its entirety .
Working in blocks will probably speed up the initial scan too , a much smaller tree needs to be built .
When Hinze and Patterson originally wrote the fingertree paper they were motivated by parallel prefix sum methods .
Just about any parallel prefix algorithm can be converted to an incremental algorithm using fingertrees .
This article is based on the idea of doing this with the parallel lexing scheme described by Hillis and Steele in their classic Connection Machine paper
So why would you want to match against a fixed regular expression like this ?
Well this method extends to a full blown incremental lexer .
This will lex quickly even if placing a character in a string changes the type of lexemes billions of characters away .
See the Hillis and Steele paper for details .
Note there 's nothing especially Haskelly about this code except that Haskell made it easy to prototype .
You can do this in C++ , say , using mutable red - black trees .
Three - and - a - half years ago , Israeli reserve Gen. Doron Almog was forced to flee Britain just after landing in London .
He had been tipped off about a surprise warrant for his arrest issued by a British magistrates court .
The charge : war crimes .
Now , as the recent Gaza war stirs up more accusations of offenses , the Jewish state and international human rights advocates are gearing up for more potential criminal cases against military officers and political leaders in Europe and possibly elsewhere .
But instead of international tribunals or the Israeli justice system , the main venue for the cases is expected to be European domestic courts that cite a legal approach known as " universal jurisdiction " that allows for the trial of cases of heinous acts , torture , or war crimes that allegedly occur outside their own borders .
Israelis consider the threats part of an ongoing political witch hunt .
Palestinians and humanitarian activists , on the other hand , see the domestic courts as the only forum to argue whether war crimes were committed .
" The systems in place across a number of countries will be tested ....
We have legal teams working across and beyond European countries " on behalf of Palestinian plaintiffs claiming war crimes , says Daniel Machover , an Israeli - born British lawyer who works in coordination with the Gaza - based Palestinian Center for Human Rights and pushed for Mr. Almog 's arrest in 2005 .
" There 's no other way a country under occupation or a land under occupation can seek justice . "
Mr. Machover also helped bring before a Spanish national court the case of the Israeli assasination of a Hamas military chief in 2002 .
That bombing allegedly killed more than a dozen civilians in a Gaza neighborhood .
Just last week , a Spanish judge announced an investigation , sparking tension between Israel and Spain , and spurring more speculation in Israel of war crimes efforts .
Dogged by a series of allegations ranging from targeting civilian locations to preventing the evacuation of noncombatants , Israel 's government in recent weeks reaffirmed a commitment to offer legal defense to soldiers and politicians implicated in the cases .
It has also decided to keep the identities of soldiers secret to protect as many as possible from prosecution .
According to Palestinian officials , more than 1,300 Gazans were killed and thousands wounded during the three - week Israeli offensive against Hamas last month .
The number of noncombatants included in those figures is disputed .
Only 13 Israelis were killed , most of them were soldiers .
In her debut address as the US ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice called on Israel to investigate the behavior of its military in the recent Gaza war and accused Hamas of its own violations for firing rockets at Israeli towns and working out of civilian areas .
An Israeli investigation is unlikely given the conviction by most Israelis that the Israel military did its best to limit injury to civilians .
Israel and the US say Hamas has broken international law by shooting rockets at towns and cities and using Palestinian civilian areas as a base .
Ironically , Israel was one of the first countries to invoke the principle of universal jurisdiction when its court system asserted its right to try Nazi chief Adolf Eichmann for crimes against humanity and war crimes during World War II .
Neither Israel nor the Palestinians , however , are parties to the treaty that set up The Hague - based International Criminal Court , making it difficult to mount a war crimes trial in that venue .
Instead , legal challenges to Israeli behavior have been made in domestic courts in Europe rather than international tribunals .
One Israeli legal expert dismissed the effort to try the war crimes abroad as an extension of a " media war " against the Jewish state for the Gaza operation .
Daniel Reisner , the former head of the Israeli military 's international division , says universal jurisdiction is being used to pursue allegations against Israel only and not Hamas .
" The danger to Israel now are those countries that have extra territorial jurisdiction that do n't have a nationality requirement , " says Mr. Reisner .
" The question is whether that is a major danger or a minor danger . "
A Belgian court considered in 2001 an indictment of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for his role in alleged massacres during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 .
But broad application of universal jurisdiction by third - party national courts without links to the alleged perpetrator or victims of the war crimes is a relatively recent development , and some European legal experts say it has n't gained traction .
Belgian lawyer Michael Verhaeghe filed charges against Mr. Sharon – a legal effort that awakened Israelis to the threat of war crimes prosecution in local European courts .
He finally convinced the Belgian Supreme Court to give his case jurisdiction and standing on a 1993 national statute , but the legislation was later revoked by the Belgian parliament .
The number of states in Europe and elsewhere that have the kind of universal jurisdiction needed to try war crimes by combatants of other wars in their own courts is in decline , he said .
Still , Mr. Verhaeghe believes the Israeli soldiers , if they have committed war crimes , " ca n't consider themselves as untouchable and safe as before . "
Neither of the cases ever went to trial .
On Jan. 29 , however , a National Court of Spain judge ordered an investigation into Israeli actions in the 2002 bombing of Hamas operative Salah Shehadeh that killed 14 others , including nine children .
Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer , who was defense minister at the time of the attack and was one of seven suspects named in the probe , said the court 's decision was " outrageous . "
" Terrorist organizations ... use the systems put in place by democratic states to sue a country fighting terrorism , " he said .

Writing for TheStreet.com on Friday , Doug Kass succinctly summarized just how bad the current economic environment is — even for those who have heretofore been thought to be the " best and brightest " of the investment world :
" [ T ]he U.S. “ economic Pearl Harbor ” has humanized and brought down to earth many of the smartest investors in the world ( e.g. , Warren Buffett ) , as well as the entire private equity universe , many well - regarded hedge funds and investors ( e.g. , Marty Whitman and Bill Miller ) , and some masters of the universe in residential and nonresidential real estate , among others .
Many industrialists , including Aubrey Kerr McClendon , Kerkor “ Kirk ” Kerkorian , Sheldon Adelson and Sumner Redstone , have been thrown under Mr. Market ’s bus , as have financiers Dick Fuld , James Cayne , John Thain and even Bank of America ’s … Ken Lewis "
The fact that this economic " Pearl Harbor , " as Warren Buffet labeled it , has ravaged many of the very best in the professional investment world ought to terrify all non-professional investors of the world .
Since there seem to be no investments in which even the best professional investors can find a reasonable degree of safety and security , this bodes ill for those of us who might delude ourselves into thinking we can " beat the market " or just ride out the storm .
The equity markets have been plummeting for over a year now , and the forecasts and earnings reports emanating from the corporate world only confirm that things will get much worse for the foreseeable future .
The bond markets are equally scary , with tell - tale signs of a bubble in U.S. Government securities , and China signaling that it is just about through buying up our government ’s rapidly expanding ( and increasingly risky ) debt .
With these ominous signs in mind , where can investors turn to protect at least a portion of their money ?
One answer to that question is to consider investing a portion of your portfolio in firearms — and I do n’t mean just buying a revolver to keep on your nightstand to protect the wad of green paper under your mattress .
I mean buying and holding firearms and ammunition that you anticipate will go up in price over the coming months and years .
There are several economic and political reasons why firearms can be reasonably expected to increase in price , and thus ought to make up a portion of your investment portfolio .
VIOLENT CRIME RATES TYPICALLY RISE IN RECESSIONS
One of the reasons why firearms and ammunition can be expected to appreciate stems from the relationship between violent crime and the business cycle .
As one might presume , violent crime rates tend to fall during the boom - phase of the cycle , and rise during the bust - phase .
( This is , by the way , yet another reason why we ought to be striving to eliminate the business cycle from the world .
See here for the instructions on how to do that . )
We are already able to see this relationship at work around the world , with violent crime rates expected to explode in the U.K. , and rise dramatically in the U.S. during this recession .
Take a look at Detroit for an indication of just how bad the violent crime rate can get during economic hard - times .
One would have to be crazy not to own a firearm of some sort in Detroit just for personal security purposes , and things will only get worse as the recession deepens .
Crime rates in parts of California already look Detroit - esque as well .
What all this means is that demand for firearms will likely rise as violent crime rates dramatically increase in the deepening recession .
And , a rise in demand for firearms will , ceteris paribus , lead to a rise in prices for firearms .
If we had a truly free market in firearm production in the U.S. , this rise in demand would be matched by an increase in production by firearm manufacturers that would bring prices back down at some point in the future .
Unfortunately , however , we do not have a truly free market in firearms .
On the contrary , there are a number of government - related factors that are likely to stifle new firearm production ( at least for the private - sector ) in the future .
First and foremost , there is the real possibility that a new " assault weapon " ban will be passed by the Democratic Congress and President .
A NEW " ASSAULT WEAPON " BAN ?
Barack Obama has made no effort to conceal his intention to not just reinstate the now - expired Federal assault weapon ban , but to make it permanent as well .
( See here , for example . )
Whether or not Obama plans to push through a new ban ( or , if this was yet another bald lie ) , is irrelevant to the price of firearms in the near future .
The fact that firearms manufacturers have a reasonable expectation that the ban might be passed is enough to keep them from investing in the capital equipment necessary to dramatically increase the production of firearms .
Why would Springfield Armory , for example , risk investing millions of dollars to increase the production of M1A ’s and XD pistols if the investment could instantly be made worthless with the stroke of a pen by Mr. Obama ?
They will no doubt attempt to maximize their current production with the capital equipment they already possess ( if they are not doing so already ) , but they would be taking a huge risk if they would choose to invest more money to expand production when the President of the United States has said many times that he wants to ban many of their products .
The same is true for every other firearm manufacturer .
Add to this the fact that gun-control advocates have been pressing hard for years for other gun laws ( such as legislation mandating so - called " smart guns " ) that will also require firearm manufacturers to invest more capital to retool ( and which will make guns more expensive ) , and you have all the ingredients necessary to keep firearms manufacturers from investing to increase production .
But there ’s still more .
Gun manufacturers are not in a position to anticipate what kinds of guns will be made illegal by a future " assault weapon " ban , so they cannot start investing in the capitol equipment necessary to produce non-assault rifles and pistols .
Who knows which guns the crackpots in Congress will outlaw this time , and what new " safety " features they will mandate ?
The definition of an " assault weapon " was arbitrary to begin with , and only God knows what the new definition will be .
All of these factors taken together indicate that it will be unlikely that firearm manufacturers will be able to invest the capitol required to increase the production of firearms substantially to meet the rising demand stimulated by the recession .
In a market filled with virtually complete uncertainty , such as the current firearm market , businesses are hamstrung by the state and are unable to make reasonable decisions that anticipate consumer demand .
The same is true for consumers , who have been buying guns at a feverish pace since Obama ’s victory due to their uncertainty about a possible Obama - sponsored " assault weapon " ban .
On the bright side , however , you can potentially profit from this government - caused debacle by putting guns in your portfolio today .
GOVERNMENT DEMAND FOR FIREARMS NOT LIKELY TO SLACKEN
Adding still more distortion to the firearms market is the government ’s own demand for firearms and ammunition for war - making purposes .
The American government is still bogged down in two hopeless wars of attrition utilizing massive amounts of guns and ammo .
These wars have partially contributed to the high cost of ammunition .
With U.S. soldiers firing over a million rounds of ammunition each year , this massive demand for brass , bullets , propellants and primers has , not surprisingly , caused ammunition prices to skyrocket .
There is absolutely no reason to think that this government demand for ammunition or firearms will slacken in the foreseeable future — especially given the fact that Obama intends to expand the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
In contrast to the production of firearms for civilians , there are absolutely no barriers standing in the way of increasing production to meet military demands .
A firearm manufacturer can invest in capital equipment that produces products demanded by the military and rest reasonably assured that the market will continue to flourish .
Expect gun and ammunition manufacturers to shift production away from the uncertain civilian market toward the governments virtually certain and insatiable demand for arms and ordinance .
CONCLUSION
There are very sound fundamental reasons for putting guns and ammunition in your investment portfolio .
The money required to get the firearm portion of your portfolio started need not be outrageous .
One way to start is to purchase as many Mosin Nagant rifles as you are legally permitted to purchase for the year .
These are very accurate and hard - hitting rifles that fire the cheap ( for now ) 7.64 x 54 R round .
Another option would be to consider getting involved in reloading ammunition .
Of course , if you are not looking for value investments , consider purchasing M1A ’s instead of Mosin Nagants .
Investors who choose to hedge their mainstream investment portfolio with a healthy dose of guns and ammunition are unlikely to be disappointed with future returns .
This is especially true since an investment in firearms can also be employed to defend one ’s life , liberty and property against thieves and politicians ( if there ’s a difference ) .
You definitely can’t say that about owning stock in Bank of America .

The U.S. economy contracted violently in the fourth quarter , with gross domestic product falling at its fastest pace in more than 25 years , economists said ahead of what promises to be a grim week of economic news .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Real economic activity fell off a cliff during the fourth quarter , producing a sharp drop in employment , output and spending , ” wrote economists at Wachovia .
And the worst part is that it ’s not over .
Economists expect another huge decline in the first quarter , with a smaller contraction in the second quarter .
GDP is expected to have fallen at a 5.5 % annualized rate in the final three months of last year , according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
That would be the biggest decline since the 6.4 % drop in early 1982 and one of the worst quarters in the post - World War II era .
The government will release its first estimate of fourth - quarter GDP on Friday , the culmination of a very busy week on the economic calendar .
See Economic Calendar .
Other major releases will include durable - goods orders for December , home sales for December , and consumer confidence surveys for January .

Mr. Kight and other unemployed workers said they were incensed to learn they were living in one of a handful of states  many of them among the poorest in the nation  that might not provide the expanded benefits .
“ It just seems unreasonable , ” Mr. Kight said , “ that when people probably need the help the most , that because of partisan activity , or partisan feelings , against the current new administration , that Perry is willing to sacrifice the lives of so many Texans that have been out of work in the last year . ”
He was referring to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas , who has said he may decline the extra money rather than change state policy .
“ I remain opposed to using these funds to expand existing government programs , burdening the state with ongoing expenditures long after the funding has dried up , ” Mr. Perry wrote in a letter to Mr. Obama last week .
The governors contend that once the federal money ran out , they would have to continue providing the new benefits , which they say would force them to raise taxes on businesses .
The federal money will end in two or three years in some states , or much later in others , depending on the size of the state allocation .

Proponents say that nothing would prevent states from changing the laws back at that time .
The anger at the governors ’ positions goes beyond just the unemployed workers who could directly benefit from the changes .
Because eligibility rules for unemployment insurance are complicated and vary by state , many unemployed people do not even know whether they would be affected .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp posted a loss of nearly $ 31 billion on Thursday for 2008 and said its auditors were likely to cast doubt on its viability as it seeks an expanded federal bailout to stay afloat .
GM burned through $ 5 billion in the fourth quarter and ended the year reliant on the first $ 4 billion in loans from the U.S. Treasury .
Quarterly revenue plunged by more than a third to $ 30.8 billion .
The automaker , which asked for up to $ 30 billion of U.S. government aid , also warned that its pension plans were underfunded by about $ 12.4 billion as of the end of 2008 .
GM ’s loss for 2008 was the deepest among Detroit - based automakers as industry - wide auto sales dropped to 16 - year lows .
Ford lost $ 14.6 billion .
Chrysler , controlled by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management , lost $ 8 billion .
The grim results came as GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner and other executives met with members of the autos task force headed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House economic adviser Larry Summers .
“ They are in fact - gathering mode right now , and so we are here in order to respond to their questions , ” GM Chief Financial Officer Ray Young told reporters on a conference call from Washington ahead of the meeting on GM ’s aid request .
Shares of GM , which have lost almost 90 percent over the past year , were down 1.6 percent at $ 2.51 at midday .
GM said it could receive a “ going concern ” notice from auditors when it files its annual report for 2008 with U.S. securities regulators by the middle of March .
GM , which took $ 6 billion in charges to shut down North American plants as sales tumbled , posted a loss of $ 30.9 billion for 2008 .
That was the second - largest loss for the 100 - year - old automaker behind the $ 38.7 billion loss for 2007 .
Over the past four years , GM has lost $ 82 billion and cut 92,000 jobs .
The combined loss is equivalent to about $ 56 million a day since the start of 2005 .
GM ’s auto operations burned $ 19 billion in 2008 and the company expects to burn through another $ 14 billion this year as it cuts output to run down inventories of unsold cars .
GM ended the year with $ 14 billion in cash , including the first $ 4 billion in taxpayer - backed loans .
S&P equity analyst Efraim Levy said GM ’s cash burn forecast for this year could prove too low because of the drop in sales and pressure on the supply base .

“ It reinforces for us the notion that GM will need multibillion government assistance to continue as a going concern , ” Levy said in a note for clients .
The automaker has received $ 9.4 billion from the U.S. government this quarter and has said it needs additional funding as soon as next month to avoid bankruptcy .
‘ CONTAGION ’ EFFECT
Slideshow ( 4 images )
GM ’s fourth - quarter net loss widened to $ 9.6 billion from $ 722 million a year earlier .
Dennis Virag , president of Automotive Consulting Group , said GM had a chance to restructure under federal oversight if the recession does not deepen beyond its forecast .
“ If the economy does not further erode and if we do see a pickup in the second half of the year , GM could foreseeably correct the situation with government funding , ” he said .
Analysts say the key to valuing GM ’s shares and debt is the progress the company is making in restructuring talks with creditors , including the United Auto Workers union .
Existing shareholder equity could be sharply diluted as bondholders and the union are offered shares in a recapitalized company in an attempt to reduce GM ’s cash drain from debt .
GM , like its smaller rival Chrysler , faces pressure to wrap up concession talks with the UAW on how to cut funding promised to a healthcare trust under the terms of the federal bailout .
GM has offered the UAW up to $ 10.2 billion in new equity in order to give up a cash claim on half of the $ 20.4 billion it is owed for the trust fund .
Ford reached a deal this week to restructure its own retiree healthcare debt to the union on similar terms .
But GM ’s parallel negotiations with its bondholders have been more difficult .
GM bondholders have been asked to take a payout equal to just $ 9 billion of the $ 27 billion that they are collectively owed .
Representatives of the debt holders have said GM ’s plan does not go far enough to reduce debt and have asked for steps to safeguard their remaining investment in the company .
Young said GM could not comment on its negotiations with bondholders ahead of an end -March deadline to launch the debt exchange .
“ We are getting to a more sensitive stage in terms of the whole bond exchange process here , ” he said .
Greenpeace issued a lengthy statement on their website in an attempt to further distance themselves from Paul Watson and Sea Shepherd yesterday .
With an aim at setting the record straight , Greenpeace made the statement out of frustration with what it claims are lies and falsehoods propagated by Watson , compounded by a general public misconception that Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd are associated with one another .
[ social_buttons ]
Greenpeace takes issue with what they describe as a fundamental difference in the anti-whaling tactics practiced by each organization .
It is interesting to note how Greenpeace characterizes and differentiates their tactics versus that of Sea Shepherd , particularly their characterization of what constitutes violence .
For Greenpeace , violence constitutes doing something that might put a human being in jeopardy , something they say Sea Shepherd and Watson are guilty of .
However , in their attempt to illustrate how proactive they are in the fight to save whales , Greenpeace makes reference to how in the past , Japanese whalers run from their ship at high speed when faced with a potential confrontation .
Regardless of Greenpeace ’s non-violent policies , would the Japanese ship run from them , or resort to bringing the coast guard , if there was n’t a perceived threat of violence ?
The success of Greenpeace ’s anti-whaling efforts is clearly connected to the willingness of Sea Shepherd to take tough action and thereby instilling fear of the protesters in the whalers ’ minds .
And anyway , is there a huge difference between sabotaging a propeller or sinking an unmanned whaling vessel ( Sea Shepherd tactics ) and blocking a harpoon vessel from shooting a whale with your ship ( a Greenpeace tactic ) ?
All these tactics are designed to achieve the same result , namely to prevent or reduce the killing of whales , and none particularly put lives at risk .
Ca n’t we all just get along ?

LOS ANGELES -- Dislocated right ring finger and all , Kobe Bryant did just what the Los Angeles Lakers needed against the Cleveland Cavaliers .
So did his teammates .
Bryant and LeBron James tussled to a virtual standoff Monday night , but Bryant 's supporting cast was far more effective , and that was the difference as the Lakers beat Cleveland 105 - 88 to snap a five - game losing streak to the Cavaliers .
Bryant had 20 points , six rebounds and 12 assists in 41 minutes despite dislocating the ring finger on his shooting hand less than two minutes into the game .
" I just dove for the ball , and the finger just popped out , " Bryant recalled afterward while wearing a splint on the injured finger .
" I was scared , I thought I was done .
It felt like I had two fingers on one , it was just disgusting .
[ Trainer ]
Gary [ Vitti ] just popped it back into place .
Not fun .
" A lot , " Bryant added when asked how much his finger bothered him during the game .
" I played with some pain , obviously .
I just tried to adjust as I went along , I just tried to play through it .
It 's just throbbing right now . "
Bryant , who shot 9 - of - 22 , spoke to reporters just minutes after X - rays showed no fracture .
He said he had n't sustained this kind of injury before , and did n't believe he would miss any playing time .
" For a while , we thought he was just going to be a playmaker tonight , but the second half , he started feeling like he could shoot it , " Lakers coach Phil Jackson said , noting Bryant scored 15 of his 20 points after halftime .
Pau Gasol shot 11 - of - 13 and led Los Angeles with 22 points and 12 rebounds .
Andrew Bynum and Sasha Vujacic scored 14 points each and Derek Fisher added 11 for the Lakers , whose 32 - 8 record is tops in the Western Conference .
James had 23 points and nine rebounds , but shot just 9 - of - 25 .
Mo Williams added 16 points , six rebounds and five assists and Sasha Pavlovic scored 12 for the Cavaliers ( 31 - 8 ) , who absorbed their most one - sided loss of the season .
" You 've got to give the Lakers credit , they played a very good basketball game , " Cavaliers coach Mike Brown said .
" I thought they were the aggressors tonight .
I thought they got up in us and made us play quick .
You have to give Kobe Bryant credit , I thought he played a whale of a game . "
Bryant scored nine points during a 16 - 7 run to start the fourth quarter , giving the Lakers a 91 - 73 lead with 6:35 remaining .
But just when the game seemed out of reach , the Cavaliers scored 11 straight points in three minutes to make it 91 - 84 .
But a jumper by Fisher ended the drought , and Trevor Ariza made two 3 - pointers after that , sparking the Lakers to a 14 - 4 game - closing spurt .
" We got back to what we were trying to accomplish and finished the game , " Jackson said .
Bryant began the game guarding James , and the fans reacted with a murmur of anticipation when they saw the matchup .
Bryant spent most of the game defending the Cavaliers ' star , but had plenty of help from his teammates .
" It 's always great when you go against the best , " James said .
" It brings out the best in you .
He 's one of the ultimate competitors that we have in our game today , and I enjoy going against him .
" Defensively , they were really good .
The same shots we made in the first half , we did n't in the second half .
We had some open looks , but we could n't capitalize and knock them down .
And against a team like the Lakers , if you do n't knock down shots , they can pull away because of how good they are offensively . "
The Lakers avoided their first three - game losing streak since last January .
" It was a huge deal , " Gasol said .
" We did n't want to come out of this game with another loss on our home court .
It was important for us to bounce back tonight .
This is a significant victory for us .
The defensive effort was outstanding . "
Gasol scored eight points and Bryant added six during a 22 - 10 run that gave the Lakers a 75 - 64 lead -- largest of the game for either team to that stage .
It was 75 - 66 entering the fourth quarter .
" I thought we did a great job defensively , " said Lamar Odom , who had eight points and 10 rebounds .
" It was fun .
We have to load up on [ James ] .
There 's no way we 're going to leave our best player on an island with him .
Kobe did a great job of denying him the ball . "
Game notes
Lakers F Luke Walton ( injured right foot ) missed his ninth straight game , although Jackson said beforehand that Walton was available .
... With Odom ( right knee ) and Vujacic ( back spasms ) having returned to action in recent days , the only unavailable player for the Lakers right now is G Jordan Farmar ( left knee ) .
...
The Cavaliers played without C Zydrunas Ilgauskas ( left ankle ) , G Delonte West ( right wrist ) and G Eric Snow ( left knee ) .
...
The Lakers have an 8 - 2 record against the Cavaliers at Staples Center since the arena opened in 1999 , but had lost the previous two home games to Cleveland .
...
The game was the opener of a four - game trip for the Cavaliers , who are 11 - 8 on the road and have lost four of their last five road games .
... The Cavaliers are 11 - 2 against Western Conference teams and the Lakers are 11 - 5 against the East . ...
The game was the second of six straight for the Lakers at Staples Center including a designated road game against the Clippers on Wednesday night .
This week we learned from the Local Government Association ( LGA ) that supermarkets are still producing excessive food packaging .
Landfill sites across the globe are overflowing with our rubbish , and local councils and their residents are paying the price in landfill tax .
The LGA argues that supermarkets should pay towards the collection of their packaging as an incentive to cut back .
Yet , with such a sharp focus on supermarkets , it 's easy to overlook what else can be done .
Every year UK households throw away the equivalent of three million double - decker buses – almost 30 m tonnes – of rubbish .
If lined one in front of the other , the queue would stretch from London to Sydney and back .
While supermarkets have a lot to answer for , individuals also have the power to make decisions that will reduce their household waste .
Local authorities need to look closer to home and ensure there are practical measures in place to help residents reduce , reuse and recycle as much as possible .
Crucial though recycling bins and collections are , it 's also vital that local authorities inform and support their residents to make sure they are doing all they can at an individual level .
Research has shown that people are more likely to recycle if they see people , and organisations , around them doing it .
We need to take advantage of the way in which individuals can inspire and encourage one another .
This approach is already having an impact in local authorities that are part of Global Action Plan 's EcoTeams programme , which works to change behaviour and reduce environmental impact at community level through education , training and support .
Small groups of households , or EcoTeams , meet regularly over a six - month period to reduce their impact on the environment .
During these meetings the teams receive guidance on waste and shopping as well as energy use , transport and water .
They set themselves achievable targets , and support each other in meeting them .
The results speak for themselves .
Independent academic research shows that households who participate in EcoTeams programmes reduce their waste by an average of 20 % .
They are more likely to buy products that can be recycled over products that cannot , and try to buy products with minimal or no packaging .
Local councils only need to do the maths to see that they could make themselves huge savings on recycling and landfill costs if all households in their area were doing the same .
And it 's not just local councils that could be saving money .
EcoTeams households make a saving of around £ 150 a year on their energy and water bills by reducing their gas and electricity consumption – a considerable sum in these difficult economic times .
So what is it that makes the EcoTeams programme work so well ?
We all know that we should be doing more to reduce our impact on the environment , but for most of us this remains a good intention which never becomes a reality .
For EcoTeams members , the secret of the programme 's success is being part of a group , where they will receive both support and pressure to change their behaviour .
Evidence shows that EcoTeams participants continue to carry out the pro-environmental actions for months and years after finishing the programme , and it's the focus on small but significant changes to existing lifestyles that makes these changes more likely to be sustained long term .
Rather than simply telling people what to do , we need to motivate , engage and involve them .
What better way to do this than bringing people together to support and encourage one another ?
The Local Government Association should be commended for highlighting the need to reduce waste in the UK – but it is overlooking the unlocked potential of our local communities in helping to achieve this .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Bank of America 's plea for more federal help has dealt another black eye to both the banking sector and the badly bruised financial advisory business .
Shares of Charlotte - based Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) plunged 15 % Thursday after earlier hitting a 14 - year low due on concerns it would need another bailout .
Early Friday , the government confirmed it was providing BofA with $ 20 billion more in taxpayer funding as well as billions of dollars in loan guarantees to stem losses tied to the bank 's acquisition of Merrill Lynch .
Friday morning , BofA announced a $ 1.8 billion loss for the fourth quarter , and further disclosed that Merrill lost more than $ 15 billion in the last three months of 2008 .
BofA 's latest problems add to the questions that have been swirling about the bank 's decision , reached early on the morning that Lehman Brothers collapsed in mid-September , to pay billions of dollars to acquire Merrill .
The big brokerage firm has been hit hard by bad bets on mortgage - related securities .
BofA completed the Merrill deal Jan. 1 - but only after receiving assurances that the government would help defray losses tied to the Merrill deal , The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday .
But CEO Ken Lewis ' decision to buy Merrill is n't the only thing that looks questionable now .
So does the advice he and the BofA board got on the hastily arranged Merrill deal from the bank 's advisers , Fox - Pitt Kelton and J.C. Flowers & Co .
The financial advisers offered opinions calling the deal fair to Bank of America shareholders .
But that conclusion seems to be undermined by the plunge in Bank of America 's shares in the months since the deal was announced , and the bank 's apparent need for another capital infusion from the government .
BofA already had received $ 25 billion , including $ 10 billion as part of the Merrill Deal , from the Treasury Department via the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , before Thursday 's announcement that it would be getting another $ 20 billion .
What 's more , the bank 's shareholders paid the advisers $ 20 million for the opinions - which the firms formulated after investigating Merrill Lynch 's condition over a single , hectic weekend .
BofA and J.C. Flowers did n't return calls seeking comment , and Fox - Pitt Kelton declined to comment .
Anatomy of a hurried deal
The proxy documents mailed to the banks ' shareholders this past fall describe the background of the hastily arranged deal .
According to the proxy documents , Merrill chief John Thain called Lewis the morning of Saturday , Sept. 13 to propose a possible partnership in which BofA would take a stake in Merrill .
Lewis replied that he was n't interested in taking a minority interest in the brokerage firm but would consider a full - fledged takeover .
They agreed to continue to talk .
" Following that afternoon meeting , and in view of the need to move expeditiously in light of the apparently imminent bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and deteriorating market conditions , " the proxy states , " both companies began to arrange meetings among members of management and their advisors to discuss the challenges and benefits of a transaction and to undertake their respective business , financial , operational and legal due diligence investigations . "
Among the firms summoned by the BofA board were Fox -Pitt Kelton and J.C. Flowers .
The next day , according to the proxy documents , BofA senior management and the advisory firms offered the bank 's board the findings of their investigation .
BofA management presented the board with a proposal to buy Merrill in an all - stock deal that , at the time , was valued at nearly $ 50 billion .
J.C. Flowers and Fox - Pitt found that the proposed price was " fair , from a financial point of view , to Bank of America , " the proxy document says .
The Bank of America board approved the deal on the morning of Monday , Sept. 15 .
" Acquiring one of the premier wealth management , capital markets , and advisory companies is a great opportunity for our shareholders , " Lewis said in a press release issued that day .
For their work that weekend , Fox - Pitt Kelton and J.C. Flowers got " an aggregate amount " of $ 20 million from BofA , the proxy filing said , in addition to reimbursement for out - of - pocket expenses and indemnification " for certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement by Bank of America and the rendering of its opinion . "
One former investment banker wondered why Lewis , or any other CEO , really needed a fairness opinion in the first place .
" Considering that no one -- the government , the boards or the investors - had any possible use for these opinions , it certainly puts the focus on why anybody is willing to pay $ 20 million for them , " said Gary Lutin , who runs the Shareholder Forum corporate governance advocacy group in New York .
Lutin said that the habit of seeking fairness opinions grew out of a questionable reading of a legal decision two decades ago , and has since devolved into an " irrelevant ritual " that amounts to " the opposite of collecting and considering relevant information about a possible merger . "
Not surprisingly , Lewis has been second - guessed about his decision to pay a premium price for Merrill ever since the deal was announced .
Because BofA shares fell so sharply between the Sept. 15 announcement and the Jan. 1 close , the transaction was worth $ 19 billion when it was completed .
" Some think that we should 've waited till Monday and see if they would 've gone bankrupt , " Lewis said an interview aired on CBS ' " 60 Minutes " on Oct. 19 .
" Some think we would 've gotten it for , you know , dirt cheap .
But my point is , you would have a tarnished brand .
You would 've had chaos . "
Considering that BofA 's stock has lost three - quarters of its value in the four months since the Merrill deal was announced , and that the bank is likely to need more help from the government , it seems Lewis and his investors may be getting their chaos anyway .
Gen Nkunda has said he protects Congo's Tutsis from Rwandan Hutus Gen Laurent Nkunda , leader of the strongest rebel group in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo , has been arrested in Rwanda .
He crossed the border after resisting a joint Rwandan - Congolese operation to arrest him , both countries say .
Correspondents say it is a startling about - turn by Rwanda , which had been accused of backing Gen Nkunda .
The BBC's Thomas Fessy says there is a sense of relief among residents in Goma who feel the war is nearing an end .
Some 250,000 people fled their homes in the region when Gen Nkunda led an offensive on the city towards the end of last year .
Some 4,000 Rwandan troops entered DR Congo this week to help fight rebel forces in the area .
See detailed map of the area
The UN refugee agency warns that further military action against other rebel groups in the area could lead to a humanitarian disaster .
BBC Africa analyst Martin Plaut says Gen Nkunda has been caught in the rapidly changing diplomatic situation in Central Africa .

Owns a cheese farm
Nkunda 's spectacular fall Profile : General Laurent Nkunda Nkunda arrest : Your views Q&A : DR Congo conflict Gen Nkunda had been Rwanda 's ally in eastern DR Congo - a Tutsi , like Rwanda 's leaders , he guarded their western flank against attacks from the Hutu forces who fled there after the Rwandan genocide of 1994 .
But in mid-November Rwanda shifted its position , announcing it would work with the Congolese to destroy the Hutu rebels .
Gen Nkunda did not back the new alliance and so became an impediment to Rwandan plans in the region , causing Rwanda to turn on him , our correspondent says .
The decision earlier this month by a group of Gen Nkunda 's top commanders to break away and join forces with government troops gave them their opportunity , he adds .
Henry Boshoff , an analyst from South Africa 's Institute for Security Studies , told the BBC that following intense diplomatic pressure in recent months , Rwanda was obliged to arrest Gen Nkunda .
The next step is for the joint Congolese - Rwandan force to tackle the FDLR Hutu rebels , some of whose leaders are accused of involvement in the 1994 slaughter in Rwanda of some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus .
But Mr Boshoff says this may not be easy , as they have resisted previous attempts to disarm them .
Arrest warrant
The rebel leader was detained in Rwanda after troops converged on his stronghold in the Congolese town of Bunagana .
" The ex-general Laurent Nkunda was arrested on Thursday 22 January at 2230 hours while he was fleeing on Rwandan territory after he had resisted our troops at Bunagana with three battalions , " a Congolese - Rwandan official statement said .
Gen Nkunda has lost the support of some of his troops in recent weeks Rebels with him were being urged to disarm , reports said .
Congolese Information Minister Lambert Mende Omalanga , told the BBC he welcomed the arrest .
" I think it is a good achievement for peace and security in this area and this region of Great Lakes , " he said .
Mr Omalanga said he wanted Rwanda to extradite him to face justice in DR Congo .
DR Congo has issued an international warrant for Gen Nkunda 's arrest following past accusations that his forces had committed atrocities .
Rwandan army spokesperson Major Jules Rutaremara told the BBC that General Nkunda was being held by the Rwandan forces in Rubavu district in western Rwanda , close to the border with the DR Congo .
But the Rwandan authorities have not yet issued any formal statement concerning his arrest .
Some of Gen Nkunda 's forces - perhaps as many as 2,000 - are still said to be loyal to him .
The question now is whether they will fight , or whether they will join the new consensus and become integrated into the Congolese army , correspondents say .
The CNDP launched a major offensive in August 2008 , which displaced more than a quarter of a million people in North Kivu and raised fears of both a humanitarian crisis and a wider regional war .
Correspondents say this may have been Gen Nkunda 's undoing , by bringing huge international pressure on all sides to end the conflict in DR Congo .
Human rights group have accused CNDP forces , along with those of the government , of numerous killings , rapes and torture .
All sides in the Congolese conflict have also been accused of using the fighting as a pretext to loot eastern DR Congo 's rich resources of minerals such as gold , tin and coltan , used in mobile phones .
Some five million people are estimated to have died as a result of almost 15 years of conflict in DR Congo , following the Rwandan genocide .

Even though the federal minimum wage is scheduled to rise again this year ( $ 7.25 on July 24 ) , more and more states are increasing their minimum wage to an amount higher than the federal minimum .
There are now twenty - seven states , plus the District of Columbia , that have a higher minimum than the federal minimum .
An interactive map with details on minimum wage laws in the states is available here .
Back in 2004 , when the federal minimum wage was $ 5.15 an hour , voters in my state of Florida approved a constitutional amendment to raise the minimum wage in Florida to $ 6.15 an hour , effective on May 2 , 2005 .
I blogged about this back on January 1 , 2005 , and wrote about it for Freedom Daily in November of 2005 .
In 2005 , only twelve states and the District of Columbia had a state minimum wage that was higher than the federal rate .
Well , the minimum wage in Florida just increased again .
Because the Florida minimum wage is recalculated every year , based on the increase in the consumer price index during the preceding 12 months , it went from $ 6.15 an hour in 2005 to $ 6.40 an hour in 2006 to $ 6.67 an hour in 2007 to $ 6.79 an hour in 2008 to $ 7.21 an hour in 2009 .
The new rate is published in October and takes effect in January of the following year .
What we see after a minimum wage increase is the unskilled minimum - wage worker bringing home a little extra money .
What we do n't see is the increase in the employer 's labor cost , Social Security taxes , Medicare taxes , unemployment taxes , and workers compensation premiums .
I usually do n't pay much attention to anything related to economics in my local newspaper , but in a recent article titled " The Florida Minimum Wage Debate : Does $ 7.21 an hour help or hurt small businesses ? " , a local economist at the University of West Florida showed that he had more sense than Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , who thinks that " raising the minimum wage is a good idea . "
According to the Pensacola News Journal :
UWF economist Rick Harper said the minimum wage hike is a double - edged sword .
The new wage does provide something of a financial floor for the lowest paid workers , he said .
But the negative effect of the hike is that " when labor costs move up , even a little bit , employers start looking for substitutes for labor . "
Harper , director of the Haas Center for Business Research and Economic Development , said that might include a fast - food restaurant owner buying an automatic fryer instead of hiring another employee to handle that particular task .
When wages are forced up without an increase in productivity , " fewer people get jobs , and those most affected are young people and , disproportionately , minorities . "
Sorry I missed Friday , gang .
I ’m going to go back and fill it in soon ( hence the skipped number ) .
Meanwhile , here ’s Monday ’s comic .

( WEB HOST INDUSTRY REVIEW ) --
Due to a mysterious distributed denial - of - service attack , several thousand websites hosted by GoDaddy.com ( www.godaddy.com) intermittently flickered on and offline Wednesday morning for a period of hours .
CNET blogger Bob Walsh reported the outage Wednesday , writing that GoDaddy communications manager Nick Fuller stated that while many sites were interrupted , neither e-mail nor DNS services were interrupted .
Also , while tech support reported that the DDoS attack made several thousand sites unreachable , this only represents a very small percentage of GoDaddy 's customer base .
Regardless , complaints began circulating shortly after the outage .
Los Angeles lifestyle blog LA Snark was one of the sites affected , which wrote about being confused and irritated .
" It has been brought to our attention that you have been experiencing brief periods of site outtages .
In order to best assist you , we will need to re-produce the errors that you are experiencing , " read an email sent to LA Snark 's Jack Stands from a GoDaddy hosting support representative .
The email on to ask the site operator for a " traceroute to the domain while the issue occurs . "
Which , typical and understandable of shared hosting customers , Stands had no idea what that meant .
A similar denial - of - service attack affected 600,000 GoDaddy hosting customers in November 2005 , which lasted roughly an hour .

Wow this is a big scale attack man , if godaddy does down alot of other sites will go along with it .
The terrorist attacks in Mumbai seven weeks ago sent shock waves around the world .
Now all eyes are fixed on the Middle East , where Israel 's response to Hamas 's rockets , a ferocious military campaign , has already left a thousand Gazans dead .
Seven years on from 9/11 it is clear that we need to take a fundamental look at our efforts to prevent extremism and its terrible offspring , terrorist violence .
Since 9/11 , the notion of a " war on terror " has defined the terrain .
The phrase had some merit : it captured the gravity of the threats , the need for solidarity , and the need to respond urgently - where necessary , with force .
But ultimately , the notion is misleading and mistaken .
The issue is not whether we need to attack the use of terror at its roots , with all the tools available .
We must .
The question is how .
The idea of a " war on terror " gave the impression of a unified , transnational enemy , embodied in the figure of Osama bin Laden and al - Qaida .
The reality is that the motivations and identities of terrorist groups are disparate .
Lashkar - e - Taiba has roots in Pakistan and says its cause is Kashmir .
Hezbollah says it stands for resistance to occupation of the Golan Heights .
The Shia and Sunni insurgent groups in Iraq have myriad demands .
They are as diverse as the 1970s European movements of the IRA , Baader - Meinhof , and Eta .
All used terrorism and sometimes they supported each other , but their causes were not unified and their cooperation was opportunistic .
So it is today .
The more we lump terrorist groups together and draw the battle lines as a simple binary struggle between moderates and extremists , or good and evil , the more we play into the hands of those seeking to unify groups with little in common .
Terrorist groups need to be tackled at root , interdicting flows of weapons and finance , exposing the shallowness of their claims , channelling their followers into democratic politics .
The " war on terror " also implied that the correct response was primarily military .
But as General Petraeus said to me and others in Iraq , the coalition there could not kill its way out of the problems of insurgency and civil strife .
This is what divides supporters and opponents of the military action in Gaza .
Similar issues are raised by the debate about the response to the Mumbai attacks .
Those who were responsible must be brought to justice and the government of Pakistan must take urgent and effective action to break up terror networks on its soil .
But on my visit to south Asia this week , I am arguing that the best antidote to the terrorist threat in the long term is cooperation .
Although I understand the current difficulties , resolution of the dispute over Kashmir would help deny extremists in the region one of their main calls to arms , and allow Pakistani authorities to focus more effectively on tackling the threat on their western borders .
We must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law , not subordinating it , for it is the cornerstone of the democratic society .
We must uphold our commitments to human rights and civil liberties at home and abroad .
That is surely the lesson of Guantánamo and it is why we welcome President - elect Obama 's commitment to close it .
The call for a " war on terror " was a call to arms , an attempt to build solidarity for a fight against a single shared enemy .
But the foundation for solidarity between peoples and nations should be based not on who we are against , but on the idea of who we are and the values we share .
Terrorists succeed when they render countries fearful and vindictive ; when they sow division and animosity ; when they force countries to respond with violence and repression .
The best response is to refuse to be cowed .

Teaching Ethics with Tom Cruise ' Valkyrie ' Classroom Material Slammed for Omitting Scientology
A German foundation has produced teaching material based on the film " Valkyrie " to stimulate discussion on civil courage .
But the booklet has been criticized for failing to mention Tom Cruise 's role as a prominent Scientologist .
Add decorated Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps to the growing list of successful Americans who happens to indulge in marijuana during his down time .
The tabloid news story is making international headlines , though it ’s difficult to understand why .
After all , Mr. Phelps is hardly alone in his herbal inclinations .
According to national and federal surveys , nearly one out of two Americans have tried weed , and among those age 18 to 25 — Phelps is 23 — pot smoking is especially popular .
Contrary to the messages promoted by the federal government , marijuana consumers include people from all walks of life , ethnic classes , and socio-economic backgrounds .
America ’s current President said that he smoked marijuana regularly as a young man .
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , former Vice President Al Gore , former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , and legendary astronomer Carl Sagan all have admitted using marijuana at different times during their lives .
According to the U.S. government , most current marijuana users are gainfully employed .
Statistically , most marijuana users are successful academically and financially .
A National Bureau of Economic Research study even reported that marijuana use is associated with earning higher wages .
Some former and current users , like Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson , Progressive Auto Insurance founder Peter Lewis , and New York State Mayor Michael Bloomberg are even multi-millionaires .
Perhaps the public ’s fascination with this story is because Phelps is recognized as one of the most talented and successful athletes in the entire world .
( He holds the record for the most gold medals won by any athlete in history . )
But Phelps is n’t an anomaly in this regard either .
Many top athletes use cannabis off the field — noting that it helps them to relax after the excitement of sports competition and alleviate the pain from nagging injuries .
It also wo n’t leave them with a hangover or adversely impact their performance the next day .
A 1997 New York Times investigation estimated that up to 70 percent of pro-basketball players occasionally indulge in the use of pot , and many high - profile football players — most notably Miami Dolphins star running - back Ricky Williams , former Dallas Cowboys all - star Mark Stepnoski , and even Super Bowl XLIII MVP Santonio Holmes — have spoken candidly about their off - field marijuana use .
In fact , Phelps is n’t even the first gold medalist to admit to smoking cannabis .
That honor belongs to Canadian snowboarder and 1998 Winter Olympics gold medal winner Ross Rebagliati , who tested positive for having used cannabis in the days prior to his history - making performance .
Sure , there will be some who will say that this latest chapter in Phelp ’s life is deserving of criticism because the 14 - time gold medalist is sending a poor message to young children .
And what message would that be ?
That you can occasionally smoke marijuana and still be successful in life .
Well sorry if the truth hurts .
Fact is , most Americans who use pot do so for the same reasons — and in the same manner — as do those who drink alcohol .
According to a recent University of Alberta study , the majority of adults who use cannabis do so recreationally to “ enhance relaxation . ”
Researchers concluded : “ [ M ] ost adult marijuana users regulate use to their recreational time and do not use compulsively .
Rather , their use is purposively intended to enhance their leisure activities and manage the challenges and demands of living in contemporary modern society .
Generally , participants reported using marijuana because it enhanced relaxation and concentration , making a broad range of leisure activities more enjoyable and pleasurable . ”
No doubt Michael Phelps indulged in the use of marijuana for these very same reasons .
He ought not to be condemned for it nor branded a criminal for his actions .
For that matter , neither should anyone else .

But Facebook was never designed for kids .
It was originally created for university students all those years ago , so it should come as no surprise that 45 per cent of its US audience is over 26 years of age .
Women over 55 are the fastest growing demographic group on the site , growing at a rate of 175.3 per cent since late September , according to InsideFacebook .
In other words , your mum might be about to poke ' you .
Facebook has a lot of older women using it .
Did n't know that ?
You might use the site everyday come on , you know you do but there 's probably a lot you do n't know about Facebook .
Here 's our top five Facebook secrets .
While the social networking site was launched by the now - very - rich Mark Zuckerberg and his four co-founders who no - one ever hears about on 4 February 2004 , it was originally limited to Harvard University users and only made available to the rest of us in September 2006 .
That was a rather clever move , as just a year later the number of users had ballooned to 50 million and is now near 150 million .
Today marks the fifth anniversary of Facebook that popular time - waster that so many love to hate and hate to love .
Facebook likes Open Source .
Facebook 's relationship with open source could be described as just friends ' or it's complicated , ' but the social networking site has a few projects on the go and uses open source style systems to run much of the site .
According to Facebook , it is the second largest PHP site by web traffic which is n't so much open source but free software , but it 's something .
It also runs a massive installation of the open source database system , and is the largest user of memcached , an open source caching system originally developed to speed up LiveJournal .
Aside from day - to - day operations , Facebook is also running a few open source projects and has licenced its developer system , Facebook Open Platform , not under the GPL but a similar system called Common Public Attribution Licence last year .
Facebook is not the first Facebook .
Zuckerberg originally called the site thefacebook.com , but after deciding to take it to the web he bought the domain www.facebook.com from a software firm called AboutFace Corporation .
That firm had been using the domain to offer its own social networking software from as early as 1994 .
As part of its intranet product AboutFace offered and still does a system that it claims to " foster community within your organisation with an online facebook . "
It is actually called " Employee Facebook . "
Perhaps surprisingly , this has n't led to a lawsuit by either party .
Microsoft really likes Zuckerberg 's work .
As a younger man , Zuckerberg created a music player called Synapse , which could learn listening preferences .
Microsoft tried to buy it up and hire Zuckerberg but he opted to carry on with his education instead .
So the 2007 rumours that Microsoft was looking to buy the site for $ 6 billion were n't the first time Zuckerberg had rubbed shoulders with the software giant .
He eventually sold a 1.6 per cent stake in Facebook to his suitor for $ 240 million .
Facebook ... does n't make that much money off of you .
It 's a good thing Facebook has so many users .
According to a recent report by Deloitte sites such as Facebook just do n't make that much money per user .
" The book value of some social networks may be written down and some companies may fail altogether if funding dries up , " said Deloitte researcher Paul Lee , according to the Telegraph .
" Average revenue per user for some of the largest new media sites is measured in just pennies per month , not pounds , " he said .
Deloitte said the average revenue for a cable subscriber , newspaper reader or movie - goer is over 10 dollars .
And , the analyst firm said , with the recession hitting advertising spending and video content sending storage costs soaring , it 's only going to get worse .
This trouble could be why Zuckerberg recently announced plans to sell more targeted polls to corporations
DALLAS - When officials at the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) spoke of jihad , or the need to support Palestinian mujahideen , they were n't necessarily endorsing violence .
And when they praised Hamas and brought in leaders of the designated terrorist group to speak at fundraisers , they were n't necessarily providing support .
That was the message John Esposito , a Georgetown University professor of Religion and International Affairs and director of the university 's Saudi - funded Center for Muslim - Christian Understanding told jurors in HLF 's terror support trial Monday .
Esposito was called as an expert witness to explain that some of the strident language jurors have heard coming from Holy Land officials may have a different , more benign meaning .
The men are accused of illegally providing millions of dollars to Hamas through a series of Palestinian charities .
Donating to charity is sacred in Islam , one of the five pillars of the faith , Esposito said .
But on cross examination , Esposito either did n't remember or did n't know about documented links between HLF and other groups he has worked with and Hamas .
One of those groups is the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) .
When asked by defense attorney Nancy Hollander if he was familiar with CAIR , Esposito described it as a " religious - oriented mainstream group " that worked on issues of discrimination against Muslims .
He confirmed he had over a period of time met with senior CAIR officials , including Nihad Awad , Ibrahim Hooper , and " another person based in California in the Bay area . "
That person , he later said , turned out to be CAIR co-founder and chairman emeritus Omar Ahmad .
CAIR is an unindicted co-conspirator in the HLF case .
In his cross examination by federal prosecutor James Jacks , Esposito said that he had attended a handful of CAIR events in the past 15 years .
But he struggled to identify the last time he attended a CAIR event .
It was three months ago in Dallas , Jacks said .
He 's also scheduled to speak at a CAIR fundraiser in Tampa later this month .
Although Esposito was a featured speaker at the Dallas event in August , he said he was unaware that the funds raised at the event went to the Muslim Legal Defense Fund , a nonprofit group set up to raise money to pay defense attorney 's fees in the HLF trial .
That was n't his only appearance at a Dallas CAIR event .
A year earlier , Esposito offered his wholehearted support for CAIR and its wishes to see the defendants set free in the HLF case , " Let me begin by saying that CAIR is a phenomenal organization … .
The main reason I decided to come was because of how I see the situation with regard to both the Holy Land Fund and the way government recently handled the situation and also to show solidarity not only with the Holy Land Fund , but also with CAIR . "
Esposito described himself as an expert on the Muslim Brotherhood movement .
He said he had " studied the movement for many years . "
However , when Jacks asked whether he was familiar with the Muslim Brotherhood motto , Esposito said he was n't .
The motto states :
" God is our goal , Quran is our Constitution , the Prophet is our leader , struggle [ jihad ] is our way , and death in the service of God is the loftiest of our wishes . "
Esposito also did not know that Hamas ' charter repeats the same motto .
He 's a Muslim Brotherhood expert , he said , not an expert on Hamas .
Jurors were shown a videotape seized from the HLF office of Yusuf al - Qaradawi , an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood scholar known for his militant religious rulings .
In the video , al - Qaradawi cites a passage from the Prophet 's Hadith , also listed in Article 7 of the Hamas charter :
" The Prophet , prayer and peace be upon him , said :
The time will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews ( and kill them ) ; until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees , which will cry : O Muslim !
There is a Jew hiding behind me , come on and kill him ! "
Qaradawi is a " very prominent Islamic scholar , " Esposito said .
He tried to rationalize Qaradawi 's statement , saying that the reference to " Jews " was really a reference to the " government of Israel . "
How could he be sure , Jacks asked , if Qaradawi has never offered such an explanation .
" No text can be interpreted without context , " Esposito said .
Qaradawi perceives
Palestine to be a " war zone " where " people are under occupation . "
" In that context all Israelis are part of the system and fighting , killing in the war zone is legitimate , " he said .
Esposito further added that Qaradawi believes that " sacrificing against a superior military power is sacrificing for a noble and just cause . "
Esposito confirmed that al - Qaradawi had issued a fatwa ( religious ruling ) that approved of suicide bombings against American troops in Iraq , explaining that al - Qaradawi had issued the fatwa because " Iraq was under occupation . "
Esposito mentioned that over a course of several years he had met with some Hamas leaders , but he could not remember the names " since it was 10 - 15 years ago . "
He said he may have also " run across someone who 's a Hamas leader at a professional conference in Europe , " but he could not say for certain .
Jacks asked Esposito whether he was familiar with the United Association for Studies and Research ( UASR ) , a think tank that used to be based outside Washington , D.C. Along with CAIR , HLF and the Islamic Association for Palestine ( IAP ) , the UASR was a member of the American Palestine Committee .
Internal records show the Palestine Committee was established by the Muslim Brotherhood to help Hamas politically and financially .
CAIR was created in 1994 , after the Palestine Committee existed .
Records show CAIR was added to the roster of committee entities and Ahmad , the co-founder and chairman emeritus , played a significant role in its operations .
Ahmad helped lead a secret 1993 gathering of committee members in Philadelphia called to discuss ways to derail the Oslo Peace Accords .
Committee members worried the secular Palestinian Authority would marginalize the Islamist Hamas movement .
Esposito said he had attended conferences , seminars , and other events sponsored by UASR and had met its director Ahmed Yousef several times .
Esposito said he had no knowledge at the time he met Yousef that the latter was a member of Hamas .
Ahmed Yousef currently serves as political advisor to the Ismail Haniyeh - led Hamas government in Gaza .
But questions about Yousef 's Hamas connections date back at least to August 1995 , when the Washington Post asked about it .
The Post was reporting on the arrest of Hamas political leader Mousa Abu Marzook by U.S. authorities :
" One of Marzook 's few professional associations was to serve on the board of the United Association for Studies and Research , a Springfield think tank that has been branded by Israelis as a Hamas front .
Ahmed Yousef , the association 's executive director , who met Marzook while also studying engineering at Colorado State , said he knew Marzook as a successful businessman who agreed to promote the think tank during his Middle East travels .
But Yousef , who said his think tank has no ties to Hamas , was unable to describe the nature of Marzook 's business . "
Esposito 's relationship with Marzook 's think tank , the UASR , was more than a passing professional interlude .
He served on the Board of Advisory Editors for the UASR 's publication , Middle East Affairs Journal .
In a 2000 interview in the journal , Esposito challenged the U.S. designation of Hamas as a Foreign Terrorist Organization : " One ca n't make a clear statement about Hamas .
One has to distinguish between Hamas in general and the action of its military wing , and then one has also to talk about specific actions .
Some actions by the military wing of Hamas can be seen as acts of resistance , but other actions are acts of retaliation , particularly when they target civilians . "
Esposito also denied any association with Marzook .
He said he was aware Marzook was a founder of UASR after reading background materials on the trial provided him by the defense but other than that he had no memory of having met Marzook .
He conceded it was possible he and Marzook " may have overlapped in Washington , D.C. "
Esposito and Jacks differed significantly on the structure of the Muslim Brotherhood .
Jacks asked if the Islamist movement had a defined hierarchical structure , with spiritual guides .
Esposito said that the Muslim Brotherhood exists in a number of countries but is " not a centrally organized , top down organization " as claimed by Jacks .
In response to Jacks ' question whether the global Islamist movement sought to establish a worldwide Islamic state , Esposito said that the Muslim Brotherhood aspires to establish Islamic law in " only those places where you have Muslim populations . "
Jacks showed Esposito an internal Palestine Committee memo from 1991 outlining " the General Strategic Goal for the Group in America " and asked Esposito whether he was familiar with the document .
Esposito said he had " read the document but had not done an analysis of it or studied it . "
Jacks then read out the section on page 21 , describing the Muslim Brotherhood 's role in America as a " Civilization - Jihadist process ... eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ' sabotaging ' its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God 's religion is made victorious over all other religions . "
Esposito said he did n't remember reading that section in the document .
He then challenged the memo's authenticity , saying " We do no know the source " but became silent when Jacks pointed out the author 's names appears on it .
The author , Mohamed Akram was listed on the document and Akram was a member of UASR , Jacks said .
David McDonald , a professor of ethnomusicology and cultural anthropology at Indiana University was the next defense witness to take the stand .
He described different types of Palestinian resistance music and the historical periods associated with it .
During the prosecution 's presentation , jurors saw numerous videotapes of fundraising rallies in which a band performed incendiary songs .
McDonald said the literal meaning of the band 's name - " Al - Sakra " - means " The Rock , " an allusion to " The Rock " on which the Prophet Mohammad ascended to heaven .
McDonald said a reference to Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin on a 1988 video should not be interpreted as a show of support for Hamas .
Instead the commentator was " using music to communicate current events " in line with Palestinian folklore music wherein singers discuss current events in their performances .
McDonald 's testimony is expected to continue Tuesday .
I 've been an entrepreneur for almost 30 years now -- 29 years and two months , to be exact , but who 's counting ? -- and one thing I 've learned is that there is no formula for success in business .
Believe me , I wish there were .
I would love to be able to give you a step - by - step guide to achieving your business goals .
But I can't .
That 's because no challenge in business is identical to any other .
Each is shaped by a multitude of factors that give it unique characteristics , and your response has to be tailored accordingly .
Then how is it , you might ask , that some entrepreneurs are able to start one successful business after another and rarely -- if ever -- fail ?
By successful , I mean a business that lives off its own cash flow , provides a good living for its owners and employees , and generates the profit it needs to keep growing .
You have no doubt run into people with the ability to create such businesses almost at will .
In the media , they are often referred to as serial entrepreneurs .
I suppose I 'm one of them , although I have certainly had my share of failures .
So what do serial entrepreneurs know that allows us to have a relatively high batting average when it comes to starting businesses ?
Or is it just a matter of luck ?
Far be it from me to downplay the role of luck in any business venture , but I do n't believe luck alone accounts for the success I have enjoyed .
Nor does it explain the successes of other accomplished company builders I have had the privilege of knowing .
Rather , what we have in common is a certain mentality , a way of thinking that allows us to overcome many obstacles and take advantage of many opportunities as they arise .
I call it the knack .
What exactly is the knack ?
I think it boils down to a set of rules that can be applied to a wide variety of situations .
Some of these rules we learn as children .
Others we pick up from mentors of one sort or another .
Most we develop the old - fashioned way -- by making mistakes , falling down , picking ourselves up , and figuring out how not to do it again .
However we learn the rules , they are the tools we use to deal with the challenges encountered in the course of building any business from scratch .
Not that the rules guarantee success , but they do improve our chances significantly .
We win more than we lose , and the longer we stay in the game , the more often we come out on top .
I believe that almost any person can learn these rules and use them to create the kind of life he or she wants .
Granted , they will come more easily to some people than to others , and not everyone will have the same success in applying them .
In business , as elsewhere , some individuals have God - given gifts that allow them to play the game better than others .
We can't all be Tiger Woods or Picasso or Shakespeare , but anybody can learn to play golf or paint or write a sonnet , and we can all learn how to be financially self - sufficient as well .
It would take a whole book to list these rules and explain the logic behind them .
In fact , my co-author , Bo Burlingham , and I have written one .
It 's called The Knack : How Street - Smart Entrepreneurs Learn to Handle Whatever Comes Up , and it goes on sale this month .
Rather than repeat what 's there , I thought I would give you what I believe are the 10 most important lessons I have learned over the past 29 - plus years , the rules that I still rely on today :
1. Numbers run a business .
If you do n't know how to read them , you are flying blind .
When I started out , I thought that CEOs ran businesses with the help of their top executives .
What I did n't realize is that a business is a living entity with needs of its own , and unless the leaders pay attention to those needs , the business will fail .
So how do you know what those needs are ?
There 's only one way : by looking at the numbers and understanding the relationships between them .
They will tell you how good your sales are , whether you can afford to hire a new salesperson or office manager , how much cash you will need to deal with new business coming in , how your market is changing , and on and on .
You can't afford to wait until your accountant tells you these things .
Nor do you have to become an accountant .
You do have to know enough accounting , however , to figure out which numbers are most important in your particular business , and then you should develop the habit of watching them like a hawk .
2 . A sale is n't a sale until you collect .
There 's a common assumption that when somebody buys something from you , it 's like money in the bank .
Sooner or later , you are going to get paid .
That 's not always true , of course , and just how much sooner or later the payment arrives can make a big difference .
But most people do n't think about that when they first go into business .
The term bad debt does n't enter their vocabulary until they suddenly find themselves with a receivable they can't collect .
By the same token , the concept of collection time does n't become meaningful until they discover they do n't have enough cash to pay their bills despite having made a lot of sales .
As I have written previously , every business that generates receivables is , in effect , a bank ( see " What Are You , a Bank ? " November 2007 ) .
When you deliver a product or a service in the belief that the customer will eventually pay you for it , you are making a loan , and you should treat it accordingly .
That means determining whether customers are creditworthy and finding out in advance how long they take to pay their bills .
It also means getting into the habit of checking the quality of your loan portfolio regularly and making sure your average collection time is what it should be .
3 . When your short - term liabilities exceed your short - term assets , you are bankrupt .
The vast majority of people in small business , I suspect , have no idea what a balance sheet is or how it differs from an income statement ( also known as a P&L ) .
The balance sheet certainly does n't figure into their decision making .
It did n't figure into mine until I wound up in bankruptcy court with my first company , Perfect Courier .
There I learned that a company is bankrupt -- at least technically -- when its current liabilities ( that is , the ones that have to be paid within the next 12 months ) are greater than its current assets ( the ones that will turn into cash within the next 12 months ) .
That information comes straight off the balance sheet .
I could have saved myself a lot of grief and pain if I had gotten into the habit of looking at it on a regular basis and keeping track of the most important ratio derived from it -- the current ratio , which measures a company 's ability to meet its short - term debt obligations .
You calculate it by dividing your current assets by your current liabilities .
If the ratio is 1.25 or higher , you are in fairly good shape .
If it 's less than 1.00 , you could be headed for trouble .
Yes , you may be able to juggle your payables and other short - term debts for a while , but you should move quickly to restore your liquidity .
Otherwise , you are taking a risk of one day finding yourself with no cash to pay your bills -- a potentially fatal condition .
4. Forget about shortcuts .
Run a business as if it 's forever .
Building a business is a lot of hard work .
Everything that a great company needs takes a long time to develop -- a diversified base of loyal customers , experienced managers , a vibrant culture , efficient systems throughout the business , a sales force that works as a team , a great reputation in the industry -- everything .
Of course , we all look for shortcuts .
That 's only natural , especially when you are on your first venture .
You constantly search for easier ways to make your company grow faster , and sometimes you find them .
Unfortunately , they almost always come back to haunt you .
I speak here as someone who is more impatient than most and who has tried just about every shortcut in the book -- like hiring salespeople from competitors and promoting employees just because they are available .
It finally dawned on me that my shortcuts were serving only to prolong the process of building the great company I wanted .
Why was I in such a hurry , anyway ?
A great company is one that can last forever , and I needed to make decisions in that frame of mind -- even though I fully expected to sell the business someday .
My records - storage business , CitiStorage , would be worth more if I took my time and did what was best for the company in the long term .
Indeed , it was .
As you may know , I ultimately sold it and two related businesses for $ 110 million .
5 . Cash is hard to get and easy to spend .
Make it before you spend it .
Most people do n't understand the value of cash when they go into business .
If they did , they would n't waste it by purchasing brand - new furniture , paying designers to produce logos , ordering fancy business cards and stationery , or spending money on dozens of other things that they do n't really need and that deplete their start - up capital without getting the business any closer to viability -- that is , the point at which the company can sustain itself on its internally generated cash flow .
If the cash runs out before you get there , the ball game 's over .
The business dies .
But it 's not just start - up entrepreneurs who waste cash .
The corporate landscape is littered with the corpses of companies whose leaders thought the good times would last forever and spent money they had n't yet made on luxuries they did n't need .
I made that mistake myself once and paid the consequences .
One of the lessons I learned was :
Make the money first .
If you are smart , you will put some of it aside for a rainy day .
Whatever is left over , you can spend as you please .
You can pay big bonuses to your employees .
You can make big donations to charity .
You can buy a corporate jet .
You can run for President .
Whatever .
But first you must earn it .
6 . You have no friends in business , only associates .
Some habits are more difficult to maintain than others , and I constantly struggle with a really important one : Do n't do business with friends .
I have broken this rule several times and always lived to regret it .
In the early days , I did n't hesitate to buy products or services from friends .
I could n't imagine why I should n't help someone with whom I had a close , personal relationship .
But friends , I learned , inevitably make assumptions that hinder your ability to do what 's best for the business .
Even though I would tell them up front that they would be treated like any other vendor , they still expected me to make exceptions for them .
When I would n't , the relationship went sour , and I lost a friend as well as a supplier .
It 's even more important to understand that you can't be friends with your employees .
I 'm not saying you should n't treat them with respect and affection .
You can laugh with them , cry with them , be happy and sad with them , but neither you nor they should ever forget that it 's a business relationship .
I had seven employees when I started my first business and became social friends with six of them .
All six of those friendships became a problem for the business .
And the seventh person ?
He now runs CitiStorage .
7 . Do n't focus on the top line .
Gross margin is the most important number on the income statement .
In the early days of a business , everybody obsesses about sales .
We want to see them increasing every month , every day , and every hour -- the faster , the better .
I know that 's how I felt .
The first thing I would check each morning was the report of the previous day 's sales .
My investors were the same way .
Not once did they ask about the company 's profitability .
They cared only about sales , and most of them were accountants !
But focusing exclusively on sales is very dangerous , especially when you are starting a business with a limited amount of capital .
Why ?
Because sales do not necessarily result in cash flow , and cash is what you need to survive .
You run out of cash , you go out of business .
End of story .
Instead , you should be focusing on your gross margin -- that is , the percentage of profit you make after covering the direct cost of whatever it is that you are selling .
In my opinion , gross margin is one of the two or three most important numbers in any business and by far the most important one in a new business .
You have to pay all your expenses out of gross profit -- your salary , your rent , the phone bill , gas , electricity , photocopying , and so on .
If your gross margin is 10 percent , you need $ 10 in sales for every $ 1 of overhead just to break even .
If your gross margin is 40 percent , you need only $ 2.50 in sales for every $ 1 of overhead .
So you will have more to show for the same amount of work with a high gross margin than with a low one .
And if you are just starting out and have limited capital , that could be the difference between failure and success .
8. Identify your true competitors , and treat them with respect .
Here 's something else I did n't know starting out :
Not everyone who does what you do is your competitor .
Rather , you compete against only those suppliers that offer the same services , are more or less equally reliable , and charge prices similar to yours .
That does n't mean you wo n't meet other types in the marketplace .
In every business I started , there were people around who claimed to provide a service like ours at a fraction of the price .
Invariably , they had tiny operations with little , if any , overhead .
If the owner - operator got sick , or if a truck broke down , the customer would be stuck .
Customers willing to put up with that risk were not good candidates for us .
Conversely , customers that demanded reliability -- and were willing to pay for it -- were not good candidates for the mom-and - pop operations .
As for our real competitors , I came to see that they were extremely important to our long - term success .
They played a critical role in shaping our reputation in the industry -- which was our most valuable asset -- if only because their opinion carried more weight than that of any other group .
When they spoke well of us , everybody listened .
So I made a habit of treating them with the respect I hoped they would show us , and I insisted that our salespeople do the same .
9. Culture drives a company .
In the long run , the boss 's most important job is to define and enforce it .
When I started my first business , it never crossed my mind that I was creating a culture as well as a company .
I did n't even realize that companies had cultures , let alone that the cultures might actually affect the businesses ' performance .
It was only 15 years later -- when my wife , Elaine , joined CitiStorage -- that I began to think seriously about the matter .
She introduced programs that fundamentally changed our culture , making it much more employee friendly , with business games , contests , educational programs , new employee benefits , and group activities of various sorts .
I could n't help noticing how much better the company functioned as a result .
Along the way , it dawned on me that setting the culture was ultimately the CEO 's responsibility .
Although Elaine was doing the heavy lifting , she could n't have succeeded without my support .
Not only did I have to give her the resources she needed , but I also had to modify my behavior to fit in with the new regime and make sure that everyone else went along .
Among other things , I had to learn how to hold my tongue and respect the chain of command .
That was probably the most difficult new habit I have ever had to develop -- and certainly one of the most important .
10 .
The life plan has to come before the business plan .
It took a major whack on the head for me to get my priorities straight .
For my first eight years as an entrepreneur , I always put my business goals first .
As a result , I missed my first daughter 's childhood .
I spent too little time with my wife and friends .
I did n't do any of the reading or traveling or gardening that I enjoy .
My life was one full - bore , supercharged , nonstop , 24/7 rush to create a high - growth business .
You know how that turned out .
Fortunately , my descent into Chapter 11 came early enough in my life for me to learn the appropriate lessons and make a fresh start .
The most important lesson was this : Building a successful business is not an end in itself .
It is a means to an end .
It is a way to create a better life for you and those whom you love , however you -- and they -- may define it .
You need to do the life plan first and then keep revisiting it , to make sure it 's up to date and your business plan is helping you achieve it .
That habit , I can assure you , will prove to be the most important of them all .
The recent economic news has been dismal , and it's now almost universally assumed things will get worse before they get better .
Conventional wisdom also dictates that this recession will be longer , deeper and cause more long - term pain than any financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Yet , less than two years ago , conventional wisdom dictated that the housing bubble would be painful but that global economic growth would remain stable .
That assertion was proved dramatically incorrect .
Why then is there so much conviction ...

This is the original posting by ' Anonymous ' , the key information provider on this site .
Also included are three responses and seemingly independent verifications of the information .
First let me introduce myself .
My name is Request Anonymous .
I am a retired employee of the U.S. Government .
I wo n't go into any great details about my past , but I was involved in a special program .
As for Roswell , it occurred , but not like the story books tell .
There were two crash sites .
One southwest of Corona , New Mexico and the second site at Pelona Peak , south of Datil , New Mexico .
The crash involved two extraterrestrial aircraft .
The Corona site was found a day later by an archaeology team .
This team reported the crash site to the Lincoln County Sheriff 's department .
A deputy arrived the next day and summoned a state police officer .
One live entity [ EBE ] was found hiding behind a rock .
The entity was given water but declined food .
The entity was later transferred to Los Alamos .
The information eventually went to Roswell Army Air Field .
The site was examined and all evidence was removed .
The bodies were taken to Los Alamos National Laboratory because they had a freezing system that allowed the bodies to remain frozen for research .
The craft was taken to Roswell and then onto Wright Field , Ohio .
The second site was not discovered until August 1949 by two ranchers .
They reported their findings several days later to the sheriff of Catron County , New Mexico .
Because of the remote location , it took the sheriff several days to make his way to the crash site .
Once at the site , the sheriff took photographs and then drove back to Datil .
Sandia Army Base , Albuquerque , New Mexico was then notified .
A recovery team from Sandia took custody of all evidence , including six bodies .
The bodies were taken to Sandia Base , but later transferred to Los Alamos .
The live entity established communications with us and provided us with a location of his home planet .
The entity remained alive until 1952 , when he died .
But before his death , he provided us with a full explanation of the items found inside the two crafts .
One item was a communication device .
The entity was allowed to make contact with his planet .
Somehow , I never knew this information , but a meeting date was set for April 1964 near Alamogordo New Mexico .
The Aliens landed and retrieved the bodies of their dead comrades .
Information was exchanged .
Communication was in English .
The aliens had a translation device .
In 1965 , we had an exchange program with the aliens .
We carefully selected 12 military personnel ; ten men and two women .
They were trained , vetted and carefully removed from the military system .
The 12 were skilled in various specialities .
Near the northern part of the Nevada Test Site , the aliens landed and the 12 Americans left .
One entity was left on Earth .
The original plan was for our 12 people to stay 10 years and then return to Earth .
But something went wrong .
The 12 remained until 1978 , when they were returned to the same location in Nevada .
Seven men and one woman returned .
Two died on the alien 's home planet .
Four others decided to remain , according to the returnees .
Of the eight that returned , all have died .
The last survivor died in 2002 .
[ Clarification ( BR / Victor Martinez ) : the paragraph above contains a typo in the original .
Twelve team members went , and eight returned – two having died on Serpo and two having chosen to remain ; these two were not ordered to return . ]
The returnees were isolated from 1978 until 1984 at various military installations .
The Air Force Office of Special Investigation ( AFOSI ) was responsible for their security and safety .
AFOSI also conducted debriefing sessions with the returnees .
I have never seen or read anything about the exchange program .
I once heard a little bit of information from Linda Howe , but she did n't have much information .
I 've monitored your e-mails for about six months .
I 've read e-mails from you and others .
But I 've never seen nor heard the truth about the real Roswell incident or the exchange program .
I 'd like to hear what others say about this .
Comment 1 ( by Gene Loscowski ) :
Who is this person ?
Most of the information is absolutely correct .
However , I never heard of any females going .
To the best of my knowledge , we had 12 men , all military men .
Eight USAF , two Army and two Navy guys .
I think the females are a red herring .
But maybe I just did n't have the clearance for that .
They left and was gone 20 years , as I was told .
When they came back they were put in quarantine for 365 days at the complex .
Only eight came back , that much is right .
Two died a few years into their assignment on the Visitor 's planet .
Two others decided to remain and maybe are still alive today .
Since their return , all have died .
The last being in 2003 in a VA hospital .
As for the Roswell incident .
Whomever sent the e-mail is correct .
The complete debriefing is contained in : " PROJECT SERPO , " Final Report - 80HQD893-020 , classified TS , Codeword .
Ask [ Rick ]
Doty about that report because I think it is an OSI report .
Paul [ McGovern ] should be commenting on this since he was involved in the debriefing .
[ Clarification by Victor Martinez , 1 December : Ths project classification was provided by Paul McGovern , not Gene Loscowski .
Apologies for the error . ]
Comment 2 ( by Paul McGovern ) :
Interesting but not totally correct [ commenting on Anonymous 's original e-mail ] .
As for the Roswell incident : absolutely right .
Few people have ever gotten it entirely correct .
Two crash sites , not one .
As for the exchange program : Unauthorized Release of Classified Information , as I see it .
But maybe someone currently within our government wants it out .
No females were sent .
Twelve men , all military .
8 USAF , 2 U.S. Army and 2 U.S. Navy .
Two were doctors ; three were scientists ; two were language specialists ; two were security personnel ; two were pilots and one was the leader ( Colonel - AF ) .
All were sheep - dipped and completely erased from the military roles .
I 'm not totally sure of the training period , but I think it was about six months .
They were able to transmit messages to Earth by means of a communication system set up prior to their trip .
One doctor and one of the security personnel died three years into their visit .
The doctor died of pneumonia and the security guy died of an injury .
The exchange team had to endure extreme hardship adjusting to the environment of the visitor 's planet .
The heat was extreme and took many years to adjust .
The food was something of a problem because the human system had problems digesting it .
The team took enough food for two years and rationed it another eight months , but eventually had to eat the visitor 's [ Eben 's : alien 's name ] food .
This caused all team members gastrointestinal problems .
Eventually , they adjusted .
The visitors tried to create different foods but few worked .
The team was never isolated or restricted by the visitors .
They could travel as they wished and see whatever they wanted to see .
After about six years , the team moved to a northern portion of the visitor 's planet , where the temperature was cooler and which contained ample vegatation .
The visitors built a small community for the team .
The only major problem was time .
Time was different on the visitor 's planet .
I do n't think anyone ever figured it out .
The visitors had no clocks .
They did n't judge or account for time as we did .
The visitors found our attempts to account for time strange .
The visitors were extremely disciplined in their daily lives .
Every visitor worked on a schedule , which was not by a clock , but by the movement of their sun .
Each little community had a large tower , which filtered the sun through .
When the sun was at a particular point on the tower , it meant the visitors had to do a particular thing .
There was never complete darkness on the visitors planet .
It got dim but not dark .
The visitors had rest periods , but not like our sleep periods .
The visitors rested three times during their sun days .
Our team determined the entire work period was approx .
43 hours .
They had three rest periods within that 43 hours .
That is still about 14 hours straight , ... could n't get too many of our workers to do that !
The visitors also did n't have months or years .
They did have life periods , as our team coined it .
It was impossible to judge the visitor 's age , although our team did find graves .
The population of the visitor 's planet was about 650,000 .
There were small communities throughout the planet .
There were underground rivers , which fed into open valleys .
There was industry .
But all of the food was grown , either in fields or in large buildings .
They did have animals .
Different types .
Strange large beasts , they used for work and other things , but no meat was eaten .
The geological make up of the planet was so much different than ours .
Few mountains , no oceans , some trees or something similar to trees and no other civilization except the Ebens .
Everyone looked the same initially to our team .
But after some time , the team members learned to identify different Ebens by their voices .
Although the Ebens could n't speak English , they did make noises that our team members were able to translate into English .
After five years , we had their language completely translated into English .
The complete debriefing accounts for about three thousand pages .
Comment 3 ( by " Anonymous II " ) :
I would prefer you keep my name private .
But here is my evaluation of the information from " Anonymous . "
1 . As for the Roswell incident [ described by Anonymous in his e-mail ] :
This was the story I read in the historical document called the " Red Book . "
Almost exactly to the word .
Although there were more details about the crash sites and what was recovered .
2 . As for the Exchange Program : I read about it but thought there were 12 men ; I do n't recall any women .
But that was about all I knew .
We did have a special unit that handled their debriefing but USAF positive intelligence was also involved .
I was never involved in that program , but I knew other agents who were .
3 . I 'd like to contact this source .
I have about a million questions to ask !
I heard Linda Howe speak about the exchange program some years ago .
I always wondered where she got her information .
Keep up the excellent work !

Protests were sparked across Pakistan today when the Supreme Court decided that Nawaz Sharif , former prime minister and opposition leader , as well as his younger brother Shahbaz were ineligible to hold public offices .
The ruling brought down the Punjabi Provincial government , which Shahbaz was chief minister of , and placed the province under direct national control .
Enraged supporters of the Pakistani Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) burned tires in the streets , and the stock market plummeted over 5 % in a single trading session as the ban on some of the most influential opposition figures in the nation .
Sharif ’s PML- N was part of a coalition government briefly after the 2008 election , but left in August when the ruling Pakistani Peoples Party ( PPP ) reneged on a promise to reinstate judges ousted by former President Pervez Musharraf .
PML - N officials slammed the ruling as a political move by President Asif Ali Zardari , leader of the PPP .
Zardari spokesman Farhatullah Babar claimed that the PML - N was exploiting the decision to derail national unity , and urged the Sharif brothers to “ control their supporters in the interest of democracy . ”
The ban was connected to an incident during the 1999 coup that brought Gen. Musharraf to power : then Prime Minister Sharif attempted to foil the coup by ordering Musharraf ’s aircraft diverted .
After Musharraf seized power , he had Sharif convicted of “ hijacking ” over the incident .

The basic ingredients necessary to make cheese are milk , culture and rennet
First off , let ’s give cheese some mad props before diving in on the how - to instructions .
Because of its long shelf life , portability , and high content of fat , protein and calcium , you could survive on cheese if you had to .
Cheese is so ancient ( and awesome ) that it predates recorded history .
It even predates the Roman times .
The estimated time of its inception is around 8000 BC when sheep made their appearance .
It is even thought that cheesemaking was stumbled upon accidentally , from longterm storage of milk in an animal stomach ( the method of storage in ancient times ) .
The acid from the stomach transformed the milk into curds and whey .
This is just one story of how cheesemaking may have begun .
Without documented history , does anyone really know the true origin of cheese ?
Today , however , we are fortunate enough to indulge in a vast array of soft and hard cheeses – traditional blue cheese , feta , Gouda , Manchego , aged cheddar , brie , the list goes on to include hundreds of varieties of cheese .
And , no matter how the practice of cheesemaking transpired , all that matters now is that we do know how to make cheese and can easily make it at home .
The basic ingredients necessary to make cheese are milk , culture and rennet ( or vinegar ) .
That ’s it .
Obviously there are specific ingredients for specific cheeses , but your basic cheese requires only the above ingredients .
Equipment you will need :
Kitchen equipment you need includes : two stainless steel or glass pots ( one should be able to hold 10 quarts or more ) , a stainless steel knife ( long enough to reach the bottom of the pot ) , a floating thermometer , a colander , ladle , a sterilized cheese cloth and a cheese press ( homemade or manufactured ) .
Keep your glass measuring cups on hand , in addition to some towels and hot water .
Note :
It is important to use stainless steel , enamal or glass containers when acidifying milk .
~
Get started :
Make sure your countertops are clean before you start the cheesemaking process .
A sanitary work area is important to prevent contamination .
The most important step of making cheese is separating the milk into curds and whey , which is accomplished by souring the milk ( yes , on purpose ! ) and adding the acidic component , or rennet ( usually vinegar or a starter bacteria like plain yogurt ) .
Ingredients :
8 quarts of whole milk
2 ounces of cheese starter ( cultured buttermilk , plain yogurt )
1/4 tablet or 1 tsp. of liquid rennet ( you can find this at the store )
How to make cheese :
1 . Heat the milk to 86 degrees ( F ) and stir in the starter .
Cover and allow to ripen for 45 minutes , maintaining the temperature
2. Dissolve the tablet in a 1 /4 cup of warm water and then add to the milk ( or add the liquid rennet ) , stirring gently .
Stir the top quarter inch of the milk for 60 seconds , cover and let it sit for 45 minutes .
3 . Cut the curd into 1/4 - inch squares and set them aside for 5 minutes .
4 . To cook the curds , warm the milk to 100 degrees , increasing the temperature no more than 2 degrees every 5 minutes .
Stir to keep the curds separated .
5 . Once the curds reach 100 degrees , continue stirring at this temperature for 30 minutes .
6 . Let the curds settle for about 20 minutes .
Now you can stop stirring .
7 . Use the cheese cloth to line the colander .
Place the curds into the colander to drain .
8. Replace the curds into the pot for 15 minutes .
9 . Place the curds on a cutting board and cut into 3 - inch slices .
It is important to keep the curds 100 degrees during the process by placing the slices in a pot in a sink of 100 - degree water .
Keep the curd in the pot for 15 minutes .
This is the cheddaring process .
10 . Next , break the cheddared cheese into 1/2 - inch cubes .
Leave the cubes in the pot and put it into a sink of 100 - degree water .
Make sure to stir the cubes every 10 minutes for 30 minutes .
It is recommended to stir using your fingers .
11 . Take the pot out of the sink and add 4 Tbsp. of cheese salt .
If possible , use your hands to gently stir .
12 . Press the cheese for 15 minutes at 10 pounds of pressure .
Flip the cheese and press for 12 hours at 40 pounds .
Lastly , flip again and press for 24 hours at 50 pounds .
13 . Remove the cheese cloth , wipe down the cheese and let air dry for 2 to 5 days ( until dry ) .
14 .
Wax the cheese with three layers ( using a small kitchen or paint brush ) , allow it to age in a 55 - degree environment for three to 12 months .
15 . Voila !
You have successfully made cheese .
Now enjoy it !
Researchers have long been trying to model actual brains in order to build a better computer " brain , " and it looks like IBM is now getting a helping hand from none other than DARPA in its attempt to create one that it hopes will one day have the intelligence level of a cat .
To that somewhat unnerving end , DARPA is pouring $ 4.9 million into a project that 'll include five universities and scientists of all stripes , who will work together to create an artificial brain that behaves like a real one right down to the neuron level .
As the BBC reports , the researchers are describing this latest initiative as a " 180 degree shift in perspective " from previous efforts , as they 're now seeking an algorithm first and problems second , as opposed to starting with an objective and devising an algorithm to achieve it .
As for DARPA 's ultimate goal , well , that 's still a bit of a mystery , though let 's just say we wo n't be surprised if future robots start to become very easily distracted [ Via Daily Tech , image courtesy Mack J , Truth and Beauty Bombs
One of the feature of the application I 'm working on these days is allowing the user to import data from Excel 2003 and 2007 files .
After some research I found out that OLEDB is the only way to read both Excel formats without any problems .
For this example I split the code into two functions .
The first is OpenExcelFile which opens the Excel file and sets the string array data field workSheetNames to the names of the sheets in the file .
This is done by reading the names of the tables in the schema , because OLEDB opens the whole file as a schema and the sheets in the file as tables in the schema .
The function takes one argument called isOpenXMLFormat , that is set to true to open a 2007 file and false to open a 2003 or previous file .
The only difference between the two formats is the connection string used .
public void OpenExcelFile ( bool isOpenXMLFormat ) { // open the excel file using OLEDB OleDbConnection con ; if ( isOpenXMLFormat ) //read a 2007 file connectionString = " Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 ;Data Source= " + fileName + " ; Extended Properties= \ " Excel 8.0 ; HDR=YES ;\ " " ; else //read a 97-2003 file connectionString = " Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0 ;Data Source= " + fileName + " ; Extended Properties =Excel 8.0 ; " ; con = new OleDbConnection ( connectionString ) ; con. Open ( ) ; //get all the available sheets System.Data.DataTable dataSet = con.GetOleDbSchemaTable( OleDbSchemaGuid.Tables , null ) ; // get the number of sheets in the file workSheetNames = new String[ dataSet.Rows .
Count ] ; int i = 0 ; foreach ( DataRow row in dataSet .
Rows ) { // insert the sheet 's name in the current element of the array // and remove the $ sign at the end workSheetNames [ i ] = row [ " TABLE_NAME " ] . ToString ( ) . Trim ( new [ ] { ' $ ' } ) ; i++ ; } if ( con != null ) { con.Close ( ) ; con.Dispose ( ) ; } if ( dataSet != null ) dataSet.Dispose ( ) ; }
The second function is GetWorksheet , and it takes the name of the sheet as an argument .
Here the file is opened again using the connection string set by OpenExcel File .
And executes a SQL SELECT on the name of the sheet passed in the argument , and returns the result as a DataTable .
public System.Data.DataTable GetWorksheet ( string worksheetName ) { OleDbConnection con = new System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection(connectionString ) ; OleDbDataAdapter cmd = new System.Data.OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter( " select * from [ " + worksheetName + " $ ] " , con ) ; con. Open ( ) ; System.Data.DataSet excelDataSet = new DataSet ( ) ; cmd.Fill(excelDataSet ) ; con.Close ( ) ; return excelDataSet.Tables [ 0 ] ; }

President Barack Obama 's sweeping executive order to shut down the controversial Guantanamo Bay prison camp within the year and close any remaining CIA secret prisons overseas was met with skepticism by two West Michigan congressmen .
U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra , R- Holland , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , said the order places " hope ahead of reality . "
" It sets an objective without a plan to get there , " Hoekstra said .
" Given the fact that we are talking about trained terrorists and people who have committed acts of mass murder , it would seem the proper course would be to have a plan in place before making this decision . "

Subjects were apparently given electric shocks Decades after a notorious experiment , scientists have found test subjects are still willing to inflict pain on others - if told to by an authority figure .
US researchers repeated the famous " Milgram test " , with volunteers told to deliver electrical shocks to another volunteer - played by an actor .
Even after faked screams of pain , 70 % were prepared to increase the voltage , the American Psychologist study found .
Both may help explain why apparently ordinary people can commit atrocities .
It 's not that these people are simply not good people any more - there is a massive social influence going on .
Dr Abigal San
clinical psychologist Yale University professor Stanley Milgram 's work , published in 1963 , recruited volunteers to help carry out a medical experiment , with none aware that they were actually the subject of the test .
A " scientist " instructed them to deliver a shock every time the actor answered a question wrongly .
When the pretend 150 - volt shock was delivered , the actor could be heard screaming in pain , and yet , when asked to , more than eight out of ten volunteers were prepared to give further shocks , even when the " voltage " was gradually increased threefold .
Some volunteers even carried on giving 450 - volt shocks even when there was no further response from the actor , suggesting he was either unconscious or dead .
Similar format Dr Jerry Burger , of Santa Clara University , used a similar format , although he did not allow the volunteers to carry on beyond 150 volts after they had shown their willingness to do so , suggesting that the distress caused to the original volunteers had been too great .
HAVE YOUR SAY Until humans value the lives of others equal to their own , this will unfortunately continue to be the case Louise , Lincoln , UK Again , however , the vast majority of the 29 men and 41 women taking part were willing to push the button knowing it would cause pain to another human .
Even when another actor entered the room and questioned what was happening , most were still prepared to continue .
He told Reuters : " What we found is validation of the same argument - if you put people in certain situations , they will act in surprising and maybe often even disturbing ways . "
He said that it was not that there was " something wrong " with the volunteers , but that when placed under pressure , people will often do " unsettling " things .
Even though it was difficult to translate laboratory work to the real world , he said , it might partly explain why , in times of conflict , people could take part in genocide .
Complex task Dr Abigail San , a chartered clinical psychologist , has recently replicated the experiment for a soon - to - be - aired BBC documentary - all the way up to the 450 - volt mark , again finding a similar outcome to Professor Milgram .
" It 's not that these people are simply not good people any more - there is a massive social influence going on . "
She said that the volunteers were being asked to carry out a complex task in aid of scientific research , and became entirely focused on it , with " little room " left for considering the plight of the person receiving the shock .
" They tend to identify massively with the ' experimenter ' , and become very engaged and distracted by the research .
" There 's no opportunity for them to say ' What 's my moral stand on this ? ' "

A mysterious object close to our solar system was detected by an international team of researchers who made the discovery after exploring an unusual surplus of high - energy electrons bombarding the Earth from outer space .
While there is nothing unusual in cosmic rays constantly entering the solar system from all directions , the scientists were caught off guard by the rays ’ unidentified origin .
Claiming that the source of these cosmic rays could be dark matter , they have published their findings on the subject in the journal Nature .
“ This is a big discovery , ” said co-author John Wefel of Louisiana State University .
“ It ’s the first time we ’ve seen a discrete source of accelerated cosmic rays standing out from the general galactic background . ”
Wefel and his colleagues have been studying cosmic rays for over eight years , conducting experiments in which they flew a series of balloons through the stratosphere over Antarctica .
The balloons carried a NASA - funded cosmic ray detector named ATIC ( Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter ) , which normally tallied a mix of particles , mainly protons and ions .
The calorimeter , however , suddenly detected an abnormal concentration of high - energy electrons .
Wefel described the team ’s surprise by saying it was like “ driving down a freeway among family sedans , mini-vans and trucks – when suddenly a bunch of Lamborghinis bursts through the normal traffic .
”
“ You do n’t expect to see so many race cars on the road – or so many high - energy electrons in the mix of cosmic rays ” – he said .
During five weeks , ATIC reported to have encountered 70 excess electrons – this may not sound like a great number to you , but the scientists say it ’s just like seeing seventy Lamborghinis on the freeway .
“ The source of these exotic electrons must be relatively close to the solar system – no more than a kiloparsec away , ” says co-author Jim Adams of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center .
He further explains : “ High - energy electrons lose energy rapidly as they fly through the galaxy .
They give up energy in two main ways : ( 1 ) when they collide with lower - energy photons , a process called inverse Compton scattering , and ( 2 ) when they radiate away some of their energy by spiraling through the galaxy ’s magnetic field .
By the time an electron has traveled a whole kiloparsec , it is n’t so ‘ high energy ’ any more . ”
Wefel says it is impossible to pinpoint the exact location of the rays ’ sources , due to the extreme difficulty in translating the incoming particles ’ arrival angles into celestial coordinates .
One reason for this is that the balloon carrying ATIC is positioned in a turbulent vortex of high - altitude winds somewhere in the South Pole , that “ makes pointing tricky . ”
Moreover , the original directions of the electrons are inevitably altered to some degree by galactic magnetic winds .
So , what could it be ?
The scientists say the possibilities include a nearby pulsar , a “ microquasar ” or a stellar - mass black hole – all of these are capable of accelerating electrons to these energies .
NASA ’s recently - launched Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope , which , according to the Agency , is sensitive enough to track down some of these objects and might be the one to solve the mystery .
Some scientists have suggested that the excess cosmic rays can be explained by a class of physical theories called “ Kaluza - Klein theories , ” according to which dark matter consists of particles that inhibit “ extra dimensions ” – these are as many as eight dimensions , in addition to our more familiar ones , which are “ woven into the space around us . ”
The encountered cosmic rays can then be explained by assuming they are the result of colliding Kaluza - Klein particles , which exist only in higher dimensions and are known to annihilate one another upon collision , producing a spray of high - energy photons and electrons .
The resulting stream of electrons materializes in the 3 dimensions of our universe and is detected as “ cosmic rays . ”
“ Our data could be explained by a cloud or clump of dark matter in the neighborhood of the solar system , ” says Wefel .
“ In particular , there is a hypothesized Kaluza - Klein particle with a mass near 620 GeV which , when annihilated , should produce electrons with the same spectrum of energies we observed . ”
While the scientists may not be able to actually ” see ” the dark matter mass , they hope to prove its existence by looking for annihilation products , such as gamma-rays in the area .
“ Whatever it is , ” says Adams , “ it ’s going to be amazing . ”
TFOT has previously published a number of fascinating cosmology and space related articles including a recent one on the magnetic sun-earth connection , as well as our coverage of NASA ’s Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope , which has recently discovered a previously unknown pulsar .
The Lavon Affair
Israel and Terror in Egypt
Prologue
The Lavon affair ( " Esek Habish " - the shameful affair ) was one of the most bizarre chapters in Israeli history .
In 1954 , the Israeli secret service set up a spy ring in Egypt , with the purpose of blowing up US and British targets .
The operation was code - named " Susanah . "
The terrorist hits were to be blamed on the regime of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser , with the purpose of alienating the US and Britain from Egypt and Nasser and somehow preventing Egyptian nationalization of the Suez canal .
The ring was discovered .
Strict censorship ensured that that the Israeli public officially knew little or nothing of the affair for many years .
Names were not mentioned , the affair was called " Esek Bish " - the affair of shame , and key protagonists were referred to as " X " and " the third man . "
Unofficially and through leaks , most people knew at least the outlines of the affair .
No ingredient was omitted that could make this affair a totally morally repugnant fiasco .
The affair occurred during a difficult time in Israel .
Terrorist raids on Israel and reprisals had provoked a public debate about the efficacy of reprisals .
David Ben-Gurion , the founding Prime Minister , had retired to his kibbutz , Sde Boker , in September 1953 claiming fatigue and age .
In October 1954 , an Israeli reprisal raid in Qibieh , in the West Bank , lead by Ariel Sharon , had miscarried , resulting in the death of 69 civilians .
An acrimonious debate was kindled between " activists " who advocated continuing such raids , and doves , led by PM Sharett , who were against them .
It was presumed that the " activists , " proteges of Ben Gurion , and in particular Moshe Dayan who was IDF Chief of Staff , initiated the operation on the orders of Ben Gurion .
Ben Gurion , on the other hand , disowned Defense Minister Lavon , and claimed that Lavon had given the orders .
The left wing of the Labor party adopted the cause of Lavon .
The right adopted the cause of Ben Gurion , Shimon Peres and Moshe Dayan .
Nothing definite could ever be proven .
The prisoners of the Lavon affair remained forgotten in Egyptian jails , and were not exchanged after the Sinai campaign .
Since they were mostly Sephardi Jews , their cause became a cause celebre of those who claimed that Israel , and in particular the Mapai party , discriminated against Sephardi Jews .
The arrest of the ring resulted in an affair that dominated Israeli politics for over a decade .
Israel was embarrassed , as it had been caught trying to harm American and British interests for no reason and in instigating terror attacks against innocent targets .
The spies who were not executed were left to rot in Egyptian jails .
Meanwhile , a wave of persecution forced the emigration of tens of thousands of Jews from Egypt , leaving behind property , memories and roots .
Investigations in Israel led to a trail of forged documents and perjured testimony , as everyone involved tried to implicate others .
To all of the above would be added the ignominy of betrayal , as it became evident eventually that Israeli agent Avri Seidenberg ( Avri Elad ) had probably betrayed the operation to the Egyptians .
The spy ring was not run by the Israeli Mossad intelligence service , but rather by unit 131 of AMAN ( IDF intelligence ) .
The rationale behind creation of this group was that they would be local sleeper agents , trained in various techniques , who would remain in place and be activated only in case of war .
At some point , someone decided , for unknown reasons , to activate the ring without waiting for war .
In those days the intelligence services were comparatively inexperienced , under budgeted and unprofessional , though the Mossad was to achieve notable success , mainly through luck , such as obtaining a copy of the twentieth party congress speech of Soviet Premier Krushchev .
Israeli intelligence was easy to infiltrate .
They had a relatively low opinion of intelligence services of Arab countries and were therefore not on their guard .
Their vetting procedures for new agents were poor .
Soviet and other intelligence agencies also had no little trouble recruiting agents among new immigrants .
The Egyptian spies were poorly compartmentalized .
They were not trained to resist torture .
The operation was not compartmentalized : the spies knew each other 's identities .
Thus , there was a danger that under interrogation , any one of them could betray the entire group .
Worse , it is now believed that in fact they were betrayed by the Israeli agent in charge of the operation .
The sensational revelations about the spy ring endangered the entire Egyptian Jewish community , which numbered about 50,000 , as well as the credibility of Israel .
The Ring
The Egyptian Jews known to have been recruited for the spy ring were :
Shmuel Azar
Yosef Carmon
Victor Levy
Dr. Moshe Marzouk
Meir Meyuhas
Robert Dassa
Phillip Nathanson
Marcelle Ninio
Meir Za'afran
There may have been others , including an additional Israeli agent .
They were recruited and trained by Avraham Dar , an Israeli agent who went by the name of John Darling , supposedly a British businessman .
They were flown to France and then to Israel and trained in use of explosives .
Dar 's ring was handed over to Avraham Seidenberg , who had Hebraicized his name to Avri Elad .
Elad had a shady past .
He had gotten in trouble with the IDF in 1948 for looting a refrigerator from an Arab house , and had been reduced in rank to private .
Shimon Peres claims that Elad was a crook even as a young member of Kibbutz Alumot .
Peres was then treasurer of the Kibbuts , and he relates that Elad pilfered the contents of Peres 's wallet , which had cash to be used for Kibbutz purchases ( Peres , p 104 ) .
Elad was nonetheless recruited into the intelligence service owing to lax vetting procedures .
He first traveled to Germany , where he posed as a former SS officer named Paul Frank .
He apparently managed to discover how wanted Nazi war criminals were able to escape to Arab countries , as well as getting information about Egyptian efforts to recruit former Nazis to help it build an arms industry .
However , Israeli intelligence later assessed that at some point Elad became a double agent .
The Ring Acts and is Caught
The group was activated in July of 1954 .
The first bombs were placed in post offices on July 15 , followed by the USIA libraries in Cairo and Alexandria on July 14 .
On July 23 , more bombs were exploded in two Cairo cinemas , in the railway terminal and central post office .
The entire ring was soon rounded up , either because of information divulged under interrogation or because it had been betrayed .
Ostensibly , they were caught when , by chance , incendiary bombs went off in the pocket of Phillip Nathanson while he was waiting in line outside the British owned Rio theater in Alexandria on July 23 ( according to Melman and Haber ) .
However , police who arrested Nathanson said they had been tipped off according to some versions .
Max ( Meir ) Binett ( or Benett ) , another member of unit 131 , IDF intelligence , was in Egypt on other business .
He had previously been an agent in Tehran and Baghdad .
In 1952 he was sent to Egypt as a German businessman .
Unfortunately , Marcelle Ninio knew at least the license plate number of his automobile , though probably not his name , and either she , or Elad had given him away to the Egyptians .
As soon as the group was arrested , Moshe Dayan , then Chief of Staff of the IDF , fired Mordechai Ben Tzur , who had headed unit 131 , replacing him with Major Yossi Harel ( Hamburger ) who was recalled from studies in the United States .
Harel may be familiar to readers in another role - he was the commander of the immigrant ship , Exodus , in 1947 .
Harel ordered the withdrawal of all unit 131 agents operating in Arab countries from the field , until it could be ascertained that nobody was compromised by the arrests .
They were only returned in 1956 .
The Trial and Sentencing
The Egyptians had announced the arrest of a " 13 man spy ring " on October 5 , 1954 ( Hirst , 1977 ) .
The trial in Egypt began on December 11 .
The Egyptians apparently somehow concluded that the operation was ordered by the Israeli Secretary of Defense , Pinchas Lavon , though they could not possibly have had evidence from the prisoners that proved this claim .
It was nonetheless a reasonable assumption .
Of the thirteen defendants , two were acquitted .
Max Binnet could not risk revealing his identity as an Israeli agent and committed suicide on arrest .
Yosef Carmon committed suicide in prison . .
Dr. Moshe Marzouk of Cairo and Shmuel Azar of Alexandria , were sentenced to death and hanged in a Cairo prison .
Marzouk claimed that he had organized the ring and took full responsibility , apparently to reduce the guilt of the others .
Victor Levy and Philip Nathanson , got life sentences .
. Marcelle Ninio , a woman , and Robert Dassa , were both sentenced to 15 years in jail .
Meir Meyuhas and Meir Za'afran , served seven year jail sentences , were released in 1962 and made their way to Israel , where they lived in obscurity .
Israel did not even try to exchange any of the prisoners for Egyptian prisoners of war after the 1956 Suez campaign .
In 1968 however , following the 6 day war , they were finally released , on the insistence of Meir Amit , then head of AMAN .
Shakeups in Israel
The Israeli cabinet had not seen fit to discuss the incident at all until the trial concluded in Egypt .
The Israeli press was outraged by the allegations of the Egyptians , and alleged that it was a frame up .
Perhaps the truth was not brought to the attention of the cabinet immediately .
The details of the affair had remained top secret for many years .
However , a version of the affair had been leaked by the army to poet Nathan Alterman , who published a poem that hinted about it esoterically in his column in Davar , the Mapai party newspaper .
When the government reviewed the case after the trial , both Pinchas Lavon , who had been minister of defense , and Benjamin Gibli , who headed AMAN , resigned or were forced out .
Lavon 's resignation was also influenced by his tendency to order retaliatory attacks without the approval of PM Moshe Sharett .
Lavon was replaced by Ben Gurion , who returned from retirement in Sde Boker , and Gibli was replaced by Yehoshafat Harkavi , his deputy .
Before his resignation , Gibli sent Elad back to Germany , perhaps to keep him from testifying .
An investigation led astray
A committee of two , composed of Yitzhak Olshan , president of the Supreme court , and Yaakov Dori , first IDF chief of staff , was appointed to investigate the affair .
They were unable to answer the question , " who gave the order " because people involved lied systematically and forged documents .
Isser Harel , head of the Mossad and the Sherut Bitachon Klali ( Shin Bet - the General Security Services , responsible for internal security ) in the 1950s , had been suspicious of Elad , because he had gotten out of the affair unscathed .
The evidence was suggestive .
However , Harel had no proof and he had no real influence in AMAN , which was part of the IDF , or in unit 131 .
Without proof , he could do little .
In January 1955 , Elad was ordered back to Israel to testify .
Givli tried to travel to Germany and suborn Elad , but the plan was discovered by Dayan , who blocked the trip .
Givli managed to send a message by special courier .
He also met Elad at the airport and " guided " his testimony .
Elad perjured himself and supported Givli 's version , giving a date for the order supposedly issued by Ben Tzur that corresponded with the date given in a letter that had been forged on Givli 's orders .
In a book he wrote long after the event , Elad admitted he had lied on the orders of his superiors , claiming that he did it in order to save the image of the IDF .
Elad 's perjured testimony was probably crucial in preventing the Olshan - Dori committee from discovering who had given the order for the operation .
The committee reported on January 13 , 1955 :
" We were not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the head of military intelligence [ Givli ] did not receive the order from the Minister of Defense [ Lavon ] .
At the same time , we are not sure that the Minister of Defense did give the order attributed to him . "
( Peres , pp 103-104 ) .
Elad was apparently no longer working for military intelligence .
However , returned to Germany , ostensibly to care for his father , who was very ill .
At the beginning of 1956 , he was ordered back to Israel and questioned again by Yossi Harel , but to no avail .
Elad again returned to Germany .
Apparently without getting permission from his former superiors in AMAN , Elad contacted Colonel Othman Nuri , who was deputy - commander of Egyptian intelligence .
Mole !
In 1957 , David Kimche , then a junior Mossad agent , tried to recruit a former Wehrmacht intelligence officer , Robert Jensen .
Kimche claimed he was working for a " European intelligence service . "
Jensen told Kimche that he knew that he must come from Nuri .
An Egyptian agent had told him to tell Nuri that " Wagner sent him . "
The name of this " Egyptian agent " according to Jensen , was Paul Frank .
Kimche was aghast .
Paul Frank was Elad 's cover name .
This information reached David Ben-Gurion , now Prime Minister again , the next day .
He ordered IDF field security to investigate .
Elad was an Israeli hero and had to be treated with kid gloves .
Versions differ on how Elad was enticed to come back to Israel .
He was offered various business deals according to Ya'akov Hefetz , who had been put in charge of the investigation .
Elad claimed in his book that he returned of his own free will to find out the truth in the Lavon affair .
In any event , he was invited for interrogation by IDF field security , in the company of Unit 131 commander , Yossi Harel .
Yaakov Hefetz , head of IDF field security , interrogated Elad .
Microphones broadcast the interrogation to an adjacent room , where Tzvi Aharoni and Victor Cohen , Shin Bet agents , were listening in .
Aharoni had been given a special appointment as a senior police officer for this mission .
Hefetz , who knew Elad well as a comrade in arms , began by saying , " Avri , I am not speaking to you now as Yankele Hefetz , your friend , but as the head of the IDF Field Security department talking to Captain Avri Seidenberg .
Elad cut him off and said , using Yiddish slang mixed with Hebrew , " Never mind the hush hush stuff and get to the point . "
Hefetz said , " You do not have to respond , but what you say may be held in evidence against you .
Avri , have you ever betrayed your country ? "
Elad paled , according to Hefetz , and said , most amazingly , " Wait , Wait , let me think about that and remember . "
This was enough for Tzvi Aharoni , who cut the interview short , entered the room and said , " I am arresting you on the grounds of suspicions I hold against you . "
Elad was interrogated at length , but denied everything .
Victor Cohen , who had known virtually nothing about " operation Sussanah " was amazed , and was also skeptical of Elad 's version of the story .
Elad had stayed in Egypt for 12 days after the arrest of the ring .
He had sold his De Soto automobile .
He even took the trouble to remove the bumper to reduce its tax value .
He claimed that he had smuggled out of Egypt film of rockets being developed with the aid of German technicians .
All this was incredible .
Nonetheless , Elad was still treated with kid gloves .
According to Melman and Haber , on the way to his incarceration in Ramle prison , he persuaded his guards to allow him to stop in his apartment .
He arranged for a friend , Peter Landesman , to pick up a suitcase from his apartment , and to stop a shipment of personal effects on its way to Hamburg .
Landesman put the freight in storage in a locker in Haifa .
When he opened the suitcase , he found it was full of top - secret documents and burned them .
However , Elad gave his sister , who visited him in jail , a note for Landesman .
The note was intercepted by the Shin Bet , and Landesman was interrogated and confessed to burning the documents .
The freight originally destined for Hamburg contained Elad 's diary , but there was nothing in it to incriminate him in betrayal of the Israeli spy ring in Egypt .
Additional documents , held by his wife in Germany , disappeared .
Elad was tried in 1958 and sentenced to ten years in prison for relatively minor offences .
The judges noted the strong suspicion that he had betrayed the spy ring , but his role could not be proven .
Aftershocks - Reinvestigation
Failure has no fathers .
It was time to pass the buck .
Ben Gurion insisted that Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon was responsible for the fiasco .
Lavon insisted that Colonel Benjamin Givli , a protege of Ben Gurion and head of Aman ( Military intelligence ) had organized the operation behind his back .
Lavon insisted on re-opening the affair .
Ben Gurion appointed a committee of three members , Supreme Court Justice Haim Cohen and two army officers .
However , Lavon also testified to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee .
He blamed Givli and accused Givli and others of an elaborate frame - up and cover up .
The testimony was leaked , causing a scandal .
Lavon claimed Ben-Gurion was persecuting him , and insisted on that his name be cleared .
The cabinet backed Lavon .
A commission of inquiry consisting of 7 ministers was set up to investigate .
They found that Moshe Dayan and Shimon Peres forged a document , apparently the letter giving the order , to incriminate Lavon .
On December 24 , 1960 , the Israeli cabinet unanimously exonerated Lavon of all guilt in the ' disastrous security adventure in Egypt ' .
According to a New York Times article ( New York Times , 10 February 1961 ) the Attorney General had found ' conclusive evidence of forgeries as well as false testimony in an earlier inquiry ' .
This was most likely the testimony of Elad and Givli , and the forged letter that Givli had produced .
Ben-Gurion insisted that the committee was politically motivated , and that ministers could not be judges .
In the subsequent 1961 elections , Ben-Gurion declared that he would only accept office if Lavon was fired as First Secretary of the Histadrut , Israel 's labor union organization .
His demands were met .
Lavon was forced to resign , but his supporters organized protest demonstrations .
However , in 1964 Ben Gurion claimed there was new evidence and demanded that the government reopen the investigation with a proper judicial commission .
According to Shimon Peres , Ben Gurion felt that Lavon had at least ministerial overall responsibility , and that it was unjust for him to place all the blame on Givli , an army officer .
However , in the absence of proof , Ben Gurion was content with the ambiguous ruling of Olshan and Drori .
When Lavon insisted on exoneration however , Ben-Gurion insisted on some sort of judicial commission .
At this time , there was no law regarding judicial investigations in Israel .
The procedure for such investigations was established by law only in 1968 , as a result of the Lavon Affair .
( Peres , pp 110 - 111 ) .
Ben Gurion tried to force his political party Mapai , The Israel Workers Party , to resolve this issue during 1964 - 1965 .
Instead , Ben-Gurion was forced to leave the party he had founded .
The party cleared and rehabilitated Lavon completely in May 1964 .
Ben -Gurion founded the Min Hayesod faction with Shimon Peres and Moshe Dayan .
This later became the Rafi party which won ten mandates , but then was reduced to four members as the Reshima Mamlachtit party after Dayan and Peres returned to the Labor party in 1967 .
Ben -Gurion failed to attract a significant number of votes , and retained a permanent enmity to Levy Eshkol , who had replaced him as Prime Minister .
In 1967 , in part because of this enmity , Ben Gurion and his supporters were able to bring about the enlargement of the Eshkol government just before the 6 - Day War .
History had passed by the founder of the Israeli state because of this one affair .
Ben -Gurion retired to his home in Sde Boker in the Negev , to live in relative obscurity , and influence events from the side lines through his proteges - Moshe Dayan and Shimon Peres , until they returned to the Labor party .
In the 1980s , Benjamin Givli 's secretary , Dalia Goldstein , confessed to forging the letter giving the orders , supposedly sent by Ben Tzur , that had been used to incriminate Lavon .
The forged letter to Elad activating the ring , was given an incorrect date .
As noted , Givli had also suborned Elad to give false testimony .
By that time , Ben Gurion was dead .
The Labor party , partly owing to the scandal set in motion by the Lavon affair , was out of power .
Elad had moved to California and written his memoirs , protesting his innocence .
Epilogue
To this day the truth about who gave the orders in the Lavon affair cannot be ascertained .
We do not have all the pieces of the puzzle .
Probably we never will .
In the absence of real information , the Lavon affair has been fertile grounds for speculation by various interested parties , but none of the theories offered fits all the facts .
For many years , Israeli leftist parties sided with Lavon against Ben-Gurion , Dayan and Peres .
Peres continues to maintain his innocence , and claims that Lavon had become eccentric and held extremist anti-American and anti-western views .
Rumor claims that Lavon was an alcoholic .
The affair continues to do damage to this day , because every bigot , crank and eccentric can use it to prove their favorite contention .
Most recently , it has been used to " prove " that Israel engineered the Al - Qaida terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11 , 2001 .
Qui Bono ?
Curiously , the alleged motivation for the operation has not been questioned .
Who could really have benefited had it been successful ?
Shabtai Tevet , Ben Gurion 's biographer , stated that the assignment was " To undermine Western confidence in the existing [ Egyptian ] regime by generating public insecurity and actions to bring about arrests , demonstrations , and acts of revenge , while totally concealing the Israeli factor .
The team was accordingly urged to avoid detection , so that suspicion would fall on the Muslim Brotherhood , the Communists , ' unspecified malcontents ' or ' local nationalists ' . "
( Tevet , p. 81 ) .
" The team was .. urged to avoid detection " is an absurd statement .
Did Tevet mean to imply that otherwise , Israeli espionage teams are not urged to avoid detection ?
Of course it is a good idea to avoid detection if you are Israeli agents blowing up public and foreign facilities in an Arab country .
The team would hardly need urging on that score .
But if secrecy was of the essence , why was n't the operation compartmentalized ?
Why were n't team members taught to resist torture ?
These techniques were certainly known to the Israeli intelligence establishment , and had been used in the preparation of paratroopers sent behind Nazi lines in WW II .
On examination , the motives offered are far - fetched .
The ostensible purpose was to prevent the withdrawal of British occupying forces from Suez , which would supposedly leave Israeli defenses naked to Egyptian attack .
Firstly , the British were in no position to stop an Egyptian attack with their small occupation force .
Secondly , if , as often claimed , the affair was the work of the Israeli activist faction , it made no sense .
The activists wanted decisive action against Egypt .
This was not possible as long as the British were in Suez , in close proximity to Sinai and defending the canal .
With the British gone , and no longer committed to defense of Egypt and the canal , the way became open to contemplate a large scale military operation such as the Sinai campaign .
The possible gains from the bombings carried out by this group would in any case have been minor .
There is no reason to assume the US would necessarily have blamed the Egyptian government for activities of opposition as some claim ( See for example , Hirst , 1977 ) .
On the contrary , Nasser could claim he was carrying out a pro-Western policy against the wishes of the opposition , and that removal of British troops was needed to satisfy anti-Western sentiment .
The British pullout was not dependent on the stability of the Egyptian regime .
Egypt had just undergone a revolution that was not quite completed , and was known to be unstable anyway .
It is a fact that several of the bombs were in fact set off , but American and British policy were totally unaffected .
In all , it is extremely doubtful if the operation would have accomplished anything even if the ring had not been caught .
Even had they been convinced that Nasser 's regime was unstable , the US and Britain tend to prop up their unstable allies , not abandon them .
That could have been easily foreseen
Why then , would Israel risk the safety of Egyptian Jews , its relations with the US and Britain and its agents ?
The argument that Lavon was a scapegoat of " activists " who wanted him out of the way so that they could perform more reprisal raids does n't make sense either , because Lavon was apparently an extreme hawk .
If Givli acted on the orders of Dayan in forging the letter , then why did Dayan try to stop him from coordinating testimony with Elad , as Melman and Haber claim ?
If Givli acted on his own , or if in reality Lavon had given the order , what were their motivations ?
Is it possible that Givli was somehow involved with Elad 's activities as a double agent , that Elad was indeed trying to raise money for his sick father , but selling real secrets instead of fake ones as he claimed ?
Givli might have been sharing profits with Elad , and may have seen the need to cover his tracks .
A foreign power who knew about the ring may have induced Elad or Givli to activate it in order to embarrass Israel or to cause an Egyptian rift with the west , or to provide Egypt for an excuse for stepping up infiltration against Israel .
All of these were in fact direct or indirect consequences of the fiasco , and they could have been easily foreseen , especially since whoever instigated it knew about the ring .
Given the contempt of Israeli intelligence for Arab intelligence services , and their false sense of security regarding foreign penetration in general , it is doubtful that this possibility was ever investigated .
Given the number of espionage fiascos due to penetration by foreign agents in those years , it is a possibility that should have been investigated .

The Lavon Affair
By Doron Geller
Two people , Yosef Carmon and Max ( Meir ) Binnet , committed suicide in prison due to the brutal interrogation methods of the Egyptian police .
Two more , Dr. Moshe Marzouk of Cairo and Shmuel Azar of Alexandria , were sentenced to death and hanged in a Cairo prison .
Israel glorified them as martyrs .
Their memory was sanctified .
Neighborhoods and gardens were named after them in Israel , as were dozens of children born in the year 1955 .
At the same time it was not publicly conceded that they died in the service of Israel .
The other six heroes of the " Esek HaBish " were far less prominently known .
They were sentenced to long jail terms , where they languished for years .
Two of them , Meir Meyuhas and Meir Za'afran , were released in 1962 , after having served seven year jail sentences .
Shrouded in secrecy , they reached Israel where their arrival was not made public , and journalists were not allowed to interview them .
Sworn to silence , they reconstructed their lives to the best of their ability , far from the spotlight .
That left four more " Zionist spies , " as they came to be called in Egypt .
Marcelle Ninio , a woman , and Robert Dassa , both sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment , and Victor Levy and Philip Nathanson , who were sentenced for life .
Marcelle Ninio was kept on her own in the women 's prison in Kanather .
The men were jailed together for fourteen years , mainly in the Tura prison .
Why would such young Jews risk their lives for an Arab country in which they were born , for a country - Israel - which until 1952 they had never seen ?
And why would Israel decide to open up a cell of native Jews to spy for them ?
For Israel , sources of information were drying up in Egypt after the War of Independence of 1948 .
Perhaps more than half of Egypt 's approximately 80,000 Jews had left for Israel by mid-1950 .
Egyptian Muslims were more openly hostile and distrustful of those Jews who remained , which led many Jews to sever any connection they had with Israel .
Israel thus needed sources of information .
More than that , by the early 1950 's Egyptian nationalist agitation against the British presence in Egypt and especially in the Suez Canal Zone was intensifying .
Britain was speaking openly about leaving Egypt as she had from Palestine a few years before , in 1948 .
British troops in the Canal Zone were living in similar conditions to those in Palestine by the end of the Mandate - behind barbed wire in protected zones .
At a farewell party for the small number of Egyptian Jews who participated in the course , they decided to call what they would be called upon to do " Operation Susannah . "
It was partly in jest , named after Victor Levy 's fiancee , whose name was Susan Kauffman .
She went with him to Israel and stayed .
The spies were to return to Egypt , and they would know when to go into action when they would hear an Israel radio broadcast of the American song " Oh! Susannah . "
Victor Levy left for Egypt in August 1952 .
On the way back to Egypt he first stopped off in Paris and then other locations in France in order to learn more about manufacturing explosives and some photography .
An Israeli agent by the name of Avraham Seidenberg was sent to take over the organization of the spy ring from his predecessor , Avraham Dar .
Seidenberg was a good choice for such a dangerous mission - taking into account that he was an Israeli unlike the Egyptian Jews , and thus had more of a chance of his cover being blown .
Yet he had little to lose .
He had been caught looting Arab property during Israel 's War of Independence and had never been able to rehabilitate himself in public life .
His marriage , too , was on the rocks , and thus he was quite happy to be offered something that could lead to new vistas and opportunities .
Seidenberg was first sent to Germany to establish a false identity as a former SS officer by the name of Paul Frank .
He successfully infiltrated the ranks of the underground former Nazi network .
He set out for Egypt in early 1954 , his new identity established .
" He chalked up a number of successes , uncovering the underground route by which wanted Nazi war criminals slipped through to the Arab states , as well as supplying the first reports about Egyptian efforts to establish an arms industry with the help of German experts . "
Once he arrived in Egypt he began recruiting further members of the Egyptian Jewish community .
Marcelle Ninio was one of those who were captivated by his show of confidence and by the fact that he was an Israeli .
The other members of the cell - who all knew each other , which was an unfortunate portent and a major mistake in terms of organizing espionage operations - agreed to work for him as well .
On July 2 , 1954 , they went into action .
They first blew up some post offices and a few days later , the American libraries in Cairo and Alexandria .
These operations were to " make it clear to the whole world that Egypt 's new rulers were nothing but a group of foolhardy extremists , unreliable and unworthy of taking charge of an asset as important as the Suez Canal .
Furthermore , it was to be demonstrated that their grasp on power was uncertain , that they faced powerful internal opposition , and , consequently , they were unworthy of being counted upon as a dependable ally . "
Robert Dassa was one of the first of the spies to be caught .
Philip Nathanson was caught soon after when , on the way to blow up a cinema in Alexandria , the bomb he was carrying in his pocket ignited and then exploded .
What was a particularly alarming factor was that outside of the theater a fire engine was waiting , as if expecting them .
Philip had the distinct feeling he was being watched .
It turned out that he had been .
As Philip lay on the ground , he saw startled and frightened faces looking down at him .
While somebody shouted " Take care !
He may have another bomb ! "
Philip heard a police sergeant say " Do n't worry , do n't worry .
We were waiting for them .
These are the people who set fire to the American library . "
He was taken by ambulance to a hospital .
After being lightly treated , he was interrogated by members of Egypt 's military intelligence , the Muhabarrat .
The others were caught soon after - Shmuel Azar , Philip Nathanson , Robert Dassa , and Marcelle Ninio .
None of them had been prepared by their Israeli handlers for this eventuality .
They refused to implicate one another .
At first , they did n't even admit to the bombings .
When the police brought Philip Nathanson to his house with incriminating material , which were sure to implicate him , Philip continued to maintain that he was innocent of all charges .
As he recalls being brought to his house ; " ' The house was overflowing with policemen and detectives in and out of uniform .
They took me straight to the garden , and to the workshop in the garden hut .
This too was so crowded there was no room for me , and I remained standing on the threshold ?
The policemen had piled the table with Vim cans , chemicals , and the fine scales I used for weighing them .
With each item they found , they asked me : ' What 's this ?
What 's it for ? ' "
' I told them I was manufacturing dyes . '
' Sure , ' said the governor sarcastically .
' There 's a good market for them , praise be to Allah . ' "
The police took everything they could from his house , even a fork and a spoon , to be used as evidence against them .
Victor Levy , Robert Dassa and Philip Nathanson held up to the persistent questioning , threats , and occasional beatings .
They maintained that they were Communists who wanted the British imperialists out of Egypt .
This even earned them the admiration and respect from the Egyptians , who also wanted the British out .
That is , until Shmuel Azar , who was constitutionally incapable of telling a lie , admitted that they were Jews and Zionists working on behalf of the State of Israel .
Thereafter , the whole network was rounded up and arrested by August 5 , 1954 .
" Paul Frank " , or Avraham Seidenberg ( Avri Gilad ) , meanwhile , did nothing , and left Egypt only on August 5 , when Meir Meyuhas and Moshe Marzouk were arrested .
In Israel , Seidenberg got a hero 's welcome as the only member of the network who had gotten away .
Meanwhile , Marcelle Ninio waited nervously , not knowing what to do , wishing to leave , but unable to do so .
Seidenberg never got back in contact with her , and in fact appeared to be very relaxed about the whole ordeal .
He had even encouraged the Egyptian Jews to stay put before they were arrested .
It was only years later that they began to question Seidenberg 's role in the story .
Israeli Intelligence began to suspect him much earlier .
The " Zionist spies , " as they came to be called , had n't been well treated before they admitted they had been working on behalf of Israel .
But it was bearable .
That all changed after their association with Israel was known .
Marcelle Ninio was arrested and beaten mercilessly on the soles of her feet , she was threatened with sexual abuse , and it did n't let up .
The torture became so unbearable that at one point she threw herself out of a window and nearly died .
She only just managed to survive .
She was taken to a hospital where she was allowed to heal .
The men were transferred from Alexandria to Cairo , where the prison guards were known to be even more savage than their Alexandrian counterparts .
They were taken to the Sigan Harbi , a prison notorious for its cruelty - a reputation the guards there very much wanted to maintain .
When they were marched down the stinking and decrepit hallways , in chains , they could hear cries coming out of the other cells .
In the near future those cries would sometimes be of their friends .
This went on day and night .
Treatment was something akin to a medieval torture chamber .
Moreover , there were rivalries between the police and prison guards on the one side , and the Muhabarrat ( military intelligence ) on the other .
Both sides wanted to prove that they could extract more information than the other .
The prison guards would sometimes hang the prisoners up with their arms tied behind their heads , and beat the prisoners savagely until they fainted , and sometimes even died .
The truth is that this treatment was not only meted out to the Jewish spies - Egyptian members of the Muslim Brotherhood , who were fierce opponents of Nasser 's secular , socialist , military regime - received exactly the same treatment , and sometimes even worse .
At one point one of the higher level prison guards , after savagely beating a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , called in Robert Dassa .
The guard told him to beat the Moslem Brother .
" Now , I am going to let a Jew beat you . "
Robert refused .
The Moslem Brotherhood member 's eyes , cringing with fear , softened a little .
The guards turned on Robbie savagely and told him to beat the prisoner or else .
He would n't .
A gang of guards then set upon Robbie , savagely beating him , while the Moslem Brother pleaded with the guards to stop beating Robbie .
As long as he could , Robbie stoically refused to cry out and give the guards any kind of satisfaction .
After months of this kind of treatment they were finally brought to trial .
The verdict was predetermined from the start , a fact which was known as long ago as 1956 .
The sentences were a compromise between the extremists of the new government , who wanted all of the spies put to death , and those more moderate members of the government , " who preferred to win the world 's sympathy for their regime by a more humane approach .
This is confirmed by the court 's presiding judge , Gen . Fuad el Digwi , when he fell into Israeli captivity during the 1956 campaign .
At the time he was the military governor of the Gaza Strip .
He told his interrogators : ' The verdict was dictated to me by my supervisors , who decided how many were to be sentenced to death , how many to imprisonment , and for what terms . ' "
The trial went on for two weeks .
As a show trial , it was staged for two purposes .
" Abroad , it was to stress the story that ' Israel tried to undermine Egyptian - American friendship ' ; at home , it would show that the regime 's severity was not confined to the Moslem Brotherhood alone . "
As we discussed above , the Nasser regime treated the Moslem Brothers as badly as the Jewish spies .
The trial was given " unusual publicity . "
The press emphasized again and again how dangerous the ' Israeli ' spies were to Egypt , and demanded severe punishment .
Naturally , the press pronounced the Jews guilty before the court did .
Such intensive and ongoing press coverage had a deeply demoralizing effect on the families of the imprisoned Jewish spies .
In court , however , they showed smiles of encouragement from the spectators ' gallery , as did the spies themselves .
Marcelle Ninio was completely healed by then - it is unlikely they would have permitted her to be shown to the outside world in any other way .
Moshe Marzouk publicly took responsibility for the group and everything that they had done .
The presiding Military Judge , General Digwi was taken aback by the admission .
On only one point did Moshe concede to his companions ' pleas not to reveal more about their activities ; and that was not to admit that they had undergone military training in Israel .
After the trial the men were transferred to Tura Prison .
Moshe Marzouk and Shmuel Azar were sentenced to be hanged .
Massive world pressure was applied on the Egyptian Government not to hang the two condemned men .
American President Eisenhower intervened , as did the Indian President Nehru - and even the Pope .
The Egyptians , aware of the American hangings of the Rosenbergs , Jewish Americans who had spied on behalf of the Soviet Union , responded ; " Egypt ( will ) treat its spies in precisely the same manner adopted by the United States . "
Moshe Marzouk and Shmuel Azar were hanged in early 1955 .
Marcelle Ninio was sentenced to 15 years in the women 's prison of Kanather - the longest sentence ever for a women political prisoner in Egypt .
The previous high had been 8 years .
After the hangings of Moshe Marzouk and Shmuel Azar , relations between Egypt and Israel considerably worsened .
Palestinian infiltration from Gaza into Israel , with Egyptian connivance , considerably increased , as did Israeli retaliatory raids .
Border tensions were reflected in the prison .
The Egyptian guards frequently incited the Moslem prisoners against their fellow Jewish prisoners .
When the prisoners were sent out to the quarries to undergo grueling , back - breaking labor cutting and hauling rocks , the " Zionist spies " were under constant threat of falling rocks loosened by ill - intentioned fellow prisoners .
The Jews did have an advantage , however ; Robbie was known in their old prison ( the Sigan Harbi ) , as someone who had helped the Moslem Brothers who had been tortured by the prison authorities .
They saw that he refused to beat a fellow prisoner and had been beaten in return .
He also helped many other prisoners beaten so badly that they could hardly walk to get back and forth to the bathroom when they needed to .
In theory , while the Moslem Brothers should have hated Robbie and his fellow Jewish prisoners , they recognized what he had done for them .
When he was transferred to Tura , word was passed that Robert had helped the Moslem Brotherhood , and that henceforth he was to be treated as one of them .
In fact , Robert and the other Jewish prisoners formed friendships with men whom , on the outside , they would have been bitter enemies with .
It is almost touching to see how the Jewish prisoners , in jail , formed relations with other prisoners who were fully aware of the fact that they had been caught and sentenced for spying for Israel .
Although tensions heated up during the 1956 war , after it many Moslem guards and prisoners told the Jewish prisoners that they had every reason to be released in a prisoner exchange , and wished them the best .
It seemed logical that they would be released ; Israel held 5000 Egyptian prisoners after her conquest of the Sinai .
But they traded them all back for one Israeli pilot .
Israel did n't even ask for the spies .
It is not clear why this was the case .
Either Israel did not want to ask , and thereby admit their involvement in the affair ( which could have endangered Israel 's relations with the United States ) ; or else the Israelis simply did n't want to get involved .
Many of the Israelis originally involved in the " Lavon Affair " or " Esek HaBish " had been forced out of office and no longer wanted anything to do with it .
They did n't raise their voices in protest over the abandonment of the spies ; they simply did n't bring the subject up .
Whatever the case , the spies continued to languish in prison , long after the last of the Egyptian prisoners returned home .
One person who became convinced that something had gone amiss , and that people in Israel were to blame - was David Ben-Gurion .
In a Commission of Inquiry into the Affair published in December 1960 , Pinhas Lavon , ( the Defense Minister at the time of the capture of the spies in 1954 ) was declared not guilty of authorizing the operation .
All the ministers in Ben-Gurion 's accepted this ruling except for Ben-Gurion himself .
A bitter debate ensued which subsequently went on for years .
But by then most of those involved in the affair had been removed from their posts .
Motke Ben - Tzur , head of a section of Military Intelligence in 1954 , had been dismissed in October of that year .
Pinhas Lavon resigned from the post of Defense Minister on January 2 , 1955 .
Binyamin Gibli , the Director of military Intelligence , was replaced as well .
The only man to emerge unscathed was Avraham Seidenberg , alias " Paul Frank , " alias " Robert " , who was subsequently referred to in Israel as " the Third Man " .
He had given the order to the cell to act - and he was the only one who escaped .
As we saw , he returned to a hero 's welcome in Israel , his role in the affair unquestioned at the time .
Israeli Intelligence even sent him on another mission to Germany .
Isser Harel served as head of the Shin Bet and the Mossad from 1952 - 1963 .
He became a giant in early Israeli intelligence , responsible for the capture of Adolph Eichmann and many other operations , as we shall see in a few weeks .
Isser Harel was known to act on his instincts - which often proved him correct .
He began to suspect Seidenberg .
He ordered Seidenberg back from Germany , and then removed him from Intelligence in October 1956 .
But Seidenberg was still not arrested or even accused of anything at the time .
To soften the blow , Seidenberg was asked to write reports on his activities in Egypt and Germany .
He was given access to archives , and years later , it was discovered that he took some of the top - secret documents he then had access to .
He served a short prison term , but after his discharge , his father in Austria became ill and Avraham Seidenberg went to visit him .
In fact he went several times .
He was , however , forbidden from entering Germany .
He went anyway , and he made contact with Nuri Otman , an Egyptian .
Seidenberg let it be known that he was prepared to sell important information to Egypt for a sizable payment .
Isser Harel started checking on Seidenberg .
He confirmed that Seidenberg was not authorized to go to Germany or to make contact with a foreign agent .
" ' We came to the conclusion ' said Harel , " that his unlawful contacts with Nuri Otman - as deputy commander of military intelligence and head of the Egyptian Army 's security services - had been in direct charge of investigating the activities of the ' Zionist network ' in 1954 . ' "
This meant that Seidenberg might very well have been a double agent working for Egypt as well as Israel .
By implication this meant that he might have turned over the Jewish spy network to his Egyptian handlers , and permitted them to be caught and then jailed while he got away .
Isser Harel tricked Seidenberg to come back to Israel by offering him a nice position business - wise , while maintaining a connection with Intelligence .
Seidenberg did come back to Israel at the end of 1957 .
A senior Intelligence officer interviewed Seidenberg about a new position , while two other senior Intelligence officers concealed themselves " in the neighboring room with the door slightly ajar when Avraham Seidenberg settled in his chair , the interviewing officer presented the first question : ' Tell me , Avry , could you swear by everything holy that you have never spied against the state of Israel ? '
Avry hesitated for a brief moment before launching on his predictable string of denials .
That moment sealed his fate . "
Under interrogation he denied everything .
Many investigative committees were appointed .
They concluded that not only had he committed perjury , but that the heads of Intelligence services had induced witnesses such as Seidenberg to commit perjury , they had lied themselves and had committed forgeries in 1954 .
Investigations in his home turned up bundles of illegal , highly sensitive intelligence material .
He went on trial for that and was convicted .
( Nevertheless , a committee was unable to find sufficient legal material to try Seidenberg for betraying his colleagues to the Egyptian police in 1954 ) .
He claimed that the whole Intelligence Services was conspiring against him and only he was telling the truth .
The court did not accept that and he was sentenced to ten years ' imprisonment .
After serving his ten years as an exemplary prisoner , he was released , and briefly sold television sets in Tel - Aviv before emigrating to California in 1972 , still denying everything .
All of the political rumblings were reported in the Egyptian press .
From there the news filtered down to the prison .
Guards and prisoners once again became hostile to them .
This treatment did not last long as they went on an 11 - day hunger strike , which led to better treatment .
In general , they were well liked and respected , even in those tense times , by the rest of the guards and prisoners .
They had many skills that they put to good use in prison - such as photography , gardening , painting , playing basketball - and raising animals .
When one of the guards saw one of Robert 's paintings , he wanted one .
Soon enough all the other guards did as well .
In return , they would do favors for him .
When they saw Victor or Philip gardening , they wanted gardens in front of their own workplaces as well .
It is rather bizarre , knowing of the often vicious nature of the Arab - Israeli conflict , that one finds the status of the Jewish spies so high in Egyptian prisons .
Their raising of ducks and parakeets within the prison particularly impressed the prison administration .
The duck farm was a rather amusing story in itself .
Once one of the ducks began hatching eggs , they decided to ask the notoriously cruel administrator to give them an incubator .
The Mudir ( administrator ) , Immara - was enthusiastic about the project .
Victor gave him a mother and three little ducks , and Immara would go every day " to feast his eyes on them . "
Moreover , he supported Victor 's project wholeheartedly .
" Anything I requested for the ducklings was provided .
No sooner did I see that a rearing house was needed than carpenters were summoned and the structure went up before my very eyes .
Two convicts were placed at my disposal , to grind up the food scraps from the kitchen .
When the ducklings grew feathers and their time came to leave the rearing house , Immara ordered the orchestra to vacate the two rooms behind the amphitheater where it used to hold rehearsals .
The rooms were converted into duck runs . "
Victor continued : " After a year or two , the duck farm ran the whole length of the prison wall . "
There was a school building attached to the prison , but " Immara ordered the pupils out and placed three of the classrooms at my disposal , to serve as rearing - rooms , this time , equipped with electric stoves .
The incubator hut was now fitted out with three up - to - date incubators operating simultaneously .
The kitchen scraps no longer sufficed , but Immara did not hesitate to requisition the convicts ' bran to feed the ducks . ' "
Immara was a very strange character .
The spies knew him from another prison , ten years before , where he had been notoriously brutal , savage and cruel to the prisoners .
When he came to Tura he was determined to prove himself again .
He took away the accumulated belongings most prisoners had accrued in their cells .
When he first arrived at Tura and saw the spies ' cell , he smiled , asked how they were , did n't seem bothered by the birds twittering around in their cell , and moved on .
He did n't conduct a search or confiscate a thing .
Soon after he made everyone vacate their cells and move into new ones with the exception of the Jews .
Other prisoners questioned his behavior .
The Jews did n't know what to make of him themselves .
For a long time they assumed he showed favoritism to them because they acquired Swiss medicines for him from the outside , which were unavailable in Egypt .
But this was not the only reason .
" Only years later , on the eve of his release , when Victor went to Immara to say good - bye , did the Mudir reveal a further reason for the change in his attitude towards them .
His brother - in - law , while serving as an army doctor at El Arish , had been taken prisoner during the Sinai campaign , and was treated well by the Israelis .
' To this day , he tells me how well your people behaved toward him . '
Immara took it upon himself to repay in kind . "
Immara grew to have complete confidence in Victor in particular , mainly because of the duck farm .
" Matters reached such a point that even guards punished by the Mudir for some offense would plead with Victor : ' He docked me ten days ' pay and I do n't have enough to feed my children as it is .
Please , do something for me . ' "
With Robert Dassa running the prison basketball team , Victor in charge of gardening and the duck farm and gardening , and Philip Nathanson holding several important posts , they all " enjoyed a position of exclusivity , with considerable freedom of movement . "
Their renown extended far outside the prison walls .
" In Cairo 's Sigan Misr , which served as a transit station for prisoners sentenced to hard labor , old lags would advise ( new ) prisoners on their way to Tura : ' When you get there , try to contact the three Jewish spies .
They 're the mukhtars ( headmen ) of the prison .
If they want to , they can be of great help to you . "
It brings to mind the story of Joseph , thrown into Pharaoh 's dungeons , rising to become the headmen of his prison in Egypt more than 3000 years before .
Comparatively , Marcelle Ninio did well for herself as well .
People who liked her supplied her with a radio and books .
She obtained writing paper and envelopes and tried her best to keep in contact with the males in the Tura prison .
She also made some real friends in the prison , particularly among the nurses .
Near the end of their imprisonment the Israeli spy Wolfgang Lotz was thrown into Tura with them as well .
Everyone , including the Jew , thought he was a German who had spied on behalf of Israel .
After he revealed the truth to them , they took him into their inner circle , as they had done with a select group of other prisoners .
Lutz , even though he had been convicted of spying for Israel , won over the guards and prisoners at Tura , just as Robert , Victor , and Philip had .
As tensions increased during the countdown to the 1967 war , there were rumors that the Jewish prisoners might be harmed .
Immara made sure that did n't happen .
Israel achieved a tremendous victory in 1967 .
This time , Israel did n't forget her spies .
Although it took months , they were finally released in February 1968 .
The prison guards , administration , and even many of the prisoners wished them well .
They all built new lives for themselves in Israel - albeit quietly , with little fanfare .
It was only some time after President Nasser 's death in 1970 that the Jewish spies came forth publicly to tell their story .

California is in a deep hole .
There is no doubt about that .
A bill in California has been introduced to legalize production , transportation and sale of the plant ( notice I did n’t say drug , oh wait … dammit ) in the state .
We ’re not going to go into a pro versus con argument on the legalization of drugs here because the argument is moot .
It ’s not going to be a gateway for the legalization of all drugs and not everyone will start doing it because it ’s legal – although that really would n’t be a bad thing , would it ?
With taxation and turning marijuana into a legitimate business in California , it is estimated that it could generate up to $ 1 billion in revenue .
Although I ’d imagine that it ’s entirely possible to get that $ 1 billion from Humboldt , Berkeley , the UC system and Stanford apart from the rest of the state .
Come on , Arnold !
Rally the troops and make this happen !
Oh , and to the hardcore conservatives of California who are going to dismiss this without even a second thought ( monetarily and scientifically ) :
Fuck you !

Tropical forest covers nearly 60 % of Peru 's territory The Peruvian government says it can reach zero deforestation in just 10 years with the help of funds from Western governments .
It is taking its ambitious proposal to the latest round of UN talks on climate change , which are taking place in Poznan .
The government claims more than 80 % of Peru 's primary forests can be saved or protected .
Peru has the fourth largest area of tropical forest in the world after Brazil , Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia .
It has around 70 million hectares of tropical forest covering nearly 60 % of its territory .
" We are not a poor country going to the Poznan meeting begging for aid , " Environment Minister Antonio Brack told the BBC .
" We are an important country with a large area of forest that has a value . "
Mr Brack says his ministry has calculated that Peru needs about $ 25 m ( £ 17 m ) a year for the next 10 years to be able to save or conserve initially at least 54 million hectares of forest , which could rise to 60 million .
He says the Peruvian government has already committed $ 5 m a year , and he is looking for $ 20 m a year from the international community .
" This is Peru 's contribution to mitigating climate change , " he said .
' Ambitious ' Government figures for Amazonian deforestation suggest 150,000 hectares were cut down in Peru in 2005 , although other organisations put the average figure in recent years higher at around 250,000 hectares annually .
Mr Brack says
Peru needs $ 25 m a year for the next ten years
This is much less than Brazil for example , which released figures last week showing an annual rate of nearly 12 million hectares .
Tropical deforestation causes about 18 % of global greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions .
Peru contributes less than 1 % of the world 's emissions , but according to the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , about half of Peru 's GHG emissions are due to deforestation .
Mr Brack says the 54 million hectares
Peru is aiming to protect or conserve is divided into four different categories : • 17 million hectares of national parks which are already in existence • 12 million for Peru's 42 indigenous groups , totally 350,000 people • 21 million for sustainable forestry development • 5 million for eco-tourism
The minister says Germany has already committed 4 m euros ( $ 5 m , £ 3.5 m ) to the first option , while Holland is interested in funding the protection of the forest for indigenous groups .
He is also hoping for funds from Finland , Great Britain and Japan .
WWF in Peru have welcomed the proposal as a statement of intent , but say there are major obstacles to achieving zero deforestation .
" The 54 million [ hectares ] as currently defined is not as guaranteed as it sounds , " said WWF 's Fred Prins .
" Also , given continued immigration , agricultural expansion , plans for biofuels and plantations , and the effects of new roads , guaranteeing zero deforestation in 10 years is very ambitious . "
Sceptics have also questioned how any government can guarantee that indigenous groups will benefit fully from such schemes and minimize the risk of international funds being siphoned off by corrupt officials .
Mr Brack says full consultation with indigenous groups is essential , but admits organisations representing Peru 's indigenous groups are already split about whether to enter into discussions with the government .
Precedents Other Latin American countries have launched similar initiatives in the run-up to Poznan .
Earlier in December , Brazil announced a plan to cut deforestation rates by 70 % over the next 10 years with the help of international funding .
It has set up a special Amazon fund where foreign countries are being asked to find more than $ 20bn by 2021 .
The Mexican government has also said it wants to launch an international " Green Fund " to help poor countries pay for environmental programmes .
Ecuador , which has a high rate of deforestation , is seeking international money for avoided deforestation by preventing oil exploration in a national park .
Some critics say that particularly at a time of world economic recession bilateral or multilateral aid will not be forthcoming in sufficient quantities from Western governments to make any significant impact on tropical deforestation .
Peru is particularly vulnerable to climate change .
It boasts a very rich diversity of Amazon species .
Its Andean peaks are already subject to accelerated glacial melt , which scientists fear will seriously threaten dry season water supplies to some coastal cities .
Peru 's Environment Ministry has only been functioning since May this year .
Its creation was largely seen as a condition for signing a Free Trade Agreement with the United States .
Mr Brack admits his ministry has to find solutions to a whole host of environmental problems .
He says deforestation is caused mostly by Andean farmers migrating to the Amazon who cut down trees for slash and burn agriculture , but also by the building of new roads and gold mining .
But he plays down the extensive presence of oil and gas companies as a cause of deforestation , claiming they only cut down small areas of forest .
Mr Brack also wants money for a new 3,000 - strong environmental police force to try to stop deforestation in remote regions .
" We currently have a force of 61 people , " he told the BBC .
" It 's a joke . "

Republic Windows and Door workers speak on their struggle
By Tom Eley
10 December 2008
A team of World Socialist Web Site reporters spoke with workers at Republic Windows and Doors .
About 250 workers have occupied their factory since being abruptly laid off last week .
( See “ Workers occupy Chicago factory for fifth day ” )
Raul Flores , who has worked at the company for eight years — since he graduated from high school — said that when workers returned to work on Monday , December 1 , they noticed that “ a whole line of production was gone , equipment and everything . ”
The company then laid off 39 people .
After the full closure of the plant was announced later in the week , workers immediately made the decision to occupy the plant , Flores explained .
“ We said , ‘ Hey , if they take everything out of here , how are they going to pay us ? ’
We ’re taking care of the machines and windows in there , because that ’s our future , that ’s our money . ”
Flores noted that Republic said it was forced to close its doors after Bank of America cut off the company ’s credit line .
With regard to the bailout of Wall Street , which has reached upwards of $ 7 trillion , some $ 25 billion of which has gone to Bank of America , Flores expressed a sentiment no doubt shared by many US workers .
“ The federal government gave this money to Bank of America .
You paid your taxes .
I paid my taxes .
Everybody paid their taxes .
So basically we ’re paying them to get us fired . ”
When asked what workers will do once a settlement is reached , Ricardo Caceres , who has worked for Republic for 15 years , expressed both fear and resolve .
“ It ’s going to be hard , but I ’ve got a family to support .
I ’ve got to go look for a job . ”
Ricardo explained , “ It ’s too close to Christmas .
You have your kid asking you , ‘ Dad you do n’t have a job ? ’
It ’s too hard for everybody here , on the families . ”
Asked what they would say to workers in other cities and countries , Ricardo said , “ This is a big starting point here in Chicago . ”
He added , “ It ’s time for workers to put their heads up .
It ’s time for workers to open their eyes .
This is not just happening here , it ’s happening in all over the world .
When we get out of here , we ’re getting out with our heads up . ”
Ricardo said that 75 percent of the workforce is from Latin America , and most of the rest are African - American .
The Latinos come from a number of different countries .
Raul quickly added , “ That does n’t matter now .
We ’re just one now .
It does n’t matter where you come from , or who you are .
We ’re one person now , with all the people out there too .
If we win this , it ’s not just for us . ”
Manuel Cordova is a Republic worker with 14 years experience .
He explained that he viewed the central opponent in the struggle to be the owners of Republic .
Cordova , like many Republic workers , does not believe that the plant was in desperate financial straits .
Rather , he said , the company seized the opportunity of the financial crisis to lay off their Chicago workforce and relocate to employ cheaper labor .
Luis Lira , a worker with 16 years at Republic as a maintenance technician , echoed these sentiments .
He said that two weeks before the announced closure the company had “ moved out a complete production line from the factory . ”
Luis is demanding his five weeks paid vacation time , along with 60 days severance , which would amount to about $ 4,000 .
He said that supporters have been bringing food and making donations from Chicago and the rest of the US .
Reginald Pope was laid off on October 16 , in anticipation of the company ’s full closure .
Pope said that he was there to support the workers inside .
There were a number of supporters present , as well .
Among them were workers from Chicago .
Ayinde Murphy , a member of United Taxi Drivers Council , said that he was there because everybody is concerned about this issue , “ because you , me , we , could be next . ”
Layoffs are a big problem in Chicago , Ayinde explained .
“ We are offended that the tax money of the US citizen was just given to the banks , to bail them out , to inject liquidity , so that they would give out loans , and now they wo n’t give it , ” Murphy said .
“ [ US Treasury Secretary Henry ]
Paulson had the nerve to come up with a two - and - a - half page document , shorter than a student loan form , and demand $ 700 billion of taxpayer money to bail out the very banks that now wo n’t give out loans . ”
Murphy said that he hoped the example of the Republic workers would be followed by autoworkers in Detroit .
“ All of my family lives in Detroit — autoworkers , ” he said .
“ I know that they ’re agreeing to make some concessions so that the auto companies , the Big Three , can stay in business and get a loan .
I do n’t have such a big problem with that , so much that the banks do n’t have to go through this process .
It ’s impossible to ignore the fact that the reason that we have this housing crisis , this mortgage crisis , economic crisis is because the banks have been mismanaged for years .
It ’s hypocrisy at its highest . ”
Kelvin Harris and Floyd Bell are day laborers who were holding a banner for an organization of day laborers in Chicago .
“ This right here is senseless , ” Floyd said .
“ People have been working here 10 , 15 years … and you just get thrown out …
They have children at home , it ’s getting close to the holidays . ”
Kelvin was also there because he is the victim of a layoff .
Until 2003 , he was employed at Unilever .
“ They picked up and left us out to dry , ” he said .
Referring to the bailout , he said , “ I want to know where all this money is going .
Bailout ?
We need to be bailed out .
We need to be bailed out right now .
Come on , you work 15 years and you ca n’t get severance pay ? ”
Tony Caldera , a worker and member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , was there to support the Republic workers because he said he too had been the victim of a sudden layoff .
He said a lot of people he knows are in the same position , and expressed anger over the bailout of the Wall Street banks .
“ It ’s the low classes who pay the consequences , ” he said .
“ It ’s a situation where people lose .
They take your money both ways . ”
Yahoo is beginning testing today on a new feature in its search engine that seems much like Google Notebook , but offers a very different approach to organizing your Web - based research .
Dubbed Yahoo SearchPad , at its core , the feature is much like online notebooks before it – a collection of links and clipped research from around the Web .
The differentiator , which will make or break Yahoo SearchPad , is that it relies largely on attention data to automatically collect research for you .
Say for example you ’re researching a new car .
If you ’re using Yahoo , Search Pad will automatically appear if it notices that you ’re clicking a lot of related links or spending lots of time on pages about cars .
How it Works
Once Yahoo notices you ’re doing research , a “ Take Notes ” option will appear , right in the search pages .
Follow the option and you ’ll enter SearchPad , where , as opposed to a blank canvas , you ’ll already see all of the research you ’ve conducted on the given topic that Yahoo has identified .
You do n’t need an account – you can keep SearchPad open , add to it , and when you ’re done , either print it or save it to your Yahoo account .
SearchPad itself is a fairly intuitive notebook program – in addition to the automatic additions based on attention data , you can manually insert items , re-order them through drag and drop , and add annotations .
Another very cool feature is that if you paste something into your SearchPad but do n’t attribute it , Yahoo will figure out where the content came from by searching the Web .
This makes it possible to use SearchPad even if Yahoo is n’t your primary search engine .
Competition
The timing of this launch is interesting , given Google Notebook just recently shutdown .
I spoke with Tom Chi , Product Manager of Yahoo Search , to figure out where he thinks SearchPad can succeed where Google Notebook failed .
He thinks the reason Notebook failed is because it went down the same path as every other online notebook provider , which is to make you change your underlying search behavior , do things like install a bookmarklet , or even download a separate application .
With Yahoo leveraging tons of search data , he believes their approach is better – and I tend to agree .
A Boon to Yahoo Search ?
Yahoo has been doing their homework when it comes to search .
Chi says the idea for SearchPad arose out of going to regular users ' homes and watching how they use the Web .
Today , the service is launching to a very limited random subset of users , and Yahoo will observe how people use SearchPad .
From there , a decision as to what tweaks are needed and when the service can be rolled out to more users will be made .
While SearchPad certainly seems like an advancement in the Web research space , do n’t expect it to be the feature that tilts the search war in Yahoo ’s favor .
After all , the bulk of queries on the Web are navigational and fact - based , which is not what SearchPad addresses .
But there are certainly a lot of use - cases for SearchPad , and the fact that it will work on Yahoo and beyond is a big plus .
Because of the phased rollout of SearchPad , it ’ll be months before we know what kind of impact it ’s having , and how well it actually works .
If you happen to have it turned on , let us know what you think in the comments .

Sir Gerald Kaufman is standing by his comments A prominent Jewish MP has compared the actions of Israeli troops with Nazis who forced his family to flee Poland .
Sir Gerald Kaufman , MP for Gorton in Manchester , drew the parallel during a Commons debate on the Gaza conflict .
Some members of the Jewish community - including his fellow MPs - have questioned the comments .
Louise Ellman MP , of the Labour Friends of Israel group , said the " dreadful " war in Gaza was not comparable to German actions in World War II .
Sir Gerald , who was brought up as an orthodox Jew and Zionist , told MPs : " My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town .. a German soldier shot her dead in her bed .
" My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza . "
We had an IRA bomb in Manchester which destroyed much of the centre - we did n't send troops over to Belfast to murder 1,000 Catholics
Sir Gerald Kaufman
" The present Israeli government ruthlessly and cynically exploit the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians . "
Palestinian deaths in the Gaza Strip have passed 1,000 , medical sources in Gaza say , but Israel has continued to resist international calls for a ceasefire .
The Israeli government says the action is necessary to prevent Hamas rocket attacks into southern Israel .
Labour MP Louise Ellman said : " The Nazis were about rounding up and exterminating people because of their origins .
" What we 're witnessing in Gaza is a dreadful war and the Israelis are trying to stop Hamas continuing to launch rockets from Gaza , targeting and killing and murdering Israeli citizens . "
But speaking to the BBC on Friday , Sir Gerald said he was standing by his comments .
" We had an IRA bomb in Manchester which destroyed much of the centre - we did n't send troops over to Belfast to murder 1,000 Catholics . "
Sir Gerald said he had been a long - term supporter of Israel and has personally known many of its prime ministers .
But he added : " I am not going to stand by and keep silent when the Israeli troops - with a dreadful government sending them there - kill large numbers of innocent people with no useful result at the end of it all . "

Under a 1974 Political Reform act , a federal judge has ruled against supporters of Proposition 8 who wished for their donations to the campaign to remain anonymous .
Prop. 8 , was widely supported by religious organisations because it defines marriage as between a man and woman , clarifying certain ambiguities in the law which had briefly afforded same - sex couples in certain States of the union , equal human rights with heterosexual couples .
The ruling means that donations of $ 100 or greater are a matter public record .
A quick search of the database on www.sacbee.com, reveals some startling sums of money being thrown around by religious organisations — who ’s tax exempt status is supposed to hinge upon their remaining separate from affairs of state .
The table reveals , in three separate donations , the Catholic organisation Knights of Columbus gave $ 400,000 , then an additional $ 25,000 as the ‘ Calif .
State council Knights of Columbus ’ as well as the highest group donation in favour of the bill , of $ 1,000,000 from the ‘ Knights of Columbus Headquarters ’ .
Evangelical mega church , San Diego Rock , gave $ 25,679 .
James Dobson ’s ‘ Focus on the family ’ , who has openly rallied on his radio show , and preached on the moral imperative for Yes on Proposition 8 , gave $ 49,536 .
Fieldstead and co. ’s support for Proposition 8 , to the tune of $ 895,000 , comes after the founder , Howard Fieldstead Ahmanson , Jr. , told the Orange County Register , “ My goal is the total integration of biblical law into our lives ” and follows years of Philanthropic efforts in support of Christian Evangelical causes .
Concerned Women For America , which calls all forms of civil unions or domestic partnership between same - sex individuals “ counterfeit marriages ” gave $ 409,000 .
The American Family Association , who in 2004 boycotted the movie ‘ Shark Tale ’ because they said it was “ designed to promote the acceptance of gay rights by children ” , gave $ 500,000 .
Indeed , looking down the list , it ’s difficult to find a single major donor who is n’t in some way connected to Evangelical Christianity of some kind or another .
But it ’s not just Evangelical groups .
Individuals who donated in support , starting at $ 500 from Whitney Clayton , of the First Quorum of the Seventy , a Mormon group who rallied for co-ordinated nation - wide efforts on a Yes vote , build to people like Alan Ashton .
Ashton , who served as a mission president for Mormon Church of Latter Day Saints in western Ontario from July 2004 through June 2007 and is the grandson of former LDS Church president David O. McKay was single largest individual contributor to the Yes campaign , donating $ 1,000,000 from his vast fortune as co-founder of WordPerfect Corporation .
John and Josephine Templeton Jr. , Presidents of the Templeton Foundation , who ’s financial support of the The Discovery Institute , an Evangelical front organisation for the promotion of “ Intelligent Design ” , gave $ 900,000 and $ 300,000 respectively .
When is there going to be a clarification of the law with regard to campaign contributions from tax exempt religious organisations ?

According to the fashion forum website TheRagTrader.com , a lot of women dress provocatively to be able to climb the career ladder faster .
About quarter of the 3,000 surveyed women said that they would wear somewhat risky clothing to get a bonus or promotion at the office .
According to TheRagTrader.com 1 in 20 of those women confessed about wearing provocative outfits on a daily basis .
The survey showed that 78 percent of women consider that their outfit influences their day at the office .
More than half of women believe that the way they dress helped them achieve good results at work .
The spokesman for the London - based company , TheRagTrader , mentioned that dressing helps women achieve more in both cases : during 9 - 5 and when they climb the career ladder .
" Even when working from home , it 's incredible how clothing can influence your productivity .
If you 're clothing is too relaxed in style it 's harder to get into work mode and all too easy to waste the day , " he said .
The results of the study also showed that two thirds of women feel they are more organized when they wear stylish clothes .
Sixty one percent of women believe that a stylish outfit helps them gain more respect from colleagues at work .
About half of the surveyed women admitted that there was also competition when it came to office dressing .
The majority of women , who were involved in office fashion battles , work in the marketing and advertising industries .
Second most competitive industry was media and third was the retail industry .
It was also revealed that 25 percent of women at least once were terrified with the fact that one of their colleagues at work wore the same outfit as them , reports Daily Mail .
The survey also showed that quite often there are cases of wardrobe malfunctions at the office .
For example , 31 percent of women laddered their tights , 19 percent of men walked around the office with their zip flying low and 14 percent of office workers have split their undergarments .
TheRagRrader.com also listed the worst industries for fashion competition :
1. Marketing and advertising
2. Media / Creative
3. Retail
4. Secretarial
5. Sales
Data thieves introduced the software as early as May , but Heartland did not detect the breach until it was alerted to the activity in late fall .
The personal data of 600 million or more cardholders was vulnerable , but data security experts suggested data from far fewer accounts had been extracted .
Other confidential information , like personal security codes , is not believed to have been compromised .
That might limit damages .
Even so , the Heartland breach could wind up rivaling some of the largest data thefts .
In January 2007 , the discount retail chain TJX revealed that data on more than 45 million customers had been compromised .
And 40 million cardholder accounts were exposed in the 2005 data compromise at a tiny payment processor , CardSystem Solutions .
Avivah Litan , a data security analyst , said that the Heartland breach could result in hundreds of millions in losses and other expenses .
“ If you add it all up , including legal costs , it could be as much as half a billion dollars in losses  or twice as big as TJX , ” she said .
Mr. Baldwin said that Secret Service officials investigating the breach suggested that the thieves involved in the attack might be part of an “ international ring of hackers that are introducing breaches at a number of financial institutions . ”
The Heartland breach also showed that in spite of the adoption of more stringent standards and tougher oversight by banks and credit card companies , consumers are still vulnerable .
All this is happening after credit card companies and merchants spent over $ 2 billion on establishing the Payment Card Industry standards , Ms. Litan said .
“ And yet the breaches continue and they get more serious . ”
Women who smoke during pregnancy risk delivering aggressive kids according to a new Canada - Netherlands study published in the journal Development and Psychopathology .
While previous studies have shown that smoking during gestation causes low birth weight , this research shows mothers who light up during pregnancy can predispose their offspring to an additional risk : violent behaviour .
What 's more , the research team found the risk of giving birth to aggressive children increases among smoking mothers whose familial income is lower than $ 40,000 per year .
Another risk factor for aggressive behaviour in offspring was smoking mothers with a history of antisocial behaviour : run-ins with the law , high school drop - outs and illegal drug use .
Psychiatry professor and researcher Jean Séguin , of the Université de Montréal and Sainte - Justine Hospital Research Center , co-authored the study with postdoctoral fellow Stephan C. J. Huijbregts , now a researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands , as well as colleagues from Université Laval and McGill University in Canada .
" Mothers - to - be whose lives have been marked by anti-social behaviour have a 67 percent chance to have a physically aggressive child if they smoke 10 cigarettes a day while pregnant , compared with 16 percent for those who are non-smokers or who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day , " says Dr. Séguin .
" Smoking also seems to be an aggravating factor , although less pronounced , in mothers whose anti-social behaviour is negligible or zero . "
The research was carried out as part of a wider investigation of children , the Quebec Longitudinal Study , which examined behaviors of 1,745 children between the age of 18 months to three and a half years .
Aggressive offspring were characterized by their mothers as quick to hit , bite , kick , fight and bully others .
Other risks for aggressive behaviour
Although physical aggression is most common in preschool children , the researchers identified other prenatal factors associated with aggressive behaviour in children : mothers who are younger than 21 , who smoke and who coerce their children to behave .
The researchers also found that children from families who earned less than $ 40,000 per year were at an increased risk for aggressive behaviour .
In this category , heavy smokers had a 40 percent chance of having highly aggressive children , compared with 25 percent for other mothers who were moderate or non-smokers .
When income was greater than $ 40,000 annually , the gap between heavy smokers and others fell to 8 percent .
The effect of smoking on aggression in offspring remained significant – even when other factors were removed such as divorce , depression , maternal education and the mother 's age during pregnancy .
Smoking during pregnancy is one factor that could be curbed to decrease risks of aggression and violent behaviour .
The research team recommends that low - income women , who are heavy smokers and who have a history of anti-social behaviour become a screening criterion for prenatal testing to determine what families need extra support to prevent development of aggressive behaviour .
This work was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research , the Fonds Québécois de Recherche sur la Société et la Culture , the Fonds de Recherche en Santé du Québec , the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec with the contribution of data from the Institut de la Statistique du Québec .
Diego G. lives in Argentina and is working with a developer from the USA on a PHP project .
Recently they were discussing the merits of handling the communication from the backend to the frontend via XML or JSON .
The system used XML elsewhere already , but for the new work it looked like it'd be quicker and easier to work with JSON in the PHP pages .
The contact in the US did n't like one solution more than the other , and in the interest of getting the project done quickly , sent an email with his solution .
We choose to keep it simple .

Washington lobbyist Vicki L. Iseman has filed a $ 27 million defamation lawsuit against The New York Times for a February article about Iseman and her relationship with Sen. John McCain .
The suit , filed in U.S. District Court in Richmond on Tuesday , alleges the article falsely communicated that Iseman and McCain had an illicit “ romantic ” relationship in 1999 when he was chair of the Senate Commerce Committee and she was a lobbyist representing clients before Congress .
The suit also names the executive editor of the Times , its Washington bureau chief and four reporters who wrote the story as defendants .
William Keller , the paper ’s executive editor , did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment on the suit .
Richmond lawyer W. Coleman Allen Jr. and Rodney M. Smolla , dean of the Washington & Lee law school and a First Amendment scholar , represent Iseman .
The story was first reported online by Virginia Lawyers Weekly , an LIBN sister publication .
The 36 - page complaint charges that the story implies an “ unprofessional relationship ” between Iseman and McCain .
Both Iseman and McCain denied any improper relationship .
However , the public viewed the story as being about an affair , according to the suit , which cites the post- publication remarks of 10 different commentators across the political spectrum .
In each case , their comments about the story assumed it was about an alleged affair , the lawyers noted .
The Times ’ own public editor , Clark Hoyt , published what Allen called a “ blistering attack ” on the Times ’ decision to publish the original Iseman article .
The suit claims that Iseman suffered damage to her mental , emotional and physical health .
The lawyers noted that she continues to work as a lobbyist in Washington , for a firm based in Arlington .
They said they anticipate developing their case on damages as the matter moves forward .
The piece was published at the height of the primary season last winter , and , the suit states , the defendants knew that it would “ reverberate around the world . ”
“ In their attack on Senator McCain , the [ defendants ] were willing to sacrifice Ms. Iseman as acceptable collateral damage , recklessly indifferent to the avalanche of scorn , derision and ridicule Ms. Iseman would suffer , ” the suit charges .
Iseman waited to file the suit until after the presidential election , in an effort to avoid influencing its outcome , her lawyers said .
Click here to read the full text of the complaint in Iseman v. The New York Times Co. Inc .
Update : The New York Times issued a statement following the filing of the suit : “ We fully stand behind the article .
We continue to believe it to be true and accurate , and that we will prevail .
As we said at the time , it was an important piece that raised questions about a presidential contender and the perception that he had been engaged in conflicts of interest . ”

Signing Breasts Part Of Jeff Reed ’s Life Since Winning The Super Bowl
Continuing on yesterday 's post , here is a brief introduction to reranking results in django - springsteen as well as coverage of how it is able to paginate consistently through results collected from multiple sources .
( You can grab the springsteen source code on GitHub . )
Custom Ranking of Results
If you 've ever tried to tune search relevency ( particularly on a large or diverse corpus of data ) , you 're probably painfully aware that reranking results is indeed the crux of the problem .
That 's why springsteen exposes a simple hook for reordering results , and also why it defaults to a simply stacking approach rather than trying to reorder results for you .
You know your data , you get to tweak its ranking yourself .
Here is a simple -- although flawed - - example of how to reorder search results .
from springsteen.views import search from springsteen .
services import Web , Images import random def scatter_results ( query , results ) : random .
shuffle ( results ) return results def scattered_search ( request ) services = ( Images , Web ) return search ( request , services = services , reranking_func = scatter_results )
There you have it , the simplest reranking function imagineable .
But it has a bit of a problem : running the ranking function twice on the same data will return different rankings , which makes predictable pagination impossible .
This brings us to the one requirement for a good reranking algorithm : given the same data , it must return the same rankings .
That is to say , they must be consistent .
It is not important that the results be consistent from day to day or even hour to hour , but the reranking algorithm must be consistent to the extent that you want predictable pagination .
The less you object to noise in pagination ( one result occuring on multiple pages ) , the more malleable your reranking algorithm can be .
To understand how consistent ranking across pagination is acchieved , we need to take a sidetrip into the details of pagination in springsteen .
Consistent Pagination across Sources
The simplest case for pagination is fetching the 1st through N th results .
To accomplish this , springsteen queries each service for N results , merges them together , calls any reranking function on the results , and then returns the first N results .
Let 's call N results ( or as close to N as the service has availale ) from all services a batch .
So if we had 5 services , and got N results from each of them , then our first batch has 5N results .
This means we have the raw material for five pages of results to paginate through from that first batch .
Because the user only requested the first N results , we rerank them as we please and then return the first N of the reranked results .
Now , if the user asks for N through 2N results , we once again query all our sources for N results , once again rerank them , and then return results N to 2N .
This may feel a bit inefficient , but springsteen tries to cache results , so paging through those five pages will only require hitting each of those services once ( assuming all five pages are displayed within the ~ 30 minutes that the results are cached ) .
Things get bit a more complex if the user asks for results which fall outside the first batch of results .
To retrieve those we need to first grab the first batch of results , set them aside , and then continue fetching batches ( and setting them aside ) until the sum of results in all batches is greater than the final requested result .
Then we perform the reranking algorithm seperately on each batch whose results fall within the first and last result requested by the user .
Then we merge together the batches ( maintaing their order ) , and slice out the requested results .
It is crucial to sort the batches separately to acchieve consistent ordering of results ( which permits predictable pagination ) .
With an example this is fairly simple .
Consider this code :
>>> a = [ 1 , 5 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] >>> b = [ 5 , 1 , 3 , 9 , 6 ] >>> sorted ( a ) + sorted ( b ) [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 ] >>> sorted ( a + b ) [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 9 ]
By reranking batches independently we get the first result , whereas by reranking them in unison we recieve the second .
With both algorithms on the first page of results you would see results 1,2,5,7,9 .
On the second page , with the first algorithm you would see 1,3,5,6,9 .
With the second algorithm you would instead see 5,6,7,8,9,9 .
Meaning the second algorithm shows you worse results on the second page , and also shows repeated results .
Thus ends our brief interlude on pagination .
A Consistent Ranking Algorithm
Here is a simple example of a consistent reranking algorithm .
It is not a useful example in terms of increasing search relevency , but is perhaps useful purely as a technical example .
This reranks results by the length of their title .
from springsteen.views import search from springsteen .
services import Web , Images def title_length ( query , results ) : results .
sort ( lambda a , b : cmp ( len ( a [ ' title ' ] ) , len ( b [ ' title ' ] ) ) ) return results def scattered_search ( request ) services = ( Images , Web ) return search ( request , services = services , reranking_func = title_length )
Keep in mind that reranking is consistent within batches , and that batches are consistent with regard to one - another , but that in some given set of results you may see the end of one batch and the beginning of another , which ( for a very visual example like this one ) is a bit jarring .
In a more realistic situation , you might create a function which assigns each result a grade , and then rerank them based on that grade .
You might start out only looking at source , but then factor in its published date ( where it exists ) and keep tweaking for your corpus .
As you start experimenting a bit , I 'm curious to hear your ideas of ranking algorithms .
Some gifts people give are pointless : Styling mousse to Dick Vitale .
An all - you - can - eat card to Kate Moss .
The BCS Championship given to Oklahoma or Florida .
It means nothing because the BCS has no credibility .
Florida ?
Oklahoma ?
Who cares ?
Utah is the national champion .
The End . Roll credits .
Argue with this , please .
I beg you .
Find me anybody else that went undefeated .
Thirteen - and - zero .
Beat four ranked teams .
Went to the Deep South and seal - clubbed Alabama in the Sugar Bowl .
The same Alabama that was ranked No. 1 for five weeks .
The same Alabama that went undefeated in the regular season .
The same Alabama that Florida beat in order to get INTO the BCS Championship game in the first place .
Yeah , that 's how it is now in the shameful , money - grubbing world of college football .
If you 're Florida and you beat Alabama , you get a seat in the title game .
If you 're Utah , you get a seat on your sofa .
Hey , remind me :
What do they give out for one of those BCS things anyway ?
It 's been so long since I cared .
Something from Sears ?
This is the sixth year in the past 10 that the title has been in dispute under this cash - grab , fan - dis , monopoly that the BCS has created .
Which is why the title game just does n't matter anymore .
It 's like being named Miss Ogallala .
Or Best Amish Electrician .
Just take a look at the teams that think they 're worthy of being called national champs :
USC ?
Great year .
Wonderful .
Let 's all go to SkyBar and celebrate .
But it lost to Oregon State , a team Utah beat .
Texas ?
You think beating Ohio State by a nubby three points gets you the title ?
The Big Ten was 1 - 6 in bowl games !
That 's like pinning David Spade !
Florida and Oklahoma ?
They lost .
Utah never did .
So that 's it .
Utah is the national champion .
The Utes should probably have two now , actually .
They went undefeated in 2004 , too , and their coach still thinks they were the best team in the land .
Smart fella named Urban Meyer .
Coaches Florida now .
By the way , we 're calling our title the " national " championship because it actually includes the whole nation­ — all 119 Division I schools — unlike the BCS , which includes 66 .
Yeah , the BCS somehow eliminated the middleman — the NCAA .
The conferences these schools play in take their dump trucks full of cash straight from the TV networks and fairness can go suck a lemon .
Do me a favor .
Call Ohio State president Gordon
Gee and ask him why he wo n't support a playoff .
He 's one of the most powerful presidents in the NCAA .
He could get it done .
If he says anything other than , " We do n't want to share the loot " then you know he 's lying his bow tie off .
" This is not how we normally do things in America , " says Utah president Michael Young .
" In America , quality usually wins , not conspiracy .
And there 's a reason people usually enter into a conspiracy .
It 's money .
You make money doing it .
And those that are in on the conspiracy want to stay in and keep everybody else out . "
Sure , BCS blowhards will hand you schlock about how the college football season is like a playoff , how it 's an elimination tournament every week .
Really ?
Well , how come Florida and Oklahoma were n't eliminated with their losses ?
Utah ran the table , beat everybody set in front of them , including Ala - damn - bama in no less than the Sugar Bowl , and gets the bagel .
Oh , by the way ?
It was Utah 's eighth straight bowl win , the nation 's longest streak .
Among the losers during that run ?
Let 's see USC , Georgia Tech , Pittsburgh , and now the legendary Houndstooth Hats .
" What else do we have to prove ? " asks
Utah 's magical quarterback , Brian Johnson .
Good question .
He and the Utes essentially whipped Alabama at home .
Handed Nick Saban a garlic necklace to wear the entire offseason .
Stepped on his team 's neck 21 - 0 in the first three possessions and never looked back .
Let 's see .
Who was it that was losing to Alabama until nearly six minutes into the fourth quarter ?
Oh , yeah .
Florida .
What , you want the Utes to win a spelling bee ?
Make a prize - winning souffle ?
Knock up Angelina Jolie ?
What ?
It just slays me .
It really does .
Call Myles Brand , president of the asleep - at - the - wheel NCAA , and ask him if he and his greedy presidents are going to stand in defiance of president - elect Barack Obama , who said again this week he wants a playoff and wants it yesterday .
Call Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner and BCS bully John Swofford and ask him what he 's going to do if Obama starts asking the Justice Department to look into anti-trust violations against the BCS .
The Utah attorney general has already launched an investigation into that very thing .
Ask him what he 'll do if Obama asks the Department of Education to consider withholding federal funds from these schools that have entered into his secret club .
You do n't think playing in the title game means millions in general - fund donations for a school ?
That 's as unfair as anything Title IX fought against .
Until all these people do the right thing , I 'll be celebrating with the true national champions — the undefeated , untied Utah Utes .
( Our new slogan : Utahk about a team ! )
Lemonades for everybody !

CENTRAL bankers were compelling figures in the 1920s , not least because they preferred to operate in secret .
The cloak was peculiarly attractive to Sir Montagu Norman , governor of the Bank of England ( pictured above , right ) , who adopted a false identity when he travelled , though this sometimes attracted attention rather than deflecting it .
Asked for his reasons for promoting a policy , Norman replied : “ I do n't have reasons .
I have instincts . ” Benjamin Strong , Norman 's principal collaborator , ran the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which was responsible for America 's international financial relationships .
In the mid-1920s , Strong decided the American economy was sufficiently prosperous that he could widen his brief to promote economic stability .
Liaquat Ahamed suggests that Strong more than anyone else “ invented the modern central banker ” .
Norman and Strong were wedded to the gold standard .
Emile Moreau , the less clubable governor of the Banque de France , was an obsessive hoarder of gold and tended to do his nation 's own thing .
The arrogant Hjalmar Schacht ( above left ) , a spiky German nationalist who headed the Reichsbank , had , by a remarkable sleight of hand , ended Germany 's hyperinflation in 1923 , but he was unable to persuade his fellow central bankers to forget reparations , even though they all appreciated that heavy post - war payments were “ bleeding Germany white ” .
The quartet , united by a belief that they knew best , had persuaded the great powers to leave the fate of their economies to the antique workings of the gold standard — “ a barbarous relic ” in the view of John Maynard Keynes .
They had the power , in a legendary phrase , to “ crucify mankind upon a cross of gold ” , and they did so .
The problem was that there was not enough gold to finance world trade .
Stocks were concentrated in America and France , and countries like Britain , where it was scarce , had to borrow heavily , and to adjust interest rates and government spending at the expense of employment in order to replenish gold reserves .
A loan organised by Strong enabled Norman to get Britain back onto the gold standard in 1926 ( it had slipped off during the first world war ) .
Norman 's advice helped persuade Strong to lower interest rates in 1927 , which only increased irrational exuberance on Wall Street .
These early central bankers were an odd lot .
Norman , who dabbled with spiritualism , apparently informed a colleague that he could walk through walls .
He suffered regular nervous breakdowns , and was actually on sick leave when Britain left the gold standard again in 1931 .
Strong suffered from permanent ill health and was often affected by the generous use of morphine to control pain .
He died in October 1928 before the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression , but Mr Ahamed does not appear to believe that things would have turned out any differently had he lived : in a crushing conclusion , he writes that the Great Depression was “ the direct result of a series of misjudgments by economic policymakers …by any measure the most dramatic series of collective blunders ever made by financial officials . ”
Looking back in 1948 , Norman 's judgment was no less harsh .
“ We achieved absolutely nothing , ” he said , “ except that we collected a lot of money from a lot of poor devils and gave it to the four winds . ”
Politicians were left to clear up the mess they left .
One of them was Hitler , who readily instigated a series of measures to combat German unemployment which were similar to those Gordon Brown is adopting today .
( Schacht later joined the anti-Hitler resistance . )
Britain 's prospects brightened as soon as the gold standard was dropped .
The French , less troubled , remained loyal to gold until 1936 .
But the most original solution was that of President Franklin Roosevelt , soon after his inauguration in 1933 .
Mr Ahamed resurrects a 59 - year - old agricultural economist from Cornell University by the name of George Warren , whose study of long - term trends in commodity prices led him to believe that , since falling prices were associated with depression , recovery ought to be encouraged by rising prices .
The president liked the idea and decided to devalue the dollar — despite vigorous opposition from the gold bugs — simply by increasing the gold price .
One of his own economic advisers lamented : “ This is the end of Western civilisation . ”
For a number of weeks , the president would consult his advisers over boiled eggs at breakfast and randomly drive up the gold price , beginning at $ 31.36 an ounce until it settled at $ 35 .
By then a recovery was under way .
This absorbing study of the first collective of central bankers is provocative , not least because it is still relevant .
Mr Ahamed , who was a World Bank economist and now manages investments in America , likens central bankers to Sisyphus .
This was the man whom the gods condemned to roll a large stone up a steep hill only for it to roll down again when it reached the peak .
These great central bankers were so wedded to a dogma that they were incapable of imagining its failure .
Perhaps this kind of single - mindedness is endemic to central bankers ; since the early 1990s the idea of controlling inflation at all costs has been so compelling that central bankers have ignored such unintended consequences as bubbles in the housing and stock markets .
But these were big enough , when they burst , to trigger a worldwide slump .
Not lords of finance surely ; more like high priests .
One of the most misunderstood people in the working world , from a white - collar workers point of view .
Many are mechanics , electricians , and other technicians making $ 30 - $ 40 an hour for jobs that most non-union employees would otherwise pay only half that much .
Many union employers are those that reel you in and just let you go during the probationary period , even if you prove yourself hardworking and competent , but will keep the lazy and incompetent , just because they are friends with management or well - liked .
If you have a blue - collar trade or skill , want to make a good wage , just want to put in a good 8 hours work a day , and no intention of trying to climb the corporate ladder , a union job is well - suited for you .
And yes , many union workers are lazy shitbags that take numerous breaks and complain about everything , but there are many others that are honest , hardworking , and dedicated to their jobs .
The union reps , with the backup of politicians and the mafia , are the ones who keep things going for the common working man .
Many Republicans and conservatives dislike unions because they believe good money should be earned though merit and hard work and that anybody that does not have a college degree and works a skilled trade deserves just enough money to keep themselves fed and a roof over their head
Energy Versus Water : Is Blue the New Green ?
November 10th , 2008 by Paul O’Callaghan
There is a growing recognition that there are two convergent crises facing the world : energy and water .
Scientific American launched a dedicated environmental publication this month , Earth 3.0 , with the cover story Energy Vs Water .
The article explores the dichotomy between the fact that we need energy to produce water and we need water to produce energy .
As we are reaching Peak Oil , we also appear to be approaching Peak Water .
This creates an interesting dilemma — one which will require no small amount of innovation to solve .
Biofuels , cited as one option to wean us away from petroleum , can consume 20 or more times as much water for every mile traveled than the production of gasoline .
Not all biofuels are created equal however .
Some are worse offenders than others , and the US National Research Council addresses this very well in ‘ Water Implications of Biofuels Productions in the United States ’ .
Electric hybrids are another solution to get away from imported gasoline .
But if we switch to electric cars , we will need more electricity and at the moment 90 percent of electricity in the US is generated at thermal power plants — those that consume coal , oil , natural gas or uranium — and these plants are water hogs .
They use vast quantities of water for cooling .
The US Army Corp of engineers is currently trying to find a middle ground in an interesting water drama unfolding between the states of Florida , Alabama and Georgia .
Part of the problem is that both Georgia and Alabama have come dangerously close recently to having to shut down their nuclear power plants due to lack of water .
The Energy Vs Water article goes on to say that “ any switch from gasoline to electric vehicles or biofuels is a strategic decision to switch our dependence from foreign oil to domestic water ” .
The Concept of Virtual Water
To help assess issues relating to water use and water balance , Professor John Anthony Allan from Kings College London developed the concept of ‘ Virtual Water ’ .
He was awarded the Stockholm Water Prize this year for his work in this area .
According to his idea , you can calculate how much water there is in , say an apple , not just physically in the apple , but on a life cycle basis , how much water went into growing it , transporting it etc .
By doing this with various food items or other commodities , a country could take a view to import ‘ water heavy ’ items as a kind of a virtual way of importing water .
For instance , behind that morning cup of coffee are 140 liters of water used to grow , produce , package and ship the beans .
The ubiquitous hamburger needs an estimated 2,400 liters of water .
Put simply , it may be more cost effective to import oranges from a region that has plenty of water than to try and desalinate water at home to irrigate an orchard .
That does n’t always work , though — you ca n’t grow things like oranges in wet damp countries like England .
And herein lies one of the fundamental problems .
There is a reason why it is easier to grow 50 % of the nations fruit and vegetables in California — it ’s warm and sunny .
And for this same reason , populations have been moving to the sunshine belt .
If we could all live in California and import melons and oranges and strawberries from England , would n’t that be great ?
And you ca n’t cool a nuclear reactor with virtual water — at least not yet !

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
By Ian Dunt and Matthew Champion
Downing Street and the Foreign Office appear to be at odds over their response to claims British security forces colluded in the torture of a British resident in Guantanamo Bay .
Two judges hearing the case about Binyam Mohamed were forced to keep certain sections of their summary secret after what they say are threats by the American government .
Former shadow home secretary David Davis announced the news this afternoon , setting off a frenzy of media activity .
The judges said that to publish all the details would entail a severance of UK - US intelligence sharing .
That threat was apparently repeated since Barack Obama 's inauguration , despite the new president signing executive orders announcing the closure of Guantanamo within a year and clarifying lawful interrogations .
" We have .
been informed by counsel for the foreign secretary that the position has not changed .
Our current understanding is therefore that the position remains the same even after the making of executive orders by President Obama on January 22nd 2009 , " the judges said .
But a Downing Street statement this afternoon appeared to flatly contradict the Foreign Office position , with a spokesman saying they were " not aware " of any threats from the US government .
The judges said the information should be published " even though it 's politically embarrassing " .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called for Gordon Brown to immediately release all documents pertaining to the case .
" There is no other term for what the US intelligence services are doing than blackmail , " he said .
" It is simply incredible that the US government would have halted intelligence co-operation with the UK if this information had been made public .
" If British ministers were complicit in any way in the use of torture , or helped the US authorities to cover it up , they could face consequences in the International Criminal Court .
The seriousness of these allegations cannot be overstated . "
Mr Mohamed , an Ethiopian national with British residency , has been at Guantanamo for the last five years .
He was first arrested over a visa violation while traveling in Pakistan in 2002 before being rendered to Morocco in a CIA plane and tortured for 18 months .
Later that year he was transferred to the secret ' dark prison ' in Kabul and tortured until being moved to Guantanamo later in 2004 .
The Foreign Office has previously told inthenews .
co.uk it was involved in active discussions with the US authorities to arrange the release of Mr Mohamed .
It has also consistently denied knowledge or complicity of or in his torture .
In their ruling , the two judges pleaded with Mr Obama to reconsider the " threats " of George Bush 's administration .
Acknowledging that the British government was " threatened " with reprisals if it disclosed Mr Mohamed 's torture at the hands of US agents , they said : " If the information in the redacted paragraphs which we consider so important to the rule of law , free speech and democratic accountability is to be put into the public domain , it must now be for the United States government to consider changing its position or itself putting that information into the public domain . "
Forty - two separate British intelligence services reportedly demonstrate awareness of Mr Mohamed 's torture .
He has consistently claimed he was tortured by American agents - claims denied by the Pentagon - and accused the British authorities of complicity after being questioned about his life in London .
UK human rights groups are demanding the British government responds to the claims and the Obama administration drops the threats of its predecessor .
" The US is under a legal duty to investigate the crime of torture , not to suppress evidence that it happened , " said Clive Stafford Smith , the director of Reprieve .
" And the UK has a similar duty .
For the foreign secretary to give in to these illegal demands by the Bush administration is capitulation to blackmail , pure and simple .
It is hardly Britain 's finest hour .
" As the judges say , it is up to President Obama to put his money where his mouth is .
He must repudiate his predecessor 's reprehensible policy . "
Clare Algar , the executive director of the human rights group , said : " Binyam was tortured horribly in Pakistan , Morocco and Afghanistan and it is clear from this case that the British security services were complicit in that torture .
" Today 's judgment notes the British government has a duty to investigate and possibly prosecute the perpetrators .
Unfortunately , it seems that this might be the only way of exposing the shadowy facts about kidnap and torture which the US continues to hide beneath the false front of national security . "
Lawyer Cori Crider added : " Secretive and lawless to the last , one of the final acts of the Bush administration was to try to bully its closest ally into sweeping Binyam Mohamed 's torture under the rug .
This is repugnant to the principles of open justice on which both our societies were founded .
" On day one of his administration , President Obama declared his government would ' operate under principles of openness , transparency and of engaging citizens with their government ' .
If this does not apply in the case of Mr. Mohamed 's torture , where does it apply ? "
Liberty said it found claims that the Obama administration had renewed threats to reconsider intelligence - sharing if the torture allegations were released " surprising and alarming " .
" There is no moral or practical argument against an immediate public inquiry into Britain 's role in rendition and torture .
A wise minister would establish an inquiry tomorrow rather than risk being dragged there by the courts , " said Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti .
The partial ruling comes as MEPs across the party political spectrum joined together to overwhelming pass a resolution calling on EU governments to be prepared to resettle Guantanamo Bay detainees .
A couple of years ago in a galaxy very , very nearby ( OK , it 's this one ) , a Web developer who does contract work for the U.S. Air Force filmed himself playing the " Star Wars " theme song on his banjo .
The banjo player , Will Chatham , from Asheville , N.C. , posted the video to YouTube .
It amassed 1.5 million hits , 8,000 comments , numerous blog - post references and an offer to play a gig at Lucasfilm 's 30th anniversary " Star Wars " party .
Oh , plus one notice of copyright infringement .
The notice landed last week , making Chatham one of many casualties of the falling out between Warner Music Group and YouTube .
It began last month with music videos from such major acts as Linkin Park and rapper T.I. disappearing from the video portal , then quickly escalated .
Warner , it appears , did n't even warn some of its own bands before pulling clips .
Social news website Reddit pointed out that pop rockers Death Cab for Cutie were left with egg on their faces , when links on the band 's website began pointing to copyright - infringement notices on YouTube instead of the music videos that once stood in their place .
The band 's webmaster has since removed the links .
Chatham , who plays in a bluegrass group called the Whappers ( no , they 're not signed to Warner ) , is fighting back .
Since receiving the e-mail from YouTube regarding Warner 's claim , Chatham has filled out copyright counterclaim papers .
If Warner does n't respond within 10 days , YouTube may put the banjo video back online , according to a YouTube support page .
He says he can't understand how the innocent clip of him playing his cover version on a couch -- a video that was once chosen by YouTube to be featured on its home page -- could be illegal .
" It 's me just sitting there , playing on my banjo , " he said .
" If someone actually stopped and looked at it , they would be like , Oh , well , that 's just some guy being silly . "
Neither Warner , nor the company 's lawyer , nor YouTube would ...
Locals inns around the country are fighting off closure with a seemingly impossible bargain - lunch for just a quid .
Our writer goes on a gastronomic tour from Cannock to Clachnaharry
" The original £ 1 food - menu pub , " says a sign outside the Four Crosses Inn near Cannock , Staffordshire .
The claim may be a contentious one , as more and more pubs offer incredibly cheap meals to stave off closure , but the owner , Tony Rabbitts , insists that he was the first to show it could be done .
" At first it was one day a week , but it filled the place up so we went up to two , then five , and now seven days a week , " he says .
" We 'd been struggling to pay the bills and would have had to close , but we refused to be beaten . "
From serving about 30 lunches a day , Rabbitts is now doing more than 300 at busy times , and bar takings have increased fourfold .
" We 've got regulars who come back every day .
Some people come seven days a week .
One woman was having her kitchen refitted and has n't bothered having her cooker put in yet . "
Minibuses full of pensioners have started coming from Wolverhampton for lunch and a day out .
There is a roaring fire , the restaurant area is filling up with New Year 's Day diners by 12.30 , and , annoyingly , today , the minced beef and onion pie has already run out .
The starters and desserts are all £ 1 ; the basic main courses are also £ 1 , but there is a " homemade " option for £ 1.50 and a roast for £ 2.50 .
David Borton , a regular diner , calls the final option " going large " .
I choose vegetable soup , meatballs and chips , and Christmas pudding with custard .
It 's £ 3 for the lot .
The soup and the pudding are fine ; the meatballs , which come in gravy , are spongy in texture and indeterminate in origin .
There may be some pork in there , somewhere .
Rabbitts says the £ 1 meals cost about 30 p for him to produce ; the £ 1.50 meals double that .
Going large may be a wise move .
But let 's not carp .
" This pub would have gone to the wall without the cheap meals , " explains Borton .
" I come three days a week , and I 've never had a bad meal here yet .
It 's absolutely brilliant and the atmosphere now is great . "
Pete Bellis , a lorry driver , chips in : " I saw the sign as I was passing and thought there had to be a catch .
What else can you buy for one pound ? "
I next go north for dinner in Boroughbridge , where the Blue Bell Inn is advertising " North Yorkshire 's first £ 1 credit - crunch menu " .
Says the pub 's garrulous website : " In these hard times we like to give a little back to the community . "
The menu at the Blue Bell looks tempting : cottage pie , lasagne , home - made chilli and chips , pasta bake , and sausage , mash and gravy - all for £ 1 each .
The desserts - toffee apple fudge cake and ice cream , chocolate cake , apple pie and custard , rice pudding , plum pie - are another quid .
There 's just one problem .
The pub 's not doing any food tonight .
This is deeply upsetting , after a 16 - mile car ride from York .
" I 've given the wife the night off , " says Andy Jeffery , the landlord .
The Blue Bell , inspired by the success of the Four Crosses , has been doing cheap meals since November .
" Like every other pub in the area we 're suffering at the moment with the recession , " says Jeffery .
" We had to do something .
I stood outside the pub , looked at it and went , ' what is going to get me in this pub ? ' "
He decided the offer of meals at the magic price of £ 1 was the answer .
Will it work ?
" If it does n't , we wo n't be here , " he says .
" The biggest problem is ... people think there 's a catch .
They just can't believe we 're doing it .
We 've had people come in and say , ' do we have to buy a bottle of wine with the food to get it for a pound ? '
People assume it 's crap food or small portions .
OK , they 're not massive portions , but as far as we can , it 's home - cooked , decent , food . "
All this analysis , sadly , is theoretical .
Dinner is two pints of Pedigree .
A bitter experience .
Undeterred , I take the train next morning to Inverness , where the award - winning Clachnaharry Inn has introduced a Scottish version of the £ 1 credit - crunch special : mince and tatties , fish pie , shepherd 's pie , stovies .
I have no idea what tatties and stovies are , but am at least reasonably confident that they will be served .
When I get to the lochside inn after a seven - hour journey , lunch indeed is being served .
But there is a worrying absence of large placards proclaiming the offer of the £ 1 special .
Instead the pub is offering a " meal deal " with some items priced at a pound but others edging back towards the old prices - fish pie at £ 1.75 , mince and tatties ( potatoes , why does everyone in the pub look at me when I ask what those are ? ) at £ 1.95 , steak pie and chips at a vertiginous £ 3.50 .
" We did the pound menu for the month before Christmas , " says the owner , Charlotte Boyle .
" Everything was doom and gloom , and I thought we had to address the situation .
This was a way of protecting staff 's jobs a wee bit , keeping their morale going , and targeting a market that is going through a difficult time financially . "
Boyle plans to relaunch the £ 1 menu this month , but says it 's not feasible to offer everything at that price .
" We could n't keep it going at a pound ... in any case , it loses its momentum .
You have to keep reinventing things . "
I do , though , manage to eat - for a £ 1 - the pub 's signature dish , of stovies and oatcakes , which is still on at that price .
The person serving me does n't know what stovies are , but Boyle enlightens me .
" Stovies are leftovers .
That one 's got corned beef , potatoes and onions in it , but you can really make stovies out of anything .
Historically , it 's poor man 's fodder . "
History , of course , has caught up with us .
What else you can buy for a quid
• A pint of Greene King IPA or bottle of San Miguel at Wetherspoon pubs ( 99 p )
• A 750 ml bottle of Duchy Selections Royal Deeside sparkling mineral water ( 99 p )
• Kellogg 's Crunchy Nut Cornflakes , at Asda
• One Lotto ticket
• A computer mouse from Poundland
• 0.23ml of La Prairie Skin Caviar Luxe Cream ( priced at £ 215.31 for 50 ml at Harrods )
• Single bus fare in London , with an Oyster card

Enlarge USA TODAY file photo A statue of " Honest John " Burke , governor from 1907 to 1913 , stands in front of the North Dakota 's state capitol building in Bismarck .
North Dakota had the highest rate of public corruption convictions won by federal prosecutors from 1998 through 2007 .
North Dakota tops analysis of corruption WASHINGTON 
Its largest city is legendary for machine - style politics and its elected leaders have been under investigation for years , but by one measure , Illinois is not even close to the nation 's most - corrupt state .
North Dakota , it turns out , may hold that distinction instead .
Federal authorities arrested Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich
Tuesday after a wiretap allegedly recorded him scheming to make money on his appointment to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by President - elect Barack Obama .
Blagojevich , a Democrat , ran for election in part on cleaning up after his predecessor , Republican George Ryan , who was convicted in 2006 of racketeering , bribery and extortion .
IN ILLINOIS : Obama ' appalled and disappointed ' by Blagojevich arrest " If it is n't the most corrupt state in the United States it 's certainly one hell of a competitor , " Robert Grant , head of the FBI 's Chicago office , said Tuesday .
On a per-capita basis , however , Illinois ranks 18th for the number of public corruption convictions the federal government has won from 1998 through 2007 , according to a USA TODAY analysis of Department of Justice statistics .
BLAGOJEVICH SCANDAL : News is a recycled blot on Chicagoans ' pride Louisiana , Alaska and North Dakota all fared worse than the Land of Lincoln in that analysis .
Alaska narrowly ousted Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens in the election in November after he was convicted of not reporting gifts from wealthy friends .
In Louisiana , Democratic Rep. William Jefferson was indicted in 2007 on racketeering and bribery charges after the FBI said it found $ 90,000 in marked bills in his freezer .
Jefferson , who has maintained his innocence and will soon go to trial , lost his seat to a Republican this year .
But North Dakota ?
Don Morrison , executive director of the non-partisan North Dakota Center for the Public Good , said it may be that North Dakotans are better at rooting out corruption when it occurs .
" Being a sparsely populated state , people know each other , " he said .
" We know our elected officials and so certainly to do what the governor of Illinois did is much more difficult here . "
Morrison said the state has encouraged bad government practices in some cases by weakening disclosure laws .
North Dakota does not require legislative or statewide candidates to disclose their campaign expenses .
The analysis does not include corruption cases handled by state law enforcement and it considers only convictions .
Corruption may run more rampant in some states but go undetected .
Michael Johnston is a political science professor at Colgate University in New York — which is ranked just after Illinois for corruption convictions .
Johnston , who has studied political corruption for 30 years , said places such as Illinois gain a bad reputation that becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
" Expectations build up … and you replicate those expectations when you get to the top of the ladder , " Johnston said .
" It gets repeated . "

If cycling is right up your alley but you do n’t much care for getting wet , direct your attention this way for a concept design that may just pique your interest .
Called the ThisWay Recumbent Bicycle , it is an interesting design that looks much like a covered motorcycle .
Unlike many recumbents , it settles for a more elegant seating position that is similar to a cruiser - like arrangement , only with peddles instead of foot pegs .
ThisWay was designed by Torkel Dohmar and came top spot in the Commuter Bike For The Masses design competition .
The style was influenced heavily by car and motorcycle design in an attempt to make the transition to bicycles easier for those accustomed to motored transportation .
The cover at the top provides weather protection , which should be especially useful in Europe with all the rain – but unfortunately omits consideration for the cold , which is probably a more important factor .
The few madmen who cycle here in London in winter all seem to have ski masks on their heads , presumably to lessen the wind - chill factor .
This design may help with that to some degree however , thanks to its small windshield .
The frame is supposedly very lightweight ( 12kg ) , consisting of composite materials and hydro - formed aluminium and comes with front and rear LED lights and a rechargable battery to power them .
Now , if this could just be converted into a backpack bicycle , I reckon we ’d all want one .

Those who make use of Netflix 's ever - popular " Watch Instantly " streaming service rent fewer DVDs than the rest of the population , a Netflix executive revealed during the company 's quarterly earnings call on Monday .
The phenomenon reinforces the fact that online offerings really do compete with physical media for the same pieces of the movie pie , and that could prove worrisome for Blu-ray as online video continues to grow in popularity .
During the call , Netflix CEO Reed Hastings noted that there were millions of subscribers using the Watch Instantly feature , and that Netflix had seen a " substitution effect " among subscribers who do so .
" We are seeing early signs of less DVD usage with some subscribers who are also watching instantly as compared to subscribers who only receive DVDs , " said Hastings .
" Time will tell whether this substitution effect is an attribute of early adopters or a mainstream behavior . "
Our money is on it becoming a mainstream behavior .
Online video has gone great guns with the likes of YouTube , but movie rentals and streaming stumbled badly out of the box .
Users now have a plethora of compelling options to choose from , and that 's going to take a bigger bite out of DVD and Blu-ray as time goes on .
Of course , the physical vs. digital debate does n't affect Netflix that much , as customers have to subscribe to one of the regular monthly DVD plans in order to get access to Watch Instantly in the first place .
In fact , Netflix announced a 26 percent increase in subscribers year - over - year , and a 19 percent year - over - year growth in revenue , and Hastings made a point of saying that the company 's margins would go up if the streaming trend continues .
Outside of Netflix and the online video niche , the trend can only mean bad things for physical media like traditional DVD and Blu-ray .
Customers have shown that they 're willing to settle for high - definition ( and , in some cases , standard - definition ) online offerings -- either in the form of streaming from places like Netflix , or VOD and downloads from Amazon or the iTunes Store -- in place of walking to the corner Blockbuster or even waiting for a DVD in the mail from Netflix .
Why wait when you can get what you want now from the comfort of the perfectly butt - shaped dent in your couch or computer chair ?
And in HD , no less ?
Do n't get us wrong ; Blu-ray is guaranteed to be the physical HD format of choice going forward .
But the proliferation of high - speed Internet access and increasing availability of download services as well as set - top boxes means that Blu-ray is going to face challenges that VHS and DVD never did when they were at the same stage of their lifecycles .

Now that we ’ve been using git at Twitter for a couple of months , we ’ve overcome several crippling problems and misunderstandings about how to use it properly .
There are dozens of “ intros ” and “ tutorials ” to git online , but at some point you need to know more than just the basics of DVCS and the map to svn commands – you need to know practical considerations of real - world usage .
None of the intros or tutorials had this stuff , so I thought I ’d share what we learned .
Git ’s command - line interface is hands - down the worst of any DVCS ( except the archaic tla ) .
There are inconsistencies :
Some commands will expect you to type “ origin / master ” , while others will want “ origin master ” .
Other commands should never ever be used , but are presented in the documentation as if they ’re part of a normal usage pattern .
Some commands are useless in their default form and need several command - line options to make them work right .
I ended up writing a wrapper script to cover up a lot of these flaws , which I consider an “ ultimate fail ” for a UI .
But I ’m still not sure the script is a good idea , since it may make me forget all the quirks I need to keep in mind when the script is n’t around .
Do n’t change history
Two commands you should avoid : git rebase and git reset .
Some of the tutorials will tell you that rebase is one of the first commands you should learn .
Lies !
rebase is a way to trick you into creating merge conflicts .
When you rebase , you are erasing every local commit you ’ve made , and turning them into patches ( as if you were back on CVS ) .
After syncing your repository up with the remote one , your patches are re-applied one by one .
Presto ! you ’ve changed history .
The only reason I can think of for doing this is if you ’re not comfortable doing merges .
But DVCS is all about merges , so you should just get used to doing them .
A merge provides a little signpost to everyone else about your branch .
Do n’t fear the merge – love it !
It records exactly how your local work should be rectified with remote changes , without requiring you to keep tweaking your patch .
reset is even worse .
It erases commits from your history , which will very likely make your local repository different from everyone else ’s , and guarantee future conflicts or even an inability to push in the future .
Some people will say you should learn reset so you can use it in a panic situation , but if you ’re panicking , you ’re more likely to make things worse , so stop .
Calm down .
You have time to think and solve the problem in a rational way .
My problem with these two commands is that they violate a core philosophy of DVCS : Everyone has their own view of the repository , but these views obey entropy and flow in only one time direction .
When they meet , they merge .
Doing a rebase or reset goes back in time and changes the past .
They should be in a separate tool , like “ git - fix ” or “ git - hack ” .
The story matters more than the chronology
Have you ever read a history book that said “ In 1812 , the British empire shelled the tiny new American capital .
Meanwhile , Napoleon marched across Europe .
In China , … ” ?
Hopefully not , that would suck .
Telling a thread of the story from beginning to end is more important than placing every single event in its exact chronological order .
The default format for git log reorders commits by their exact date and time , so you need to be aware of that and not get confused .
Say , for example , you made a local branch , and made 3 local commits : L1 , L2 , and L3 .
Meanwhile , someone else is working on a different feature on their branch , and does commits R1 and R2 .
After you merge ( M1 ) , git is likely to show you a history like this :
M1 -> R2 -> L3 -> L2 -> R1 -> L1
Huh ?
What ?
Why are my local commits intermixed with my co-worker ’s commits ?
The merge must have messed up !
Crap !
Time to git reset and destroy everything , right ?
No !
Stop !
Do n’t do it .
It ’s a trap !
Git is lying by omission – it ’s telling the literal , actual truth , but it ’s telling it to you in a way that makes it confusing .
Git is re-ordering the history to make sure every commit is shown in its actual time order , not the story order .
You should probably just go ahead and alias log to :
git log -- topo - order -- decorate
That tells git to show things in “ topological ” ( story ) order , and to also mark where various branches are sitting .
I usually find it useful to take that one step further :
git log -- topo - order -- decorate -- first - parent
That tells git to show things in story order and to tell that story from my point of view .
It ’s sometimes interesting to see every commit that one of your coworkers did in their branch , but often you just want to see the merge - commit and move on .
" -- first - parent " tells git to skip over the details of every branch that is n’t a linear parent of yours .
Generally this means you ’ll see a simplified history of what ’s been going on , without the intricacies of what happened on forked branches while they were forked off .
If you want to see all the threads of history intertwined , I suggest using a graphical tool like gitk instead of git-log .
Do n’t fast - forward – live every moment
This one is pretty confusing .
And it sucks , because this concept does n’t even exist in other DVCS .
I think it ’s another symptom of “ fear of merge ” .
Basically , sometimes when you ask git to merge branch A into branch B , it will decide that it does n’t want to merge and it will instead turn A and B into clones of each other .
For example , let ’s pretend you made a branch of “ master ” called “ feature ” and did a few commits on it , and are now ready to merge it back into master .
If no other work has happened on the master branch , git will try to out - clever you .
It thinks : “ Well , nobody else has worked on the master branch , so I could just make the feature branch become the new master branch and that would be logically equivalent . ”
So after the merge , you ’ll see every single commit you made , as if you had done them directly on the master branch .
Git has cloned your feature branch into the new master branch .
This might not be so bad if there are only a couple of people working on the project , but there are a few side effects :
Your branch has effectively vanished from history .
There is no longer any indication that you were working on a side branch ; it looks like you were working directly on master .
And if it turns out that there were bugs in your new feature ( which , you know , sometimes happens ) , you ca n’t reverse the merge - commit because there is no merge - commit .
You will have to reverse every single commit you made , in reverse order , or worse .
So really , you want git to always create a merge - commit when you do a merge .
For this , you have to ask it nicely :
git merge -- no - ff
( Git calls the history erasing “ fast - forwarding ” . )
A few other things
To remove a branch from a remote repository after it ’s been merged and deployed , you have to push the branch with a colon in front of the branch name .
This has become a running joke in the office : “ Colon means delete . ”
Look , do n’t ask me , I ’m not Linus .
That ’s just how it works .
git push origin :stale_completed_branch
When other people remove branches , they wo n’t be removed from your local copy of the repository .
To take care of this housekeeping , you need to express a fruit preference :
git remote prune origin
Again , do n’t ask .
I do n’t know why .
That ’s just how it is .
I have a few ranty topics on how git is implemented and used , and how that compares with the older DVCS ( especially bazaar ) , but I ’ll save that for some other time .
If you ’re using git , hopefully this information is useful .
After years of slasher / horror flicks gracing the big screen ( most of which were sequels ) , these 10 serial killers stand out above the rest .
10 . Chucky .
Okay , the Child ’s Play franchise has gone from all - out horror to comedy - horror over the course of five films , but any way you look at it , the Lakeshore Strangler is one mean SOB .
Let ’s also not forget Tiffany , Chucky ’s wife , in Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky .
Be prepared for Charles Lee Ray to return in a remake of the 1988 original .
9. Ghostface .
With a mask inspired by Edvard Munch ’s painting The Scream , Ghostface is actually five people over the course of three films .
Scream , brought to us by Wes Craven , revitalized slasher flicks in the mid-90s .
After two successful sequels , and the Scary Movie spoofs , Ghostface deserves to be on this list .
8. Michael Myers .
John Carpenter brings us Mr. Myers , who killed his sister when he was a kid , went to a mental institution , escaped 15 years later and now kills people on Halloween .
Originally in theaters in 1978 , Halloween spawned seven sequels , not including a remake of the original by Rob Zombie .
Another one is slated to be released by Zombie .
7. Jigsaw Killer .
Unlike others , Jigsaw does not intend to murder .
He wants to see if the victim has the will to survive , thus inflicting enough psychological trauma for them to appreciate their life and save themselves from their own demons .
If anything , he ’s doing them a favor .
Saw VI will be out on the fall , but only the first one is must - see .
6. Freddy Kruger .
Robert Englund plays the dream killer in the Nightmare on Elm Street series , also brought to us by Wes Craven .
Kruger ’s motives are to kill teenagers as revenge on their parents , who had burned him alive years before .
Expect more Nightmares to come , but this time reportedly without Englund .
5. Jason Voorhees .
Slashing up teens at Camp Crystal Lake through 12 Friday the 13th flicks ( most recently a remake of the original ) , Jason did wonders for the old school hockey goalie mask .
Met another legend , Freddy Kruger , in 2003 ’s Freddy vs. Jason ( That was the most fun I ever had at the movies , as audience members were loudly cheering for their favorite of the two . )
Unlike Kruger , Jason has a sad backstory , having been deformed and humiliated as a child .
Eight of the Friday films came out in the 80s , 1 in the 90s , and 3 in the 00s .
4. Leatherface .
Loosely based on real life killer Ed Gein , Leatherface is severely mentally retarded and disturbed , often using a chainsaw and sledgehammer to slaughter his victims .
His family of fellow cannibals abuse him and tell him what to do .
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out in 1974 , the first in line of more slasher flicks to come .
Six films have been made over the years , including a remake of the original in 2003 .
3. John Doe .
After killing five people who are , in fact , sinners , John Doe , played by Kevin Spacey , delivers a this - all - makes - sense monologue to Brad Pitt , justifying the murders and making the Seven audience nod along in agreement .
But then he turns out to be a sinner himself , “ envy , ” to be exact , and completes his masterpiece with his own death by the hand of “ wrath . ”
This is the only killer on this list in a stand - alone film .
2. Norman Bates .
Alfred Hitchcock ’s 1960 film Psycho , most notably the shower scene , set the tone for just about every serial killer made after that .
The cross-dressing , momma- loving motel peeper was based on real life killer Ed Gein ( Gein was only convicted of killing two , but his grave robbery and hobby of making trophies out of bones and skin made him arguably the top killer that influenced other very famous fictional serial killers . )
Five movies have been released in this series , including an unnecessary remake of the original in 1998 .
1. Hannibal Lecter .
Lecter , played by Anthony Hopkins in three films ( Silence of the Lambs , Hannibal and Red Dragon ) , was voted by The American Film Institute as the most memorable villain in film history .
Why ?
Because the audience rooted for him , unlike his former patient , transvestite wanna - be woman killer Jame Gumb ( also inspired by Gein ) .
Lecter was popular even before his tragic backstory was told in 2007 ’s Hannibal Rising .
Yes , there are some I purposely left off , such as the guy in American Psycho , the Driftwoods in House of 1,000 Corpses , the Leprechaun , and many , many others .
Argue amongst yourselves .

NASA ’s Swift satellite and Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope have keyed in on a rowdy stellar remnant 30,000 light - years away .
The object , already known as a source of pulsing radio and X - ray signals , lies in the southern constellation Norma .
It kicked out some moderate eruptions in October , but then it settled down again .
Late last month , it roared to life .
“ At times , this remarkable object has erupted with more than a hundred flares in as little as 20 minutes , ” said Loredana Vetere , who is coordinating the Swift observations at Pennsylvania State University .
“ The most intense flares emitted more total energy than the sun does in 20 years . ”
The new object has been cataloged as SGR J1550 - 5418 .
Because of the recent outbursts , astronomers will classify it as a soft - gamma - ray repeater .
Only six such objects are known to science , and they share the trait that they unpredictably send out a series of X - ray and gamma -ray flares .
In 2004 , a giant flare from another soft - gamma - ray repeater was so intense it measurably affected Earth ’s upper atmosphere from 50,000 light - years away .
The source of the wild emissions is probably a spinning neutron star — the superdense , city - sized remains of an exploded star .
Measuring only about 12 miles ( 19 kilometers ) across , a neutron star is more massive than the sun .
While neutron stars typically possess intense magnetic fields , a subgroup displays fields 1,000 times stronger .
These so - called magnetars have the strongest magnetic fields of any known objects in the universe .
SGR J1550 - 5418 , which rotates once every 2.07 seconds , holds the record for the fastest - spinning magnetar .
Astronomers think magnetars power their flares by tapping into the tremendous energy of their magnetic fields .
Fermi ’s gamma-ray burst monitor is designed to investigate magnetar flares , and SGR J1550 - 5418 has already triggered the instrument more than 95 times since Jan. 22 .
Swift ’s X - ray telescope captured the first “ light echoes ” ever seen from a oft - gamma - ray repeater when SGR J1550 - 5418 started exploding .
Both the halo - like rings and their apparent expansion are an illusion caused by the finite speed of light and the longer path the scattered light must travel .
NASA ’s Wind satellite , the joint NASA - Japan Suzaku mission , and the European Space Agency ’s INTEGRAL satellite also have detected flares from SGR J1550 - 5418 .
Mike Spence has devoted nearly two decades to spreading conservative Republican gospel in California , an often thankless task in a state that has been spurning his wing of the party the entire time .
Now , John McCain ’s rout in California has set a new low for Republicans .
So it was more than a mild understatement when Spence recently summed up the plight of California conservatives by saying , “ We ’re at a difficult point . ”
As leader of a group that battles abortion , gay rights , illegal immigration and taxes , Spence is accustomed to bucking the tide in California .
Shrugging off all the evidence to the contrary , he sees better days ahead for conservatives .
“ Too many people look short - term , ” Spence , president of the California Republican Assembly , said over lunch at a restaurant near his West Covina home .
“ There are elections all the time .
Things change . ”

They do indeed .
Californians may display remnants of their Republican - leaning past -- a law - and - order streak and an aversion to taxes , to name a couple .
But for a generation , the state has drifted relentlessly from the Republican Party and its shrinking base of conservative true - believers .
“ The California Republican Party is dead , ” election analyst Tony Quinn , himself a Republican , wrote last week on Fox & Hounds Daily , a political blog .
“ Call the undertaker , haul away the corpse . ”
Others apply a less severe metaphor : dismal health .
Either way , signs of doom abound .
Starkest of all was McCain ’s loss to Barack Obama in the presidential contest last month by a staggering 3.3 million votes -- or a margin of 61 % to 37 % .
Since 1900 , the only Republican nominee for the White House to be trounced by a wider gap in California was Alf Landon , President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s challenger in 1936 .

Also alarming for conservatives is the hemorrhaging of Republicans from the state ’s voter rolls , even in the party ’s longtime strongholds .
When California ’s election map was last adjusted in 2002 , Republicans made up more than half of the voters in 11 of the state ’s 173 congressional or legislative districts , and Democrats held 66 .
Now , Republicans constitute a majority in zero , and Democrats hold 57 .
Already , many districts drawn specifically to protect solid Republican seats are no longer safe .
Take the 44th Congressional District , which stretches from Riverside to San Clemente .
Lawmakers carved it out as a conservative bastion , and Republicans have routinely won landslide victories there .
Yet the Republican incumbent , Ken Calvert of Corona , squeaked to reelection last month by just two points , making him a ripe target for Democrats in 2010 .
Other Republicans survived similar near - miss contests .
In one of the more telling races , a Republican nearly lost an Assembly contest in the Palmdale area , casting doubt on the party ’s longtime dominance in the Antelope Valley .

It could get worse , analysts say .
Under Proposition 11 , a ballot measure that passed last month , the Legislature lost its power to draw district lines .
With demographic trends running so strongly against Republicans , the citizens ’ commission that will take over the job after the next census will probably draw even fewer safe GOP districts .
Allan Hoffenblum , a Republican consultant and publisher of the California Target Book election guide , described the state GOP as “ a white man ’s party . ”
As California has diversified , he said , the party has failed to adapt .
“ They have lost the confidence of the overwhelming majority of minority voters , people of color , ” Hoffenblum said .
Spence , however , sees opportunities to expand the party ’s reach .
Conservatives can take heart , he said , in the strong support of Latinos and African Americans for Proposition 8 , the November ballot measure that banned same - sex marriage .
Advertisement
“ There ’s at least one issue we agree on , ” he said .
Spence , a former Mormon bishop who serves on the West Covina school board and advises the National Right to Life Committee , also sees Republican resistance to tax increases as attractive to many Californians .
But those glimmers of hope do n’t easily translate into electoral victory .
Fiscal discipline does in fact resonate with voters , said Mark Baldassare , president of the Public Policy Institute of California , a nonpartisan think tank .
But the party ’s opposition to same - sex marriage puts off many younger Californians as well as upscale moderates , he said .
And the party ’s hard line on illegal immigration has hurt its standing among Latinos , a group that grew from a 7 % share of the electorate in 1992 to 18 % last month .
Advertisement
“ That ’s a very important issue to Latino voters , ” Baldassare said .
Still , it would be a mistake to write off the party ’s chances of mounting a comeback , particularly in statewide races .
The last two Republican governors , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Pete Wilson , demonstrated the success of a formula blending moderation on social issues , especially abortion , and conservatism on fiscal matters .
But both wound up supporting tax increases in difficult economic times , infuriating the conservatives who retain strong influence in nominating the party ’s candidates in primaries .
“ Too many of them , when they get to Washington and Sacramento , they sell us out , ” Spence said .
Advertisement
The lengthy standoff between more moderate Republicans and the conservatives over which path is more appealing to California voters has only sharpened in the wake of the November defeat .
That has left the party not only reeling but unable to coalesce behind a strategy for resurrection .
As bleak as California looks for conservatives , Spence recalled the Republican resurgences that followed Republican defeats in 1964 and 1992 .
“ It ’s not hopeless , ” he said .
“ I have n’t moved to Idaho yet . ”
And as for Quinn ’s suggestion that the state ’s Republicans are beyond hope , Spence begged to differ .

“ I do n’t know about dead , ” Spence said .
“ Dead ’s pretty strong .
But the Republican Party has a lot of work to do . ”

Recently I ’ve been looking into message passing as a model for concurrency .
It turns out that there are two warring camps in the message passing community .
One believes that synchronous message passing is more fundamental , the other believes that asynchronous message passing is more basic .
You might think that the discussion is moot , since one can be emulated by the other , but it ’s not as simple as that .
Let me first explain the concepts .
In message passing you have a sender and a receiver–they usually run in separate threads .
The sender sends a message and the receiver receives it .
All issues of memory sharing and concurrent access are hidden inside the communication channel .
The client does no low level synchronization actions like locking .
Which is a good thing–no low level races or deadlocks !
The receiver usually has a choice of synchronous or asynchronous access .
It can block until a message is available , or it can peek to see if there is a message waiting .
Usually both interfaces are available .
The major choice of paradigms is on the sender ’s side .
In the synchronous model , the sender blocks until the receiver picks up the message .
The two have to rendezvous .
model , the sender blocks until the receiver picks up the message .
The two have to rendezvous .
In the asynchronous model , the sender drops the message and continues with its own business .
The synchronous model is used , among others , in CSP ( Communicating Sequential Processes ) and CML ( Concurrent ML ) .
The asynchronous one is used in Concurrent Haskell and in actor - based languages like Erlang or Scala .
Here ’s the main argument of the synchronous camp :
After calling send the sender has the guarantee that the message has been received by the receiver .
The code after send may safely make this assumption .
If you ’re a believer in RPC ( Remote Procedure Call ) you ’ll love this .
Sending a message is just like making a function call , only the work is done in a separate thread .
To which the asynchronous camp answers : Yeah , but what about distribution ?
In a distributed system , the receiver may be in a different process on a different machine .
There may be many reasons why the message does n’t arrive at the recipient ( the recipient is dead ?
a bulldozer cut the network cable ? ) .
In that case the sender will hang forever .
The code after send may still assume safe delivery , but it will never be executed .
There is another , more subtle problem with synchronous message passing between machines–a network protocol might deliver messages in different order than they were sent .
If the receiver ’s code expects a certain sequence of messages , it might block forever if the messages are permuted .
All these problems may be overcome by queuing messages , building sophisticated protocols , and spawning helper threads .
But is it really worth the trouble ?
Yes , say the synchronous camp , if you want to formally prove the correctness of your programs .
With synchronous message passing you can use the theoretical machinery of C.A.R Hoare ’s CSP .
That ’s an important advantage if you are writing your Ph.D. thesis , but maybe less so if you ’re maintaining millions of lines of Erlang code .
For my next installment I ’m already working on translating Haskell ’s MVar ’s to Java .
This will be fun !

The Great White Way will turn into a great walkway .
In a stunning Midtown makeover , Mayor Bloomberg announced today that traffic lanes along Broadway from 42nd to 47th streets and from 33rd to 35th streets will be torn up starting Memorial Day and transformed into pedestrian plazas until at least the end of the year .
PHOTOS : Broadway as a Pedestrian Mall
“ By making targeted adjustments at Broadway ’s two main pinch points , we believe we can ease traffic congestion throughout the Midtown grid , ” Bloomberg said .
“ We are going to closely monitor the results to determine if this pilot works and should be extended beyond its trial period . ”
POP VIDEO QUIZ : Where in New York Are You ?
The $ 1.5 million pilot program will discontinue vehicular traffic from 47th Street to 42nd Street and from 35th Street to 33rd Street – connecting Seventh Avenue through Times Square , where it is currently bisected by Broadway , and improve traffic flow on Sixth Avenue through Herald Square .
Bloomberg said the result will be simplified traffic patterns , longer green lights and reduced travel times across Midtown .
All car traffic going east and west through Times and Herald Squares will not be impacted and travel times are expected to improve on some of those streets , Bloomberg added .
In addition , the plan is expected to improve bus times on the avenues for the more than 75,000 daily passengers .
Some businesses in the area welcomed the plan .
“ The time for improving congestion at Herald Square — Macy ’s front yard — is long overdue , ” said Ed Goldberg , vice - president of government and community relations at Macy’s .
“ This project will create a much safer and more enjoyable experience for everyone at this important shopping and transportation hub , and we applaud Mayor Bloomberg for taking this innovative and exciting approach . ”
A large credit card processing company was breached in an attack late last year that may have compromised more than 100 million accounts .
Heartland Payment Services , which processes debit and credit card transactions for 250,000 businesses , said it first learned around late October that it might have been hacked , but was n't able to determine that its system had indeed been breached until last week .
The company said it notified the public Tuesday as soon as it confirmed it was the victim of a " highly sophisticated " attack .
Law enforcement officials are investigating the breach as potentially part in a wider cyber fraud operation with multiple victims , according to Robert Baldwin , Heartland 's president and chief financial officer .
" They are working on an active investigation on a gang [ and ] all the hallmarks are that this is associated with that , " Baldwin said .
" They have said that investigation is focused on a significant number of breaches of financial institutions . "
Heartland discovered malware on its system that allowed thieves to sniff unencrypted card data as transactions were being authorized in Heartland 's system .
The thieves captured card account numbers and expiration dates and , in 20 percent of cases , the customer 's name as well .
The company , which is based in New Jersey , did not know how long the sniffer was in its system or how many card accounts might have been compromised , although the company 's web site indicates that it processes about 100 million transactions a month .
Heartland said the thieves did not obtain personal identification numbers ( PINs ) or customer address information – which limits the value of the card data to the thieves .
To use the card numbers online or over the phone , the thief would generally need the customer 's billing address – or at least a ZIP code – and the three - or four - digit security code printed on the card , although there are some merchants who fail to ask for such information .
The company says a thief could , however , clone stolen debit card data to a fake card and swipe the card as a credit card , though this puts the thief at risk of being caught on surveillance cameras .
Baldwin told Threat Level that Heartland first learned of a possible breach in late fall after Visa and MasterCard reported a pattern of suspicious transactions , but that the company initially received conflicting information that led it to believe the leak may have sprung outside of Heartland 's systems .
" Some of the information they gave us threw us off the scent , " Baldwin said .
" There were transactions that had n't crossed our platform . "
The company eventually decided it needed to analyze its system anyway and called in outside forensic investigators in early December when internal auditors could find no problem .
The outside investigators were unable to find the breach until last week when they discovered " some residual temp files " that led them to the malware .
Investigators still have not determined how the intruders infiltrated the system , but Baldwin said it was not a case of an employee opening an infected attachment .
" We employ a lot of anti-virus capabilities that this was able to get through , " he said , adding that as far as Heartland knows the malware is of a previously undiscovered variety .
Baldwin said Heartland 's announcement on Inauguration Day was not intended to bury the news .
He said the company first found clues pointing to the malware last week and worked through the weekend to uncover it in the system .
Employees then spent Monday , a holiday , coordinating with the Secret Service , the Department of Justice and the card issuers to get approval for a press release .
" Really , today was the first possible day that we could get this information out , " Baldwin said .
" Transparency is absolutely critical .
It 's a core value of this company ....
We 're not kidding ourselves that if it does n't get reported today it 's going to go away .
To purposefully hold off the information [ for another day ] was just going to be wrong . "
Heartland did n't want to delay the announcement to Wednesday for fear of a leak that could lead to insider trading on the public company 's stock .
Regarding who might have been affected by the breach , Heartland has declined to identify the businesses that are its customers .
But Baldwin told the Washington Post that 40 percent of the transactions the company processes come from small to mid-size restaurants .
Heartland is advising consumers to monitor their account statements and report suspicious activity to their card issuer .
The company has also established a web site to address questions about the breach .

The Well Grounded Rubyist is a new and rewritten version of the popular Ruby for Rails .
Today InfoQ publishes a review and excerpts Chapter 15 .
Download : Chapter 15 .
Callbacks , hooks , and runtime introspection ( PDF )
David A. Black ’s Ruby for Rails was one of the early and popular Ruby texts .
Now , Manning is publishing an extensive revision , The Well Grounded Rubyist , to be in the bookstores in March .
The Ruby language has grown in the intervening years , substantially in features and available libraries , and dramatically in acceptance and popular use .
So it is certainly time for a new version .
The Well Grounded Rubyist is intended to introduce the reader to Ruby , but is n’t really intended for a beginning programmer ; the target audience is more the experienced programmer transitioning to Ruby .
It begins with a one - chapter concise introduction to Ruby syntax including files and how classes and modules are laid out , the basics of the Ruby installation on a user system , the use of the Ruby interpreter irb , and some of the basic tools , particularly gem and rake .
The first chapter ( which is also available for download at the Manning site ) would serve in itself to allow an experienced programmer to read and understand most Ruby code .
The book is broken into three sections .
The rest of the first section , on Ruby Foundations , extends the introduction in the first chapter by covering , in separate chapters :
Objects , methods , and local variables
Organizing objects with classes
Modules and program organization
The default object ( self ) and scope , and visibility
Controlling program flow
The next section is on the various built in classes and modules available with Ruby , including chapters on :
Built - in essentials
Strings , symbols , numbers , and other scalar objects
Collections and container objects
Collections central : Enumerables and enumerator
Regular expressions and regex - based string operations
File , IO , and system operations
The third section is on the dynamics of Ruby .
These chapters are particularly interesting because Ruby , as a dynamic language , draws much of its advantages from the powerful facilities it has for taking advantage of interpreter - time information to simplify things that can be difficult in compiled languages like C , C++ , or Java .
The third section contains three chapters :
Object individuation
Callable and runnable objects
Callbacks , hooks , and runtime introspection
The chapter on Callbacks , hooks , and runtime introspection is available for download directly from InfoQ , and is one of the most interesting chapters .
Ruby is a descendent , in one way or another , of most of the object - oriented languages , but arguably draws the most from Smalltalk and Lisp , even though the syntax is distinctly more like a block - structured language .
But the influence of Smalltalk is strongly felt in the openness of classes , allowing new code to be added at runtime to any class already available to the system , as Smalltalk does ; the influence of Lisp shows in the use of code blocks and closures , and in the extensive use of continuations ( “ call / cc ” in scheme , available through the yield keyword in Ruby . )
The runtime introspection and reflection facilities , allow a lot of things to be done simply in Ruby that are difficult in other languages .
If an unknown method is called on a class , defining a missing_method method in the class allows that method call to be intercepted , and dealt with by user code instead of simply causing a run-time error or exception .
Internals of the Class object in Ruby can be examined and extended , and the calling stack is available at run time , so user code can examine and its own state in a number of useful ways .
The chapter concludes with an implementation of a very basic unit testing framework similar to the unit test frameworks provided with Ruby .
All in all , The Well - Grounded Rubyist is a strong introduction to Ruby for any experienced programmer , and will provide useful information to all but the absolutely most experienced and expert Rubyist .

One of the questions that I was asked a lot and that we asked the children in the class was the all popular .
When you grow up , what do you want to be ?
When we are young , our entire lives are ahead of us and there is great big world out there just waiting for us to dive in .
But we , as adults , know the difficulty behind finding a job , getting a job , and keeping a job .
Sometimes we are fortunate enough to find a job that we fall in love with .
But most young adults entering into the work force is just not that lucky .

Explanation :
This shock wave plows through space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour .
Moving right to left in the beautifully detailed color composite , the thin , braided filaments are actually long ripples in a sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge on .
Cataloged as NGC 2736 , its narrow appearance suggests its popular name , the Pencil Nebula .
About 5 light - years long and a mere 800 light - years away , the Pencil Nebula is only a small part of the Vela supernova remnant .
The Vela remnant itself is around 100 light - years in diameter , the expanding debris cloud of a star that was seen to explode about 11,000 years ago .
Initially , the shock wave was moving at millions of kilometers per hour but has slowed considerably , sweeping up surrounding interstellar gas .
AT&T is contacting some of its customers asking if they 'd like to test an in - home extension to its cellular networks powered by a subscriber 's own broadband — a femtocell .
Femtocells use frequencies licensed by the carrier for data and voice , while handling backhaul through a customer - provided service .
An Ars Technica reader forwarded a customer survey question he 'd seen after being solicited by AT&T for his opinion : " AT&T 's new product is a small , security - enabled cellular base station that easily connects to your home DSL or Cable Internet , providing a reliable wireless signal for any 3G phone in every room of your house .
The device allows you to have unlimited , nationwide Anytime Minutes for incoming or outgoing calls . "
Sprint Nextel has been offering femtocells since last year ; the advantage to the carrier is providing fill - in service in the home without deploying more base stations in an area .
( See " Sprint 's new femtocells offer cell coverage , backhaul costs , " July 30 , 2008 . )
AT&T has apparently been testing femtocells with its own employees since last year as well .
Femtocells differ from T - Mobile 's UMA ( unlicensed mobile access ) approach , which also puts a specialized device in the home .
With UMA , specialized handsets must have both cell and WiFi radios , and the firmware to handle seamless handoffs between the two network types .
With a femtocells , the radio side is effectively identical with only the backhaul varying .
T - Mobile also offers WiFi routers that feature two increasingly common VoIP - oriented protocols ( one for power conservation , the other for packet prioritization ) .
Carriers pay enormously less to transit and account for voice and data over a customer 's own broadband , and thus can offer so - called unlimited voice plans ( which have some very high monthly limits ) .
T - Mobile 's HotSpot@Home service costs $ 10 ( 1 or more lines ) per month adding to a minimum $ 40 - per- month voice plan ; Sprint charges $ 15 to $ 25 per month for the same thing .
Femtocells have few disadvantages for home users because the dedicated frequencies means that any WiFi network they may already have in place is n't degraded by cellular use , and vice versa .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate Intelligence Committee is preparing a review of the CIA 's controversial interrogation programs under the Bush White House , a Senate Democratic aide told CNN .
CIA Chief Leon Panetta says he does not plan to use coercive interrogation techniques on terrorist detainees .
The committee would look at how the agency carried out interrogation tactics and whether they provided useful information , the aide said .
The review could be announced as early as Friday .
" The intention is not to find evil - doers or lawbreakers , " according to the aide , but " the information will go where it goes . "
It was not immediately clear whether committee Republicans were on board with the review .
President Barack Obama issued an executive order in January that calls for a review of the Bush administration 's controversial interrogation program to see whether any of the harsh techniques used should be retained .
The " enhanced interrogation techniques " included waterboarding , a method that simulates drowning and is considered torture by the new administration and around the world .
Any Senate review is likely to look into the CIA 's detention program and secret prisons , the aide said .
At this point , no public hearings are planned .
The review process is expected to take up to a year , according to the aide .
CIA Chief Leon Panetta said Wednesday that he cannot envision any circumstance in which he would consider asking the president for permission to use a coercive interrogation technique on a terrorist detainee .
Do n't Miss Senate confirms Panetta as CIA director
Panetta said he would cooperate with any congressional reviews or inquiries .
" If those committees are seeking information in these areas , we 'll cooperate with them , " Panetta said Wednesday .
" I think that we have a responsibility to be transparent on these issues and to provide them that information . "
" I would not support , obviously , an investigation or a prosecution of those individuals " involved in the interrogation program , Panetta said .
" They did their job .
They did it pursuant to the guidance that was provided them , whether you agreed or disagreed with it . "
The Bush administration repeatedly insisted that suspected terrorists were not tortured during their interrogations .
Then - President George Bush said in 2006 that top al Qaeda suspects had been held in secret prisons overseas and subjected to " alternative " interrogation methods , which he called " tough " but legal .
Former CIA chief Michael Hayden admitted last year that the agency had used waterboarding on three detainees while they were in U.S. custody .

The best way to improve children ’s performance in the classroom may be to take them out of it .
New research suggests that play and down time may be as important to a child ’s academic experience as reading , science and math , and that regular recess , fitness or nature time can influence behavior , concentration and even grades .
A study published this month in the journal Pediatrics studied the links between recess and classroom behavior among about 11,000 children age 8 and 9 .
Those who had more than 15 minutes of recess a day showed better behavior in class than those who had little or none .
Although disadvantaged children were more likely to be denied recess , the association between better behavior and recess time held up even after researchers controlled for a number of variables , including sex , ethnicity , public or private school and class size .
The lead researcher , Dr. Romina M. Barros , a pediatrician and an assistant clinical professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine , said the findings were important because many schools did not view recess as essential to education .
“ Sometimes you need data published for people at the educational level to start believing it has an impact , ” she said .
“ We should understand that kids need that break because the brain needs that break . ”
About the author
( NewsTarget )
Most people today are usually aware that fast food is not the healthiest food to eat .
Typically , the majority of people eat fast food several times a week or more .
People generally eat fast food for a few main reasons , mostly because it 's convenient , cheap and usually tastes pretty good .
The cost factor is certainly an understandable reason given the current state of the world economies and everyone 's need to tighten up on their spending .
But even this is really no excuse to be pumping the tons of toxic chemicals and " dead " food into you or your families ' bodies .
Nearly all books and documentaries that have come out in recent years showing how bad fast food is mostly focuses on it's high fat / high sodium content .
Very few of them truly reveal the real dangers of consuming fast food and just why it is totally unfit for human consumption .
Hopefully this article will help you to truly begin to understand why it 's not just a " less healthy " food , but something so terrible , so disgusting , and so horrible that you are far better off eating nothing at all than to consume fast food .
If most people truly knew what it is that they 're putting into their bodies when they go up to that drive through window and place their order , surely the vast majority would rarely if ever consume it again .
Certainly anyone who is interested in overcoming illness and disease and attaining higher levels of health and internal purity must vastly limit or completely eliminate their consumption of these so called foods
So just what is in fast foods today and why is it really that bad for you ?
Come along as we cover some main reasons for such a strong stance against fast foods and just why they are to be avoided at all cost .
Be warned that some of this information may be quite disturbing to some readers .
In 2002 , author Eric Schlosser , a correspondent for the Atlantic Herald , came out with a ground breaking book called " Fast Food Nation " which takes us through a sordid maze of deception , cover up , lies , fraud and both animal and human cruelty that has unfortunately become all too common in the meat packing industry today .
This was even turned into a 2006 movie release of the same name .
If you only saw the movie , then you missed virtually all of the " meat and potatoes " of this story because the movie was but a pale shadow of the mind blowing information contained in the book .
The movie mostly focused on the plight of the immigrant laborers who work in the meat packing plants .
These plants are the main suppliers of the meat , chicken and other foodstuffs sold in the fast food industry .
The book covers every aspect of the fast food industry .
From the truly horrible and inhumane conditions of the animals themselves from birth till death , to the often slave like conditions of the plants where the mostly immigrant and poor workers toil in 12 hour shifts or longer each day and more .
Fast Food nation is a thoroughly well researched book that has won worldwide praise for its author Eric Shlosser .
Eric was able to gain access to feed lots , slaughter houses and even the J.R. Simplot plant in Aberdeen , Idaho where millions upon millions of French fries are made on a daily basis .
The majority of which are mostly destined for area McDonald`s restaurants .
The fast food industry came out in strong protest against his book saying that they do n't agree with his conclusions .
At the same time when asked if there were any errors in the book the same industry said " no " that they could not find any errors in his facts or figures at all .
Twenty years ago the standard number of cattle processed per hour in a typical meat packing plant was 175 .
The older meatpacking plants in Chicago slaughtered about 50 per hour .
Today the workers at many plants are required to kill up to 400 cattle per hour .
At the rate worker injuries are all too common as the workers stand close together in one spot for hours a day performing the same task over and over again .
Mostly this involves swinging a large sharp knife over and over again to carve up the animal into smaller pieces for processing .
Mistakes and injuries to other workers are common as they struggle to keep up with the fast pace of the line in constant fear of falling behind or being fired .
The pace of the line that these workers are forced to work at is a major cause of many serious injuries to workers and has even led to several deaths .
How do these workers die exactly ... well this is where the story gets downright grizzly .
Many times these workers are near the meat grinders when some get limbs caught in them or simply fall into the larger machines completely .
By the time the machine can be shut down , there is nothing of the worker left to recover .
That means that along with the meat from the cattle , there is at times , human meat mixed in with the animal meat itself .
Fortunately it does n't occur all that often , but the author is surely not taking any chances on putting such meat into his body or that of his family and I strongly suggest that you do n't either .
There are other things mixed into with the meat as well which we 'll cover shortly .
The speed of the cattle line not only producers a danger to the workers themselves , but it causes them to make a much higher percentage of mistakes in the cutting of the meat itself .
What this means is that , because these workers are being forced to do the same motion up to 10,000 times per day , they can and do make mistakes and end up cutting the wrong part of the animals .
Instead of cutting the meat parts that are to be sold , they can end up hitting the bowels which often causes a " mixing " of the animals waste to be mixed in with the meat that is eventually sold to restaurants and the public .
This is a main source of various E - coli outbreaks that we hear about on the news from time to time .
How many more people get sick from such " food " but never report it ?
With the terrible and inhumane way in which the animals themselves are treated which causes the meat to lose any of it's health benefits , coupled with the contamination of the meat itself during processing , you now have a situation where this meat is not only providing very little nutrition or bio-energy , but it can be quite dangerous and deadly .
" Every day in the United States , roughly 200,000 people are sickened by a food borne disease , 900 are hospitalized and fourteen die .
According to the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) , more than a quarter of the American population suffers a bout of food poisoning each year .
Most of these cases are never reported to authorities or properly diagnosed " - Fast Food Nation , page 195 Not only are these animals often killed while they 're in poor health , as a recent investigative film by the human society showed that even animals that are too sick or weak to walk are being picked up by forklifts and led to the slaughter anyway .
This is against current animal welfare policies but is rarely enforced due to a loophole in the laws .
Aside from the obvious reasons for animals to be sick and weak such as hormone injections and cramped feedlots which stresses animals out just as it does humans , there are other more stomach churning reasons for their ill health .
The animals are not only unhealthy due to how they 're treated in terms of actual abuse or crowded and stressed conditions , but what they 're being fed is absolutely disgusting a crime against nature itself .
These cattle are ruminants , meaning that they 're designed to eat grass and perhaps some grain .
They have four stomachs because they 're meant to eats things with high cellulose content .
So what is it that these animals are being fed that further contributes to their being in such ill health and overweight ?
Until 1997 , about 75 % of the cattle in the US were being fed livestock wastes , the rendered remains of dead sheep and cattle .
They were also fed millions of dead pets from animal shelters .
The FDA banned such practices after evidence from Great Britain suggested that this might be responsible for a widespread outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) also known as " mad cow disease " However , current FDA regulations do allow dead pigs and horses to be turned into cattle feed , along with dead poultry too .
They also allow the poultry to be fed to dead cattle .
Other constituents of cattle feed include cattle blood , metal fragments and sawdust .
Is it any wonder then that these poor animals are sick and weak and some are unable to even walk to their own slaughter ?
Many such animals go to the slaughter with their bodies wracked with tumors , viruses , infections and some reports indicate that a majority of them have cancer throughout their bodies .
Meat packers are taught how to cut around the cancers and tumors to avoid infecting the meat itself .
But this means that even the " uninfected " parts are so weakened of nutrients , oxygen , energy and life force that it is still unfit for human consumption .
Because of their low nutrient content , higher levels of diseased tissues , bacteria , weak and impure electromagnetic and life force energies along with little to no exercise and not being allowed to eat the grasses that they are designed to eat and other reasons constitute why these animals are unfit for human consumption and a horrible choice of food to be putting into your body .
If you think the chickens that are sold at fast food places are treated any better , then please take a look at this 48 minute video recently featured on a major health website that is available free at the authors website below .
The meat and other foods sold at fast food restaurants bears little to no resemblance to actual freshly cut meat .
Food scientists employ a number of very deceptive and clever techniques to fool the senses into thinking that such foods are tasty and healthy .
Science has discovered many chemicals that can exactly emulate the smells of fresh foods found in nature .
For example ; Ethyl - 2 - methyl butyrate smells just like an apple .
Adding methyl - 2 - peridylketone makes something taste like popcorn .
Ethyl - 3- hydroxybutanoate makes something taste like marshmallow .
On and on these combinations go and it can all be done without effecting the appearance or nutritional value of the processed foods .
These ingredients can be listed as " natural flavors " on the labels , even on foods that are listed as " organic " At the Lamb Weston plant in American falls , Idaho , Eric Shlosser saw how the French fries undergo an amazing amount of scientific testing and chemical tweaking to attain just the right taste , consistency , mouthfeel , cooking time and even after taste .
At one point they had him close his eyes and he was asked to identify various foods just from their smell .
When the first sample was brought him he said " hmmm apples " .
When the next sample was brought to him he said " French fries " , the third smelled just like a hamburger .
Upon opening his eyes and expecting to see each of the foods present , all he saw was a scientist in a lab coat holding small white pieces of paper under his nose .
These were the samples of the chemicals used to make fast food taste and smell so good .
This process is certainly not limited merely to fast food or French fries .
At the IFF ( International Flavor and Fragrances ) plant in Dayton , NJ , Eric saw how chemicals that make nearly every single food or product sold on the market today taste and smell just as they do .
Some of these products include ; toothpastes , colognes , pop tarts , frozen and restaurant foods , ice cream , snack cakes , cookies , mouthwashes , antacids , potato chips , corn chips , breakfast cereals , soft drinks , sports drinks , bottled teas , beer , wine coolers , all natural juice drinks , frostings , dishwashing detergents , floor waxes , shampoo , soaps , furniture polish , and the list goes on and on .
Why such a focus on the aroma of food , because up to 90 % of the taste of a food is actually linked to its aroma .
Of course if the food is healthy and fresh , why do they need to add aroma and taste back into the food ?
Simple , because the food sold at most if not all fast food restaurants is so degraded , so old and of such poor quality that if you actually were to see it 's color and smell it before all of this chemical processing , you would never put such foods into your stomach .
This is especially true of the meats that are sold at fast food restaurants .
This is a major reason why reading those labels and eating as much organic , unpackaged and unprocessed foods as possible is so incredibly vital to health and longevity .
Too often even foods that are labeled as " natural " or " organic " will contain many of these chemical potions .
Eating as much raw foods such as fruits , vegetables and locally grown meats is about the only way to make sure that you 're not consuming foods with these myriad of chemicals in them .
Aroma is not the only tweaking that goes into fast foods .
The color of food also has a lot to do with it 's perception of flavor .
This is by design because we know that color often indicates whether a food is ripe or rancid .
In the early 1970's an experiment was done where people were given an " oddly tinted " meal of steak and French fries that appeared normal under the colored lights they were subjected to .
Everyone thought that the food tasted fine that is until the lighting was changed .
As soon as people saw that the steak was actually blue and the fries were green , people were shocked and several even became ill .
If you have ever bought standard supermarket meats then you have probably noticed that the meat has a bright red " healthy " looking color to it .
Well that meat is not much better than your typical fast food meats .
The bright red color is from the same kind of food coloring and chemical wizardry of sight and aroma as those used in the fast food industry to trick your senses into believing the meat is health and tasty .
The processing of these foods whether it's the beef , chicken , other meats or French fries has not only destroyed its chemical and nutritional value , but the energetic and phytonutrient or light energy of these foods long before they get to the dinner table .
Understanding how this food is processed , what the animals are eating , how they 're treated and what effect all of this has on the animals that you 're consuming is critical to understanding why fast food is something that you want to avoid at all costs .
At the very least you want to limit your consumption of this convenient food to no more than once a week , making sure to take digestive enzymes with every meal to ensure proper digestion .
Since these foods are enzymes , nutrient and energy dead , that means that you will use up far more of your own digestive enzymes to process this food .
This is why fast food equals dead food and the more dead foods we consume , the faster we end up dead ourselves .
We truly are what we eat .
Most natural raw foods contain their own natural enzymes which helps the food to digest itself in the stomach and intestines .
This takes a big load off of the pancreas which makes most of our digestive enzymes .
This is very important since digestion is the number one drain on our store of enzymes .
What 's not well known is that enzymes are also a major part of our immune system and are responsible for every process that occurs in the human body , even the beating of your heart .
This is why eating foods high in natural enzymes , which means eating raw , fresh and minimally processed foods as much as possible along with sufficient enzyme supplements , can go a long way to not only aiding in digestion and absorption of nutrients , but can even help boost the immune system and ward off disease .
When enzymes are not busy digesting our last meal , they travel around the body dissolving tumors , killing bacteria , viruses and germs , absorbing dead tissues and rebuilding new ones along with strengthening the entire system .
This is the main reason why juicing is so effective at helping people at overcoming and eliminating their serious diseasesWe get a plethora of these natural vitamins , nutrients and enzymes when juicing or making natural smoothies with plenty of raw , fresh ingredients .
Their natural enzymes are released in the juicer or the blender in the same way that cutting up a fresh salad also releases and activates the nutritional and enzymatic contents in the leaves .
Hopefully you can now see more clearly why it 's vital to avoid fast foods .
This truth extends to just about all packaged and processed foods .
Food that is packaged and processed is almost totally enzyme , nutrient and energy dead .
These foods use up and drain the human body of tremendous amounts of enzymes required to digest and assimilate their nutrient content while giving very little in the way of true life giving energies back .
The longer we keep putting these denatured and energy dead processed foods into our bodies , the faster we 're using up our own limited stores of these life sustaining substances .
This can not only hasten the onset of disease , but can accelerate the arrival of our own demise .
It is for these and many other reasons why you should avoid fast food at all costs .

But the effort to turn the city into a place that embraces bicyclists has clashed with a long - entrenched reality 
New York is a crowded , congested urban landscape where every patch of asphalt is coveted .
The latest illustration of this reality  and among the more contentious  is playing out on the Brooklyn waterfront , where bike lanes less than two miles long have set off a verbal battle among a growing cast of interested parties , including business owners , residents , bicyclists and their advocates , and politicians .
The city ’s Department of Transportation painted 1.75 miles of bike lanes on Kent Avenue in Williamsburg last fall , the first step of an ambitious plan to create a 14 - mile bicycle and pedestrian path stretching from Greenpoint to Sunset Park and separated from vehicles by medians filled with grass or shrubs .
Look Out It ’s a Bear … .
Sleeping Bag
Cure your fear of bears by pretending you are the mighty hunter and have slayed the terrifying bear .
Then strut around the room wearing the huge bearskin to show off your prowess .
OR take the sleeping bag camping and you can scare the be-jezuz out of your friends when they wake up next to you .
Both are possible with this incredible new sleeping bag by artist Eiko Ishizawa .
This fun design is so cool ( and a little creepy looking ) that we just had to share it with all of our readers .
Islands , it 's well known , are more vulnerable to species extinctions than continents .
Could the same be true with economic extinctions ?
After all , as Rebecca Solnit wrote at this site , the small North Atlantic island of Iceland ( pop. 320,000 ) went bust first in this ongoing , roiling economic crisis .
Its economy had been riding high on speculative funny money for years when , in little more than a week in October , all three of its major banks cratered and the country 's currency essentially ceased to have value .
Not long after , Icelanders hit the streets of their capital , Reykjavik , launching protests , which have yet to end .
Soon after , the government fell .
Just this Saturday , Ireland , another suddenly shaky island , whose economy had been riding high on funny money , saw mass protest in the streets of its capital .
As the British Times described the scene : " For two hours yesterday Dublin 's O'Connell Street was a swollen river of anger as 100,000 people marched in protest at the government 's handling of the financial crisis . "
At least one protestor carried a sign warning of " a lesson learnt from Iceland . "
And in this climate of unrest that threatens to flood islands with " swollen rivers of anger , " the British police are now bracing for the worst -- a possible " ' summer of rage ' with mass protests over the economic crisis that could mar Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's G20 summit in London in April . "
We 're talking here about a formerly prosperous isle that is now inspiring headlines like " Is The U.K. Another Iceland ? " and whose capital has been dubbed by some " Reykjavik on the Thames . "
But mainlands , as Michael Klare , author of Rising Powers , Shrinking Planet : The New Geopolitics of Energy , tells us in his latest TomDispatch post , have n't exactly been immune from rage either .
As the planet seems to melt down , day by day , week by week , no place may be .
Everywhere , it seems , authorities are bracing themselves for the worst .
Just yesterday , for instance , the New York Times reported that , in China , which has lost 20 million jobs in the last few months , " more than 3,000 public security directors from across the country are gathering in the capital to learn how to neutralize rallies and strikes before they blossom into so - called mass incidents . "
Good luck , as they say .
Let Klare -- who , back in the 1990s , may have been the first person to seriously consider the kinds of violence , conflict , and even " resource wars " that might arise out of scarcity and tough times -- survey the global landscape and offer you a sense of what may lie ahead .
Tom
As people lose confidence in the ability of markets and governments to solve the global crisis , they are likely to erupt into violent protests or to assault others they deem responsible for their plight , including government officials , plant managers , landlords , immigrants , and ethnic minorities .
( The list could , in the future , prove long and unnerving . )
If the present economic disaster turns into what President Obama has referred to as a " lost decade , " the result could be a global landscape filled with economically - fueled upheavals .
The global economic meltdown has already caused bank failures , bankruptcies , plant closings , and foreclosures and will , in the coming year , leave many tens of millions unemployed across the planet .
But another perilous consequence of the crash of 2008 has only recently made its appearance : increased civil unrest and ethnic strife .
Someday , perhaps , war may follow .
Indeed , if you want to be grimly impressed , hang a world map on your wall and start inserting red pins where violent episodes have already occurred .
Athens ( Greece ) , Longnan ( China ) , Port - au - Prince ( Haiti ) , Riga ( Latvia ) , Santa Cruz ( Bolivia ) , Sofia ( Bulgaria ) , Vilnius ( Lithuania ) , and Vladivostok ( Russia ) would be a start .
Many other cities from Reykjavik , Paris , Rome , and Zaragoza to Moscow and Dublin have witnessed huge protests over rising unemployment and falling wages that remained orderly thanks in part to the presence of vast numbers of riot police .
If you inserted orange pins at these locations -- none as yet in the United States -- your map would already look aflame with activity .
And if you 're a gambling man or woman , it 's a safe bet that this map will soon be far better populated with red and orange pins .
For the most part , such upheavals , even when violent , are likely to remain localized in nature , and disorganized enough that government forces will be able to bring them under control within days or weeks , even if -- as with Athens for six days last December -- urban paralysis sets in due to rioting , tear gas , and police cordons .
That , at least , has been the case so far .
It is entirely possible , however , that , as the economic crisis worsens , some of these incidents will metastasize into far more intense and long - lasting events : armed rebellions , military takeovers , civil conflicts , even economically fueled wars between states .
Every outbreak of violence has its own distinctive origins and characteristics .
All , however , are driven by a similar combination of anxiety about the future and lack of confidence in the ability of established institutions to deal with the problems at hand .
And just as the economic crisis has proven global in ways not seen before , so local incidents -- especially given the almost instantaneous nature of modern communications -- have a potential to spark others in far - off places , linked only in a virtual sense .
A Global Pandemic of Economically Driven Violence
The riots that erupted in the spring of 2008 in response to rising food prices suggested the speed with which economically - related violence can spread .
It is unlikely that Western news sources captured all such incidents , but among those recorded in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal were riots in Cameroon , Egypt , Ethiopia , Haiti , India , Indonesia , Ivory Coast , and Senegal .
In Haiti , for example , thousands of protesters stormed the presidential palace in Port - au - Prince and demanded food handouts , only to be repelled by government troops and UN peacekeepers .
Other countries , including Pakistan and Thailand , quickly sought to deter such assaults by deploying troops at farms and warehouses throughout the country .
The riots only abated at summer 's end when falling energy costs brought food prices crashing down as well .
( The cost of food is now closely tied to the price of oil and natural gas because petrochemicals are so widely and heavily used in the cultivation of grains . )
Ominously , however , this is sure to prove but a temporary respite , given the epic droughts now gripping breadbasket regions of the United States , Argentina , Australia , China , the Middle East , and Africa .
Look for the prices of wheat , soybeans , and possibly rice to rise in the coming months -- just when billions of people in the developing world are sure to see their already marginal incomes plunging due to the global economic collapse .
Food riots were but one form of economic violence that made its bloody appearance in 2008 .
As economic conditions worsened , protests against rising unemployment , government ineptitude , and the unaddressed needs of the poor erupted as well .
In India , for example , violent protests threatened stability in many key areas .
Although usually described as ethnic , religious , or caste disputes , these outbursts were typically driven by economic anxiety and a pervasive feeling that someone else 's group was faring better than yours -- and at your expense .
In April , for example , six days of intense rioting in Indian - controlled Kashmir were largely blamed on religious animosity between the majority Muslim population and the Hindu - dominated Indian government ; equally important , however , was a deep resentment over what many Kashmiri Muslims experienced as discrimination in jobs , housing , and land use .
Then , in May , thousands of nomadic shepherds known as Gujjars shut down roads and trains leading to the city of Agra , home of the Taj Mahal , in a drive to be awarded special economic rights ; more than 30 people were killed when the police fired into crowds .
In October , economically - related violence erupted in Assam in the country 's far northeast , where impoverished locals are resisting an influx of even poorer , mostly illegal immigrants from nearby Bangladesh .
Economically - driven clashes also erupted across much of eastern China in 2008 .
Such events , labeled " mass incidents " by Chinese authorities , usually involve protests by workers over sudden plant shutdowns , lost pay , or illegal land seizures .
More often than not , protestors demanded compensation from company managers or government authorities , only to be greeted by club - wielding police .
Needless to say , the leaders of China 's Communist Party have been reluctant to acknowledge such incidents .
This January , however , the magazine Liaowang ( Outlook Weekly ) reported that layoffs and wage disputes had triggered a sharp increase in such " mass incidents , " particularly along the country 's eastern seaboard , where much of its manufacturing capacity is located .
By December , the epicenter of such sporadic incidents of violence had moved from the developing world to Western Europe and the former Soviet Union .
Here , the protests have largely been driven by fears of prolonged unemployment , disgust at government malfeasance and ineptitude , and a sense that " the system , " however defined , is incapable of satisfying the future aspirations of large groups of citizens .
One of the earliest of this new wave of upheavals occurred in Athens , Greece , on December 6 , 2008 , after police shot and killed a 15 - year - old schoolboy during an altercation in a crowded downtown neighborhood .
As news of the killing spread throughout the city , hundreds of students and young people surged into the city center and engaged in pitched battles with riot police , throwing stones and firebombs .
Although government officials later apologized for the killing and charged the police officer involved with manslaughter , riots broke out repeatedly in the following days in Athens and other Greek cities .
Angry youths attacked the police -- widely viewed as agents of the establishment -- as well as luxury shops and hotels , some of which were set on fire .
By one estimate , the six days of riots caused $ 1.3 billion in damage to businesses at the height of the Christmas shopping season .
Russia also experienced a spate of violent protests in December , triggered by the imposition of high tariffs on imported automobiles .
Instituted by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to protect an endangered domestic auto industry ( whose sales were expected to shrink by up to 50 % in 2009 ) , the tariffs were a blow to merchants in the Far Eastern port of Vladivostok who benefited from a nationwide commerce in used Japanese vehicles .
When local police refused to crack down on anti-tariff protests , the authorities were evidently worried enough to fly in units of special forces from Moscow , 3,700 miles away .
In January , incidents of this sort seemed to be spreading through Eastern Europe .
Between January 13th and 16th , anti-government protests involving violent clashes with the police erupted in the Latvian capital of Riga , the Bulgarian capital of Sofia , and the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius .
It is already essentially impossible to keep track of all such episodes , suggesting that we are on the verge of a global pandemic of economically driven violence .
A Perfect Recipe for Instability
While most such incidents are triggered by an immediate event -- a tariff , the closure of local factory , the announcement of government austerity measures -- there are systemic factors at work as well .
While economists now agree that we are in the midst of a recession deeper than any since the Great Depression of the 1930s , they generally assume that this downturn -- like all others since World War II -- will be followed in a year , or two , or three , by the beginning of a typical recovery .
There are good reasons to suspect that this might not be the case -- that poorer countries ( along with many people in the richer countries ) will have to wait far longer for such a recovery , or may see none at all .
Even in the United States , 54 % of Americans now believe that " the worst " is " yet to come " and only 7 % that the economy has " turned the corner , " according to a recent Ipsos / McClatchy poll ; fully a quarter think the crisis will last more than four years .
Whether in the U.S. , Russia , China , or Bangladesh , it is this underlying anxiety -- this suspicion that things are far worse than just about anyone is saying -- which is helping to fuel the global epidemic of violence .
The World Bank 's most recent status report , Global Economic Prospects 2009 , fulfills those anxieties in two ways .
It refuses to state the worst , even while managing to hint , in terms too clear to be ignored , at the prospect of a long - term , or even permanent , decline in economic conditions for many in the world .
Nominally upbeat -- as are so many media pundits -- regarding the likelihood of an economic recovery in the not - too - distant future , the report remains full of warnings about the potential for lasting damage in the developing world if things do n't go exactly right .
Two worries , in particular , dominate Global Economic Prospects 2009 : that banks and corporations in the wealthier countries will cease making investments in the developing world , choking off whatever growth possibilities remain ; and that food costs will rise uncomfortably , while the use of farmlands for increased biofuels production will result in diminished food availability to hundreds of millions .
Despite its Pollyanna - ish passages on an economic rebound , the report does not mince words when discussing what the almost certain coming decline in First World investment in Third World countries would mean :
" Should credit markets fail to respond to the robust policy interventions taken so far , the consequences for developing countries could be very serious .
Such a scenario would be characterized by ... substantial disruption and turmoil , including bank failures and currency crises , in a wide range of developing countries .
Sharply negative growth in a number of developing countries and all of the attendant repercussions , including increased poverty and unemployment , would be inevitable . "
In the fall of 2008 , when the report was written , this was considered a " worst - case scenario . "
Since then , the situation has obviously worsened radically , with financial analysts reporting a virtual freeze in worldwide investment .
Equally troubling , newly industrialized countries that rely on exporting manufactured goods to richer countries for much of their national income have reported stomach - wrenching plunges in sales , producing massive plant closings and layoffs .
The World Bank 's 2008 survey also contains troubling data about the future availability of food .
Although insisting that the planet is capable of producing enough foodstuffs to meet the needs of a growing world population , its analysts were far less confident that sufficient food would be available at prices people could afford , especially once hydrocarbon prices begin to rise again .
With ever more farmland being set aside for biofuels production and efforts to increase crop yields through the use of " miracle seeds " losing steam , the Bank 's analysts balanced their generally hopeful outlook with a caveat : " If biofuels - related demand for crops is much stronger or productivity performance disappoints , future food supplies may be much more expensive than in the past . "
Combine these two World Bank findings -- zero economic growth in the developing world and rising food prices -- and you have a perfect recipe for unrelenting civil unrest and violence .
The eruptions seen in 2008 and early 2009 will then be mere harbingers of a grim future in which , in a given week , any number of cities reel from riots and civil disturbances which could spread like multiple brushfires in a drought .
Mapping a World at the Brink
Survey the present world , and it's all too easy to spot a plethora of potential sites for such multiple eruptions -- or far worse .
Take China .
So far , the authorities have managed to control individual " mass incidents , " preventing them from coalescing into something larger .
But in a country with a more than two - thousand - year history of vast millenarian uprisings , the risk of such escalation has to be on the minds of every Chinese leader .
On February 2nd , a top Chinese Party official , Chen Xiwen , announced that , in the last few months of 2008 alone , a staggering 20 million migrant workers , who left rural areas for the country 's booming cities in recent years , had lost their jobs .
Worse yet , they had little prospect of regaining them in 2009 .
If many of these workers return to the countryside , they may find nothing there either , not even land to work .
Under such circumstances , and with further millions likely to be shut out of coastal factories in the coming year , the prospect of mass unrest is high .
No wonder the government announced a $ 585 billion stimulus plan aimed at generating rural employment and , at the same time , called on security forces to exercise discipline and restraint when dealing with protesters .
Many analysts now believe that , as exports continue to dry up , rising unemployment could lead to nationwide strikes and protests that might overwhelm ordinary police capabilities and require full - scale intervention by the military ( as occurred in Beijing during the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989 ) .
Or take many of the Third World petro-states that experienced heady boosts in income when oil prices were high , allowing governments to buy off dissident groups or finance powerful internal security forces .
With oil prices plunging from $ 147 per barrel of crude oil to less than $ 40 dollars , such countries , from Angola to shaky Iraq , now face severe instability .
Nigeria is a typical case in point :
When oil prices were high , the central government in Abuja raked in billions every year , enough to enrich elites in key parts of the country and subsidize a large military establishment ; now that prices are low , the government will have a hard time satisfying all these previously well - fed competing obligations , which means the risk of internal disequilibrium will escalate .
An insurgency in the oil - producing Niger Delta region , fueled by popular discontent with the failure of oil wealth to trickle down from the capital , is already gaining momentum and is likely to grow stronger as government revenues shrivel ; other regions , equally disadvantaged by national revenue - sharing policies , will be open to disruptions of all sorts , including heightened levels of internecine warfare .
Bolivia is another energy producer that seems poised at the brink of an escalation in economic violence .
One of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere , it harbors substantial oil and natural gas reserves in its eastern , lowland regions .
A majority of the population -- many of Indian descent -- supports President Evo Morales , who seeks to exercise strong state control over the reserves and use the proceeds to uplift the nation 's poor .
But a majority of those in the eastern part of the country , largely controlled by a European - descended elite , resent central government interference and seek to control the reserves themselves .
Their efforts to achieve greater autonomy have led to repeated clashes with government troops and , in deteriorating times , could set the stage for a full - scale civil war .
Given a global situation in which one startling , often unexpected development follows another , prediction is perilous .
At a popular level , however , the basic picture is clear enough : continued economic decline combined with a pervasive sense that existing systems and institutions are incapable of setting things right is already producing a potentially lethal brew of anxiety , fear , and rage .
Popular explosions of one sort or another are inevitable .
Some sense of this new reality appears to have percolated up to the highest reaches of the U.S. intelligence community .
In testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on February 12th , Admiral Dennis C. Blair , the new Director of National Intelligence , declared , " The primary near - term security concern of the United States is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical implications ...
Statistical modeling shows that economic crises increase the risk of regime - threatening instability if they persist over a one to two year period " -- certain to be the case in the present situation .
Blair did not specify which countries he had in mind when he spoke of " regime - threatening instability " -- a new term in the American intelligence lexicon , at least when associated with economic crises -- but it is clear from his testimony that U.S. officials are closely watching dozens of shaky nations in Africa , the Middle East , Latin America , and Central Asia .
Now go back to that map on your wall with all those red and orange pins in it and proceed to color in appropriate countries in various shades of red and orange to indicate recent striking declines in gross national product and rises in unemployment rates .
Without 16 intelligence agencies under you , you 'll still have a pretty good idea of the places that Blair and his associates are eyeing in terms of instability as the future darkens on a planet at the brink .

IDF razes terror mosque :
The IDF confirmed Wednesday afternoon that Air Force jets bombed a mosque in western Gaza City .
Medical sources in the Strip said that several people were hurt in the attack .
IDF officials said that the mosque was used by terrorists as a storage site for missiles and explosive materials .
The army said that Palestinian rocket cells were firing at Israel from the mosque area and from nearby sites .

In recent days , the army had been closely monitoring the mosque and discovered that it was used as a hiding spot by Hamas members , who proceeded to fire rockets at Israel from the area .
The attack on the mosque was carried out in line with legal authorization provided by the military 's experts on international law .
Earlier , Judge Advocate - General Avichai Mandelblith approved strikes against sites used for terror activity , even if they happen to be located in holy or sensitive spots .
A short while earlier , the Air Force attacked an ammunition warehouse in the Khan Younis area where a senior Islamic Jihad figure involved in rocket attacks was staying .
The IDF said that it conformed a hit , and that the man , Amar Abu Alula , was involved in producing and upgrading the terror group 's rocket capabilities .

The British economy officially entered a recession in the fourth quarter , according to data released Friday .
In Spain , half a million more people lost their jobs , pushing the unemployment rate there to the highest in more than eight years .
British gross domestic product fell 1.5 percent from the third quarter and was down 1.8 percent on a year earlier , the Office for National Statistics said Friday in a preliminary estimate .
Economists had predicted a 1.2 percent quarterly drop .
All sectors except agriculture contracted .
The numbers confirmed what economists and consumers have known for some time : that the economy is in a recession , traditionally defined as two consecutive quarterly declines in G.D.P .
The rate fell 0.6 percent in the third quarter .
For the whole of 2008 , G.D.P. rose 0.7 percent , the lowest rate since 1992 , when it rose 0.1 percent .
The faster decline in output touched both services and manufacturing ; all sectors except agriculture contracted in the quarter .
The Commissioner of Baseball — Bud Selig — is obviously not pleased with the turn of events despite the implementation of drug testing and the public relations hit baseball continues to take .
Thursday morning , he spoke with USA Today ’s esteemed journalist Christine Brennan about the steroid era .
Although Selig has taken a lot of lumps from fans and the media alike during his tenure , a different side of him was shown in Brennan ’s piece — an upset , and saddened leader who may be ready to strike the hammer .
This week has been ugly on the sport , and now many want to see the record book redone — thus , Selig alluded to it with Brennan .
However , a member of baseball immortality — Hank Aaron , the former holder of the all time home run record — believes things should stay as they are .
From MSNBC : ATLANTA – Hank Aaron believes Barry Bonds should keep major league baseball ’s home run record .
“ In all fairness to everybody , I just do n’t see how you really can do a thing like that and just say somebody is n’t the record holder anymore , and let ’s go back to the way that it was , ” Aaron told the Atlanta Journal - Constitution on Friday .
— and —
Commissioner Bud Selig has indicated that he ’s given some thought to returning the record to Aaron if it is proved Bonds used steroids .
“ If you did that , you ’d have to go back and change all kinds of records , and the ( home run ) record was very important to me , ” Aaron said .
“ It ’s probably the most hallowed record out there , as far as I ’m concerned , but it ’s now in the hands of somebody else .
It belongs to Barry .
No matter how we look at it , it ’s his record , and I held it for a long time .
But my take on all of this has always been the same .
I ’m not going to say that Barry ’s got it because of this or because of that , because I do n’t know . ”
Aaron said he does n’t think the commissioner would like to get involved .
“ There are things out there besides worrying about a home run record that somebody now holds , ” Aaron said .
“ Barry has the record , and I do n’t think anybody can change that . ”
If there ’s some solace for those who believe the tainted players should have no business holding Aaron ’s hollowed record — most in the court of public opinion still believe Hank Aaron is STILL the man .
It seems that no matter what arguments that Barry throws out , or if Alex Rodriguez stays clean from here on out , number 44 for the Braves still rightfully owns baseball ’s most immortal record — not anyone else .
Like I said yesterday , if you try to modify records , or retroactively expunge them for misdeeds — how far does one go ?
No matter if you try to change the history book — what happened has already been written and it can not be changed .
These people should be completely ashamed of themselves .
Tonight an old man stumbled into the same Metro - North [ edit : the same Metro - North , I meant to say ] I was sitting in .
He was dressed in a nice shirt and pants , tie , clean sweater , and an expensive London Fog overcoat .
And from how he walked , how he struggled to put his coat on the overhead rack and how he plopped into his seat , he was clearly a bit inebriated .
I wonder how he got onto our train , because it was on a lower level .
He must have taken an elevator , or else someone helped him down the ramp and stairs .
Because he was dressed nicely , I figured he 's just some old chap who went out with the boys and had one too many .
He was n't causing anyone any harm , just sitting in his seat at the same end of the car I was on , opposite side .
He paid cash , so it likely was n't his usual ride , and presumably he was too inebriated to stand in line to purchase a ticket ( buying on - board has a surcharge , discouraging passengers from taking up the conductor 's time ) .
At our second stop , he started to disembark .
I started to worry , because he was halfway out the door but had forgotten his coat !
Luckily someone told him the name of the station , and it apparently was n't his stop .
He started moving slowly back to his seat .
Well , I did the decent thing : I went over to see if he was ok , to ask where he was getting off , and to help him put his coat on so he would n't forget .
His stop was the end of the line , where conductors make sure everybody disembarks ( and hopefully they helped him get a taxi if necessary ) .
But I was mostly concerned that he not forget his coat , with this weather .
It was n't that cold , but alcohol allows more body heat to escape , and he could get hypothermia if he wandered around too long without a coat .
Nobody else , and I mean , did a single blessed thing to help .
Everyone was so deliberately tuned out that they did n't even look up !
After the first stop , a lot of people got off the packed car .
A 40 - ish bespectacled guy and 20 - something girl had been sitting next to the old man , and they both took the opportunity to move to new seats .
After I helped the old fellow with his coat , I whispered to the other man , " I guess he had too much . "
He did n't say a word ; he just did n't want to get involved .
Never mind the kid , who appeared more interested in her music than anything else .
But I guess my action did n't go completely unnoticed .
The man sitting in front of me , I 'd guess 50ish , turned around , gave me a thumbs up and said , " You did a good thing . "
I simply replied , " Well , somebody had to .
" What I did n't say ( and probably should have said ) was , " Why did n' tdo something ?
" Our train is almost always one of the newer models , but tonight 's was an old one .
Usually I sit in the last car , except that on older trains the last car has a lavatory whose smell spreads throughout , so on older trains I sit in the penultimate car .
If it had n't been an older train , if I had n't sat in that penultimate car , who would have helped the old man ?
Goddamn sheep .
People have been so bred by government to let " authorities " take care of others , whether welfare workers or police officers .
People do n't want to get their hands dirty in doing actual things for others .
People are afraid to get involved , like a few years ago when a punk attacked a man and his pregnant girl on the subway .
Everybody else fled to the other side of the car .
Then as tonight , these people should be ashamed of themselves .
The pity is that they probably wo n't realize it .
I 'm not writing this tonight to say I 'm a saint .
I 'm not writing this to say you have to rescue people from violent attackers .
I 'm just saying to ask yourself : " Who is my neighbor ? "

Following in the footsteps of the film “ A Day Without a Mexican ” and the 2006 “ A Day Without Immigrants ” protest against criminalization of illegal immigrants , proponents of the movement to overturn Prop 8 are asking members of the LGBTQ community to do something about the November passage of the proposition that banned gay marriage in California by doing nothing .
OK , so obviously it ’s a little more complicated than that .
Participants of the “ Day Without a Gay ” protest are asked to call into work “ gay ” and abstain from buying anything , using the Internet or cell phones , watching TV or in any way contributing to the straightness of our economy .
The boycott aims to give the economy a metaphorical kick in the ass and show just how much gays are worth to California–literally .
Scheduled for Dec. 10 , the “ rainbow flu , ” as one newspaper put it in an oh - so - un - P.C. fashion , also conveniently falls on International Human Rights Day , so participants in the movement are encouraged to not just stay home and hold onto their wallets , but also go out and do something nice for someone by volunteering .
A rally and march sponsored by BAMN ( of course ) are also scheduled to take place at noon on Sproul and a rally at Berkeley ’s City Hall at 1:30 p.m .

An image of Saturn 's moon Titan taken by NASA 's Cassini Spacecraft in 2004 .
LOS ANGELES ( AP )  Observations from the international Cassini spacecraft suggest Saturn 's largest moon may have active or recently active ice volcanoes .
Radar images point to flows on the surface of Titan that could result from volcanoes spewing chilled liquid from the interior , mission scientists reported Monday .
Previous Titan flybys suggested ice volcanoes existed , and scientists believe they would erupt with ammonia , methane and water instead of lava .
The latest data " not only indicate that cryovolcanism has been going on on Titan in the recent geologic past , but might even be going on on Titan today , " said Cassini scientist Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona in Tucson .
Titan is one of the few bodies in the solar system with a significant atmosphere .
Scientists believe methane gas breaks up in the atmosphere and forms clouds that rain methane .
The source of methane remains a mystery .
Scientists favoring the volcanic theory say methane eruptions from Titan 's interior could explain the moon 's smoggy atmosphere .
Data from the spectrometer instrument on Cassini found bright spots on two regions on Titan .
In one of the regions , scientists found evidence of ammonia frost that they interpreted as coming from the interior .
The results were presented at an American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco .
Not everyone is convinced by the evidence .
Planetary scientist Jeff Moore of NASA 's Ames Research Center , who has no role in the project , said the results were intriguing , but inconclusive .
" Something is going on .
Exactly what it is is n't clear , " Moore said .
Cassini is a project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The spacecraft has been orbiting Saturn and studying its rings and moons since 2004 .

DIY Marquee LED Array Display
Have you ever wanted to have one of those big scrolling LED displays , to keep you up to date on e-mails , news , weather , or stock quotes ?
In this microcontroller project tutorial , we 'll show you how to build an array of 120 LEDs , how to control them all from one microcontroller , and how to talk to it from your computer .
November 3 , 2009 : Welcome , visitors !
We had such a tremendous response to this video tutorial that we decided to make it into a kit of its own !
Ready to build your own LED array ?
Find more details on our LED Array Kit page .
- Humberto and Mike
This project makes use of row - column addressing , which lets us control lots of LEDs without having one wire going to each one .
We also use one more trick -- the fact that diodes only conduct in one direction -- to double the number of LEDs you can handle with the ATmega168 microcontroller .
There are some schemes that you can use to control even more LEDs ( see Charlieplexing ) , but part of the tradeoff is that the LEDs would be on for a shorter fraction of the time , so they'd be less bright .
Engineering is all about making smart tradeoffs : here , we 're going with somewhat fewer LEDs , but they 'll be brighter and the wiring will be much simpler .
Here 's what the finished product looks like :
Parts List
In addition to our USB NerdKit microcontroller kit and a wall DC adapter , you 'll need :
Photo Part Quantity Description T1 - 3/4 ( 5 mm ) standard LEDs 120
Our video shows green LEDs , but you can definitely use other colors .
Keep in mind that the anode is the longer lead , the cathode is the shorter one ( also indicated by a flat section on the plastic case , and by the triangle 's tip and line on the schematic ) , and that current only flows from anode to cathode .
Some example part numbers from Digi-Key : Red LEDs Green LEDs Yellow LEDs
We also used cardboard ( roughly 21 " by 6 " ) , spray paint , wire ( roughly 30 - 50 feet ) , and some tissue paper as a display diffuser .
LED Wiring Plan
As described in the video , we make use of row - column addressing , as well as one special trick to double the number of pixels .
This schematic illustrates the wiring scheme for the 120 LEDs : ( click to enlarge )
If you are n't yet familiar with microcontroller basics or microcontroller programming , then what you first need to know is that each of the 12 column wires and 5 row wires goes to an input / output ( I/O ) pin of the microcontroller .
The software running on the chip can put the pin in one of three states : HIGH ( driven to +5 volts ) , LOW ( driven to 0 volts ) , or FLOATING ( undriven -- no current in or out ) .
( There is a fourth state which has to do with pull - up resistors , but this is not important for now . )
If a path from HIGH to LOW exists across any LED in the forward direction , current will be allowed to flow , and that LED will light up .
To turn on the top left LED in this schematic , we would make row 0 be LOW , column 0 be HIGH , and simply drive no current onto the other row and column wires .
For its neighbor one spot to the right , we would make row 0 be HIGH , column 0 be LOW , and not drive the others .
The same pattern applies for all of the 5 row and 12 column wires , so that ultimately we can individually control every LED in the array .
Row - column addressing , like shown here , is an extremely common way of reducing " pin count " of systems , which allows for simpler wiring and cheaper parts .
For example , numeric keypads , like those on a telephone , have a row - column matrix of wires , so that an individual wire per button is not needed .
Also , you should be aware that when using this kind of scheme , we are adding another complexity : time .
With any sort of multiplexing scheme like this one , we can control or read lots of outputs or inputs , but we can't do them all at exactly the same time .
That 's why we have the microcontroller quickly loop through the various row / polarity combinations , as described more below .
Physical Construction
The physical construction of the LED Array is where you get to be creative .
Feel free to explore different backboard materials , different spacing between the LEDs , even different patterns ( who said it had to be a rectangular array ) .
We started off with a piece of cardboard , and spray painted it blue .
We measured and marked out a grid with spaces 3/ 4 " apart , and drilled small 1/16 " holes using a drill press .
We understand most people do not have a drill press at home , but a handheld drill should work fine , or even a sharp pencil .
Once you have holes in the back board , you need to put the LEDs through .
We chose to run the column wires down the back of the array , and run the row wires across the front .
This makes it easier to keep them from touching , and shorting out .
In order to be able to drive more columns using only one microcontroller we will connect the LEDs using a wiring scheme that takes advantage of the diode properties of LEDs ( see wiring plan above ) .
This means we have to very careful to put the anodes of the LEDs through on the first column , then cathodes of the LEDs through on the second column , and keep alternating all the way down the array .
On the back , every two LED columns is twisted together with one column wire , and soldered in place .
On the front we lay the row wire across the entire row of LEDs , twist the LED pin over the row wire , and solder it together .
You can then cut off the excess LED pin on the front using wire strippers , or diagonal cutters if you have them .

Display Interrupt Handler
Since we can only actually have 12 of the 120 LEDs on at any time , we have to switch between the sets fast enough that your eyes can not perceive any blinking .
For this , we use the ATmega168 's Timer0 timer / counter unit , which we have set to count and overflow every 1.1 ms .
( For more background on the timer / counters on the microcontroller , see our Servo Squirter tutorial page . )
We then designate a special function , called an interrupt handler , to be run every time the counter overflows .
When this happens , the microcontroller stops whatever code it 's running , and switches to the interrupt handler .
In order to pass information to the interrupt handler , we maintain a big array in memory , which contains information telling us whether each LED is supposed to be on or off .
The normal code flow sets those bits high or low , and the interrupt handler reads the appropriate ones and turns the LEDs on or off .
Whenever writing interrupt handler code , you have to be mindful that some variables might get modified by the interrupt handler , at times when the normal code flow would n't expect them .
In this case , it is n't a significant issue , because information only goes one way -- from normal code to the interrupt handler .
But if it were to go the other way as well , we'd have to be careful to use the " volatile " keyword to tell the compiler to make fewer assumptions about those variables .
LED Font
In order for a system like this to be useful for displaying text , you need a way to take characters and transform them into the internal array representation of ON / OFF LEDs .
In order to abstract this away from the microcontroller code , we wrote a python font maker .
This small program reads a file called font .
txt which contains a representation of every character using rows of *s .
The font maker python code reads this file and generates a C file called font .h.
This font.h file is a giant array which contains every character represented by 5 integers .
Each integer represents a whole column , and every bit of each integer is a single LED .
Depending on whether the bit is high or low , the LED should be on or off .
Loading font.h into our microcontroller code allows us to retrieve the representation of each character we want to display .
Computer to Microcontroller Communication
The computer communicates with the microcontroller through a the serial port .
The microcontroller sends a lower case " n " when it is able to take a new character .
The computer sends the characters one at a time , and the microcontroller scrolls them across the LED display .
We wrote some python code that can accept a connection , and receive text over that socket connection and send it to the LED Array to be scrolled .
You can use netcat , to send text to this script , or write your own application that pulls data from the web and pushes it to the LED Array !
For example , you can run :
echo " HI MOM !!! " | netcat localhost 6666
to scroll that text across the display .
When the text is done scrolling , the display will return to showing the current time .

The final days of Oetzi , the Copper Age hunter whose frozen body was found preserved in an Italian glacier in 1991 , were about as rough as they come .
New investigations by a research team from Ludwig Maximilian University , Munich and Bolzano , Italy conclude the world 's oldest " ice mummy " probably suffered at least two separate attacks leading up to his frosty demise .
In addition to being shot in the back with an arrow and bludgeoned from behind - both of which likely caused the end to his 45 - year existence - Oetzi received a nasty gash on his hand just days earlier that reached down to the bone .
Basically , a real bitch of a week .
" We are now able to make the first assertions as to the age and chronology of the injuries , " wrote Professor Andreas Nerlich , who lead the study .
" It is now clear that Oetzi endured at least two injuring events in his last days , which may imply two separate attacks .
Although the ice mummy has already been studied at great length , there are still new results to be gleaned .
The crime surrounding Oetzi is as thrilling as ever ! "
The body and belongings of Europe 's oldest natural human mummy has offered scientists an unique look at Copper Age life since its discovery in the Schnalstal glacier on the border between Austria and Italy .
For instance , the food found in his intestine show his final meal consisted largely of cereals and a bit of meat cooked on an open fire .
The copper knife found on his body combined with high levels of copper and arsenic found in his hair also suggest he was involved in smelting tools and weapons .
But the exact nature of his death has remained a considerable source of mystery and speculation .
At first it was thought Oetzi had the relatively peaceful end of over - exposure in the frigid temperatures .
A CAT scan study in 2001 , however , discovered an arrowhead lodged in his shoulder .
Further investigation indicated the arrow shaft was even removed before his demise .
A bruised area discovered nearby the exit wound was likely from being stuck by a blunt object .
A deep and unhealed cut on his hand also indicate his death was n't exactly on a bed of roses .
The Ice Man got shoteth
The LMU researchers who analyzed previous studies and conducted their own study of the body said Otzi probably died because the arrow hit a main artery .
The injury to his hand " clearly indicated that the laceration must have been survived for at least several days . "
The two injuries to his back " suggest a wound age of the back lesions of less than a few hours survival time . "
The study appears in the January online issue of the journal Intensive Care Medicine . ®
Tanzania 's only albino MP has been trying to fight prejudice Traditional healers in Tanzania are defying a government ban announced on Friday , intended to stop the killings of people with albinism for ritual medicine .
A BBC correspondent has seen at least 10 healers working openly .
It comes days after the latest murder of an albino man in Tanzania brought the national death toll to at least 40 since mid-2007 .
The killers reportedly sell albino body parts - including limbs , hair , skin and genitals - to witchdoctors .
Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda said on Friday the government was revoking the licences of all traditional healers with immediate effect .
Leg chopped off " These witchdoctors are big liars , " he said at a rally in the northern Shinyanga region .
But the BBC's Vicky Ntetema said it was business as usual for the traditional healers she visited on Monday just outside the biggest city Dar es Salaam .
I believe it would have been better if the PM had consulted us before announcing the ban
Haruna Kifimbo
Traditional healer A spokesman for a traditional healers ' association has criticised the ban .
Arusha - based herbalist Haruna Kifimbo told the Citizen newspaper : " We are legally registered , they should be dealing with some state organs who have not done much to stop the wave of albino killings . "
He claimed members of his association were offering services to more than 30 % of the country 's population .
" We have so many patients and clients who depend on us , " he told the Citizen .
" I believe it would have been better if the PM had consulted us before announcing the ban . "
In the most recent case last Wednesday an albino man - named as Jonas Maduka - was killed in Sogoso village in the north - western Mwanza region .
He was reportedly eating dinner at home when some people called and asked for his help .
When he went outside he was strangled , before his assailants chopped off his leg and made away with the limb .
The Tanzanian authorities have arrested more than 90 people in recent months - including four police officers - on suspicion of killing albinos or of trading in their body parts .
There are thought to be more than 200,000 albinos in the country , which has a total population of 40 million .
The killings have spread to neighbouring states , with at least one albino murder each in Burundi and Kenya last year .

John Travolta Extortion Plot
Asmourns the loss of his 16 - year - old son , Bahamian police are investigating an alleged extortion plot over the circumstances of 's death .
Although earlier reports claimed the $ 20 million plot involved photographs of Jett as he lay dying , police say it does not involve pictures , although they will not say just what the extortion attempt is about .
According to the reports , two men - a local politician from Grand Bahama , and a man connected with the ambulance service , are being questioned over the alleged extortion plot .
Travolta 's reps contacted police about a week ago , and the investigation is expected to be concluded " very shortly . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Results of a Swedish population - wide study hint that children born prematurely have some risk of developing anxiety , depression or other psychiatric disorder in adolescence and young adulthood .
Children born “ preterm ” should therefore be watched more closely for these disorders , the investigators suggest .
Among 545,628
Swedish residents born in the 1970s and followed up until 23 to 29 years of age , Dr. Karolina Lindstrom from Sachs Children ’s Hospital , Stockholm , and colleagues observed a stepwise increase in psychiatric hospital admissions with an increasing degree of preterm birth .
A normal pregnancy lasts 40 weeks .
Lindstrom ’s team found that 3.5 percent of subjects born moderately preterm at 29 to 32 weeks of pregnancy and 5.2 percent born very preterm at 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy had been hospitalized because of a psychiatric disorder .
They report their finding in the January 2009 issue of Pediatrics .
Compared with those born at 40 weeks , the risk for psychiatric disorders was 68 percent higher in the very preterm group ( birth at 24 to 32 weeks ) , 21 percent higher in the moderately preterm group
( birth at 33 to 36 weeks ) , and only 8 percent higher in the early term group ( birth at 37 to 38 weeks ) .
Alcohol - and drug - related hospital admissions were not more common in adolescent and young adult ex-preterm infants .
“ These results , ” Lindstrom and colleagues note , “ are in line with previous studies reporting that addictive behavior is not an important problem in this group . ”
The investigators conclude , based on their findings , that adolescent and young adults who were born prematurely are a group “ in need of more attention in research and secondary prevention ” of psychiatric morbidity .

Here ’s the teaser trailer for new ’s movie “ ” ( “ “ ) .
“ Broken Embraces ” is set in the ’90s and present day .
It will be with Almodovar ’s themes : “ Fate , the mystery of creation , guilt , unscrupulous power , the eternal search of fathers for sons , and sons for fathers , ” said Pedro Almodovar .
“ Penelope Cruz will exchange the era ’s aprons , cardigans and the hairdos for an updated look , but one that mixes the transparent turbulence of Gene Tierney and the mistreated , challenging beauty of Linda Darnell in Otto Preminger ’s ‘ Fallen Angel , ’ “ Pedro Almodovar explained , talking about points of departure for the film .
The movie is scheduled to hit Spanish theaters on March 18 , 2009 but “ Broken Embraces ” ( “ Los abrazos rotos ” ) will probably be presented in May 2009 at .
The movie will hit domestic theaters on November 6 , 2009 .

Artist Stuart Semple released these smiley - shaped , pink - tinted clouds to celebrate London industry .
Comprised of helium , soap and vegetable dye , a total of 2057 clouds were launched at a rate of one every seven seconds .
Sadly , the clouds lasted only 30 minutes apiece before they disintegrated away .
Then again , there are only so many smiles I can take in a day before I just need to punch somebody .

US prosecutors have called for Bernard Madoff to be locked up until his trial after it emerged he had been sending valuables to family and friends .
The prosecutor said that a single one of the packages sent in the post was worth more than $ 1 m ( £ 685,000 ) .
They included jewellery , watches , pens , cufflinks and a $ 200 pair of mittens .
Mr Madoff 's lawyer , Ira Sorkin , said that his client had not realised that the mailings violated the freezing of his assets .
He also said that some of the items sent belonged to Mrs Madoff and so were not covered by the freeze .
The parcels were sent to Mr Madoff 's brother , his son and daughter - in - law and another New York couple .
' Not a threat '
Mr Sorkin said that it had been members of Mr Madoff 's family who had brought the mailings to the attention of the authorities .
Mr Madoff was accused last month of running a fraudulent $ 50bn scheme , which involved existing investors ' returns being funded by cash from new investors .
At a bail hearing , Judge Ronald Ellis told both sides to submit written arguments and said he would rule later on whether Mr Madoff would have to go to prison until his trial .
" He 's not a threat to the community and there 's no danger he 's going to flee , " Mr Sorkin said .
Mr Madoff is currently under house arrest in his New York penthouse .
His $ 10 m bail is covered by that home as well as his houses in Long Island and Florida .

Evidence is mounting that the Israeli defence forces used the Gaza assault as a testing ground for new , horrific weapons that have confounded doctors ’ attempts to save the wounded , writes LARA MARLOWEin Gaza .
THERE WERE MANY ways to die during the Israeli offensive on Gaza .
From their hospital beds at Gaza ’s Shifa Hospital , Atallah Saad , 13 , and Yussef Salem , 17 , told me how “ zananas ” – remotely piloted drones that fire missiles – wounded them and killed Atallah ’s mother and pregnant sister - in - law , and two of Yussef ’s school friends .
The drones were given the nickname because they make a loud z - z - z - z -z sound .
But the most shocking thing about them is that an Israeli operator watches his target – in these cases , all civilians – through a surveillance camera before launching the missile .
Death by remote control .
White phosphorous was another , much publicised means of death .
Each M82581 artillery shell , manufactured by General Dynamics in Pine Bluff , Arkansas , bears the initials PB .
And each of the 155 mm shells contains 116 felt wafers soaked in phosphorus , which ignites on contact with oxygen .
The phosphorous makes the white jellyfish - shaped clouds seen on television during the December 27th - January 17th Israeli offensive .
It provides cover for advancing troops , but it also burns houses and people .
If one of the felt pads lands on your skin , it burns until all the fuel is consumed , creating deep , wide , chemical burns , often to the bone .
Dr Nafiz Abu Shabaan pulls a plastic bag from under his desk .
It is filled with white phosphorous , buried in sand .
The brown pieces look like dog dirt , and re-ignite if broken open .
Mahmoud al Jamal , 18 , sits in the doctor ’s office , his right ear congealed , his fingers and part of his chest eaten away by white phosphorous .
The unsightly wounds make him look like a leper .
Al Jamal was walking at dawn when he saw the white jellyfish in the sky .
“ Everything was set on fire around me .
I felt my body burning .
I fell down and I asked the man lying next to me to help me , but he was dead .
Then I lost consciousness . ”
Al Jamal ’s brother later told him how smoke poured from his body in the ambulance on the way to the hospital .
The Israeli ’s use of white phosphorous is amply documented .
Israel says it is legal , but human - rights groups say its use in civilian areas might constitute a war crime .
Dr Abu Shabaan is more concerned by evidence of new , mysterious weapons and appeals for an impartial international investigation into Israel ’s use of new weapons .
“ We ’ve seen many , many cases of amputation – like a cauterised wound , with no bleeding , ” he recounts .
“ Some have minor chest injuries , but the X - rays show nothing and they die suddenly , without explanation . ”
Palestinian and foreign doctors who ’ have treated the war - wounded at Shifa suspect the injuries may be caused by Dense Inert Metal Explosive , also known as Focus Lethality Munition , a weapon invented through Israeli - American cooperation .
“ We are guinea pigs to the Americans and Israelis , ” says Dr Abu Shabaan .
“ The Americans give the Israelis new weapons , and they try them out on us . ”
“ They are definitely testing weapons on us , ” says Dr Sobhi Skaik , a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh and the head of the surgery department at Shifa .
“ The amount of damage done by these weapons is not commensurate to the wounds .
We found computer chips , magnetic pieces and transistors in wounds .
Sometimes there are only minute pin-point punctures to the abdomen and chest , but you see huge damage to internal organs .
One patient had his liver burned black , as if it had been grilled .
We think there must be something embedded in the human body that is releasing poison and killing . ”
YET FOR ALL the high - tech and Frankenstein weaponry , perhaps Israel ’s most vicious arm against the Palestinians has been “ al - hissar ” , the siege , imposed on the Gaza Strip 19 months ago when Hamas , after winning a democratic election that the world refused to recognise , seized power from the Fatah Palestinian Authority .
The world turned a blind eye as Gazans languished in the world ’s biggest prison , unable to travel , import , export or interact with anyone or anything beyond their borders .
And the world largely ignored the rockets Hamas fired in anger and frustration from within the siege .
As a result of this dual negligence the conflict exploded , killing 13 Israelis and 1,300 Palestinians .
The siege was one reason casualties were so high in the three - week war , says Fred Abrahams of Human Rights Watch .
With the Israeli and Egyptian borders closed , “ It was n’t possible for Gazans to escape .
The only way to get out was on a stretcher . ”
For 19 months , Gaza has endured shortages of fuel , food , medicine and building materials .
The Palestinians suffer the additional humiliation of using their tormentors ’ currency , but two months ago the Israeli government cut the supply of shekels , creating a severe cash shortage .
Fayad Salam , the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah , was forced to plea with the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert .
There were long queues at ATMs in Gaza City this week , but no matter how much they have in salary or savings , cash is rationed and Palestinians can withdraw only 1,000 Israeli shekels per month .
“ If the Israelis could deprive us of air , they would do it , ” says a Palestinian doctor .
The siege of Gaza lies at the heart of the conflict .
“ If the Israelis want the war to end , they must open all the borders and end the siege , ” says Hamas government spokesman Tahir al - Nounou .
“ Because the siege is war ; the siege is killing our people . ”
The only lifeline for Gaza are some 1,300 tunnels beneath the Gaza - Egyptian border .
It costs $ 10,000 ( €7,800 ) to dig a tunnel .
The best tunnels are bored with sophisticated machines that compress earthen walls so no give - away sand appears outside .
Some have railway tracks and electricity , and the tunnels are a lucrative business for Gazans and Egyptians .
Because Hamas is believed to import weapons through the tunnels , Israel carpet - bombed them during the offensive .
Yet only an estimated 400 were destroyed , and by mid-week the tunnels were again open .
Huge plastic cubes in metal frames , holding petrol , appeared on the pavements of Gaza City .
But the return to a semblance of normality cannot efface the three - week nightmare .
Whole families were wiped out .
Abu Mohamed Balousha , who lost five daughters , and the Samounis of Zeitoun , where a four - year - old boy was the only survivor in a family of 30 , have become causes célèbres .
Everyone has a worst memory .
For ambulance driver Hathem Saleh , it was desperate telephone calls from the wounded .
“ When you have been talking to him on the phone and you cannot reach him because the Israeli tank will hit you – it happened to me many times . . .
I could hear cries and the Israelis were shooting at us . ”
Dr Mahmoud al Khozendar , a chest physician , tells of a colleague whose Russian wife was cut in half when an Israeli missile hit their home .
It also killed their six - month - old child .
“ He took the two parts of his wife and put her on the bed with the baby .
He escaped with a wounded son and daughter , and asked the Red Crescent to go back for the bodies . ”
At Shifa , al Khozendar had a room full of limbs he could not match with bodies , and one body with two heads .
“ Most of the bodies were buried without names , ” he says .
THERE WERE MANY ways to die during the Israeli offensive on Gaza .
Perhaps the greatest number killed were crushed to death when the Israelis fired heavy tank artillery at their houses .
Halima Radwan , 60 , seemed particularly symbolic to me .
Radwan was a young woman when she and her family fled from Israel in the 1967 war .
She spent her life as a wandering Palestinian , moving to Gaza , Jordan , Lebanon , Egypt .
In 1996 , in the glory days when Gaza had an airport and Palestinians carried passports , she and her husband Ahmad , a PLO official , decided to move back to “ Palestine ” .
They built a five - bedroom villa in the Abed Rabbo district of Gaza .
A month before the offensive , they paid off their debts and celebrated .
Maher Radwan , 36 , is Halima and Ahmad ’s only son and a mechanical engineer with the Palestinian Authority .
He , his wife and children lived with his parents .
“ Before the ground offensive started , I decided to take my wife and children further from the border , ” Maher recounts in front of the ruined villa .
“ I begged my parents to come with us , but they said ‘ No , we are old .
The Israelis wo n’t harm us ’. ”
On January 6th , an Israeli tank fired a shell at the Radwans ’ house .
Ahmad was wounded in the head and walked out with a white flag .
He begged the Israelis to allow the Red Crescent to rescue his wife Halima , who was buried alive in her kitchen .
The Israelis said no .
Halima lived for four days under the debris of her house , which the Israelis then dynamited .
“ They knew she was there and they saw her , because they searched the house before they destroyed it , ” says Maher .
As soon as the ceasefire took effect last Sunday , he went with friends and relatives to dig his mother out .
“ I had the tiniest hope she might still be alive . ”
But Halima ’s legs , shoulder and head had been crushed by concrete .
Broken porcelain , a framed verse from the Koran and a piece of plaster with Hebrew writing by the Israeli soldiers are scattered in the ruins of the Radwan family home .
The pigeons they raised have returned to roost on the broken roof .
Maher Radwan ’s neighbours say there can be no peace with the Israelis who did this .
But Maher is more sad than angry .
Peace might still be possible , he says , “ if only there were wise Israeli people ” .
OVERWEIGHT TROOPS OVERWEIGHT TROOPS WASHINGTON 
The number of troops diagnosed as overweight or obese has more than doubled since the start of the Iraq war , yet another example of stress and strains of continuing combat deployments , according to a recent Pentagon study .
The review , contained in the January edition of the Defense Department 's Medical Surveillance Monthly Report , raises concerns about the overall readiness as demands on the military continue to increase , says Dr. Michael Kilpatrick , director of strategic communication for Pentagon health affairs .
" Stress and return from deployment were the most frequently cited reasons " for gaining weight , the study said .
The largest increase in diagnoses of overweight and obese troops came in the last five years , the report said .
From 1998 to 2002 , the number of servicemembers diagnosed as overweight remained steady at about one or two out of 100 .
But those numbers increased after 2003 , according to the study , and today nearly one in 20 are diagnosed as clinically overweight .
There may be even more overweight troops than the report shows , Kilpatrick said , because the study includes only servicemembers diagnosed as overweight during a visit with a doctor .
The actual percentage of troops who are found to be overweight during fitness trials could be higher , he said .
The weight - gain trend is among many strains shown within the military after six years of war and back - to - back deployments .
They include steadily rising suicides and divorce rates among soldiers and Marines and increased prescription drug use in the Army .
Problems with obesity among the general public — fostered by fast - food restaurants and increasingly popular sedentary pastimes such as video games — have spilled over into the military , the study suggests .
One in five Americans between ages 18 to 34 is obese , the study says .
The Army reports problems of obesity among recruits .
" Overweight / obesity is a significant military medical concern because it is associated with decreased military operational effectiveness , " the study says .

I was at a local flea market this morning stocking up on local everclear that the farmers can ' find ' if you ask the right guy and I saw a chinese version of this product .
A little disturbing ... made of an aluminum cone and plastic attachments , I was told it was easier to clean .
I slit my thumb on the insertation edge , and had to pour some of my ill - gotten hooch on the finger because , honestly , the guy could n't tell me if it had been used previously and I was n't going to take and chances ...
Pretty much why I only buy American and if you put anything up your children 's butts , it better be American because you do n't want to get a staph infection when your kid leaves their toys lying around ...

• ' Terrible ' tax returns for January • Government likely to miss borrowing target • Public net debt hits record 47.8 % of GDP - set to rise to 100 %
The government 's rescue of some of Britain 's biggest banks will more than double the national debt at a stroke after government statisticians decided to classify Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland as public corporations .
Their liabilities – up to £ 1.5tn – will be added to the taxpayer 's balance sheet .
That could push the country 's debt levels up to 150 % of national income , from a three - decade high of 48 % now .
The public sector net debt has already been swollen by £ 90bn of Northern Rock liabilities and , as of yesterday , £ 50bn of Bradford & Bingley 's liabilities .
But the two latest additions , which the ONS estimates could total between £ 1tn and £ 1.5tn , would dwarf those .
It was already widely expected that RBS 's liabilities would come onto the public balance sheet since it is now 70 % owned by the taxpayer but it is a surprise that Lloyds , which recently swallowed Halifax Bank of Scotland , has been classified as a public corporation given that it is only 43 % owned by the state .
ONS statisticians said , though , that it was not ownership that mattered but " ability to control " a company , and for that reason it had decided Lloyds should join RBS in the public sector .
They said the ONS had taken the decision " based on a judgment that government has the ability to control the respective banks ' general corporate policy through the conditions associated with the agreements signed relating to recapitalisation " .
They added they would continue to publish two measures of the national debt – one including the various banks ' liabilities and one excluding them – as it does now .
The ONS said it did not yet have accurate numbers for the true extent of the banks ' liabilities since they were such complex instititutions and said it would take months to work out a true figure .
But the hit to the public finances will be back - dated to last October when the recapitalisations were announced .
RBS owns Dutch bank ABN Amro , Natwest , several insurers and rolling stock companies .
The ONS will exclude an overseas liabilities that the banks may have .
Importantly , it will also exclude the banks ' assets , other than very short term ones like government bonds or cash holdings .
This is because of international statistical rules which insist full liabilities be counted for public corporations but only short - term assets .
Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury , Philip Hammond , said : " This is just the beginning of Gordon Brown 's debt crisis .
Even on his own figures our national debt is set to double to more than one trillion pounds .
This is the true legacy of the government 's economic failures , and our children will be paying it off for a generation . "
" Once the liabilities of the bailed out banks are included , our true national debt is now significantly larger than our national income , adding to the risks facing the economy and the burden on future generations . "
Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable urged the government to use the banks to increase the flow of money to the economy .
" The ONS has confirmed what we already knew .
The government has in effect nationalised RBS and has a substantial stake in Lloyds .
" Ministers must now accept the reality that they effectively own two large banks and use them to ensure the flow of much needed credit into the economy . "
He also criticised the fact that statistical conventions mean the public accounts would only include the liabilities of the banks , not the assets , thus distorting the picture .
Gemma Tetlow , senior economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies , agreed : " This overstates the deterioration in the public sector balance sheet , because the government is not credited with the long - term assets of the banks . "
Tax take falls sharply
The other piece of bad news was that tumbling income tax , corporation tax and VAT revenues in January caused the public deficit for the first 10 months of the fiscal year 2008 / 09 to blow out to £ 67bn from £ 23 bn a year ago .
The IFS said that meant the public deficit for this year to April could run up to £ 87bn .
Just over two months ago , in the pre-budget report , the chancellor , Alistair Darling , estimated a shortfall of £ 78bn for this year .
Public net debt has already hit a record 47.8 % of GDP , today 's figures showed .
The ONS also reported that the government finances worsened dramatically in January – the biggest tax - raising month of the year .
City bonuses and corporation tax receipts usually swell the national purse at the start of the calendar year , but the tax take fell sharply last month as the recession took its toll .
As a result , public sector net borrowing , the government 's preferred measure , recorded a surplus of only £ 3.34bn , some £ 10bn less than a year ago and the lowest January surplus since 1995 .
" The public finances continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate , " said Andrew Goodwin , senior economic advisor to the Ernst & Young Item Club .
" January is an important month for tax receipts so to record a surplus which was just a quarter of that achieved last January highlights the severity of the situation . "
Overall government receipts were down by 11 % in January .
The finances were also hurt by increases in government spending , up nearly 9 % , and strong public investment .
Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight called the figures " terrible " .
" January is a bumper month for tax receipts .
Unfortunately , though , bumper hardly describes the tax receipts for this January as they have been decimated by sharply contracting economic activity , declining profitability , rising unemployment , reduced bonus payments , December 's VAT cut and substantially weakened housing market activity and prices . "
Over the tax year so far , government borrowing has reached £ 67.2 bn – almost three times higher than this time last year .
Some economists warned that there could be a shortfall of close to £ 100bn rather than Darling 's predicted £ 78bn borrowing forecast .
However , TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said : " A steep fall in the tax take in the middle of a recession will surprise no one .
But it is absolutely right to let the deficit grow .
When companies and consumers stop spending , the public sector must fill the gap . "

In August 2004 , I wrote a Rural Life editorial about the victory garden movement during World War II , noting that a national crisis had turned Americans  for a few years at least into a nation of gardeners .
Now we are in the midst of another crisis .
And perhaps this is the moment for another national home gardening movement , a time when the burgeoning taste for local food converges with the desire to cut costs and take new control over our battered economic lives .
There are signs that some people are already thinking this way .
A number of friends have said to me , wistfully , that if things get worse , they ’ll just go to the country and learn to farm , as if learning to farm were like studying shorthand or learning to weld .
This is daydreaming .
But there ’s every reason to think about putting in a garden .
In fact , many seed companies are reporting higher sales  especially in Britain , which has a rich tradition of home gardening .
At grocery stores and farm stands , the difference in cost between organic and conventionally grown vegetables can be substantial .
In the garden , the difference is negligible .
I can’t help noting , too , that half of “ The 11 Best Foods You Are n’t Eating ”  a widely e-mailed Web article by Tara Parker - Pope of The Times  are easily grown in a northeastern garden , including beets , chard , pumpkins and blueberries .
Is it possible for the hype of a game to completely fuel both its designers and its fans eagerly awaiting its release ?
In the case of Guerrilla Games ' upcoming Killzone 2 , the answer is an emphatic yes ; the developers knew that they wanted to meet or surpass the action of the now infamous E3 trailer and have been trying to perfect their anticipated shooter .
As far as fans were concerned , they were hoping that Killzone 2 would be the system seller and showcase for the PlayStation 3 -- a game that could conceivably rival that of Halo and Gears of War .
Fortunately , the wait is almost over , because Killzone 2 will be released at the end of next month .
That might seem a bit far away , but believe me when I say that the wait has been well worth it .
Killzone 2 is an outstanding evolution of the franchise , a bullet and adrenaline - fueled rampage against an implacable enemy and a fantastic shooter for the PS3 .
Killzone 2 is actually the third chapter in the series , following the original PS2 shooter and Killzone : Liberation , a third - person action title on the PSP .
While players do n't need to have played either one of those games to understand what 's going on in Killzone 2 , fans of the franchise will see connections between the three games with familiar characters popping up and events being referenced .
The basic thrust of the story takes place after the events of Liberation , where the ISA has finally gotten tired of being invaded and attacked on its world of Vekta .
While the relative success of repelling the Helghast has worked , the ISA has decided to take the fight back to Emperor Visari .
Believing that the Helghast spirit has been broken by their losses on Vekta , the ISA launches a " revenge " invasion against the world of Helghan with the goal of capturing Visari and forcing the Helghast to stand down .
Of course , the ISA quickly discovers that this is not the case at all , and as the soldiers discover that the Helghast spirit is just as fierce on their home world than ever before , they also that discover the Helghast have new weapons to unleash on their foes .
Watch the Video Review here ( HD available ) .
You 're+not+in+Vekta+anymore , +Sev .
Unlike the previous games , you 're not stepping into the boots of Templar , the hero of the first two titles , who 's been promoted up the ranks to become a commander of a fleet and his own troops .
Instead , you 'll take on the Helghast as Sev , part of a four - man team known as Alpha Squad .
Led by Rico ( who players might remember from the first two games ) , Sev and his other teammates , Garza and Natko , fight their way across Helghan through ten separate missions that will take you about eight to ten hours to complete .
Each mission you embark on has multiple checkpoints and objectives that you 'll complete , and these will cover large battles , ambushes , choke points , house to house fighting and even vehicular and turret sequences .
Of all the segments , I kind of wish that the vehicles and turrets were expanded because you get a sense of truly affecting and turning the tide of the location that you 're in with these weapons at your disposal .
The story of the game is pretty good for what it is .
Themes of fascism and militaristic aggression , revenge and the costs of war echo rampantly throughout the entire title .
There are a few dips here and there within the story .
Rico is just as annoying and unlikable as ever ; it's to the point where you can't help but hope that he meets an unsavory end in a sequel .
The ending could 've also ended on a much stronger note , particularly when compared to the final battle , which can be a serious challenge of your accuracy and ability to handle threats from all sides .
When compared to that fight , the decision made at the end of the game is a poor choice -- it 's obviously the weaker of two actions that could 've driven the franchise forward .
However , with that being said , the majority of the plot does an excellent job of driving the action throughout the campaign , which will give you a ton of action , hellish warfare to fight and survive through , and moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat .
Much of this is driven by the incredible presentation of the title , which makes you feel like you 've fallen into the middle of a warzone .
Guerrilla has managed to make a technical masterpiece for the system that first - person shooters on the PS3 will be judged by from here on out .
Whether it's the insanity of watching soldiers getting immolated by flamethrowers and ripped to shreds by bullets or avoiding the numerous explosions that rock your team 's position , you frequently feel as though someone has you in their sights and is just getting ready to pull the trigger .
This chaotic sense is only enhanced more by the start of just about every mission , which frequently has a dramatic crash or other striking moment occur before control is given to you .
For example , when you crash land in the first level , you 're almost given a burst of adrenaline because you 've just managed to avoid bodies and the wreckage of a fellow lander that went flying past you .
Leaping off that and into the fray really gives you a sense of how short the life expectancy of any soldier in this war is and draws you into the fight in a way that few cutscenes could do .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Sky News , the British - based 24 - hour news broadcaster , will not show a controversial appeal for aid for the people of Gaza , it announced Monday .
Protesters demonstrate in London Sunday against the BBC 's decision not to show Gaza aid appeal .
Sky News joins the BBC in refusing to show the appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee , an umbrella group of 13 leading British aid agencies .
The BBC , Britain 's public broadcaster , has been criticized by politicians and religious leaders for refusing to show the appeal , which launches Monday .
There have been demonstrations against the decision at BBC buildings in England and Scotland .
Sky News said airing the appeal would compromise its reputation for fairness .
Do you agree with the decision ?

" Broadcasting an appeal for Gaza at this time is incompatible with our role in providing balanced and objective reporting of this continuing situation to our audiences in the UK and around the world , " John Ryley , the head of Sky News , said Monday in a statement on the company 's Web site .
The Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) includes the British Red Cross , Oxfam , Save the Children and 10 other charities .
British broadcasters , led by the BBC , originally declined to air the Gaza appeal , but in the face of criticism from government ministers and others , ITV , Channel 4 and Channel 5 changed their minds .
CNN was not approached to broadcast the ad , a DEC spokesman said .
About 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London on Saturday over the broadcaster 's stance .
Seven people were arrested .
About 50 people protested at its Glasgow headquarters Sunday .
The corporation received about 1,000 phone calls and 10,000 e-mails of complaint in the three days after it announced its decision Thursday .
But the BBC is sticking with its position , director general Mark Thompson wrote in a blog post on the corporation 's Web site .
" We concluded that we could not broadcast a free - standing appeal , no matter how carefully constructed , without running the risk of reducing public confidence in the BBC 's impartiality in its wider coverage of the story , " he wrote Saturday .
" Inevitably an appeal would use pictures which are the same or similar to those we would be using in our news programs but would do so with the objective of encouraging public donations .
The danger for the BBC is that this could be interpreted as taking a political stance on an ongoing story , " he wrote .
" Gaza remains a major ongoing news story , in which humanitarian issues -- the suffering and distress of civilians and combatants on both sides of the conflict , the debate about who is responsible for causing it and what should be done about it -- are both at the heart of the story and contentious , " he added .
The BBC , which is funded by an obligatory license fee paid by every British household with a television , is required by its charter to be impartial .
The DEC is " disappointed that the BBC declined to support the Gaza appeal , " a spokesman told CNN .
" It might limit the reach of our key message to the general public . "
The spokesman , who asked not to be named , said the BBC had to make its own decision about impartiality .
" That is a decision they must make .
We have no view on that subject , " he said .
Many readers of Thompson 's blog post did have a view , however .
The statement received hundreds of comments , most of them critical of the BBC .
A commenter who signed in as bully -- baiter said the BBC was taking a side no matter what it did .
" Sorry Mr. Thompson but you cannot have it both ways .
If deciding to accede to the DEC request would be seen as political then deciding not to accede to it is also political .
Do n't insult me with your disingenuous attempts to suggest it is otherwise , " the commenter wrote .
Other commenters simply rejected Thompson 's position out of hand .
" I think the reasons for blocking help for a grave humanitarian disaster are simply astounding , " brit -- proud wrote .
" How can simply bringing food , medicines and homes to hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians be seen as political impartiality ?
How stupid do the BBC think the British public are ? "
The corporation had its defenders as well .
" The last thing I want to do , is fund the BBC to broadcast propaganda , " SternG wrote : " There 's no way I will pay the BBC to air the DEC 's politically - motivated ' appeal ' for Gaza .
Gaza is run by a government which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group , including by the EU .
There is no doubt that some aid / fund will be ' procured ' by Hamas .... Good decision BBC . "
British broadcasters have refused to air some previous DEC appeals , the umbrella organization 's spokesman said .
A planned 2006 appeal for aid to victims of the war in Lebanon was scrapped because " there were genuine concerns , shared by the aid agencies , about the deliverability of aid . "
Thompson cited doubts about whether DEC members could get aid to Gaza as a secondary reason for declining to take the ad .

For most of The Shield 's seven - season run , the most important episode of the series was the pilot , which ended with the murder of undercover internal affairs officer Terry Crowley at the hands of rogue cops Vic Mackey ( Michael Chiklis ) and Shane Vendrell ( Walton Goggins ) .
Crowley 's murder hung over the characters like a storm cloud , and in the final two episodes , karma finally rained down and washed Vic and Shane away into oblivion .
If " Family Meeting " gets the edge over the shattering penultimate episode " Possible Kill Screen " — which built to a confession scene of stunning proportion — it 's because finale episodes of long - running TV shows are rarely as satisfying as this one .
Vic 's reckoning defied most speculation , but still landed him in the worst kind of hell , while Shane 's desperate final days were n't extinguished with big bang , but rather a quiet , even tranquil , resolution .
It 's sad to see The Shield go , but it's hard to imagine the series topping an episode as shocking and haunting as " Family Meeting . "

2. 30 Rock , " Cooter "
While its gone - yet - still - inexplicably - fun - to - kick - around onetime rival Studio 60 On The Sunset wore its laughably earnest politics proudly , 30 Rock 's political satire is infinitely slyer and more subtle , not to mention , you know , actually funny .
In the delightful season finale , " Cooter , " Tina Fey and her crack group of writers got in some hilarious shots at soon - to - be - gone - yet - still - inexplicably - fun - to - kick - around President Bush and his hapless cronies by having proud capitalist Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) hop on board the sinking ship that is the Bush Administration .
Matthew Broderick put several decades of playing luckless schmucks to good use playing a flopsweat - drenched Bushie the President nicknamed " Burger " because he once saw him eating a hamburger ( shades of The Office 's " Big Tuna " ) who ushers Jack into the comic insanity of Bushworld .

3 . The Wire , " Late Editions "
Throughout its five - season run , The Wire has functioned like a great epic novel unfolding , with each new season providing a mini-arc in the larger story of a city 's institutional failures and how they impact the populace .
And within those seasons , the penultimate episode was generally the dramatic fallout before the mournful aftermath , the hour when all the shit goes down .
The great crime novelist George Pelecanos , who penned several penultimate episodes from seasons past , was brought in again for " Late Editions , " which handled the mighty task of delivering satisfying payoffs for the season and the series .
A number of unforgettable moments stand out : Bubbles achieving some measure of grace in his anniversary speech to AA ( " Ain't no shame in holding onto grief , as long as you make room for other things , too " ) ; Michael getting the drop on Snoop ; and perhaps most heartbreaking of all , the parting of poor Dukie , who leaves with a memory of more innocent times that seem eons removed from the present .
4. Mad Men , " Maidenform "
Advertisement
Mad Men 's second season offered much more for fans to unpack about the mysteries and meaning of Don Draper , and his place in the shifting American culture of the early ' 60s .
" Maidenform " was arguably the season 's most symbol - dense episode , and one loaded with what passes for action in the Sterling - Cooper universe .
Don lashes out at Betty for her revealing swimsuit , and then channels his anger into a bondage session with his mistress .
Pete sleeps with a bra model , on her mother 's couch .
Duck releases his beloved dog onto the streets of New York City , then retreats to his office to stare down his liquor bottle .
And the S - C staff works on an ad campaign for Playtex , suggesting its bras fit two sides of a woman : sensible and sexy .
The episode opens with Mad Men 's women looking into mirrors , suiting up for the day ; it ends with Don unable to cope with his own reflection , or his daughter 's adoring eyes .
The message : Sometimes having two sides is n't fun , for a woman or a man .
( Note : An argument could be made that Mad Men 's best episode this season was " Three Sundays . "
Or " The Jet Set . "
Or the season finale " Meditations In An Emergency . "
This show had a heck of a run . )
5 . The Office , " Dinner Party "
The fourth season of The Office was defined largely by its bracing darkness and , with the possible exception of " The Deposition , " no episode was bleaker or more caustically funny than " Dinner Party . "
The standout episode plunged deep into the black hole of barely restrained contempt and raging bitterness at the core of Michael Scott 's hate - hate relationship with boss - turned - girlfriend - turned - enemy Jan Levinson with a Dunder - Mifflin twist on Who 's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf ?
After turning down dinner invitations for weeks , Jim and Pam reluctantly agree to have dinner at Michael and Jan 's place , where they 're treated to an unwanted front - row seat to a crazily dysfunctional relationship spiraling rapidly out of control .
There was no subplot to lighten the angst and bad vibes , just a painfully funny look into the deepest depths of cohabitation hell .
6. Lost , " The Constant "
Was Lost 's fourth season its best yet because it finally moved the story forward — while also deepening the mythology and tugging at the heart — or was it the best because it was the shortest , and thus had a higher percentage of memorable moments ?
Sure , the show 's first three seasons had plenty of episodes as good as the absolutely awesome " The Shape Of Things To Come , " " Cabin Fever , " and " The Economist . "
But you'd be hard pressed to find many Losts as singularly special as " The Constant , " a mind - bending time - travel episode focused on poor , displaced Desmond .
While Desmond — who always seems to figure into the best Losts — jumps back and forth between the present and the past , and between potential rescue on a mysterious freighter and his years of military service , " The Constant " drops hints about the time - warping properties of the island and the behind - the - scenes machinations of Charles Widmore .
It all concludes in a touching virtual reunion , reminding fans that Lost is more about the journey of its characters than the history of the place they 've been stranded .
7. Generation Kill , " A Bomb In The Garden "
The title says everything that needs to be said about the final episode of Generation Kill , Wire creator David Simon and company 's brilliant adaptation of Rolling Store reporter Evan Wright 's book about his experience as an embed with a Marine recon battalion in the Iraq War .
In a stunning three - week campaign through the country , the Marines have forged their way through Iraq , overcoming poor armor , equipment failure , and inept , potentially disastrous decision - making at the top in order to get to Baghdad .
Once they arrive , the war has created such chaos and destruction that the best they can do are little things , like defusing an unexploded bomb lodged in a garden where children play .
It fits beautifully into an ongoing theme both here and on The Wire :
That decent , well - intentioned people can make a small difference , but they 're doomed to be let down by their leaders .

8. Battlestar Galactica , " Revelations "
Way back at the start of the series , the Cylons killed 99.999 % of humanity and mortally ticked off the surviving 0.001 % , who wound up limping off to their only possible refuge — the long - lost planet Earth .
Yet over the course of the series , the humans and their killer robot prodigy have slowly come to terms with each other , until finally in Season 4 — and specifically , the season finale " Revelations " — the two sides learn that their fates are connected .
A higher power wants them to come back to Earth , and they can only get there if they make peace and work together .
" Revelations " delivered high drama and heartbreaking work by Edward James Olmos and Michael Hogan .
It also left several questions unanswered : who 's the fifth Cylon ?
What is Head Six ?
And who left this breadcrumb trail across space , anyway ?
But the show was most memorable for the cliffhanger : everyone finally makes it to Earth , only to find a charred , radioactive wreck where their paradise was supposed to be .
Somebody send them a copy of WALL -E , stat .

9. Breaking Bad , " Crazy Handful Of Nothin ' "
AMC 's edgy drama about a high school chemistry teacher who goes into the meth business only aired seven episodes in an abbreviated January - to - March season .
But a paunchy , desperate Bryan Cranston convinced viewers that the show had higher aspirations than becoming a gender - reversed Weeds .
In the penultimate installment , " Crazy Handful of Nothin ' , " the cold open alternates between Cranston 's Walter trying to establish boundaries with the twitchy , undereducated former student and current " Cap'n Cook " with whom he 's partnering —
" I 'm just the chemist , " he argues — and a nightmarish flash - forward in which a suddenly bald Walter strides out of an burning building with a bloodstained bag of money .
In between , Walter starts chemotherapy , endures the therapeutic lingo of a cancer support group , and lies to his wife about their finances while kiting checks at the medical center .
How did we get from here to there ?
That 's the fascination of this show : filling in the formula that transforms a mild - mannered father into an explosives - toting badass , and watching the elements react .

10 . Chuck , " Chuck Versus The Seduction "
Evidence enough of a complete Chuck creative renaissance , " Chuck Vs. The Seduction " is an homage to 1982's My Favorite Year .
Chuck Bartowski , the affable sap with a government database lodged in his brain , is tasked with wooing a powerful ( ly hot ) Russian operative known as the Black Widow ( Melinda Clarke ) .
Of course , his IT vocab does n't do wonders as far as " the ladies " are concerned , so he 's a bit inexperienced .
To help , the CIA calls in rogue agent , overall - suave - guy Roan Montgomery ( John Larroquette ) to walk , and talk , Chuck through the whole thing .
It 's certainly well - worn TV territory , but all of co-creator Josh Schwartz 's talents are on display .
The dialogue pops at every point ( Chuck on Roan : " His liver must look like camouflage " ) ; the guest stars are perfectly cast and wholly utilized ; and Schwartz , a pop culture savant , successfully pays tribute to a piece of film he loves , all while building a show where the main character can believably fumble through a bar pick - up , then swing from the roof of the Buy More on a banner that reads : " Under New Assistant Managementship . "
If only season one were half this much fun .

11 . How I Met Your Mother , " Naked Man "
Nearly all the elements that make How I Met Your Mother a tonic to the sitcom - depressive are present in the recent " Naked Man " episode : a high - concept sexual strategem , rampant list - making , temporary self - deception , Barney Stinson bravado ( and comeuppance ) , a rapid - fire time - compressing montage , and just a pinch of mythology to remind us that we continue to progress toward the answer to the question posed by the series title .
The gang is puzzled by Robin 's capitulation to an unlikely first - date advance by short , balding , unattractive Mitch , until Mitch tells them the secret :
Get into her apartment on a pretense , then strip naked .
" Two out of three times , guaranteed ! "
Even though
Ted believes that he 's got something going with fellow elevator rider Vicki , he decides to risk it all on the Naked Man , leading to a cellular back - and - forth with Barney in which they practice Naked Man poses like " Mr. Clean " and " The Burt Reynolds " ( complete with chewing gum ) .
Alas , somebody has to be The Third Naked Man .
Even though this episode did n't have the pathos that HIMYM can achieve , its crackerjack timing and surfeit of invention made it a season highlight .
Advertisement
12 . The Venture Bros. , " The Doctor Is Sin "
The Venture Bros. has long walked the line between parody and pity , and rarely has that line been quite as blurred as in the second episode of the third ( and latest ) season .
When Rusty Venture turns to the magical Dr. Killinger for help reorganizing his miserable , imploding existence , he gets a glimpse of a different kind of life , one with suited thugs ( " Venchmen " ) , stronger costume design , and the freedom to finally get some much desired revenge on his successful twin brother .
It 's the chance to turn his back on the self - absorbed , self - loathing " hero " persona forced on him by his father and embrace the super - villaindom to which is he seems far better suited .
To the show 's credit , his ultimate decision is both tragic and curiously uplifting .
Oh , and funny as hell .
For a series that embraces its freaks as much is it mocks them , " Doctor " is a twisted statement of purpose : that even naked , miserable , and ashamed , it 's still possible to want to be the good guy .

13 . Pushing Daisies , " Comfort Food "
It was a sad season for fans of the unrepentantly quirky Pushing Daisies , who watched as one of the few truly original shows left on network television floundered in the ratings and eventually succumbed to cancellation .
Yet there was a little sweet to counteract that bitter blow ; rather than retreat to the middle ground to draw more viewers , the show ramped up its signature blend of wacky morbidity and candy - colored tweeness , resulting in a post - cancellation string of top - tier episodes .
No episode epitomized this better than " Comfort Food , " which featured , among other highlights : Murder via deep - fat - frying , a character called " The Waffle Nazi " ( complete with lederhosen and Hitler ' stache ) , a characteristically spectacular guest performance by Stephen Root , and , perhaps best of all , a musical number from lovable sprite Kristen Chenoweth , who busted out " Eternal Flame " while wearing a hat shaped like a tiny pie .
It 's a near - perfect episode , and a stinging reminder for fans of what they 're losing .
14 . It 's Always Sunny In Philadelphia , " Mac And Charlie Die "
How crude can you be on basic cable ?
Excluding cut - out animation ,
It 's Always Sunny answers that question more thoroughly than anyone actually wants to see .
Exhibit A : The Shadow , the fall - down - funniest moment in the up - and - down fifth season of the show .
Frank discovers a glory hole in the men's bathroom of Paddy 's Pub , and Dennis gets very … excited … about sex with strangers whose faces you can't see .
The Eyes Wide Shut orgy that Frank takes him to does n't satisfy — it 's just a bunch of fat guys sitting around in stupid masks , although the buffet is quite extensive — and eventually Dennis tries out the hole , in slowly extending ( and quickly retreating ) silhouette .
Meanwhile , after angry Luther gets paroled , Mac and Charlie fake their own deaths by crashing a car into a wall and leaving a video and a bunch of teeth ( which Charlie has no trouble providing , thanks to inadequate dental hygiene ) .
When the crash fails to explode the car , Charlie urges Mac to fire his handgun into the gas tank , assuring him that " it 'll blow you to safety . "
Although the series has suffered from some half - baked ideas this season , " Mac And Charlie Die " packed enough breakneck craziness and penile innuendo into one hour to last us all year .

15 . Doctor Who , " Midnight "
The revived Doctor Who has become a phenomenon in the U.K. but remains a tough sell in the U.S.
If any single episode could change that , it 's " Midnight . "
Penned by departing show runner Russell T. Davies , it begins as a light diversion when a vacationing Doctor ( David Tennant ) takes a short trip with some fellow tourists while visiting a resort planet famed for its relentless , and dangerous , sunlight .
Then a lot of things outside their shuttle start going wrong until the danger drifts inside .
The scares come more from dramatic claustrophobia than special effects and it's the fears and short tempers of everyone involved — including the usually unflappable Doctor — that make the episode so unsettling .
Like the best of the revived Who , it 's great television by any standard .
Advertisement
16 . Friday Night Lights , " Leave No One Behind "
Even the staunchest Friday Night Lights fan will admit to some tough moments in the second season , but an episode like this made those moments easy to forget .
It begins with easygoing humor as the show 's outwardly taciturn , bad luck - attracting quarterback Matt Saracen ( Zach Gilford ) decides to give up and emulate his low - achieving pal ( Taylor Kitsch ) .
It climaxes with an amazing scene in which his coach ( Kyle Chandler ) lets his intimidating façade drop enough to reveal how deeply his concern for his players — and maybe this good , fatherless kid in particular — goes .
Whatever the missteps the show made after its near - perfect first season , betraying its characters was never one of them .

17 . Sons Of Anarchy , " Capybara "
It 's been called " Sopranos with motorbikes , " and at first the comparison does n't seem far off .
There 's a strong - willed patriarch , a manipulative maternal figure , and , of course , the tight - knit band of criminals with an ironclad code of loyalty and brotherhood .
But as Sons went on , things changed ; characters deepened , situations grew more complex ( and Shakespearean ) , and the ramifications and limitations of the SAMCRO code become clear .
By the final episode , it was obvious that series creator Kurt Sutter had something more ambitious in mind than your standard crime drama ; the hero 's journey from willing sap to disillusioned warrior makes the possibilities of next season all the more exciting .
In " Capybara , " the third to last episode of the first season , the seeds are planted for favored son Jax 's split from the group , and it's a remarkable 40 - plus minutes of neatly sustained tension .
Advertisement
18 . Skins , " Effy "
This sharp BBC series , helpfully subtitled by BBC America so we do n't miss a single indecipherable Britishism , chronicles a group of high schoolers in Bristol as they navigate the many drugs , parties , and sexual pressures of adolescence — but also the loneliness , the insecurities , and the intense crushes and friendships .
If it sounds like Gossip Girl with an accent and explicit content , that could n't be further from the truth .
While the teens of Gossip Girl are glamorized to the point of cartoonishness , the adolescents of Skins look , speak , and feel like actual teenagers .
And while they do drugs and have sex and say things like " Ring me back when you are n't actually being penetrated , okay ? , " the kids of Skins never seem like walking lessons trapped in " very special episodes . "
They 're far more true - to - life than any teenagers currently on American TV , and definitely much funnier .
Each episode of Skins zeros in on one or two characters , unfolding the story from their perspectives .
But the show 's penultimate episode , " Effy " ends up being as much about Effy 's older brother Tony , his best friend Sid , his ex girlfriend Michelle , and even Effy 's parents as it is about the mysterious , often mute Effy .
When Effy goes missing after sneaking out of the house , the cool , Machiavellian Tony , who has become an outcast amongst his friends because of his dishonest and controlling behavior , attempts to enlist his estranged friend Sid to help him look for her .
If the show 's first episode " Tony " introduced him as a selfish , somewhat cruel , cool kid , " Effy " forces
Tony to atone for his past sins , and reveals his compelling flip - side — the lonely , protective , often misguided Tony .
" Effy " also contains one of the most frightening sexual lines ever uttered from one parent to another : " I 'll get the turkey baster , you go wash your bits . "

19 . Tim And Eric Awesome Show , Great Job ! , " Spagett "
Spagett — a freakish entertainer whose shtick is " spooking " people by jumping from behind things — began in a typically nonsensical Tim And Eric sketch , but blossomed in his own thoroughly meta episode .
Eric Wareheim discovers that Tim Heidecker ( who plays the long - haired , marinara - mouthed weirdo ) is in the process of shooting Spagett And The Quest For The Golden Treasure with Steven Spielberg ( played by a spot - on double ) , but there 's no room for Wareheim to participate .
The scenes in which Heidecker shoots the movie — all on green screen , with new co-star Brian Posehn — are incredible , filled with super - shitty CGI and stupid dialogue .
But it 's after the movie bombs ( and Heidecker gets the Spagett look permanently ) that ridiculous flirts with genius .

20 . Top Chef , " Wedding Wars "
The challenges on Top Chef are all about taking the contestants out of their culinary comfort zone , and there 's no crueler example than the annual " wedding wars " battle , which hits them with the impossible task of preparing a multi-course dinner ( including cake ) for 100 + guests within a 24 - hour period .
Fueled by Red Bull and a healthy supply of contempt , two mismatched teams go without sleep to grind their way through this catering nightmare , and some of them are clearly going mad .
( The season 's wild card Andrew , who behaved like a coked - up mental patient under the best of circumstances , said this about his creamed spinach : " I 'm like Popeye 's fucking wet dream right now . "
He also talked about having " a culinary boner . " )
" Wedding Wars " also gets bonus points for the always - entertaining knife - skills relay challenge .

21 . House , " House 's Head " / " Wilson 's Heart "
House 's fourth season began with the misanthropic diagnostician dealing with the loss of his team by pitting dozens of new applicants against each other in his own cruel version of reality TV .
It was an entertaining twist on the House formula , but once the field of candidates narrowed — leaving only the dullest doctors behind — the show largely retreated to formulaic mediocrity .
That is , until the two - part season finale , which saw Dr. House recovering from a bus crash and trying to sort through his own foggy memories to recall the name and symptoms of a missing passenger he knows is going to die .
At the end of part one , House realizes that the person he 's looking for is someone dear to his only real friend , Dr. Wilson .
But if House tells Wilson why he was on a bus with this person , he risks that friendship .
With a structure that owes more to Dennis Potter than Marcus Welby , and a conclusion that 's quietly devastating , " House 's Head " and " Wilson 's Heart " offered a powerful rejoinder to those who think House is just the same show week after week .
( Unfortunately , House has spent much of Season Five proving the naysayers right all over again . )

22 . Survivor : Micronesia , " If It Smells Like A Rat , Give It Cheese "
Survivor : Micronesia pitted long - time Survivor fans against favorite players from seasons past , and while the early episodes had a comfortable feel — as the contestants we already knew trounced people we never got a chance to care about — it did n't take long for the twists to start coming , hard and fast .
Contestants dropped out because of injury , or homesickness , and then eventually the strongest players started getting picked off one - by - one by a core group of female contestants who week after week blindsided people who thought they were in control of the game .
In the season 's most stunning bit of deception , the women somehow convinced the unbeatable Erik to give one of them his immunity idol .
When he went along with their plan , they immediately voted him out .
It was easily the most ridiculous Survivor strategy ever — and it actually worked .
So much of reality TV has become over - familiar , but Survivor : Micronesia had more " I can't believe what I 'm seeing " moments than just about any show on TV this year .

23 . The Middleman , " The Obsolescent Cryogenic Meltdown "
The plan was sheer elegance in its simplicity .
In the heat of summer , tempt TV addicts with a pop-savvy sci-fi / super - spy series that alternately recalls The Venture Bros . ( in its frequent references to a long , noble , gradually decaying legacy ) , Buffy The Vampire Slayer ( in the presence of a smart - mouthed , uncannily gifted heroine ) , Gilmore Girls ( in the non-stop , rapid - fire patter , rife with obscure pop culture references ) , and The Hitchhiker 's Guide To The Galaxy ( in its vision of a meaningless universe that presents the illusion of purpose via complex bureaucracy ) .
Alas , ABC Family never quite got the word out to the kind of people who would 've loved The Middleman , if only they 'd known about it .
But the lucky few who caught on early were treated to classic TV episodes like " The Obsolescent Cryogenic Meltdown , " in which a '60s version of the world 's official protector gets defrosted in a crisis and ends up providing a swinging , politically incorrect contrast to the strait - laced modern superhero .
All that , plus Natalie Morales in a catsuit , the world 's most impossible card game , and a touch of genuine twentysomething romance .
Ah , Middleman … we miss you so much .

24 . Burn Notice , " Double Booked "
In its first season , Burn Notice was little more than light - toned but action - packed quasi - detective series , about a disavowed spy who picks up some extra cash doing gumshoe work .
Between the glamorous Miami setting , the high - tech capering , and the dry humor , Burn Notice was pure summer escapism , gripping but ultimately undemanding .
But while the show has remained every bit as fun in season two , the quality of the plots , action , and performances have all reached a higher level .
This past summer 's run was like a series of lean , colorful pulp paperbacks brought to life .
Witness " Double Booked , " a tricky episode in which our hero Michael ( played by the strikingly angular , surprisingly versatile Jeffrey Donovan ) gets hired by an old associate to perform a quickie assassination , and then spends the next several days trying to warn his mark while investigating his client , amid a series of near - misses and double - crosses as twisty and entertaining as any big - screen thriller .

25 . Xavier , Renegade Angel , " Signs From Godrilla "
Vernon Chatman and John Lee — the subversive weirdoes behind Wonder Showzen — got even more willfully strange with Xavier , Renegade Angel , which ran relatively unnoticed for 10 episodes .
( It 'll be back in February . )
It takes some effort to find the rhythm of the show — no surprise given it 's about a idiotic , philosophizing beast that 's part faun , part snake , and has weird blonde hair and lots of nipples .
( Not to mention the fact that the show is animated like a video game . )
But start with the season 's penultimate episode , a total mindfuck called " Signs From Godrilla , " and you could be hooked .
In it , Xavier comes to a crossroads and must choose between the heart and the mind : Somehow , in 11 minutes , it covers a gorilla messiah , horrible morning DJs , a biting indictment of religion , a repairman who restores hymens ( he 's got a model with an MP3 player in it ) , and more .
It 's so packed that it 's almost assaultive , especially the ending , but it 's worth tickling a part of your funny bone that does n't often get attention .

Stray moments from a few other favorite shows
The Daily Show
Given the election , The Daily Show would have been on America 's radar no matter what .
But Jon Stewart and company stepped up in a big way , writing precise , surprisingly level - headed media criticism .
Consistently .
The high point came September 3 , when Stewart — with help from what can only be described as the best damn clip - finding squad in history — delivered a point - by - point argument directed at Republican pundits ' glaring double standards regarding Sarah Palin .
The rest of the amazing episode compared Fred Thompson to Foghorn Leghorn and Joe Lieberman to Droopy Dog , but this clip continues to bite .

The Soup
The WGA strike earlier this year probably had a lot to do with this , but 2008 certainly was n't the high point for reality TV .
( Seriously , Paris Hilton 's My New BFF ?
Has the well run that dry already ? )
But America's " loss " is The Soup 's big , big gain .
Host Joel McHale ( aided by his trusty Spaghetti Cat ) is currently on a hot streak , taking on Miley Cyrus , Tyra Banks , and the women of The View with a smile — and no vitriol whatsoever .
Perhaps most impressive is his coverage of soap operas during the " My Stories " segments ; truly , McHale watches it all for us :
Saturday Night Live
From pretty much the moment America met Palin , there was no doubt in anyone 's mind that comedy goddess Tina Fey was made for the part .
Of course she paid her ol ' buddy Lorne Michaels a visit , but no one expected the result to catapult Saturday Night Live so rapidly back into the national spotlight .
Each of her appearances was great , but her first captures the element of surprise ( and co-stars the fabulous Amy Poehler ) :

The Late Show With David Letterman
David Letterman does n't seem to care much what people think about him anymore .
Which is great , because his unusually candid interviews this year made for some of the most honest , engaging work in his Late Show tenure .
No one was spared : The Hills ' Lauren Conrad and Spencer Pratt got the full pointed treatment , as did John McCain — who blew off an appearance to hurry back to Washington , only to sit down with Katie Couric one studio over .
Defamer has a nice compilation clip up , which does more justice than any write - up can .
As you settle into the Oval Office , Mr. President , may I offer a suggestion ?
Please do not try to put Afghanistan aright with the U.S. military .
To send our troops out of Iraq and into Afghanistan would be a near - perfect example of going from the frying pan into the fire .
There is reason to believe some of our top military commanders privately share this view .
And so does a broad and growing swath of your party and your supporters .
True , the United States is the world ’s greatest power  but so was the British Empire a century ago when it tried to pacify the warlords and tribes of Afghanistan , only to be forced out after excruciating losses .
For that matter , the Soviet Union was also a superpower when it poured some 100,000 troops into Afghanistan in 1979 .
They limped home , broken and defeated , a decade later , having helped pave the way for the collapse of the Soviet Union .
It is logical to conclude that our massive military dominance and supposedly good motives should let us work our will in Afghanistan .
But logic does not always prevail in South Asia .
With belligerent Afghan warlords sitting atop each mountain glowering at one another , the one factor that could unite them is the invasion of their country by a foreign power , whether British , Russian or American .
I have believed for some time that military power is no solution to terrorism .
The hatred of U.S. policies in the Middle East  our occupation of Iraq , our backing for repressive regimes such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia , our support of Israel  that drives the terrorist impulse against us would better be resolved by ending our military presence throughout the arc of conflict .
This means a prudent , carefully directed withdrawal of our troops from Iraq , Afghanistan , Saudi Arabia , Qatar and elsewhere .
We also need to close down the imposing U.S. military bases in this section of the globe , which do so little to expand our security and so much to stoke local resentment .
We cannot evade this reckoning .
The British thought they could extend their control over Iraq even while pulling out their ground forces by creating a string of bases in remote parts of the country , away from the observation of most Iraqis .
It did n’t work .
No people that desires independence and self - determination wishes to have another nation ’s military bases in its country .
In 1776 , remember , 13 little colonies drove the mighty British Empire from American soil .
In 2003 , the Bush administration ordered an invasion of Iraq , supposedly to reduce terrorism .
But six years later , there is more terrorism and civil strife in Iraq , not less .
The same outcome may occur in Afghanistan if we make it the next American military conflict .
Mr. President , the bright promise of your brilliant campaign for the White House and the high hopes of the millions who thronged the Mall on Tuesday to watch you be sworn in could easily be lost in the mountains and wastelands of Afghanistan .
The Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz has estimated that the war in Iraq will have a total cost of more than $ 3 trillion .
That war has clearly weakened our economy and our armed forces even as it has made the national debt soar .
The Bush administration committed itself to Iraq before the recession .
Today , with our economy teetering , does the Obama administration believe that it is time for yet another costly war in yet another Muslim country ?
I ’m aware that some of my fellow Americans regard me as too idealistic .
But sometimes idealism is the best realism .
And at a minimum , realism and idealism need not be contradictory .
The invasion and occupation of Iraq has not only angered Iraqis who have lost family members , neighbors or homes ; it has also increased the level of anger throughout the Muslim world and thrown up obstacles to our political leadership in that deeply important part of the planet .
Like you , Mr. President , I do n’t oppose all wars .
I risked my life in World War II to protect our country against genuine danger .
But it is the vivid memory of my fellow airmen being shot out of the sky on all sides of me in a war that I believe we had to fight that makes me cautious about sending our youth into needless conflicts that weaken us at home and abroad , and may even weaken us in the eyes of God .
As you have noted , Mr. President , we take pride in our soldiers who conduct themselves bravely .
But as you have also said , some of these soldiers have served two , three and even four tours in dangerous combat .
Many of them have come home with enduring brain and nerve damage and without arms and legs .
These troops need rest , rehabilitation and reunions with their families .
So let me suggest a truly audacious hope for your administration :
How about a five - year time - out on war  unless , of course , there is a genuine threat to the nation ?
During that interval , we could work with the U.N. World Food Program , plus the overseas arms of the churches , synagogues , mosques and other volunteer agencies to provide a nutritious lunch every day for every school - age child in Afghanistan and other poor countries .
Such a program is now underway in several countries approved by Congress and the United Nations , under the auspices of the George McGovern - Robert Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Act .
( Forgive the self - serving title . )
Although the measure remains painfully underfunded , with the help of other countries , we are reaching millions of children .
We could supplement these efforts with nutritional packages for low - income pregnant and nursing mothers and their infants from birth through the age of 5 , as is done here at home by WIC , the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants and Children .
Is this proposal pie - in - the - sky ?
I do n’t think so .
It ’s food in the stomachs of hungry kids .
It would draw them to school and enable them to learn and grow into better citizens .
It would cost a small fraction of warfare ’s cost , but it might well be a stronger antidote to terrorism .
There will always be time for another war .
But hunger ca n’t wait .

The Best of George McGovern
SEOUL , South Korea 
The North Korean military declared an “ all - out confrontational posture ” against South Korea on Saturday as an American scholar said North Korean officials told him they had “ weaponized ” enough plutonium for roughly four or five nuclear bombs .
American intelligence officials have previously estimated that the North had harvested enough fuel for six or more bombs , although it has never been clear whether the North constructed the weapons .
The scholar , Selig S. Harrison , said the officials had not defined what “ weaponized ” meant , but the implication was that they had built nuclear arms .
The North conducted a test of a nuclear device in 2006 , but it appeared to result in a fizzle and experts concluded the explosion was relatively small .
While the country has often claimed to possess a “ deterrent , ” this appears to be the first time it has quantified how much plutonium it says it has turned into weapons .
After the threats on Saturday , South Korea ordered its military to heighten vigilance along the heavily fortified border with North Korea , according to a spokesman for the South Korean military joint chiefs of staff .
Any student of Econ 101 knows that economists measure costs by opportunity costs , meaning everything that is given up to get something else .
Time spent interacting with the medical system could be used for other activities , like work and leisure .
Moreover , spending time getting medical care is not fun .
This time should be counted as part of the cost of health care .
Using the
American Time Use Survey
, I calculate that Americans age 15 and older collectively spent 847 million hours waiting for medical services to be provided in 2007 .
If we value all people ’s time at the average hourly wage of production and nonsupervisory workers ( $ 17.43 in 2007 ) , Americans spent the equivalent of $ 240 billion on health care in 2007 .
Put another way , omitting patients ’ time caused national health care expenditures to be undercounted by 11 % in 2007 .

Economic justice has always been a philosophical underpinning of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force .
We know that when there is an economic downturn , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people suffer the same risks as others , and then some .
The administration and many others hope this action will serve as a critical first step toward greater stability and economic recovery .
But no one is wearing rose - colored glasses ; clearly , an arduous road lies ahead .
It will likely create and save more than 3 million jobs , strengthen state safety nets , and provide for the neediest among us during this crisis .
President Obama just signed the stimulus bill , which holds promise for at least beginning to alleviate some of the hardship inflicted by the economic turmoil enveloping the country .
Beyond the myth of large incomes and large living are the real stories of our lives .
LGBT people , already vulnerable and unprotected by most anti-discrimination employment laws and marriage laws , take multiple hits as large and small employers cut jobs , community - based nonprofits are forced to eliminate services and programs , and small mom-and - mom and pop-and - pop businesses shut doors .
All of this places LGBT people at a severe disadvantage in an economic climate such as the one we are currently in .
The Task Force understands that stabilizing the economy stabilizes our opportunities -- indeed , the opportunities of all people -- to live decent lives and take care of our families .
That 's why the Task Force Action Fund has joined with other progressive organizations to support these recovery efforts .
We are working with our partners under the leadership of Americans United for Change , Campaign for America 's Future , USAction , People For the American Way , AFSCME and many others as part of the Campaign for Jobs and Economic Recovery coalition to support the president 's economic stimulus efforts .
We know how critical it is that there be an LGBT organization and voice in this coalition .
The stimulus plan signed Feb. 17 by President Obama will go far to promote the economic stability of Main Street , support working families , and bolster those who live at or below the poverty line .
As layoffs have piled up by the hundreds of thousands , state - based , federally funded programs like unemployment insurance , Medicaid , health care for low - income people , and other safety - net programs have been strained beyond capacity and are now threadbare .
This new plan will at least start to provide some much - needed relief .
This is just the beginning of a long haul back to a healthy , robust economy and society .
Over the weeks and months ahead , the Task Force will continue advocating for an economic recovery that is fair , humane and inclusive .
We will also continue advocating for passage of a fully inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act ( ENDA ) and other legislation that gives people a fair shake and fair shot at keeping our jobs .
This means working for health - care reform and improved access to affordable quality health care .
We know this must remain a core component in the president 's economic recovery plan .
LGBT people often cannot obtain health - care coverage on a partner 's plan , and even when we are eligible for partner / spouse health - care coverage , we are penalized by being taxed on the cost of the benefit .
This particularly cruel kind of economic discrimination against our community must end .
We believe a true economic recovery means that all people are given an equitable chance to thrive and contribute their full selves , talents and skills to their families , communities and country .

Of all the past Islamic philosophers / scholars , none are probably more interesting than al - Razi ( 864-925 ) .
His basic philosophy was basically that a person ’s life should be governed only by reason .
Sometimes , though , his rationale for reason went beyond what was reasonable , proposing ideas like emotion , pleasure , grieving , and bowel movements to all be irrational tendencies .
However , despite his eccentrics he was a very accomplished person .
If we were not reading about his life philosophy , we would still be reading about him in our science textbooks .
He considered himself primarily a physician , studying under the tutelage of the famed Islamic physician al - Tabari .
Among his contributions to medicine is his discovering the difference between measles and small pox .
He also wrote al - Hawi ( Liber Continens ) , which was his major work in medicine , and was translated into Latin in 1279 .
Though he primarily considered himself a physician , and was obviously a philosopher , he was also a chemist , alchemist , astronomer , grammarian , theologian , and logician .
During his lifetime , al - Razi claimed to have written over 200 books on a variety of subjects .
Regarding his philosophy , he believed everything can be viewed from a rational perspective , and all things could be overcome by reason .
He was famous for being one of the most vocal Platonists and Aristotelians in the Islamic World .
Constantly referring to the three great philosophers ( the other being Socrates ) as his “ teachers ” and “ masters ” .
Because of his views and take on theology and philosophy , al - Razi was considered a heterodox .
Often , however , you can read in his works his attempts to reconcile philosophical ideas with Islam .
His philosophical works consisted of a discussion on many topics : including morality and rationality , pleasure and pain , the nature of pleasure , the soul and the afterlife , love and friendship , and virtue and vice , among other things .
Morality and Rationality
al - Razi sees a close connection between morality and rationality .
He gives two main reasons for his view :
The first is that reason is what makes us distinctively human , and is what distinguishes us from “ beasts ” .
He argues there is an implicit notion that we have been made the way we are for a reason , and that reason was given to us by God .
Most his arguments in this respect are teleological .
I guess we could say he was a vitalist , where he saw a spark of the divine in all creation .
Reason is a means to the least painful life , and to discoveries that benefit our lives .
He argues here that reason has allowed us to understand so much of what is around us , that it should be used as a guide .
So much technological advances and so much benefits to our daily lives are due to using reason , that to go against the use of reason would be to go against the very cause of our existence and against God .
In terms of reason being a means to the least painful life , al - Razi feels we should be suppressing and controlling our passions and instincts .
He often compares the two as a dichotomy , contrasting reason with passion .
Pleasure and Pain
His take on pleasure and pain is that reason enables us to avoid pain .
Based on the pattern of dichotomization , you would think he would equate reason to pleasure .
So does this mean reason is equitable to pleasure ?
Not according to al - Razi .
Al - Razi separates the notion of pleasure and pain from reason .
So what is pleasure and pain according to al - Razi ?
He explains pleasure as a short - lived state - of - being .
A transitory state between pain and equilibrium , or as he calls it , a “ state - of - nature ” .
Al - Razi argues that what rational humans must strive for is this state - of - nature .
All other states - of - nature are irrational .
The Nature of Pleasure
al - Razi 's ultimate point about pleasure was that what he deemed “ pleasure ” was not worth pursuing .
He had two reasons .
1 . It ’s a transitory state , not permanent by its nature
2 . There ’s no pleasure without proportionate pain before hand .
Objections to al - Razi ’s reasoning was that , if his assertion is correct , than why ca n’t we go directly to pleasure from the normal state ?
Does it have to be ephemeral ?
To this objection , al - Razi seems to have three replies .
First , he argued humans become habituated to pleasure .
Sort of like a high .
We can become habituated to it , however , because it is something we constantly seek , it is not a permanent state .
Secondly , humans cannot experience pure , unmixed pleasure .
His definition of pure , unmixed pleasure was attainment of pleasure without the worry of losing the thrill .
It is a pleasure that we attain without having any worries .
An animal , he said , could attain pure , unmixed pleasure , because the animal did not have any burdens or worries of which it is aware at the time of the attainment of pleasure .
Because humans naturally have something on their mind , or have burden or worries in some form , however minor , cannot attain this pure , unmixed pleasure .
Thirdly , the human physique is n’t made for pleasure , since our bodies lose the sensation .
It naturally regresses back to the normal state .
Soul and Afterlife
On the human soul , al - Razi ’s theory was that the soul is divided into three parts : the rational soul , the choleric soul , and the appetitive soul .
According to al - Razi , all 3 aspects of the soul work together .
The concept itself is not dissimilar to the Freudian Theory on the id , ego , and superego .
Observe ; al - Razi argues that to lead a good life , the rational soul should curb the appetitive soul using the choleric soul .
The choleric soul , in turn , is the faculty that controls anger , shame , indignation , and other such emotions .
In this regard , al - Razi ’s theory of the soul involves a hierarchy of behaviours , with the appetitive soul being the most primitive , the choleric soul being the controlling aspect of the appetitive soul and the bridge between it and the rational soul .
The rational soul , in turn , is the highest , most developed part of the soul .
Love and Friendship
Regarding love and friendship , when considering his views on pleasure , it is not hard to see how al - Razi takes a negative attitude towards love .
al - Razi argues that love chooses short - term gratification and leads to long - term gain , and that you are bound to lose your love in death , if not before that .
Thus , al - Razi argues that it is better to not love so you do not endure pain .
Even familiarity he says , is in the same “ boat ” as love because of the inevitable loss that arises in the future .
This also applies to carnal love , and companionship .
So it is easy to see how al - Razi discourages friendship and love , since it is rational to him to avoid pain .
And pain includes losing a loved one , or someone you are familiar with .
Virtue and Vice
According to al - Razi , all vices are the result of obeying passion , as opposed to reason .
To avoid vice , al - Razi backtracks a little on his position on companionship , arguing that a general method of ridding oneself of it involves choosing a constant companion .
This companion is there to keep you ethical and moral , and to keep you responsible for your actions and behaviour .
This approach to ethics and morality involves character - building rather than obedience to a system of rules .
So al - Razi ’s philosophies are a composition of reason , however , reason according to al - Razi is basically a method for avoidance of pain .
However , according to al - Razi , this method for pain avoidance has allowed man to attain high levels of rationality and spirituality , and is the key to living a good life , and attaining a pure soul in the eyes of God .
Despite his own philosophy , al - Razi followed in the footsteps of Socrates , where even though he preached a consistent , almost extreme adherence to reason , he himself admitted that such a lifestyle was near impossible to practice .

For the most part , this list has offered ways to befriend white people one at a time .
However , if you want to befriend a large number of white people at the same time , the easiest way to do it is to go to jail for political reasons .
White people love political prisoners because they are individuals who have been locked up because their beliefs or their presence stands in defiance of an unjust system .
In fact , most white people would love to be locked up for their beliefs provided that they could go to a jail with private toilets , plenty of books and no rape .
Instead , white people are forced to turn those dreams of oppression into something more productive .
Specifically the belief that one day their law degree , graphic design skill , or ability to attend a concert can be used to free a political prisoner .
If you happen to be this individual , then you have no further work to do .
White people already like you and will provide for you financially in the form of book deals , commencement addresses , and documentaries .
But do not assume that these are the only people who can benefit from their time in jail .
Political prisoners make excellent choices whenever a white person asks you to name a personal hero .
If they drop an answer like “ Kurt Cobain ” or “ Toni Morrison ” you can easily trump them by offering up a name like Mumia Abu Jamal or Nelson Mandela which will show white people that you are smart , well informed , and political .
Or that you own at least one Rage Against the Machine CD .
But what if you pick the wrong political prisoner ?
Impossible .
This is because political prisoners do not exist until a famous white person has drawn attention to them .
Until that point , any person who has been locked up for their beliefs is just a regular prisoner and subsequently not worthy of graffiti stencils .
Conversely , if you ever find yourself needing to end a friendship with a white person you can simply say something like “ well , he ’s a criminal he belongs in jail .
I do n’t care what the Beastie Boys have to say about it . ”
End of friendship .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Two months after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson pulled the plug on his plan to buy troubled mortgage assets , the financial industry is pushing the government to reconsider .
Since the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , took effect in October , Treasury has spent $ 267 billion buying preferred stock in financial institutions and auto companies , the agency said Thursday .
Paulson has said the capital infusions have stabilized the financial sector .
But the economy has taken a sharp turn for the worse in recent months , as credit has become less available and companies and consumers have cut back on their spending .
Meanwhile , U.S. banks continue to hold hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage - backed securities that , if downgraded , could lead to another round of damaging writedowns .
That 's why some observers want the Treasury to return to the premise of the original bailout and move toxic assets off banks ' balance sheets .
New TARP has failed , bring back TARP classic
Leading the charge for a return to what some might refer to as " TARP classic " is SIFMA , the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association trade group that 's based in Washington .
" We need to get the markets moving again , " said Tim Ryan , SIFMA 's CEO .
" We have no problem with capital injections , but if you do capital injections without taking care of the bad assets , it just causes the problem to go into hibernation . "
Ryan is a former Treasury official and onetime director of the Resolution Trust Corp. , or RTC .
The RTC oversaw the cleanup of the savings - and - loan crisis in the early 1990s .
Ryan said the lesson he took from that experience is that the only way to make sure banks start lending again is to get rid of the bad assets .
Others share that assessment .
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in a paper issued this week that a study of financial crises over the past three decades suggests that isolating bad assets is a key to a successful response to a major market meltdown .
And the congressional panel overseeing the TARP wrote Friday in a report to Congress that events such as November 's federal bailout of Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) highlight how the toxic asset problem has continued to fester .
Citi received $ 25 billion of TARP money in October .
But despite Treasury 's insistence that banks receiving TARP funds were healthy , Citi shares promptly plunged .
That forced the government to come to its rescue for a second time in November , with a $ 20 billion preferred stock injection and a $ 306 billion loan guarantee .
" These events suggest that the marketplace assesses the assets of some banks well below Treasury 's assessment , " the panel , chaired by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren , concluded .
Of course , simply acknowledging the toxic asset problem does n't make fixing it any easier .
Critics of the original TARP questioned how the government would arrive at prices for assets that lack liquid markets , and Ryan conceded that pricing will present a challenge .
But he said the government is the only entity with the scale to solve it .
" We all know pricing is going to be difficult , " Ryan said .
" But until we know what these assets are worth and get some transactions going , we 're going to be stuck right where we are . "
Bad assets are n't going away
Brian Olasov , a managing director at law firm McKenna Long & Aldridge in Atlanta who has worked on Wall Street and in commercial real estate lending , agreed .
" The RTC was imperfect , but it played an important role in getting markets going again , " said Olasov .
" What it ended up doing was developing a pricing technology for nonperforming loans , and that 's the role the government could play again . "
Not everyone buys the RTC analogy , though .
Bill Isaac , who was the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from 1981 to 1985 , said the RTC simply replicated the FDIC 's bank - resolution process .
He said the RTC was an appropriate response to the mass bank failures of the 1980s - more than 3,000 institutions failed during that decade , he said -- but he questioned how that experience translates to the present day .
" I think the whole bit about buying assets is highly impractical , " said Isaac , now the chairman of the Secura Group bank consultancy in Sarasota , Fla .
" The pricing issues are practically overwhelming . "
A related problem stems from the uncertain health of the banks .
Markets for distressed securities are locked up , observers said .
That 's partly due to banks not wanting to sell at the prices being offered because doing so would oblige them to take additional writedowns against their capital .
" The problem is that you do n't know how deep the hole is for the banks , " said Michael Bleier , an attorney at Pittsburgh law firm Reed Smith who oversaw the 1988 restructuring of Mellon Bank , a predecessor to Bank of New York Mellon ( BK , Fortune 500 ) .
Money could be an issue too .
While $ 350 billion more in TARP funds are available to Treasury upon congressional approval , House Democrats have signaled in recent days that the toxic asset program is n't their top priority .
Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , introduced legislation Friday that calls for the Treasury to spend at least $ 50 billion starting in April to cut foreclosures .
Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services committee , said congressional leaders have been consulting closely with the Obama administration .
He also laid out additional restrictions on recipients of TARP funding and called for closer oversight of the program .
But he did not mention any plans to address toxic assets .
Whatever the priorities in Congress , the bad asset problem is n't going away .
Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney warned in a report this week that she expects downgrades of mortgage - backed securities to hit bank profits in the soon - to - be- reported fourth quarter of 2008 - and to force the banks , which have already sold hundreds of billions of dollars in stock , to raise more capital .
Despite the shifting winds in Washington and the lack of attention the toxic asset problem is currently getting , Ryan said he remains hopeful that legislators and administration officials will take appropriate action .
" We 've been talking to all the right people , and they 've been listening , " Ryan said .
" We think this new group can see the need to act . "
New York state workers rally against Paterson ’s budget cuts
By William Moore
16 January 2009
Thousands of New York state public workers rallied January 7 in Albany to oppose sweeping budget cuts and threatened layoffs contained in the budget proposal of the state ’s Democratic Governor David Paterson .
New York state public workers rallying in Albany .
While workers demonstrated outside in the cold , Paterson delivered his “ State of the State ” speech in the state capitol building , further spelling out austerity plans that were first announced in his budget presentation last month .
His proposal would make public employees and working people across the state pay for the state ’s budget deficit of over $ 15 billion .
The state of our state is perilous , ” Paterson warned .
“ We have an historic economic challenge , the gravest in nearly a century .
For several months , we have been reeling from events . ”
The theme of shared sacrifice , which permeated his earlier budget presentation , was again put forward as the key to overcoming the crisis and providing a better future .
He has ruled out , however , any increases in taxes on the states corporations or its billionaires and multi-millionaires .
The proposed budget includes $ 9.5 billion in cuts , primarily in health care , education , and a variety of social services .
And , in what is likely to be a gross understatement , the Governor predicted that 225,000 New Yorkers could lose their jobs before the crisis is over .
In addition , he has proposed dozens of new or increased regressive taxes and fees on everything from sugared soft drinks to driver ’s licenses .
Paterson ’s speech proposed a handful of paltry initiatives , including a plan to fight childhood obesity and a program to promote renewable energy .
These were far less , however , than has been the tradition in which governors have used the State of the State speech to lay out a whole range of new initiatives designed to curry favor with a range of interest groups .
Even the few new proposals that were made are likely to be negated by the effects of the budget crisis and economic downturn .
As pointed out by one of the union rally participants who spoke with the WSWS , while Paterson claims he wants to reduce childhood obesity , his budget will destroy educational and recreational programs which keep children active .
As an indication of things to come , the New York State Office of Parks , Recreation , and Historic Preservation announced two days after the speech that it would eliminate funding for the Empire State Games , the nation ’s oldest state - run Olympic - style competition .
Paterson ’s speech offered few specifics on his proposed cost - cutting measures .
Senate Minority Leader , Republican Dean Skelos , alluded to this when he said , “ I think we needed a little bit more nuts and bolts . ”
Speaker of the State Assembly , Democrat Sheldon Silver stated that “ Inevitably , there will be fewer resources for government programs that New Yorkers count on and some of the goals we have been working for and sponsoring as individual legislators , as a body , and as a state , will have to be delayed . ”
Working out the details of the State budget for the coming fiscal year will be take place roughly over the next two and a half months leading to the April 1 deadline .
Both houses of the legislature are now controlled by the Democrats , who will be responsible for the harsh attacks that are being prepared .
As Paterson spoke , workers assembled at the Times Union Center and marched up the hill in a cold rain to the front steps of the Capitol Building .
Unions represented included the Civil Service Employees Association / American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employees , the Service Employees International Union , the Public Employees Federation , District Council 37 , and the New York State Nurses Association .
They represent workers performing a range of essential government functions from health care to social services to parks and recreation .
The demonstrators chanted “ Tax the rich , not the poor ! ” , “ Wall Street got bailed out , we got sold out ! ” and “ Do n’t touch our contracts ! ”
Workers expressed anger over Paterson ’s proposal to withhold a week of their pay until retirement , saying that this amounted to a permanent loss .
The union leaders ’ brief speeches focused on threats of electoral retribution against politicians who support attacks on workers : “ We put them in , we take them out ” and “ If our jobs are at risk , their jobs are at risk . ”
The speakers urged pressure on the politicians — “ let them hear from you ” — but offered no proposals for independent struggle .
Given that the unions have slavishly supported and are fully integrated into the Democratic Party , which is leading the attacks , this rhetoric rang extremely hollow .
Paterson and a number of other governors of large state have issued a joint call to the incoming Obama administration to substantially increase the federal government ’s aid to states and municipalities as part of the proposed “ stimulus package ” .
However , even with such aid , Paterson said , “ Our situation is so dire that even the greatest assistance from the federal government , the one we are proposing here today , will still not alleviate us from the responsibility of some rather severe action . ”

They are essentially translating haskell to CUDA code .
The added semantics on the Haskell side is what is most interesting .
Does anyone know of similar projects to add higher - level constructs to a language that gets compiled to CUDA .
It 's not clear to me from this presentation what the Lava semantics have to do with it .

Juggling glasses of white wine and baggies filled with baubles , dozens of women descended on a well - appointed Orange County home this week to trade in their old golden treasures for hefty checks .
There were earrings from ex-boyfriends , ring settings with missing stones and chain bracelets from sorority sisters .
One woman brought in her husband ’s wedding ring -- from a previous marriage .
Julia Geivet , 39 , had hopes of selling an “ embarrassing ” Italian horn bauble she had owned since eighth grade and a few other small trinkets , which she thought might get her $ 30 .
“ I figured I ’d come get a little money and socialize and chat , ” said Geivet , who was recently laid off as a manager at Verizon Communications Inc .
“ It might not come out to a lot , but right now , every little bit helps . ”

She left with a check for $ 302.92 .
Gold is hot .
The precious metal soared $ 25.70 an ounce Friday to $ 1,001.80 , topping the $ 1,000 mark for the first time in nearly a year .
South African Krugerrands , American Eagles and other gold coins are in demand as people seek safe investment havens in uncertain times .
That has people digging through their drawers and jewelry boxes looking for watchbands , cuff links , chains and bracelets that can be sold to jewelers , pawnshops and other brokers to be melted down to feed the growing demand for gold coins .
The party Geivet attended at the Aliso Viejo home of Mary - Margaret Fincher is a twist on the old suburban Tupperware party .
Here , however , it ’s the guests who do the selling .

Erin Stevenson , who organized the party through her group My Gold Party CA , appraised the jewelry with assistant Richard Bartoletti as guests debated whether to wear heels or flats during pregnancy .
To test the gold , Stevenson shaved off small flecks with a whirring Dremel tool , blanketing the dark wood of the dining table with a luminous sheen .
Later , while Bartoletti peered through a magnifier attached to his eyeglasses , looking for karat stamps on the jewelry , Stevenson weeded out gold impostors with magnets and a special acidic gel .
Fincher , 34 , said the parties were popular in her hometown of Atlanta .
As the host she gets 10 % of what is paid out -- which this night was $ 4,000 .
One woman walked away with a $ 1,836.88 check .
Stevenson pays about 65 % of the market value , which works out to $ 5.56 for a gram of 8 - karat gold , rising to $ 15.47 a gram for 22 k .
She then sells the gold to a refiner for a price just under the market trading price .

She founded her company in April after losing her job as a mortgage account executive at Credit Suisse .
Business ebbs and flows with the price of gold ; right now , she ’s booking three parties a week .
Although there ’s a strong market for gold itself , there is relatively little demand for jewelry .
A recent survey by the National Jeweler Network found that 80 % of merchants reported a sales decline for the last holiday season .
That has jewelers like Josef Shamir of Joe ’s Gold and Silver in Beverly Hills doing more buying than selling these days .
He buys gold in almost any form -- tie tacks , pendants and even gold teeth .
Last fall , perhaps three customers a day would come into his store to sell gold , Shamir said .
That ’s up to about eight a day now , including an elderly woman who Thursday brought in a gold watch , chains , earrings and bejeweled rings .
She got a check for $ 813 .

“ People are looking harder in their drawers for gold , ” he said .
Shamir , 52 , says he ’s paying out about $ 100,000 a month on the gold he takes in .
Like Stevenson , he pays about 65 % of market value .
About three times a week he takes the gold to an office building in downtown Los Angeles ’ jewelry district .
Here on the seventh floor , baubles are melted down in NTR Metals ’ induction furnace and then poured , lavalike , into molds .
After being tested to determine the quality of the gold , the blocks are sent to the refinery at the company ’s Dallas headquarters to be purified .

The volume of gold the refinery company is buying is up about 20 % from a year ago , said David H. Williams , NTR ’s president of West Coast operations .
Hundreds of merchants , including pawnbrokers and jewelers , are crowding waiting rooms with gold to be melted .
“ The gold price spurs more people into action , ” Williams said .
“ There is a lot of material being submitted now because the economy is souring and the need for liquidity is enormous right now . ”
So far this year , the price of gold has risen by 13 % , while the Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled 16 % .
John March of the Superior Gold Group brokerage in Santa Monica thinks the high prices are here to stay .

“ After this year , we wo n’t see gold under $ 1,000 again , ” he said .
“ There was a time , after all , when diamonds were fairly inexpensive . ”
But others say the bonanza can’t last forever .
Precious metals , including silver and platinum , are benefiting from the panicky belief that “ everything else has been destroyed , ” said Leonard Kaplan of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston , Ill .
Kaplan says the gold market is on its way to becoming another bubble , like technology stocks in the late 1990s and housing for much of this decade .

“ Is it going to end badly ?
Yes , ” he said .
“ The question is where -- is it $ 1,200 , or $ 1,500 , or $ 1,800 ? ”
For now , however , demand appears to be growing .
The U.S. Mint shipped 92,000 1 - ounce American Eagle coins to its dealer network in January , up sharply from 22,500 in January 2008 .
On Cloverfield Boulevard in Santa Monica , Goldline International Inc. caters to investors looking to buy thousands of dollars in gold bars or coins such as the American Eagle .
Chief Executive Mark Albarian said that until late last year his staff was making about 100 sales a day with an average order of about $ 5,000 .
Now the firm is closing nearly 300 deals daily with an average order of about $ 13,000 , he said .

On Friday , total sales exceeded $ 5 million , he said .
“ A few years ago , the scene was pretty quiet , but business has pretty much tripled , ” Albarian said .
“ Most businesses worry these days about not having enough customers .
Gold businesses worry about running out of product . ”

Tips for selling your gold
Advertisement
* Before selling , get an estimate .
Certified appraisers can be found through the National Assn. of Jewelry Appraisers and the American Society of Appraisers .
* Selling for scrap means that the final price will not reflect the craftsmanship , antique value or aesthetics of the jewelry .
* The price is based on a troy ounce of 24 - karat gold , the pure form of the metal .
Divide the karat of your jewelry by 24 for the percentage purity .
For example , 18 k is 75 % pure .
* The karat stamp on jewelry should be used as a gauge , but it can be inaccurate .
For example , 12 k gold is often mismarked as 14k .

* Old jewelry can be sold at consignment shops or at websites such as EBay and Craigslist .
Jewelry stores tend to offer better prices than pawnshops and most mail - in operations .

With the metabolism of a White House set by its occupant , Obama 's team is preparing for a return to long nights and heavy weekend shifts .
Obama returns night - owl presidency
Barack Obama is bringing back the night - owl presidency .
With the metabolism of a White House set by its occupant , Obama 's team is preparing for a return to long nights , heavy weekend shifts – and a boss who will venture into Washington far more than the place 's current resident .
Advertisement
It ’s a throwback to Bill Clinton ’s cramming - for - an - exam style , a shift from George W. Bush ’s early - bird routine .
Aides expect the workload to be so intense , at least for the early months , that they ’re trying to formalize ways to help staffers stay in touch with spouses and kids – with ideas under consideration that include inviting family members into the White House for casual after - hours meals .
Another possibility : urging aides to go home for dinner , as long as they come back to finish the night .
Obama aides say there are no specifics so far , but hinted that staffers ' children may be seeing the inside of the White House like never before – as way to stay in touch with Mom or Dad .
“ Family is very important to the Obamas and while the challenges ahead will require long hours , hard work and sacrifice for everyone in the incoming administration they hope to make the White House a place that is open and welcoming to the families of White House employees , ” said Jen Psaki , an Obama spokeswoman .
Bush famously arrives at the Oval Office by dawn , leaves by 6 p.m. and goes to bed by 10 p.m.
Dinners out are as rare as a lunar eclipse .
Obama , by contrast , stays up late .
He holds conference calls with senior staff as late as 11 p.m. , and often reads and writes past midnight .
Ahead of the Democratic National Convention , he spent consecutive nights holed up in a Chicago hotel room , working on his speech until 2 a.m .
And in the 10 days alone , Obama stopped by a Senate cocktail party , dined out with foreign policy types , and made a visit Saturday to Ben ’s Chili Bowl , a Washington institution and pillar in the African - American community .
He stayed out until 9:30 p.m. Tuesday at a dinner with conservative columnists .
“ The expectation is that it will be a lot of hours , and hours we were used to working before the transition , ” one Obama aide said .
“ Everybody is comfortable with that .
There is an expectation that the first few months will set the tone . ”
Michelle Obama often speaks of using her new role as First Lady to highlight the struggles of balancing work and family .
But she need look no further than her husband ’s White House , where not just the incoming president – a father of two daughters – will feel torn .
The senior ranks include several parents of young children , including incoming chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , press secretary Robert Gibbs , and Jackie Norris , chief of staff to the First Lady .
In his attempt to maintain balance , Obama would routinely divert his lumbering campaign apparatus back to Chicago simply to be present for important events : picking out a Christmas tree , taking the girls to go trick - or - treating on Halloween , attending a dance recital .
His staff would take their own timeouts , too .
Gibbs flew home less than five days before the election so he could spend Halloween with his son .
“ There is a great deal of respect and importance for being there for your children , ” the aide said .
Still , the White House will no doubt foster an unforgiving pace , particularly now that late nights may be more normal than they were under Bush .
Emanuel , for example , does n’t think twice about dialing up his staff as early as 6 a.m .
He schmoozes after work at Washington hot spots , and emails late into the night .
Bush and his top aides prided themselves on promoting a family - friendly White House , as much as 12 - hour days and a Blackberry - wired existence can count as healthy .
The first White House chief of staff , Andy Card , initially started the senior staff meetings at 6:30 a.m .
But when several of the working moms told Bush the time was too early , Card moved it to 7 a.m .
Parents could cut out for family events .
The work day ends between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. , although they were expected to be available by Blackberry .
And staff even made time for afternoon workouts at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building three days a week , a break in the work day that Bush “ highly endorsed , ” said Mary Matalin , a former counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney .
“ The working culture was mature , ” Matalin , a mother of two daughters , said in an email .
“ The culture of staying late just to stay late was discouraged , even frowned upon .
The operating principle was to pace yourself to be able to provide peak performance . ”
" Both the president and vice president insisted we try to have integrated family lives , " Matalin said .
" Balance is not possible in a White House job , but if you had a family deal , you went and were never remotely made to feel awkward about it . "
Karen Hughes , a longtime adviser and close confidant to Bush , established what she called a “ Midweek Moment . ”
She would try to leave the office early – at 5:30 p.m. – once a week so she could spend time with her teenage son , who was usually sleeping when she left in the morning and in bed when she got home .
“ I made it half the time , ” Hughes said of her “ Midweek Moment . ”
Even with the family - friendly mantra , both Matalin and Hughes stayed in the White House for less than two years .
Like the Obama team , they arrived in Washington after an extended and grueling presidential campaign that makes burnout all the more likely .
“ It is very difficult to meet your responsibilities to both your family and job , ” Hughes said .
The Clinton White House , on the other hand , offered no pretense of normalcy .
“ I fully admit that we may have overdone it , ” said Michael Feldman , a partner at The Glover Park Group who served in the White House for eight years as an adviser to Vice President Al Gore .
“ We took the campaign mentality directly into the White House . …
It was a direct extension of the campaign .
People worked literally around the clock and slept in their offices .
There never seemed to be enough hours . ”
Clinton set the tone , staying in the Oval Office until 10 p.m .
That meant others felt like they could n’t leave until he did .
Hughes said the Obama White House might want to consider shift work – a day shift and a night shift – to lighten the load .
“ You do n’t want to burn people out , ” Hughes said .
“ You do n’t want them to become so busy that they ca n’t function to their maximum potential .
After 12 - or 14 - hour days , I was mentally shot .
It was hard to do anything effectively . ”

Tony Blair has been explaining his decision to delay converting to Roman Catholicism until after he had resigned as prime minister .
He said it would have been a " palaver " if he had acted while in office .
In a BBC interview , Mr Blair denied suggestions he had delayed the decision out of fear it would be harder to be prime minister as a Roman Catholic .
He attended Mass for 25 years and brought up his children as Catholics before his conversion in 2007 .
Mr Blair said he feared talking about his religious beliefs during his time in Downing Street would lead to people dismissing him as a " nutter " .
But Mr Blair said he regretted he had not been more adventurous in referring to his own faith while he was prime minister .
The comments were made in an interview for a BBC1 programme called Christmas Voices , broadcast on Sunday .
Christian values Mr Blair argued some people would have found it comforting to think the person leading them had some sense of " spiritual value " .
He said : " It 's sad in a way that people feel you can't talk about something that is important to who you are .
" Maybe I became too sensitive to that or too cautious about it , but I just came to the conclusion that if I started talking about God it was going to be difficult . "
But the BBC 's religious correspondent Robert Pigott said some Roman Catholics have suggested the influence of Christian values had diminished sharply during his term of office .
Some even suggested Mr Blair 's voting record had often gone against the Church 's teaching , he added .

I present you today with both sides of the question of whether or not there is any life left in the small - government philosophy .
[ Thanks to Crosstitch.com for the cross stitch pattern photo .
]
We have the optimist 's viewpoint expressed by Richard A. Viguerie in today 's LA Times article With no sense of humor whatsoever , Mr. Viguerie , author of , expresses his hope that someone with a Reagan touch can revive our somnolent but innate comprehension of the original intent of the Constitution 's Founding Fathers .
On the other side , and with his usual unique comic flare , we have the pessimist view of P.J. O'Rourke in this Cato article ( also published at the Weekly Standard ) .
His humor turns quite black at the end .
The title says it all : " We Blew It .
" These two writers are so eloquent that I wo n't excerpt them or add superfluous comment here .
You 'll enjoy the reads .
I once asked another proponent of small government , Robert Higgs of the Independent Institute , how he managed to find the courage to continue the battle for the idea of small government .
He replied that he had no hope whatsoever for winning the war ; but that his motive has become that of " bearing witness " through public condemnation of those who strip us of our liberties , whether anyone cared to take note or not .
Honorably said , and I concur .
At the moment , as the sky grows prematurely dark at 5:00 p.m. on a December afternoon , I feel the same depressing lack of hope .
But tomorrow I will wake up to daylight with enough energy to toll the bell once more .

The South Pole continues to draw adventurers
Three Canadian men have claimed a new record for the fastest trek across Antarctica to the South Pole .
Ray Zahab , Kevin Vallely and Richard Weber said they had completed the 1,130 km ( 700 miles ) journey in 33 days , 23 hours and 30 minutes .
They say they suffered white - out but survived on a high - calorie diet of deep - fried bacon , cheese and butter .
The Canadians ' journey took them from Hercules Inlet on Antarctica 's Ronne Ice Shelf to the South Pole .
" If you took a cloud , wrapped it around your head and then duct - taped it , that 's what a white - out is like , " Mr Zahab , 39 , told The Associated Press by satellite phone from Antarctica .
Dying for pizza
He had previously run across the Sahara desert but told reporters his feet were more worn out by his latest adventure .
Tom Sjogren , founder of ExplorersWeb.com , a New York - based Web site that compiles statistics on adventurers ' feats , said the men beat the previous record of 39 days , 7 hours and 49 minutes , which was set by American Todd Carmichael just last month .
The Canadian trio used their satellite phone to post photos and podcasts of their journey as they did it .
They pulled 170 - lb ( 77 - kg ) sleds of equipment , with Mr Zahab travelling on foot and on snowshoes while the other two men skied .
At night , they slept in a tent .
They endured altitude sickness , vertigo and massive , painful blisters .
They kept themselves fuelled with a 7,000 - calorie - a - day diet of deep - fried bacon , cheese and huge chunks of butter .
" I'm dying for some pizza , " said Mr Zahab , who added he was too excited to sleep .
Fred Phelps and his daughter have been banned from entering the UK A threatened mass protest by an anti-gay US church failed to materialise when only one demonstrator turned up .
Fred Phelps and his daughter Shirley Phelps - Roper from the Westboro Baptist Church were banned from entering the UK to protest against a play in Hampshire .
They had urged a picket of Queen Mary 's College in Basingstoke over the staging of The Laramie Project , a play about a man killed for being gay .
But only one protester arrived and was heckled away by counter - demonstrators .
Play supporter Blake West was among about 50 students who protested against Westboro church outside the college on Friday .
' Great wrath '
He said : " They are doing something completely ridiculous which has very flawed and inaccurate foundations .
" I am just standing up for my own sexual orientation .
" Their views will not be tolerated and all of us have proved that here tonight . "
Westboro preacher Mrs Phelps - Roper had said the decision to ban her and her father from entering the UK would " bring great wrath upon your heads " .
She had warned that other members of the church , who are not as well known to the authorities , would be trying to get into the UK to protest but that failed to happen .
The church 's website advertised the picket , proclaiming : " In merry old England they plan to further enrage the living God by putting on the farce known commonly as The Laramie Project .
" We will picket them , and see if they actually believe those lies they tell about how tolerant and accepting Brits are . "
Members of the group - based in Topeka , Kansas - have denounced homosexuality for years and have in the past targeted the funerals of Aids victims .
In 2007 , the church was told to pay $ 10.9 m ( £ 5.2 m ) after its members cheered a soldier 's death as " punishment " for US tolerance of homosexuality .

Friends , I may adore you but I have had just about enough of this cold , windy and snow - free excuse for a New York City winter and I ’m leaving you .
For a week .
Maybe more , I ’m not making any promises of a swift return .
I seem to not be the only one with the Caribbean Islands on my brain , because I had barely cracked the cover of the March Gourmet when I saw this lime coconut cake recipe , remembered both the leftover coconut and a bag of withering key limes I had never used in the fridge and knew immediately that this would be the only thing that would get me through the remaining hours between now and that beachfront resort .
Tiny violins , please .
As with previous vacations , you wo n’t have to miss me at all because I ’ve hidden all sorts of posts that will magically pop up over the week that I am gone ; the only thing they ’ll lack is my comment responses and clarifications .
But , hopefully all of the recipes I am leaving you with are clear - cut enough that there should be very few needed .
( Are n’t those famous last words ? )
And when I get back — dare I say I am actually looking forward to it ? — there is so much good stuff ahead .
I can think of at least three things that are too cool not to discuss going on this spring — four , if you consider what awesome company I ’m going to be in on this trip — but we ’ll get to that in due time .
For now , I ’ll be collecting my freckles and frosty mai tais , and I plan to forget the internet ever existed .
Recipe Index !
Aaat laaast …
I have a recipe index that is largely up to date .
Oh , I always had one but at last count it was about 6 months out of date and I would rather have stuck pins under my fingernails than even considered making up for that lost time .
Instead , I have a new , self - updating system and I love it .
I am basking in the glow of a recipe page that ’s 90 percent functional .
How far we ’ve come !
[ Of course , I have made the rather awkward realization that a ton of posts have been creatively mis-tagged and I ’m slowly going through them .
Yes I see them , no you do n’t need to tell me about all the ones I have n’t gotten to , I will fix them all — after vacation .
I will hopefully sound less easily exasperated by then too ! ]

Key Lime Coconut Cake
Gourmet , March 2009
I am sure you could use standard limes in here , but if you can find them , Key limes are the juiciest ( especially for their size ) and the tastiest .
I plan to put a wedge of one in every frosty beach cocktail .
Serves 8 , but I ’d argue 16 , especially if in squares
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
1 stick unsalted butter , softened
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
1 tablespoon grated Key lime zest
2 large eggs
1 3/4 cups self - rising flour *
3/4 cup whole milk
1/4 cup fresh Key lime juice , divided
1 cup confectioners sugar
1 tablespoon rum ( optional )
Preheat oven to 350 °F with rack in middle .
Generously butter an 8 - by 8 - inch square or 9 - by 2 - inch round cake pan and line bottom with a round of parchment paper .
Toast coconut in a small baking pan in oven , stirring once or twice , until golden , 8 to 12 minutes .
Cool .
Leave oven on .
Beat together butter , granulated sugar , and zest with an electric mixer until fluffy .
Beat in eggs one at a time .
Stir together flour and 1/2 cup coconut ( reserve remainder for topping ) .
Stir together milk and 2 tablespoons lime juice .
At low speed , mix flour and milk mixtures into egg mixture alternately in batches , beginning and ending with flour .
Spoon batter into pan and smooth top .
Bake until golden and a wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean , 40 to 45 minutes .
Cool to warm , then turn out of pan and discard parchment .
Whisk together confectioners sugar , remaining 2 tablespoons lime juice , and rum ( if using ) and pour over cake .
Sprinkle with remaining coconut .
* Make your own :
You can make your own self - rising flour — I did , when I realized I had self - rising flour in the pantry but my last known use of it was nearly three years ago .
Unfortunately , there are many recipes out there and they do n’t all agree .
The most common one has you add for each cup of flour 1 /2 teaspoon of salt and 1 1 / 2 teaspoons baking powder but some also suggest 1 teaspoon baking powder instead .
I ’m going to suggest that you use the 1 teaspoon level because I used the higher one and my cake sunk ever so slightly in the center , a suggestion that it had too much leavening in it .
So :
For every cup of flour , add a 1 / 2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of baking powder , whisk together very well and sift the mixture .
Measure your self - rising flour from there .

When 91 - year - old Irvin Lafferty was diagnosed with severe blockage of his heart valve — hardening that is formally known as aortic valve stenosis — open - heart surgery was out of the question .
He ’d already survived quadruple bypass while in his 50s , and having lived almost a century , Lafferty was n’t a good candidate for heart surgery for many reasons .
His local cardiologist referred him to surgical and interventional specialists at Chicago ’s Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute of Northwestern Memorial Hospital .
And , on January 21 , 2009 , Lafferty became the first patient in Illinois to receive a prosthetic heart valve through a procedure known as transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation , which combines catheterization technology and traditional surgery , allowing doctors to implant a new heart valve in place of Lafferty ’s diseased valve while his heart remained beating .
“ Traditional open - heart surgery is a very safe and effective way to replace diseased heart valves , but for many patients bypass surgery is not a viable option ” says Patrick M. McCarthy , MD , Northwestern Memorial ’s chief of cardiothoracic surgery and co-director of its Bluhm Institute and a Heller - Sacks professor of surgery at Northwestern University ’s Feinberg School of Medicine .
“ By utilizing the percutaneous technique — meaning surgery is not required — we are able to greatly reduce risk for these patients .
We see percutaneous valve repair as not only having a great impact upon how high - risk patients are treated , but in how heart valve disease is treated period , in the U.S. and around the world . ”
McCarthy is a co-principal investigator for the clinical trial that provided Lafferty ’s new heart valve , which is formally referred to as the Placement of AoRtic TraNscathetER Valve , or PARTNER .
The Bluhm Institute is among the trial ’s pioneering sites .
McCarthy says the procedure builds upon a routine catheter - based procedure , the balloon aortic valvuloplasty .
“ Balloon aortic valvuloplasty has been traditionally offered as a palliative therapy for patients who were not candidates for aortic valve surgery , ” said the hospital ’s Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Charles J. Davidson , MD , who is also a co-principal investigator for the trial and a professor of medicine at Northwestern University ’s Feinberg School of Medicine .
“ This particular technique is a more durable treatment than balloon valvuloplasty and is potentially a breakthrough for treating high - risk patients . ”
Medical experts estimate every year nearly 200,000 people in the U.S. need new heart valves .
Yet over half of them do not receive them primarily due to frailty , one of the most common reasons for exclusion from traditional open - heart surgery .
“ Surgery becomes far too risky when patients are conditionally weak or frail , ” says Chris Malaisrie MD , a Northwestern Memorial cardiac surgeon and member of the site team evaluating this new procedure .
“ The goal is to replace diseased valve at minimal risk to these patients — many of whom have very limited therapeutic options .
Aortic valve replacement is one of few therapies offering both symptomatic relief and improved long - term survival . ”
During insertion , the artificial valve remains collapsed until it reaches its destination .
It is then expanded and released in place of diseased aortic heart valves .
The prosthesis is made of stainless steel and biological leaflets that help direct the flow of blood in the heart .
It is permanent and integrates an expandable stent that holds the valve in its intended position .
Northwestern Memorial utilizes both the transfemoral ( through the groin ) and transapical ( through the ribs ) approaches .
Implantation occurs in a hybrid operating room suite that incorporates elements of both a traditional OR and catheterization laboratory .
Fund - raising is a time - and energy - consuming necessity for those striving to collect money for a cause .
One of the most common ways to raise funds is to organize a charity dinner .
Proceeds from entrance tickets , donations and event activities can all be funneled to the worthwhile cause that you are endeavoring to champion .
Done right , a charity dinner can do more than just raise money -- it can raise much - needed awareness for a particular cause .
Here are a few helpful tips for organizing this worthwhile event .
Zero in on your cause .
This may seem like an unnecessary step , but the truth is that a cause that is defined too generally can leave less of an impact on your dinner 's participants .
For example , if your charity efforts are geared towards poverty , try defining a specific beneficiary to whom the event will be dedicated -- like those stricken by poverty in one specific city or country .
Select a venue .
This has a lot to do with the funds available to you .
For example , do you have the cash to rent a ballroom at the nicest hotel in town , hoping to attract the city 's high rollers ?
Or are your funds so limited that you have to hold your dinner in someone 's backyard ?
Both could work .
Create an exciting program .
Usually this means lining up speakers , perhaps a musical number , if appropriate , and activities aimed at raising additional funds on top of the entrance fee .
Contact speakers who are well - connected with the cause or are noted authorities on the issue and invite them to speak .
Complement your program with some sort of visual exhibit .
This can be a gallery of photos or paintings connected to your dinner 's cause , a display made up of an amalgam of objects that help illustrate the need for donations , or something else artsy or informative that catches attendees ' attention and motivates them to make additional donations .
Decide on a meal .
A buffet might be the easiest option if you are expecting a large turnout , though separate plates with servers are easy to arrange if you are holding your event in a hotel or conference center .
Send out invitations .
Invite everyone you can , from friends and family to members of organizations and groups in the area that might be interested or otherwise connected to the cause .
Additionally , print out fliers and post them where appropriate with the proper contact and event information , and , if you have the funds , consider placing a large colorful ad in the local paper .
In the case of the latter , try meeting with the paper 's editor and explain the dinner 's cause , then request one free ad placement -- it happens .
The New York Times and the Gaza crisis : Israeli war propaganda in the guise of news
By Tom Eley
13 January 2009
The New York Times is the leading media organ of US liberalism and is closely aligned to the Democratic Party .
In recent days it has planted a series of propaganda pieces disguised as news articles , which aim to justify Israel ’s war crimes in Gaza .
These articles appear in the context of worldwide revulsion at the criminal methods Israel is using in the densely populated Gaza strip , home to 1.4 million people .
So far , more than 900 Palestinians have been killed , about half of them civilians , and thousands more have been wounded in an Israeli air , sea and ground assault that is utilizing advanced weapons supplied by the United States against a virtually defenseless population .
On January 9 , the New York Times published a brief article on its front page , “ Fighter Sees His Paradise in Gaza ’s Pain , ” written by Taghreed El - Khodary , reporting from Gaza .
The article describes a horrific scene of suffering and death in the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City .
But it focuses on a wounded fighter for Islamic Jihad , who is depicted as welcoming the killing of Palestinian civilians as a form of martyrdom and a boon to his organization ’s aims .
According to El - Khodary , this shows “ the way ordinary people are squeezed between suicidal fighters and a military behemoth . ”
What cynicism !
The article feigns sympathy for the Palestinian victims of Israeli mass murder in order to suggest that any resistance to the perpetrators is illegitimate .
The population of Gaza is not being “ squeezed ” between Israel and those who are fighting its onslaught .
As more and more evidence makes clear , the Palestinians are the target — not the “ collateral damage ” — of a campaign of bloodletting and collective punishment designed to terrorize the population .
In a January 11 article by Steven Erlanger entitled “ A Gaza War Full of Traps and Trickery , ” the Times offers a more elaborate defense of the war crimes Israel has already perpetrated — and others that will follow .
The article ’s first full paragraph lays out the argument : “ Hamas , with training from Iran and Hezbollah , has used the last two years to turn Gaza into a deadly maze of tunnels , booby traps and sophisticated roadside bombs .
Weapons are hidden in mosques , schoolyards and civilian houses , and the leadership ’s war room is a bunker beneath Gaza ’s largest hospital , Israeli intelligence officials say . ”
( Emphasis added . )
The Times serves up , as if it were uncontestable fact , Israel ’s unsubstantiated claims that the “ mosques , schoolyards , and civilian houses ” which it continues to destroy — killing hundreds of civilians in the process — double as weapons stores , and therefore deserve to be destroyed , civilian casualties notwithstanding .
Even were Israel ’s assertions of weapons stores true , from the standpoint of international law , not to mention an elementary respect for human life , this would not justify the deliberate bombing of civilian targets .
Where , in any case , are the Palestinians supposed to place their weapons ?
Perhaps Erlanger thinks they should be stored in a clearly labeled warehouse .
Or , more to the point , that the Palestinians should be totally and permanently disarmed .
Erlanger ’s claim that the Gaza leadership is hiding in a “ bunker beneath Gaza ’s largest hospital ” is especially chilling .
He is all but justifying , a priori , the bombing of the hospital , where the maimed and dying are receiving desperately inadequate care due to Israel ’s blockade and its targeting of ambulances , medical supplies and personnel .
Do Erlanger ’s unnamed sources in “ Israeli intelligence ” already have plans to destroy the hospital ?
The article similarly presents as fact Israeli claims that Hamas has “ training from Iran and Hezbollah . ”
The newspaper chooses not to point out that the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) possess some of the most deadly military hardware in the world , courtesy of $ 3 billion in annual funding from Washington .
Erlanger then notes that Hamas militants are “ unwilling to … come into the open ” and are “ fighting in civilian clothes ; even the police have been ordered to take off their uniforms . ”
Here the implicit argument is that the IDF ’s killing of civilians , as well as its mass arrest of the male portion of the Palestinian population , to which Erlanger refers in passing , is justified because Palestinian fighters do not don uniforms and present themselves to the Israelis to be executed .
Once again , the author fails to note that in the first hours of the Israeli attack , all Gazans wearing the uniforms of police or security personnel were targeted by missiles and bombs .
To bolster the Israeli lie that Hamas is responsible for the mounting toll of death and destruction in Gaza because it uses civilians as “ human shields , ” Erlanger cites “ an Israeli journalist embedded with Israeli troops ” to claim that “ in one apartment building in Zeitoun , in northern Gaza , Hamas set an inventive , deadly trap , ” placing “ a mannequin in the hallway off the building ’s main entrance . ”
He continues : “ They hoped to draw fire from Israeli soldiers who might , through the blur of night vision goggles and split - second decisions , mistake the figure for a fighter .
The mannequin was rigged to explode and bring down the building . ”
Leaving aside the credibility of Erlanger ’s source , what is the implication of this tale ?
Clearly , that Hamas is deliberately luring Israeli soldiers into blowing up apartment buildings and unwittingly causing civilian casualties .
The author then identifies the Israeli journalist as Ron Ben - Yishai , “ a senior military correspondent for the newspaper Yediot Aharonot . ”
Erlanger does not let on that Ron Ben - Yishai is a right - wing journalist with longstanding ties to the IDF and the Likud Party .
The author ’s choice of Zeitoun is no accident .
In the neighborhood south of Gaza City , the IDF rounded up an extended family , forced it into a building at gun point and fired missiles on the building , killing at least 70 people — all civilians , mostly women and children .
Then , for four days , the Israelis refused to allow the International Red Cross access to the neighborhood and stood by , offering no assistance to the dying .
As aid workers finally made their way to the neighborhood during Israel ’s three - hour pause in bombardment , they found unspeakable scenes of human suffering , including four young children , half - dead , clinging to the corpses of their mothers ( see : Gaza : The massacre in Zeitoun )
Erlanger continues : “ Israeli officials say that they are obeying the rules of war and trying hard not to hurt noncombatants but that Hamas is using civilians as human shields in the expectation that Israel will try to avoid killing them .
“ Israeli press officers call the tactics of Hamas cynical , illegal and inhumane ; even Israel ’s critics agree that Hamas ’s regular use of rockets to fire at civilians in Israel , and its use of civilians as shields in Gaza , are also violations of the rules of war . ”
In reference to the now infamous IDF bombing of a schoolhouse and UN refuge in Jabalya , which killed more than 40 people , Erlanger writes : “ The Israelis said they returned fire in response to mortar shells fired at Israeli troops [ claims that have been rejected outright by the UN and other observers ] .
Such an action is legal … ”
He goes on to hedge somewhat his legal brief for this particular war crime , adding that “ there are questions about whether the force used was proportional under the laws of war , given the danger to noncombatants . ”
In fact , under international law , what the IDF did would be a crime even if its story about mortar shells were true , because such a grossly disproportionate response is illegal .
On the same day as Erlanger ’s article , the Times ’ public editor , Clark Hoyt , wrote a column citing complaints of biased reporting from both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian readers .
Noting in passing , without comment or criticism , Israeli censorship of the war , including a total ban on reporters entering Gaza , he concluded with a complacent and self - satisfied : “ The Times … has tried its best to do a fair , balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded . ”
The New York Times ’ dishonest and cynical defense of Israel ’s slaughter in Gaza is a measure of its own moral and political degeneration and that of US liberalism as a whole .
It underscores the complicity of the entire American media , liberal and conservative , in war crimes .
Surgeons in England and Wales will be ordered today to carry out a safety checklist before every operation they perform , after a study showed it cut surgical deaths and complications by a third .
Described as the biggest clinical innovation in 30 years , the checklist is based on a set of seemingly banal questions but is set to become as essential to daily medicine as the stethoscope .
In Britain alone , the new procedure could save hundreds of lives a year and 80,000 complications .
A pilot study run in a London hospital , St Mary 's in Paddington , and seven others around the world , has shown that using the checklist cut the death rate following surgery from 1.5 per cent to 0.8 per cent ( 47 per cent ) and the complication rate from 11 per cent to 7 per cent ( 36 per cent ) .
There was no distinction between hospitals in richer and poorer countries on complications , but richer countries saw a smaller decline in deaths of about a third ( though this was not statistically significant ) .

With an estimated 234 million operations performed yearly around the world , and eight million in Britain – one for every eight people in the population – that translates to millions of lives saved .
The results of the study , organised by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , are published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Surgeons and nurses run through a series of basic safety checks before each operation , similar to those made by pilots before take - off .
The checks include asking :
Is this the right patient ?
Is this the right limb ?
Has the patient had the right drugs ?
Britain's National Patient Safety Agency ( NPSA ) issued an alert today to all hospitals and clinics where surgery is performed , setting a deadline for implementation of the checklist by February 2010 .
Kevin Cleary , the medical director of the NPSA , said : " It is very difficult for the general public to believe that these checks are not being made already .
It is about making them every time , and not assuming that someone else is making them . "
The latest figures for Britain show that there were 129,419 surgical incidents in 2007 when patients were put at risk , more than 1,000 of which resulted in severe harm and 271 in death .
One patient a day was listed for the wrong operation .
Sir Liam Donaldson , the Government 's chief medical officer , highlighted in his annual report last year 14 cases in which patients undergoing brain surgery had had burr holes drilled on the wrong side of the head .
More than one operation a month was carried out on the wrong site in 2007 .
Lord Darzi , a Health minister and surgeon at St Mary 's who chaired the WHO group that devised the 19 - item checklist , said that its implementation across the country was " a dream come true " .
He added : " It was in front of us – we all travel and it is in every [ aircraft ] cockpit .
Surgery has become vastly more complex and susceptible to errors .
Having a system that reminds the whole team of the 19 items is essential .
No single individual , however bright , could ensure it happens every time . "
About 20,000 patients die each year following surgery , but it is not known how many are preventable .
An estimated 2,000 patients die as a result of errors following all forms of treatment and an inquiry by the National Audit Office in 2005 concluded that half could have been avoided if staff had learnt the lessons of previous incidents .
Atul Gawande , an American surgeon and associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health , who led the study , said work was under way on further checklists for maternity and childbirth ( to be published this year ) , heart disease , pneumonia , HIV and mental health .
" It is one of those simple , unbelievably powerful ideas that will have an impact across medicine .
Surgeons had assumed that doing well for patients was mostly about their skill .
But there is now too much technology and too many patients for one person to deal with . "
He added : " When I talk to clinicians , they say : 'we already do this stuff . '
The answer is : we are good at doing it most of the time , but we are not good at doing it all the time .
We found some members of the team felt they were such low agents , they only felt responsible for their corner .
Being allowed to say who they were [ one item on the checklist ] and hear the surgeon say what he expected made them feel part of the team .
When you are not given a voice you turn your brain off . "
Peter Walsh , chief executive of the charity Action against Medical Accidents , said there was concern about how surgeons would react to the checklist .
" People are on tenterhooks .
Some surgeons say that checklists de-professionalise them , turning them into automatons who do n't think .
But it is only a tool .
It has to be used with professional judgement , " he argued .
Donald Berwick , the president of the US Institute for Healthcare Improvement , said of the innovation : " I can not recall a clinical care innovation in the past 30 years that has shown results of the magnitude demonstrated by the surgical checklist . "
If Open Source Does n't Succeed , Do n't Blame the Teachers
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 27 , 2009
We talk a lot at OStatic about open source solutions in the classroom .
In fact , just yesterday Kristin pointed to a recent article from the BBC discussing the strengths of open source software and the complexities associated with deploying it in an educational environment .
According to the BBC , " Good teachers will always be looking to move forward but they are so busy that they are often conservative . "
Datamation 's Matt Hartley has a completely different take on why open source can't get a foothold in American classrooms , and he claims it 's largely because teachers and school IT professionals are " misinformation junkies . "
In a rather vitriolic rant against the nation 's teachers and school IT departments , Hartley roundly dismisses the fact that there are plenty of educators who openly advocate open source in the classroom .
Instead , he complains , " Seems to me that [ it ] is not just individuals in the proprietary software realm who have no idea how open source software works .
Apparently the group of misinformation junkies now includes teachers as well . "
Then Hartley turns on IT professionals and claims " The problem is that Linux users themselves are seen as a rogue element in a world maintained by Microsoft certified administrators .
These admins , often working off of their ' vast Linux experience ' derived from a twenty minute [ sic ] adventure into some random Linux distro from a few years ago , are choosing to contribute to the misinformation already in existence . "
Perhaps Hartley needs to get to the root of the issue here , instead of lopping off the first head he sees .
In general , IT and hardware decisions are made at the district level and , in some cases , higher .
The poor soul in the high school server room has no more input about the platforms being used than my great - aunt Fanny .
The teachers ?
Even less .
It 's the suit - wearing administrators sitting in air - conditioned offices who drop in for a meeting between rounds of golf that make the decisions that are foisted on local schools .
When school administrators are handed incentive - laden hardware and software proposals from slick marketing folks promising to put a laptop in the hands of every student , it 's not surprising that Microsoft and Apple win the race almost every time .
So , before anyone blames IT admins or teachers for a lack of experience or willingness to use open source solutions , it 's important to make sure accusations are flung in the right direction .
Hartley goes on to say , " With the current educational budget that U.S. schools have at their disposal , it seems like there must be plenty of money to spend on software and hardware upgrades ! "
Does Hartley read the newspaper ?
Every single school district in the nation is struggling with horrific budget cuts that slicing core educational necessities from classrooms .
Teachers are being let go , and entire subjects are being eliminated from curricula across the country .
Perhaps not enough is being done to educate students on the benefits of open source software , but it is most certainly not because a surplus of money is being funneled elsewhere .
In the end Hartley concludes that the best thing to do is encourage students to explore open source software on their own time , perhaps offering extra school credit as an incentive .
On that , we completely agree .
Hartley loses me again , however , when he suggests " teachers and the school ’s Microsoft trained [ sic ]
IT staff consider studying up on the subject of Linux before trying to pass futile judgments over it . "
Perhaps Mr. Hartley could do a little studying himself before passing futile judgements in kind .

A week after Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood floated the idea of taxing drivers by - the - mile - driven rather than by - the - gallon - of - gas - purchased and the White House ’s near - immediate denial that such a tax was under consideration , a federal commission has recommended just such as tax .
In a report released today , the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission recommended that ,
A federal funding system based on more direct forms of “ user pay ” charges , in the form of a charge for each mile driven ( commonly referred to as a vehicle miles traveled or VMT fee system ) , has emerged as the consensus choice for the future …
Commence the transition to a new , more direct user charge system as soon as possible and commit to deploying a comprehensive system by 2020 …
Ensure that , once implemented , mileage - based fees and any other charges are set to meet the
designated federal share of national surface transportation investment needs , and index these rates to inflation .
Initiate an extensive public outreach effort to create a broad understanding of the current funding
problem , the proposed solution , the intended method of implementation , and the anticipated
impact on individual system users .
So the government plans on monitoring how much you drive and taxing you on that basis .
Note that fuel efficient vehicles wo n’t save you from the tax .
The Commission ’s report is available here .

LAS VEGAS , Jan. 16 ( UPI ) -- President - elect Barack Obama was installed in the " Spirit of America " room at Madame Tussauds Las Vegas days before his inauguration .
Obama 's wax figure almost missed Thursday 's ceremony , the Las Vegas Sun reports .
It arrived at McCarran International Airport Monday but then was held up in Customs .

The world - famous wax museum has expanded from its original in London to eight branches around the globe .
Obama was the first person to be installed in all eight branches at the same time .
" He was the number one request overnight as soon as he got the nomination for the presidency , " Madame Tussauds Las Vegas General Manager Adrian Jones said .
The Las Vegas installation -- presided over by Frank Hawkins , president of the Nevada chapter of the NAACP -- featured three students reading essays and cantors from the Guardian Angel Cathedral .
Obama is the fifth U.S. president to be featured at the wax museum .
His statue stands near that of his predecessor , President George W. Bush .
Beginning Factor – Introduction
I ’ve been involved in the Factor programming language community for about a year now , and am constantly amazed with how productive its contributors are .
Large improvements to the language and its libraries are made on a weekly ( if not daily ) basis , and it ’s finally starting to attract some much - deserved attention from the programming community .
The problem is , the language is a huge departure from the norm for most developers and it can be overwhelming to someone just getting started .
I would like to help ease that transition by posting on various topics that I know have been confusing to me over the past year .
Note that many topics are covered in the official FAQ — which is well worth a read — and I wo n’t spend time covering how to install Factor on the 14 or so platforms it supports , but beyond that , I ’ll try to give enough information ( from basic to advanced ) to get you going .
The Basics of the Basics
First of all , Factor is a stack - based language , which means that it uses a stack to store all arguments and returned values from functions ( called “ words ” in Factor ) .
To put that another way , Factor words do n’t receive arguments in the traditional manner ; all input values that your word needs are expected to already exist on the top of the stack .
What is a Stack ?
If you ’re unfamiliar with the data structure called a stack , the concept is fairly simple .
It centers around the idea of “ Last In First Out ” ( LIFO ) , meaning the last item placed onto the stack is the first item that will you will get when you remove an item from the stack .
You can not get to the lower items until the all of the items above it have been removed .
I like to picture a stack like a tower of LEGOs .
The only thing you can do with it are add another brick to the top ( “ push ” an item onto the stack ) , or take the top brick off to use it for something else ( “ pop ” an item off the stack ) .
That ’s all there is to stacks !
How to Use the Stack
So , now we know that Factor manages its input and output with a stack , but how do we actually use it ?
Well , when entering data into Factor ’s listener , one of two things is happening :
You are pushing a literal onto the stack
OR
You are calling a word which will consume literals from the stack
Things do get slightly more complicated than that , but for the most part those two rules hold true .
The most simple example of this behavior is the ubiquitous hello world program , shown entered directly into Factor ’s interactive listener environment :
( scratchpad ) " Hello world ! " print Hello world !
To understand what is happening , you can just type the string first , and then execute the print word later :
( scratchpad ) " Hello world ! " ---
Data stack : " Hello world ! " ( scratchpad ) print Hello world !
In this particular case , typing the literal string " Hello world ! " will push that value onto the stack ; then the word print , takes a single string off the stack and writes it to the output stream .
The same idea can be applied to simple arithmetic .
Like strings , numbers are also literals , so you just have to type them in ( separated by spaces ) for them to be pushed onto the stack :
( scratchpad ) 2 3 --- Data stack : 2 3
NOTE : the stack is displayed in the listener upside - down from the way you ’d think , so the bottom number is actually the top of the stack .
… and if you want to add the top two numbers together , the + word will simply pop two numbers off the stack , add them together , and push the result back onto the stack :
--- Data stack : 2 3 ( scratchpad ) + ---
Data stack : 5
A Few More Words
If you start messing around in the listener , odds are your stack is going to grow pretty quickly and become unmanageable .
There are a few words that are essential to know in order to keep things under control :
drop ( x -- ) removes the top item from the stack and discards it
. ( obj -- ) takes the top item from the stack and prettyprints it
clear ( -- ) removes all items from the stack
( scratchpad ) 2 3 - ---
Data stack : - 1 ( scratchpad ) drop ( scratchpad ) 20 5 / . 4 ( scratchpad ) 2 3 + 6 7 --- Data stack : 5 6 7 ( scratchpad ) clear ( scratchpad )
Ramifications of Stack - Based Design
From these simple examples , we can observe a couple of important things about Factor :
Postfix Notation
When using a stack , passing data becomes implicit and we can assume that all input needed by words already exists on the stack .
This naturally lends itself to using postfix notation because you have to push your data onto the stack before you can use it .
This also makes words more concise and unambiguous when compared to infix notation and eliminates the need for copious amounts of parentheses used by prefix notation languages , like Lisp or Scheme .
POSTFIX : 6 5 4 * + INFIX : 6 + 5 * 4 = PREFIX : (+ (* 4 5 ) 6 ) With the infix example above , you ’d have to know order of operations rules in order to get the correct answer ( or use parentheses to force the matter ) .
When using postfix notation , the fact that multiplication is done first becomes explicit .
Prefix notation also gets rid of that ambiguity , but becomes messier and harder to type with the more nesting you add .
Calling Words is Implicit
You do n’t have to specify that you ’re calling a word , you simply use the word .
This , combined with postfix syntax , means that you can easily nest words or cut and paste parts of definitions into new words without disrupting the flow of data .
This lends to keeping code modular , short , easily testable , and readable .
Your First Word
If you ’ve typed in the examples from above and messed around in the listener , then you might want to know how to write your own word rather than just using ones that are predefined .
Drawing on what we already know , here ’s how to write your first word :
: plus - two ( x -- y ) 2 + ;
If you copy and paste that into your listener , than you can use the word plus - two anywhere you would like to add two to a number on the top of the stack :
( scratchpad ) 15 plus - two .
17
Not very exciting , but it gives us a couple more things to talk about …
Syntax Specifics
If you study the word definition , you ’ll see that it ’s made up of a few elements :
: plus - two ( x -- y ) 2 + ;
A colon ( : ) is used to start the definition of a word .
This is required and must have a space after it .
Right after the opening colon is the name of your word , also required .
Following the name of your word is its stack effect declaration , which is a list of the word ’s inputs and outputs separated by -- and surrounded by parentheses .
All words must have a stack effect declaration unless it only pushes literals on the stack .
The names of elements in the stack effect declaration do n’t make a difference , only the number of elements .
That means that ( elt elt -- seq ) and ( x y -- z ) are the same thing .
There are some common conventions for these names , but do n’t get caught up by it as I ’ll talk more about them in a later article and it wo n’t change how your program runs .
Next comes the word definition itself , in this case 2 + .
And the last item is a semicolon ( ; ) , used to end the word definition .
This is required and must have a space before it .
The reason that everything must be surrounded by spaces is that there are n’t any syntax - only elements to Factor …everything is a word !
The colon / semicolon , the parentheses , etc. are all just parsing words working together in order to create the syntax .
Next Time
Next time we ’ll talk more about stack shufflers , quotations & combinators , details about more datatypes , and more …

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - A senior U.N. official denied on Wednesday that any Hamas militants were inside a U.N. - run school in Gaza where Israeli shelling killed more than 40 people on Tuesday .
The Israeli army accused Hamas of using civilians as “ human shields ” and said its troops had returned fire after gunmen mortared their positions from inside al - Fakhora school in Jabalya refugee camp .
Citing intelligence reports , it named two men it said were Islamist gunmen killed in the attack .
John Ging , director of operations in Gaza for UNRWA , the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , told reporters at U.N. headquarters by videolink that he had visited the Jabalya school during a three - hour lull in fighting on Wednesday .
“ I was reassured by the management of the school , my own staff , senior , experienced , long - serving staff , that there were no militants in the school , ” Ging said .
“ I am very confident now that there was no militant activity inside the school nor militants in the school , ” Ging said , reiterating a call for an independent investigation .
“ If anybody has evidence to the contrary , then let ’s bring it forward , ” Ging said .
John Holmes , the top U.N. humanitarian official , told the same news conference the latest casualty figures from the school were 43 dead and 100 injured .
The casualties included people who had taken refuge inside the school and residents of nearby buildings .
What do you do when you have a chunk of time with nothing planned out ?
Standing in a line , between the ordering and the eating at a restaurant , waiting for a meeting to start ?
Do n’t waste that time .
Instead , have the tools on hand to game .
Most commonly , that means carrying around your Tiny Notebook and working on your next session , fleshing out NPCs , or roughing out an encounter or map .
But what about when you ’re sharing that time with your fellow gamers ?
If you ’re standing in line or waiting to dine , those minutes can be snatched up and used for a bit of impromptu gaming .
Do n’t break out dice .
That ’s awkward .
Do n’t do anything flashy that might draw attention to yourself , that ’s a good way to cause trouble , but a brief role - playing exchange can use that time to good advantage .
Especially if your entire group is n’t present , it can be a good time to add some world flavor , drop an adventure hook that they can then take to the group , or share some secrets .
With technology ’s ever - increasing reach , you do n’t even have to have your players with you .
It ’s rare that you ca n’t reach your players via e-mail or text message even on the go .
Sending a message to your players can keep them thinking about the game while letting them respond at their leisure .
In addition to the above options , electronic communication means you can share with as many or as few of your players as you like .
Do n’t forget to make the inherent abilities of your communication device work for you .
Snap a picture of a crowded street or subway with a distinctive person in frame and send it to your modern players with a note : “ Who is the man with the red flower ?
Where is he going ? ”
Do the same with the map you doodled on your napkin , wet ring making the ink run – “ Saw this at the sword and flagon last night .
Wonder what that ’s a map to ? ”
Too often we ’re set in the concept that Role Playing Games require hours of prep and day - long sessions on the weekend .
Make use of spontaneous micro-sessions to make your game fun and keep your players on their toes .
If you have a gun on your person , even if it is legal under a concealed carry license , you may be required to notify the police officer .
Doreach for a gun or any weapon on your body .
If you have a concealed carry permit , calmly tell the officer that you have a permit .
Use the following phrase : “ I want to let you know that I have a concealed carry permit in this state and currently have one on my person . ”
Try to avoid using the word “ gun ” so as to avoid scaring the officer .
Ask the officer how you should proceed .

MIDs , or Mobile Internet Devices , have never been hotter , and there are two open - source handhelds slated to land this year that could very well win over quite a few consumers .
GamePark's GP2X
Wiz , which will be hitting stores soon , looks to be a capable gaming unit as well as an open source machine , but it 's OpenPandora 's Pandora handheld that has most gadget - lovers salivating .
Though it once seemed to be potential vaporware , the Pandora team has let word slip that the product is edging closer to release .
Claiming that 2009 " will surely be the year of the Pandora , " the design team behind the desirable open - source device has posted a new video of the now - fabricated and assembled unit .
Though the current build is still missing its internal components , the team ensures those awaiting the device that the project is coming together and has posted an " unofficial estimated " launch date of April 7 .
Judging by the video , there 's still quite a bit of work to be done on the case itself .
But the team has had working hardware for the innards for some time now , so some final fabrication , polish , and QA work seem to be the only things that stand in the way of the release which once seemed to be a mere fantasy .
As we 've mentioned before , the unit is packed with an ARM Cortex - A8 600 Mhz + CPU running Linux , PowerVR SGX OpenGL 2.0 ES compliant 3D hardware , an 800x480 4.3 " 16.7 million color touchscreen LCD , a full keyboard and dual analog stick layout , Wifi 802.11b/g , Bluetooth , and a High Speed USB 2.0 Host , as well as a host of other slots and an alleged ( and lofty ) ten hours of battery life .
Though the OpenPandora team 's unit is powerful on paper , the Pandora and the Wiz will be doing battle with one another for the affections of MID - loving gadgeteers when they launch later this year .
We 're planning to look at both extensively when they release , so be sure to watch out for more coverage down the road .
Update : Reader BikeHelmet has turned us on to a few additional facts about the Pandora that inquiring minds will want to know .
Firstly , the CPU is a 900 MHz Cortex A8 which has actually been underclocked to 600 MHz .
This , combined with the fact that the battery is a high capacity lithium polymer , is largely what makes the 10 hour battery life plausible .
The official forums for the device also reveal , for those wondering , that the Pandora will be capable of playing back 720 p H.264 video content .
The hardware currently supports the profile ; all that 's needed is a codec .
Bolstered by concerns that existing wind energy technology is n't sufficient to meet renewable energy needs , two Ann Arbor startup companies are developing new solutions that could turn wind into a dramatically more viable energy option .
One of the firms ,
Accio Energy
, is developing a stationary " aerovoltaic " device that would be installed on rooftops , harvest wind and turn it into electricity - without the moving parts associated with wind turbines .
Put simply , it would resemble a wind version of a solar panel .
" Who would have thought that there 's another way to capture wind energy ? " said David Carmein , Accio 's research director and chief scientific mind behind the technology .
" If you look at the wind market , the technology of how you take wind energy and capture it has n't changed for over 700 years . "
The second startup company , WindSight , is a spinoff of Ann Arbor - based Michigan Aerospace , an engineering firm that has gradually diversified its technology portfolio in recent years .
WindSight , led by Michigan Aerospace CEO Peter Tchoryk , is set to commercialize a wind - farm site assessment technology solution .
Together the two companies , albeit officially unrelated , underscore the Ann Arbor region 's budding wind energy technology arsenal .
Accio President Dawn
White , who founded successful Ann Arbor defense tech startup Solidica , said Accio aims to create a wind energy device that would generate double the electricity per square meter of traditional photovoltaic solar panels .
White said the device could ultimately present a way to harvest wind energy in locations where wind turbines are n't practical .
" Small wind turbines are very expensive for the amount of power you get out of them , " White said .
" There 's a real need for a mid- scale wind solution . "
Accio ( pronounced AXE - EE - OH ) , officially formed about a year ago , has received angel investment but would n't discuss specifics .
The firm recently a $ 97,000 grant from the National Science Foundation and a $ 401,500 competitive funding award from the Michigan Public Service Commission .
WindSight , meanwhile , is in the midst of raising funds , but Michigan Aerospace CEO Peter Tchoryk said the firm expects to have its system in beta testing by this summer .
WindSight 's customers would be wind farm developers seeking site analysis tools and ways to optimize turbine performance .
" If you 're a developer , you have to be really sure that the land you 're going to buy and develop and put these hugely expensive turbines on is going to generate the energy that you anticipate , " Tchoryk said .
" That 's really where we shine .
We have a transformational product in that it 's going to provide so much more information than is currently available . "
Conference details
2009 Michigan Wind Energy Conference
• Organizer : Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association .
• Expected attendees : 1,000 .
• Speakers include : Jim Walker ; president of the American Wind Energy Association ; Skip Pruss , director of Michigan 's Department of Energy , Labor and Economic Growth ; Keith Cooley , CEO of Detroit - based NextEnergy ; Dawn White , president of Ann Arbor - based Accio Energy ; Peter Tchoryk , CEO of Michigan Aerospace and leader of WindSight
• Location : Cobo Hall .
• Registration : www.glrea.org.
In the energy field , wind turbines have long been considered static technology .
But Jennifer Alvarado , executive director of Dimondale - based Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association , said that conception is misguided .
GLREA is hosting the 2009 Michigan Wind Energy Conference from March 3 - 4 in Detroit in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy , the Michigan Economic Development Corp. , Detroit - based NextEnergy and other groups .
" There are lots of opportunities right now to achieve higher efficiency in wind generation for electricity , " Alvarado said .
" Innovation is key . "
New wind technology
Accio officials , meanwhile , are remaining purposely secret about the specifics of their technology because of concerns about intellectual property rights .
They said the original basics of the technology were invented decades ago , though it was not proven as a product and the IP has expired .
They 're trying to leverage new technological advances to commercialize the original technology .
Accio officials declined to discuss details but said the device would be modular - meaning you could add capacity based on the size of the structure you 're using to host the technology .
Among the benefits of this aspect of the technology is that it provides for 80 percent " parts commonality " among the various versions of the Accio device , White said .
That is , manufacturing operations would n't have to create many different processes to produce the devices .
That 's one of the biggest problems with wind turbines .
Different sized wind turbines require different sized parts , thus requiring completely different machinery to produce those parts .
White suggested that Accio 's product could eventually be assembled in large scales at repurposed Michigan manufacturing operations .
" Our product is going to be made from components that you can make in plants with machines that are already sitting there , " White said .
The inefficiency of traditional wind turbines is boosting WindSight , which has developed a laser - based system designed to improve wind farm site assessment .
Wind site assessment is quickly turning into a major market as utilities throughout the country seek to meet renewable portfolio standards .
Michigan 's RPS requires utilities to derive 10 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2015 .
Tchoryk said WindSight is developing predictive analytics programs to project problems with wind turbines , deliver performance expectations and forecast optimal wind output at prospective wind farms .
Michigan Aerospace 's atmospheric measurement technology advancements - to be commercialized through WindSight - can be applied to the wind industry .
" It will measure wind speed and direction , temperature density and it also has the capacity to do water vapor as well , and it will do this at long ranges .
We can map out many kilometers ahead of the wind farm and be able to completely map out the atmosphere , " Tchoryk said .
" We can then forecast when the winds will actually arrive at the turbines , and that 's very important for increasing efficiency and maintenance and for improving switching times . "
Tchoryk said Windsight would offer a packaged solution - a laser - based sensor to make measurements and " computational fluid dynamics " software to analyze the results .
Boosting the economy
Tchoryk would n't discuss specifics of where WindSight would locate its headquarters .
He also declined to discuss Michigan Aerospace 's previously announced decision to locate an expansion unrelated to WindSight in the Battle Creek area .
For WindSight , the firm is likely still at least a year or two away from making products , if not more .
Accio officially only has three employees right now , but the firm is working with experts at the University of Michigan , George Washington University and Purdue University to advance the technology .
But Jeffrey Basch , general manager of Accio , said Accio is aiming to reach production stages as soon as possible .
" We really want to make a product , " he said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Major U.S. banks are still hemorrhaging red ink , despite massive taxpayer aid , and President Barack Obama is under pressure to take a high - stakes political gamble -- asking for another bailout .

Whether he would get one from a skeptical Congress is unclear , given the wide dissatisfaction with the first bailout , known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , a $ 700 billion fund to stabilize the banks and Wall Street .
The political danger of backing another aid package was vivid on Thursday when the House of Representatives voted 270 - 155 against releasing a second allotment of $ 350 billion to the TARP .
The money will be released , nonetheless , because the Senate previously voted not to block the funds .
With the most recent TARP vote as a backdrop , analysts said that , if Obama sought more bailout money and Congress approved it , financial markets and bankers would certainly be pleased .
But lawmakers who voted in favor of such a program could pay a high price with voters in elections two years away .
And if the new president requested more money and Congress rejected him , the markets might plunge like they did last year when the Bush administration ’s initial TARP funding request was defeated , although it was later approved .
Neither outcome looks too rosy for Obama and congressional Democrats , leading some analysts to conclude that “ TARP II ” may not be on the cards .
“ There would be tremendous political risk as Obama could lose the vote .
That would spook markets even more and could make conditions worse .
That is why we see this as a very last resort , ” said Jaret Seiberg , financial services policy analyst at investment firm Stanford Group Co .
“ At this point , we do not expect Congress to enact a TARP II bill .
Instead , we believe Treasury , the Federal Reserve and the ( Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ) will find creative ways to recapitalize the banks ...
Still , one cannot rule this out if conditions get worse than expected . ”
OBAMA MUST ASK
Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank said on Tuesday he would be open to expanding the TARP only if the original $ 700 billion was expended fully on “ constructive ” measures , including foreclosure mitigation .
He would back more money only if Obama asked for it and if events warranted , he said , adding that they currently do not .
But Pennsylvania Rep. Paul Kanjorski , a top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee that is chaired by Frank , told C - SPAN television on Tuesday : “ I guarantee ... we ’re going to have another bailout for Wall Street because we are not doing these things properly . ”
One alternative to more capital injections under TARP is for the government to create a “ bad bank ” or “ aggregator bank ” to clean toxic assets from struggling financial companies .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd said on Tuesday he was aware the Obama administration was discussing the idea .
“ It makes some sense to me , ” Dodd added .
As Obama visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday seeking Republican support for an economic stimulus plan , he acknowledged the bad asset problem .
“ We ’re going to have to deal with the troubled assets that many banks are still carrying and that ... have locked up the credit system , ” he said .
It is unclear how an aggregator bank would be paid for .
LOSSES ACCUMULATE
Along with an assortment of Federal Reserve emergency financial - stabilization initiatives , the TARP has been handed over midstream to Obama by former President George W. Bush .
The program has already pumped billions of dollars in taxpayer funds into more than 250 banks , while aiding automakers General Motors Corp GM.N and Chrysler LLC , as well as insurance giant American International Group Inc AIG.N .
Despite this help and the Fed 's unprecedented actions , banks this month have been racking up staggering quarterly losses : $ 8.3 billion at Citigroup Inc C.N , $ 1.8 billion at Bank of America Corp BAC.N and $ 2.2 billion at Morgan Stanley MS.N .
Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius recently said global credit losses may approach $ 2.1 trillion .
Of that total , banks worldwide have already absorbed about $ 975 billion in losses , he estimated in a research report , suggesting the worst is far from over .
FBR Capital Markets analysts said eight of the largest U.S. financial institutions need up to $ 1.2 trillion in new common equity and that “ the government is the only entity that can provide bridge capital to get past the current credit crises . ”
With losses piling up at major banks and the recession deepening , U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday the government may need to pump “ some increased investment ” from taxpayers , beyond the TARP , into the banks .
Lawrence Summers , the head of Obama ’s National Economic Council , would not on Sunday rule out the possibility that more money might be needed to stabilize the financial system .
But such a request may wait awhile since it was less than two weeks ago that Congress approved the second , $ 350 billion funding allotment from the existing program .
“ It would seem prudent to figure out how you ’re going to deploy that before you start asking for more money .
I do n’t think the sentiment in Congress right now is to just keep approving these bills , ” said Daniel Arnold , associate director , at financial group Sandler O’Neill .
fox5vegas.com : Legislators Kills Sex Offender Bill .
dailyfreeman.com :
Sex offender residency rule off the table in Ulster County .
Carson City , Nevada–
A bill that would have changed lifetime supervision requirements imposed on convicted sex offenders has been killed by the state legislature .
Initially introduced by the Division of Parole and Probation , the bill is one of two that would change how sex offenders — sentenced to a lifetime of parole — are tracked , while a second bill would not automatically restore the civil rights of those offenders .
Legislators and officials from the American Civil Liberties Union said the bills would violate constitutional due process protections and goes too far .
They added that the parole board should focus on the “ host of other problems they face , ” which was recently outlined in a legislative audit .
Kingston , NY — Acting on the recommendation of the county attorney , Ulster County Legislature Chairman David Donaldson has pulled the plug on an effort to restrict where in the county registered sex offenders may live .
During a meeting last week , Donaldson , D - Kingston , ruled out of order a resolution to schedule a public hearing on a proposed local law to prohibit registered sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school , church or day - care center .
He said a ruling in Rockland County that an almost identical law there is unconstitutional calls into question the legitimacy of Ulster ’s proposed law .
“ When we compared what their law was against what was being proposed , it was determined that our law would likewise be declared unconstitutional under the same facts and circumstances as in Rockland County , ” Donaldson said .
Donaldson added that county law - enforcement and mental health officials have said such a law would be impossible to enforce and could be counterproductive because it could force sex offenders to choose not to register , making it impossible to monitor their movements .
In a court decision dated Jan. 22 , state Supreme Court Justice William Kelly struck down the Rockland County law , saying it “ impermissibly conflicts with the state enactments . ”
The lawsuit was brought by a sex offender who is an orthodox Jew and said he must live within walking distance of a synagogue .
Similar laws have been adopted elsewhere the state , but many of those — including laws in Albany , Washington and Rensselaer counties — now are facing court challenges .
Communicating with Israelis may leave one bewildered .
Even now when the Israeli Air Force is practicing murder in broad daylight of hundreds of civilians , elderly persons , women and children , the Israeli people manage to convince themselves that they are the real victims in this violent saga .
Those who are familiar intimately with Israeli people realise that they are completely uninformed about the roots of the conflict that dominates their lives .
Rather often Israelis manage to come up with some bizarre arguments that may make a lot of sense within the Israeli discourse , yet make no sense whatsoever outside of the Jewish street .
Such an argument goes as follows : ‘ those Palestinians , why do they insist upon living on our land ( Israel ) , why ca n’t they just settle in Egypt , Syria , Lebanon or any other Arab country ? ’
Another Hebraic pearl of wisdom sounds like this : ‘ what is wrong with these Palestinians ?
We gave them water , electricity , education and all they do is try to throw us to the sea ’ .
Astonishingly enough , the Israelis even within the so - called ‘ left ’ and even the educated ‘ left ’ fail to understand who the Palestinians are , where they come from and what they stand for .
They fail to grasp that for the Palestinians , Palestine is home .
Miraculously , the Israelis manage to fail to grasp that Israel had been erected at the expense of the Palestinian people , on Palestinian land , on Palestinian villages , towns , fields and orchards .
The Israelis do not realise that Palestinians in Gaza and in refugee camps in the region are actually dispossessed people from Ber Shive , Yafo , Tel Kabir , Shekh Munis , Lod , Haifa , Jerusalem and many more towns and villages .
If you wonder how come the Israelis do n’t know their history , the answer is pretty simple , they have never been told .
The circumstances that led to the Israeli Palestinian conflict are well hidden within their culture .
Traces of pre-1948 Palestinian civilisation on the land had been wiped out .
Not only the Nakba , the 1948 ethnic cleansing of the indigenous Palestinians , is not part of the Israeli curriculum , it is not even mentioned or discussed in any Israeli official or academic forum .
In the very centre of almost every Israeli town one can a find a 1948 memorial statue displaying a very bizarre , almost abstract , pipe work .
The plumbing feature is called Davidka and it is actually a 1948 Israeli mortar cannon .
Interestingly enough , the Davidka was an extremely ineffective weapon .
Its shells would n’t reach more than 300 meters and would cause very limited damage .
Though the Davidika would cause just minimal harm , it produced a lot of noise .
According to the Israeli official historical narrative , the Arabs i.e. , Palestinians , simply ran away for their lives once they heard the Davidka from afar .
According to the Israeli narrative , the Jews i.e. , ‘ new Israelis ’ did a bit of fireworks and the ‘ Arab cowards ’ just ran off like idiots .
In the Israeli official narrative there is no mention of the many orchestrated massacres conducted by the young IDF and the paramilitary units that preceded it .
There is no mention also of the racist laws that stop Palestinians from returning to their homes and lands .
The meaning of the above is pretty simple .
Israelis are totally unfamiliar with the Palestinian cause .
Hence , they can only interpret the Palestinian struggle as a murderous irrational lunacy .
Within the Israeli Judeo - centric solipsistic universe , the Israeli is an innocent victim and the Palestinian is no less than a savage murderer .
This grave situation that leaves the Israeli in the dark regarding his past demolishes any possibility of future reconciliation .
Since the Israeli lacks the minimal comprehension of the conflict , he cannot contemplate any possible resolution except extermination or cleansing of the ‘ enemy ’ .
All the Israeli is entitled to know are various phantasmic narratives of Jewish suffering .
Palestinian pain is completely foreign to his ears .
‘ Palestinian right of return ’ sounds to him like an amusing idea .
Even the most advanced ‘ Israeli humanists ’ are not ready to share the land with its indigenous inhabitants .
This does n’t leave the Palestinians with many options but to liberate themselves against all odds .
Clearly , there is no partner for peace on the Israel side .
This week we all learned more about the ballistic capability of Hamas .
Evidently , Hamas was rather restrained with Israel for more than a long while .
It refrained from escalating the conflict to the whole of southern Israel .
It occurred to me that the barrages of Qassams that have been landing sporadically on Sderot and Ashkelon were actually nothing but a message from the imprisoned Palestinians .
First it was a message to the stolen land , homes fields and orchards : ‘ Our beloved soil , we did n’t forget , we are still here fighting for you , sooner rather than later , we will come back , we will start again where we had stopped ’ .
But it was also a clear message to the Israelis .
‘ You out there , in Sderot , Beer Sheva , Ashkelon , Ashdod , Tel Aviv and Haifa , whether you realise it or not , you are actually living on our stolen land .
You better start to pack because your time is running out , you have exhausted our patience .
We , the Palestinian people , have nothing to lose anymore ’ .
Let ’s face it , realistically the situation in Israel is rather grave .
Two years ago it was Hezbollah rockets that pounded northern Israel .
This week the Hamas proved beyond doubt that it is capable of serving the South of Israel with some cocktail of ballistic vengeance .
Both in the case of the Hezbollah and the case of the Hamas , Israel was left with no military answer .
It can no doubt kill civilians but it fails to stop the rocket barrage .
The IDF lacks the means of protecting Israel unless covering Israel with a solid concrete roof is a viable solution .
At the end of the day , they might be planning just that .
But this is far from the end of the story .
In fact it is just the beginning .
Every Middle East expert knows that Hamas can seize control of the West Bank within hours .
In fact , PA and Fatah control in the West Bank is maintained by the IDF .
Once Hamas takes the West Bank , the biggest Israeli population centre will be left to the mercy of Hamas .
For those who fail to see , this would be the end of Jewish Israel .
It may happen later today , it may happen in three months or in five years , it is n’t matter of ‘ if ’ but rather matter of ‘ when ’ .
By that time , the whole of Israel will be within firing range of Hamas and Hezbollah , Israeli society will collapse , its economy will be ruined .
The price of a detached villa in Northern Tel Aviv would equal a shed in Kiryat Shmone or Sderot .
By the time a single rocket hits Tel Aviv , the Zionist dream will be over .
The IDF generals know it , the Israeli leaders know it .
This is why they stepped up the war against the Palestinian into extermination .
The Israelis do not plan upon invading Gaza .
They have lost nothing there .
All they want is to finish the Nakba .
They drop bombs on Palestinians in order to wipe them out .
They want the Palestinians out of the region .
It is obviously not going to work , Palestinians will stay .
Not only they will they stay , their day of return to their land is coming closer as Israel has been exploiting its deadliest tactics .
This is exactly where Israeli escapism comes into play .
Israel has passed the ‘ point of no return ’ .
Its doomed fate is deeply engraved in each bomb it drops on Palestinian civilians .
There is nothing Israel can do to save itself .
There is no exit strategy .
It ca n’t negotiate its way out because neither the Israelis nor their leadership understand the elementary parameters involved in the conflict .
Israel lacks the military power to conclude the battle .
It may manage to kill Palestinian grassroots leaders , it has been doing it for years , yet Palestinian resistance and persistence is growing fierce rather than weakening .
As an IDF intelligence general predicted already at the first Intifada .
‘ In order to win , all Palestinians have to do is to survive ’ .
They survive and they are indeed winning .
Israeli leaders understand it all .
Israel has already tried everything , unilateral withdrawal , starvation and now extermination .
It thought to evade the demographic danger by shrinking into an intimate cosy Jewish ghetto .
Nothing worked .
It is Palestinian persistence in the shape of Hamas politics that defines the future of the region .
All that is left to Israelis is to cling to their blindness and escapism to evade their devastating grave fate that has become immanent already .
All along their way down , the Israelis will sing their familiar various victim anthems .
Being imbued in a self - centred supremacist reality , they will be utterly involved in their own pain yet completely blind to the pain they inflict on others .
Uniquely enough , the Israelis are operating as a unified collective when dropping bombs on others , yet , once being slightly hurt , they all manage to become monads of vulnerable innocence .
It is this discrepancy between the self - image and the way they are seen by the rest of us which turns the Israeli into a monstrous exterminator .
It is this discrepancy that stops Israelis from grasping their own history , it is that discrepancy that stops them from comprehending the repeated numerous attempts to destroy their State .
It is that discrepancy that stops Israelis from understanding the meaning of the Shoah so can they prevent the next one .
It is this discrepancy that stops Israelis from being part of humanity .
Once again Jews will have to wander into an unknown fate .
To a certain extent , I myself have started my journey a while ago .
Not anymore .
And you know why we do n't put them in prison anymore , or why it is we do n't put them in some kind of social servitude ?
We really want people out there working .
We really want people to have a stake in their own futures .
And the founding fathers , even before the Bill of Rights , put in a provision that says Congress will have the power to establish a uniform law of bankruptcies .
...
It was all about how we want to make sure that people have ... the enthusiasm , the incentive , to get out there and try .
For the same reason , we have a lot more businesses start up in the United States than we have in Europe .
Entrepreneurs can get out there and borrow a little money and ... start a hot dog stand or go into consulting .
...
They can take those risks , knowing that there is some safety on the other side .
It 's a big form of social insurance , not for the poor , but for the middle class , for people who are starting businesses , ... people [ who ] are trying to hold together their families , their jobs ; hardworking , play - by - the - rules people .
Those are the people ultimately who end up in bankruptcy ; people who took the risks we wanted them to take , but for them , it did n't work out .
Here , unlike Europe , until very recently , we 've had a huge consumer credit economy , because people could afford to take the chance .
They could afford to get out there and spend next month 's paycheck , knowing at some underlying level that if they got laid off or if they got too sick or got hit with big medical bills , that there really is ultimately a way out , that the creditors can't come , strip you down to naked , throw you back into poverty , leave you in the gutters ; ... that there is some safety net .
And so they founded this nation , and when they got into financial trouble , you know what they did ?
They moved west .
And they moved west , and they moved west .
And by the end of the 19th century , there was no place else to move , and creditors could pretty much reach their debtors ... anywhere around the country , and that 's when we finally put our first national bankruptcy law into effect .
And we 've had one ever since .
It 's the way that people say : " I got out there ; I borrowed the money ; I did my best ; I used that money to start a small business or to keep myself going in my job .
...
You rolled the dice with me .
...
It did n't work .
You can have most of what I own , and that 's it , though .
We 'll stop there .
We 'll declare the default .
You write off the part of the debt I can't pay , I 'll take my human energy ... and go right back into the game again . "
That 's the whole premise behind bankruptcy .
It 's about death and rebirth .
Because bankruptcy is about financial death and financial rebirth .
Bankruptcy is the great American story rewritten .
We 're a nation of debtors .
Why do you think people left Europe to come to the United States ?
They left because they were in debt .
We like to describe it as , " Oh , it was about religious freedom . "
No , it was about debt .
They were looking for a way to escape their debts .
A professor of law at Harvard University , Elizabeth Warren is an expert on bankruptcy and an outspoken critic of consumer lenders .
She is the author of several books including , most recently , The Two - Income Trap : Why Middle Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke .
Here , she discusses the range of deceptive and unfair practices she says the credit card companies try to hide in the fine print of card agreements and she lays out the remedies that should be put in place to protect the consumer .
She is especially outraged by those who argue that the debt problem facing Americans is really a tiny fraction of the overall economy and that such consumer spending has helped keep the economy afloat .
" Seventy percent of American families last year said that they are carrying so much debt that it is making their family lives unhappy , " says Warren .
" Middle - class Americans , hard working , play - by - the - rules Americans , Americans who lost a job , who do n't have health insurance , who are in the middle of a divorce -- those are the Americans who are carrying enormous credit card debts . "
This interview was conducted on Sept. 20 , 2004 .
» " The Cement Life Raft "
In this excerpt from Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi 's book , The Two Income Trap : Why Middle - Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke , the authors lay out their argument against the " predatory " lending practices of the mortgage and credit card industries and their effect on American families .
There is no problem if they would do it on terms that are fair and if they would make their contracts transparent so that the person who 's borrowing the money is borrowing it in a way that he or she understands and appreciates the risks .
So the credit card industry says ...
" We provide the credit , in many cases , for people to start businesses ... to buy more , to live a better life , to do things that they could never do any other way . "
So what 's the problem ?
So bankruptcy was a way to take the human beings who had gambled and lost and get them back into the game .
Better that they be back in the game , working and starting their businesses , so that they earn taxes that help all of us .
Better that America believes in a business sense , in rebirth , than in ... the taint of debt ... and some form of death following that .
The notion was anyone whose complete income was going to be seized by his creditors , anyone whose farm was all going to be taken away , anything that was produced , would n't have very much reason to get up and go to work , would n't have very much reason to plough the fields .
In Queensland , Australia , policemen are arresting fewer people because their new data - entry system is too annoying :
He said police were growing reluctant to make arrests following the latest phased roll - out of QPRIME , or Queensland Police Records Information Management Exchange .
“ They are reluctant to make arrests and they ’re showing a lot more discretion in the arrests they make because QPRIME is so convoluted to navigate , ” Mr Leavers said .
He said minor street offences , some traffic offences and minor property matters were going unchallenged , but not serious offences .
However , Mr Leavers said there had been occasions where offenders were released rather than kept in custody because of the length of time it now took to prepare court summaries .
“ There was an occasion where two people were arrested on multiple charges .
It took six detectives more than six hours to enter the details into QPRIME , ” he said .
“ It would have taken even longer to do the summary to go to court the next morning , so basically the suspects were released on bail , rather than kept in custody . ”
He said jobs could now take up to seven hours to process because of the amount of data entry involved .

The internet will get a chance to watch live as lawyers spar in a Recording Industry Association of America file sharing lawsuit this month , a federal judge ruled Wednesday .
U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner of Massachusetts granted over - the - internet coverage for a Jan. 22 motions hearing in the RIAA 's lawsuit against Boston University student Joel Tenenbaum and others .
The defendants are seeking to dismiss allegations they shared copyrighted music over peer - to - peer networks .
The RIAA opposed the broadcast , requested by the defendant 's attorney , Charles Nesson , a Harvard University legal scholar .
On Wednesday , the judge called the RIAA 's position " curious . "
" At previous hearings and status conferences , the Plaintiffs have represented that they initiated these lawsuits not because they believe they will identify every person illegally downloading copyrighted material .
Rather , they believe that the lawsuits will deter the Defendants and the wider public from engaging in illegal file - sharing activities .
Their strategy effectively relies on the publicity resulting from this litigation , " she ruled .
The ruling is groundbreaking .
Federal trial courts rarely , if ever , permit still pictures or live feeds from their courtrooms , though appeals courts are more open .
Most states allow some type of photography , and vest the decision exclusively with the judge presiding over the case .
Many state judges began barring cameras in court following the O.J. Simpson murder trial .
But Judge Gertner is an outspoken proponent of cameras in the courtroom , and she noted that the law does not prohibit them .
" Nothing in the local rules of the District Court of Massachusetts , the policies of the Judicial Council for the First Circuit , life , or logic suggests that this motion should be denied , " she ruled ( .pdf ) .
In September 2007 , Gertner testified on Capitol Hill that " public proceedings in the 21st century necessarily mean televised proceedings . "
She said " the vast majority of the American public get information about courts through screens — television or the internet . "
The internet feed will be provided by Courtroom View Network and will be funneled to the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School , which will broadcast the hearing live .
Trial in the case is scheduled for March 30 .
Cameras have only been granted for the 2 p.m. Eastern , Jan. 22 hearing .
Last month , the RIAA announced it was abandoning its file sharing legal campaign , which has targeted more than 30,000 individuals but would continue with cases already in the pipeline .
Most cases settled out of court for a few thousand dollars .
Only one has gone to trial , which resulted in a mistrial .

Lockheed Martin , EEStor Developing Energy - Equipped Body Armor
December 31st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
I ’m hesitant to call anything used in combat environmentally friendly , but Lockheed Martin ’s proposed body armor equipped with an energy unit is nothing if not interesting .
According to the company ’s patent application , the armor will feature an “ electrical energy storage unit ” developed by stealth start - up EEStor .
The armor ’s energy storage layer could help soldiers power their flashlights , GPS units , radios and more .
Currently , soldiers are often weighed down by extra batteries for these devices .
Lockheed Martin ’s energy unit will most likely be between .5 centimeters and 2 centimeters thick .
The body armor will include electrical connectors , electrical ports , and an energy management system .
If EEStor ’s ultra - light energy storage device works for the military , it may be headed for electric vehicles next .

Scientology attempts to ban HIV positive picketers
Scientology attempts to ban picketers due to their HIV status
Los Angeles , CA ( 1-12-09 ) -
In a shocking new tactic attempting to ban peaceful protesters from picketing the Scientology compound known as " Gold Base " near Hemet , CA , Scientology lawyers have obtained medical information regarding two protesters , and are using their HIV positive status in an attempt to prevent them from picketing at the location .
Worldwide pickets against Scientology have surged in the last year , and Scientology has been fighting to stop them , especially near the Hemet compound .
Scientology has used tactics ranging from physical attacks [ 1 ] , false reports to police [ 2 ] , and the emission of an estimated 110 db organ note from loudspeakers in an attempt to drown out the protesters ' chants . [ 3 ]
The latest tactics , however , are downright sickening , illegal , and an insult to members of the LGBT community and HIV patients worldwide .
Attorney Graham Berry and activists " Angry Gay Pope " ( AGP ) and " Happy Smurf " ( a former Scientologist ) are openly homosexual .
Scientology , which policy states that homosexuals are " low on the tone scale " and should be " disposed of quietly and without sorrow " [ 4 ] , has obtained AGP and Happy Smurf 's private records and discovered that they are HIV positive . [ 5 ]
Scientology is lobbying for the passage of a county - wide ordinance restricting protesting at " Gold Base " . [ 6 ]
Scientology considers the presence of the two HIV + men to be a threat to the well - being of the alleged 500 " church workers " at the Base , and is seeking to restrict protests in a move that may constitute an restriction on 1st Amendment rights of activists in Hemet .
This is not the first time Scientology has openly spoken out against homosexuality .
At the 2008 Toronto Gay Pride Parade , Scientologists made false claims of being able to cure homosexuality . [ 7 ]
Recently the Church of Scientology of California donated a generous sum of money to aid in the passing of Proposition 8 , a law that banned marriage between homosexual couples . [ 8 ]

A worrying statistic shows that the average American home consumes some 15,000 gallons of water on watering the lawn alone .
This is an astronomical figure , seeing how there are people out there who live their entire lives without consuming that much water .
Counting the rapid worldwide depletion of sweet water reserves , it 's easy to see that these consumption rates are unsustainable .
However , a company called Biokube may have come up with a solution to this problem .
The new system it proposes uses water that would have otherwise been lost into a septic tank for watering the lawn .
The 6 - feet tall basin can handle an approximate output of about 7.5 liters of water per 15 minute intervals .
And while this may not be the most elegant solution scientists could come by for stopping useless high water consumptions , it is one of the most practical .
Water that enters the Venus tank is not subjected to regular cleansing procedures .
Other filtering systems use gravity to settle down solid waste , while specific bacteria clean the water in several stages .
The Venus system uses some built - in " biomembranes , " which are layers of filters , each with its own bacteria culture .
Thus , by the time water reaches the exit end , it 's very clean and fit to water the grass .
This invention can help households significantly reduce their water consumption levels , seeing how not all plants require pure water , like humans do .
Out of the 15,000 gallons of water each American household that has a lawn consumes yearly , several thousands could be offset with the use of the Venus filtering system .
The rate at which the system works is good for the lawn and its water processing capabilities make it ideal for average homes .
But , for people to be motivated to buy such a system , they need to overcome a lot of mentalities that plague the " common belief system . "
Namely , using recycled water wo n't kill your lawn and will not generate horrible smells around your house .
All it does is save fresh water from being depleted in the foreseeable future , so nations wo n't have to turn to alternatives .
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - New Zealand ’s main opposition National Party and its support parties were on track to sweep the ruling Labor government from power in Saturday ’s general election , the latest count showed .
With 50 percent of the vote counted , the center - right National Party led by former foreign exchange dealer John Key had 47 percent of the vote , which would translate to 60 seats in the 122 - seat parliament .
The center - left Labour Party , which is seeking a fourth three - year term , had 33 percent of the vote , translating to 42 seats .
The Green Party is on 6 percent , which would give it eight seats , with National ’s committed ally , the right - wing ACT Party , on 3.7 percent for five seats .
If National maintains its current share of the vote , it would be able to form the next government with the help of the ACT and United Future parties , who have already pledged support .
Under New Zealand ’s proportional voting system , a party must win 5 percent of the nationwide vote or a local electorate seat to be represented in parliament .
Other parties on track to win seats were the Maori Party and the Progressives , both of which would hold local district seats .
However , the NZ First Party , led by outgoing Foreign Minister Winston Peters , was on 4.4 percent and because it was unlikely to win a local seat would not return to parliament .

Everyone loves positive feedback .
We are no exception .
Fortunately , there ’s no lack of positive comments from our consulting clients .
We love our work , and we love making our clients happy with successful ...
I 'm sorry , but this really pisses me off .
The problem with getting good numbers is that they invariably take time to come in .
In the meantime , people are happy to run off and trumpet their half - cocked theories -- unchallenged -- to anyone who 's listening .
I 've tried to be measured and sensitive on this .
But frankly , the scapegoating of black people for the failure passage of Prop 8 has been a travesty .
Anyone who doubts that needs to read this report .
A few of the conclusions are as follows .
1. ) The 70 percent figure for black support of Prop 8 is wildly overblown , and in conflict with all the other polling done .
The study concludes that 58 percent is a more likely number .
To put that in context , the study also concludes that 59 percent of Latinos supported prop 8 .
That is n't one - up - manship -- it just means we were about the same .
2. ) Black people almost certainly did not account for 10 percent of the voters on Prop 8 , they accounted for seven percent
3. ) 58 percent is still higher than the 52 percent for the state , as a whole , but that difference is almost entirely accounted for by the fact that no ethnic group in California is as religiously devout as ( as measured by church attendance ) African - Americans .
Truphone uses the wi-fi technology in an iPod touch to connect to other users A freeware application for the iPod Touch can turn the music player into a virtual mobile phone .
Truphone uses wi-fi technology in an iPod Touch to allow users to make calls to other iPod Touch owners and Google Talk 's messaging service users .
The software is a spin - off from technology Truphone developed for smartphones and iPhones .
The developers plan to have the ability to make calls to and from landlines in place very soon .
Ipod Touch owners keen to use the software will also have to buy a clip - on microphone for the portable music player .
Truphone is the latest firm to offer voice over internet protocol ( VoIP ) , alongside Unlicensed Mobile Access and proprietary protocols such as Skype .
Geraldine Wilson - Truphone 's CEO - said the firm had ambitions to become a global internet player .
" There are a slew of new features we 're rolling out for the iPod Touch that will let users call landlines , Skype users or send instant messages .
We 're talking weeks , not months , before these go live . "
Although Truphone technology can , in theory , work on any mobile device , the firm is concentrating on devices that have an application store .
" We 've decided to focus on devices that are wi - fi enabled and have an apps - store .
For the consumer , there has to be an easy way of downloading an application . "
" Our focus on the consumer side - at least in the short term - is finding devices that fit that category , " said Ms Wilson .
Wi - fi go bye bye
The only catch is that for a wi- fi connection to work , users need to be within range of a wi- fi network .
Truphone founder - James Tagg - said that the technology also worked on other mobile devices , albeit in a slightly different way .
" If you were using Truphone on a Blackberry , it will use cellular technology to log into the Truphone 's website . "
" From here you can make an international call , call a user on VoIP , or send an instant message . "
" Because the first leg of the call - from the user to our server - is charged at local rate , you 're talking a bill of pennies , rather than pounds , to call , say the United States . "
The company said Google 's Android operating system would be the next platform for which it will develop the Truphone applications .

BREAKING : Israeli ground forces storm Gaza RAW STORY
Published : Saturday January 3 , 2009
Print This Email This Gaza death toll passes 500 : medics GAZA CITY ( AFP ) 
At least 500 Palestinians have died in Israel 's nine - day offensive on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip , medics said on Sunday .
" The number of martyrs has reached at least 500 , including 87 children , and more than 2,450 have been wounded , " Moawiya Hassanein , the head of Gaza medical emergency services , told AFP .
" The number of the dead can be much higher , since there are many martyrs and wounded in the streets , but we have not been able to get to them , " he said .
Israel hit by 32 Gaza rockets : army JERUSALEM ( AFP )  Militants in the Gaza Strip fired at least 32 rockets and mortar rounds into Israel on Sunday , lightly wounding three people as Israeli troops pushed deeper into the Palestinian territory , the army and medics said .
One of the rockets scored a direct hit on a house in the southern town of Sderot , lightly wounding one woman .
The town , which lies several kilometres ( miles ) from the Gaza border , has borne the brunt of the rocket fire since 2001 .
Medics also treated another two people who were lightly wounded -- one in the Israeli port city of Ashdod and another in kibbutz Nir Oz .
At least 12 of the missiles were longer - range Grad rockets , which fell near Ashdod , and the towns of Ofaqim and Netivot which are both east of Gaza , the army said .
Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired more than 500 rockets and mortar rounds into Israel since the beginning of the Jewish state 's massive offensive on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip on December 27 , killing four people and wounding several dozen others , according to Israeli officials .
At least 30 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel 's ground offensive began on Saturday .
In total , more than 485 Palestinians have died since Israel began its offensive against Gaza on December 27 .
Fierce fighting brings first casualties of new offensive GAZA CITY ( AFP )  Invading Israeli ground forces fought fierce battles with Hamas on Sunday in the beginning of Israel 's new offensive in Gaza .
A burning fuel depot lit up the night sky soon after troops crossed the border at around 8:00 pm ( 1800 GMT ) on Saturday , while warplanes swooped on dozens of targets in the biggest Israeli military operation since the 2006 Lebanon war .
Israeli tanks supported by helicopter gunships were battling around Gaza City and in the northern town of Beit Lahiya , while Hamas fighters fired back with mortars and rockets , witnesses said .
An Israeli military spokesman said dozens of Hamas fighters were killed in the initial battles , while the Islamist group 's television said Israeli soldiers had also been killed .
There was no independent confirmation of the claims .
Gaza emergency services said one child was killed and 11 others wounded in one tank attack .
War over Gaza begins GAZA CITY ( AFP )  Israeli tanks rolled into Gaza late Saturday and troops clashed with Hamas fighters in a step - up to an eight - day offensive that has killed hundreds of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction .
A burning fuel depot lit up the night sky soon after tanks and troops crossed the border and the air force carried out more raids in the biggest Israeli military operation since its 2006 war in Lebanon .
Dozens of Hamas fighters were killed in the initial battles , an Israeli military spokesman said .
Update : Hamas responds
Hamas vowed on Saturday to turn the Gaza Strip into a " cemetery " for the Israeli army , which launched a ground offensive in the enclave following a week of air and naval bombardment .
CNN reports :
" ' We will defeat the army just like they were defeated before , ' Abu Thaer , spokesman for the military wing of Fatah -- the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades -- told the television network Al Jazeera .
" 'We will rub their noses in the sand .
To the Arabs of 1948 , today it is the time to act , to carry martyrdom operations in the heart of Israel .
In case they will get in really on the ground , they will be taught a lesson that they will never forget .
The Israeli army is the loser from ground operations in Gaza .
" ' They claim that the Palestinian resistance was hit , but we say that the resistance will not be defeated , and we will not receive them with roses .
We will receive them with bombs and that will not stop , God willing , ' Thaer said . "
Update : ' We have many , many targets '
The Associated Press reports :
Israeli tanks and infantry entered Gaza after nightfall Saturday , launching a ground offensive that the military said would be a " lengthy operation " in a widening war on Gaza 's Hamas rulers .
Israeli security officials said the operation is likely to go on for several days , but that the objective is not to reoccupy Gaza .
The depth and intensity will also depend on parallel diplomatic efforts , the officials on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations .
" We have many , many targets , " Israeli military spokeswoman Maj .
Avital Leibovich told CNN , adding that Hamas has been digging smuggling tunnels and other facilities .
" To my estimation , it will be a lengthy operation , " she said .
" The goal is to try and take over some of the those launching areas that were responsible for the many launches , thousands of launches in fact , toward Israeli civilians , " she said .
" The civilians are not our target .
We are looking only after militants .
Hamas militants . "
Update : the invasion has begun
JERUSALEM ( AFP )  Israeli ground troops have entered the Gaza Strip , an army spokesman told AFP on Saturday a week after the Jewish state launched its massive offensive on Hamas targets in the enclave .
" I can confirm that Israeli troops have gone in , " she said .
Witnesses inside Gaza Strip said soldiers had entered the territory in the north .

' Dramatic escalation ' in Gaza as tanks ' moving toward the frontier '
GAZA CITY ( AFP )  Israeli artillery on Saturday bombarded the Gaza Strip in a dramatic escalation of the campaign against Hamas after a week of air attacks which have left more than 440 Palestinians dead .
Israeli tanks were seen moving toward the frontier as Howitzer guns fired dozens of shells across the border .
AFP correspondents saw huge plumes of black smoke rise on the Gaza side .
The Israeli army made no immediate comment on the operation which came amid mounting speculation that Israel would send troops into Gaza .
With thousands of troops and tanks massed at the frontier , Israeli air strikes earlier killed a Hamas military commander and destroyed a school as the military campaign against rockets fired from Gaza entered a second week .
Israeli radio warned the public that rocket attacks could intensify in " coming hours " .
Israel has staged more than 750 air raids against Hamas leaders and military targets since launching " Operation Cast Lead " on December 27 .
At least 442 Palestinians have been killed -- including 75 children -- and 2,290 wounded , according to Gaza medics .
Four people have been killed in Israeli by more than 500 rockets fired from Gaza over the same time .
Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal warned Israel on Friday of a " black destiny " if it invaded .
But US leaders have given their key Middle East ally free rein to begin a ground operation , again blaming Hamas for the new conflict .
More than 30 air raids on Saturday hit Hamas targets across the densely populated territory .
One strike killed Mohammad al - Jammal , who Gaza sources said was a Hamas military commander .
Israel said he was responsible " for the entire rocket launching enterprise in all of Gaza City . "
Jammal 's death came two days after an air raid killed top Hamas leader Nizar Rayyan .
Another raid demolished a school in northern Gaza and killed a guard there .
Israel said its warplanes had targeted " a college used as a base for firing a large number of rockets . "
Two people were killed when a strike hit their car in the southern city of Khan Yunis , medics said .
The Israeli strikes have so far failed in their declared aim of ending rocket fire from Gaza and there is mounting concern over the humanitarian impact of the Israeli operation .
Maxwell Gaylard , UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories , said on Friday " there is a critical emergency in the Gaza Strip right now .
By any definition this is a humanitarian crisis and more . "
About 80 percent of the 1.5 million population relies on international food aid .
But the United States has given fresh backing to Israel , insisting that the key to a truce is Israel 's demand that Hamas stop firing rockets .
In his weekly Saturday radio address , the text of which was released by the White House , President George W. Bush called on Hamas " to turn away from terror , and to support legitimate Palestinian leaders working for peace . "
Bush blamed Hamas for the violence and rejected calls for a unilateral ceasefire that he said would allow the Islamists to continue targeting Israel with rocket and mortar fire .
Thousands of Israeli troops with tanks have been waiting along the 60 - kilometre ( 37 - mile ) border with Gaza for the green light from the government to advance .
Amid new diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting , Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas was to meet French President counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy in Ramallah on Monday .
He was then to travel to New York to appeal for a ceasefire at the UN Security Council .
Syrian President Bashar al - Assad on Saturday met Iran 's Supreme National Security Council chief Saeed Jalili to discuss the Gaza crisis , Syria 's official SANA news agency reported .
Jalili also met the exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal and Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah on Friday , a Palestinian source said .
In a televised speech on Friday night , Meshaal warned Israel : " If you commit the stupidity of launching a ground offensive then a black destiny awaits you . "
The week of Israeli strikes has destroyed Hamas government buildings , the homes of senior Islamist officials , mosques , schools and other buildings said to have stored weapons , and roads and tunnels used to smuggle arms and supplies .
Israel has kept the territory virtually sealed since Hamas seized power there in June 2007 from Fatah forces loyal to the secular Abbas .

Building email messages is a pain .
Even if you use a library to build the message string for you , you have to know a lot of crap and pay attention to a lot of details .
If you know what those details are , it 's a pain .
If you do n't know what they are , you do n't feel any pain until later , when you find out all the ways things went wrong .
It 's more of a pain , too , when trying to set up multipart emails that are sent all the time , like subscription notifications , welcome messages , reports , and so on .
I 've seen a lot of awful solutions to this problem .
My favorite awful solution was when I saw some code that took a complete , encoded MIME message and used it as a template .
You 'd have to pass it variables properly encoded with the right Content - Transfer - Encoding for the part into which the variable was used , sometimes passing two versions of one variable .
Also , as I recall it used Python 's format operator , so it all looked like a massive printf string .
Then there are all the awful messages I get from vendors who build terrible MIME messages with broken encodings or text parts poorly converted from HTML ( or empty ! ) .
Also , American Express has ignored my repeated complaints that while they provide a perfectly legible plaintext part , they do not render it , so I see all their template variables instead of my information .
We set out to solve this problem internally a while ago , and I think it was a pretty big success .
It made it very easy to throw together email templates that were maintainable , comprehensible , and that our web guy could edit easily .
There were some problems , though .
The biggest one , for me , was our code 's reliance on one of YAML 's more powerful features : tagging .
We used tags to describe parts of the message in its YAML - based definition file , but dealing with YAML tags in Perl is still awful .
Rather than pin our hopes to that improving , we 've replaced that design .
Actually , we 've rewritten the entire library .
I think it should be easier to use , easier to extend , and easier to understand .
I 'm very , very excited to start using it for all our internal messages .
( Once again , this is Pobox saying , " We 'd love to release this code , but not until we can rewrite it entirely based on the lessons we 've learned .
Normally I do n't like that kind of thinking , but I thinks it keeps serving us ( and the CPAN ) well ! )
The library is called Email : : MIME :: Kit .
It can be fairly significantly customized , but a fairly simple configuration , close to the stock one , works like this :
You create a directory , which we call a message kit , or mkit , and put a bunch of files in it .
These files are used in assembling the kit , and the most important is the manifest .
We decide to write our manifest in YAML :
--- validator : Rx renderer : TT header : - From : '" Customer Support " < cs@example.com >' - To : '[ % account.email_address.for_header % ] '
- Subject : ' Your Invoice , Number [ % invoice.number % ] ' alternatives : - type : text / plain path : body .
txt - type : text / html path : body .html attachments : - assembler : InvoicePDF attributes : { filename : invoice.pdf }
When we send a customer a bill , now we can say :
my $ kit = Email : : MIME :: Kit->new ( { source => ' share/msgs/invoice.mkit/' } ) ; my $ email = $ kit -> assemble ( { account => $ account , invoice => $ invoice } ) ; $ transport -> send ( $email , { ... } ) ;
The kit will validate the stash .
Our example uses an Rx schema , but writing a validator plugin is trivial .
With that done , the message is assembled .
The top - level part is assembled by the standard assembler , but the one attachment consults a custom assembler that retrieves or generates a PDF from our billing system .
The only thing the designer needs to do is edit the text and HTML files in the message kit .
These do n't need to know anything about the fact that they 're going into email .
They will be properly encoded as needed .
Even the headers are checked for non-ascii text and encoded as MIME headers ( encoded - words ) if needed .
While the templates do n't need to know they 're going to be part of email , it can be useful .
This is part of a manifest in Email : : MIME :: Kit 's test suite :
- container_type : multipart / related type : text / html path : better - alternative .html attributes : charset : utf - 8 attachments : - type : image / jpeg path : logo.jpg
The HTML template can get the Content - ID of any attachment easily enough , meaning that you can attach the images you want to reference in your HTML , rather than rely on web connectivity .
Your template might contain :
<img src=" cid : [ % cid_for ( ' logo.jpg ' ) % ] " />
It 's worth noting that this is all possible with the standard assembler , but wordy .
I think we 'll probably end up writing an assembler that optimizes for multipart / related HTML - and - content parts .
Among the pieces that can be replaced are the KitReader ( so you could decide to store the kit in a tarball , a database , or a webservice , for example ) , the ManifestReader ( so you can use JSON , YAML , XML , or Perl to describe your kit 's manifest ) , the Assembler ( which actually builds the message parts ) , the Renderer , and the Validator .
I imagine there are at least a few bugs related to autoencoding , and I expect I 'll find one or two features that I need to add in the next few weeks , but right now I 'm very happy with the code , and I 've just uploaded it to the CPAN .
If you find it useful , or if you hit a problem , let me know !
In the grip of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , America has undergone radical changes .
Greed is no longer good and luxury is a shameful word .
Paul Harris in New York analyses the tests facing the new president of a shattered nation
When writer Héctor Tobar returned to America last year after seven years living in Latin America , he came back to a profoundly changed land .
He had left a United States riding an economic boom .
House prices were soaring , suburbs were gobbling up farmland and good times were rolling on Wall Street .
Now all that has gone .
Tobar , an acclaimed author and essayist , was stunned to find America in the grip of an economic turmoil that was changing his native country before his eyes , plunging it into the worst crisis since the Great Depression .
" There is a sense of mourning and confusion and a real feeling of living in the last days of empire , " Tobar said .
This new America is what Barack Obama has inherited .
It is in many ways a broken country .
When Obama takes the oath of office on 20 January watched by millions of Americans , his burden will be heavy in the extreme .
The scale of the disaster is so large that Obama being America 's first black president will almost be a historical footnote .
The numbers describe the extent of the catastrophe best .
Seven trillion dollars has been wiped off a stock market that has dropped 33 % , its biggest fall since 1931 .
Two million jobs have disappeared , wages are frozen and millions have lost their homes .
The Federal Reserve is printing billions of dollars to keep the economy afloat .
Banks have been part nationalised and the car industry of Detroit - once the symbol of the all - American lifestyle - is on life support and may not see the end of 2009 .
These terrible facts are accompanied by a profound cultural shift .
The era of individualistic consumption that swept aside the Great Society of the 1960s has come to an end .
For three decades , American culture has celebrated the glories of unabashed capitalism and the ideals of the rich .
No longer .
From Hollywood movies to celebrity culture to television , frugalism is taking hold .
Consumers are cutting back .
Luxury brands are falling by the wayside .
Even the excesses of the sporting world , from the Super Bowl to Nascar , are being curbed .
A national belt - tightening is having an impact on everything from restaurants and books to a collapse in the demand for cosmetic surgery .
The recession is reshaping the cultural landscape in which ordinary people live their lives .
As it prepares to inaugurate a new president , America is also trying to forge a fresh identity in a world unimaginably different from the one inherited by George W Bush only eight years ago .
Mike Levine , founder of leading Los Angeles PR firm Levine Communications , believes the cultural change is even hitting the ethereal world of the über - rich celebrities who inhabit La - La land .
Gone are the days of bling and Beluga caviar , of quaffing Krug in high - end clubs and driving around Hollywood in a Hummer .
" The new year will be marked by a cultural trend I am calling ' Luxury Shame ' , " he said .
" In the extraordinary recessionary times , it seems vulgar to flaunt one 's luxurious lifestyle . "
Paris Hilton - not usually a name associated with economic hard times - has already run foul of the new cultural mood .
On a trip to Australia for New Year 's Eve , a shopping splurge on luxury items earned her a barrage of negative headlines .
On the TV show Entourage , which normally celebrates its male cast 's acquisition of brand - name products , the rapper Bow Wow recently bought a Toyota Prius .
" I caution even the most successful celebrities to go bling - less , " Levine said .
Perhaps not coincidentally , several forthcoming Hollywood movies , such as Clive Owen 's The International , have as their main villains banks or financiers .
In a recent trailer for the film , Owen 's character is seen preparing to execute a rogue banker at gunpoint - no doubt a satisfying moment for many multiplex audiences .
Many experts see the cultural rejection of luxury and excess as a watershed moment which for many Americans seemed to descend out of a clear blue sky .
" This is about a rethinking of the fundamentals that comes about because society is suddenly under a large amount of stress , " said Miles Orvell , a professor of American studies at Temple University in Philadelphia .
It certainly seems a cultural milestone every bit as significant as the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 , which ushered in an era of conservatism , deregulation , free markets and muscular nationalism .
The Reagan revolution ended the progressive era of presidents such as Lyndon Johnson and John F Kennedy .
It celebrated Wall Street and making money .
It was the era of Gordon Gekko and Rambo .
The presidency of Bill Clinton did little to change its course , and it continued unabated into the Bush years as hedge funds became the new masters of the universe and America became the world 's only superpower .
In both high finance and global politics , it seemed that the wealthy and powerful had written their own rulebook .
But , culturally at least , that book is being redrawn in the face of the recession and the election of a president whose mantra was based on rejecting conflict and trying to forge a consensus .
Cultural historians now see echoes of the 1930s when the Great Depression inspired works that focused on the troubles of ordinary people , such as John Steinbeck 's The Grapes of Wrath and the non-fiction of James Agee , whose Let Us Now Praise Famous Men examined poverty in the south .
Orvell believes the coming recession will see a similar flowering of art and literature , reflecting the changed times .
He is predicting a greater focus on community and an end to individualism as the dominant ideal .
" Stress brings new ways of thinking .
This will have a profound effect on culture from people at the bottom to people at the very top , like Obama , " he said .
The new president is likely both to lead and to encapsulate these changes .
Dealing with the economy is the number one topic in America , greater than Iraq , greater than the " war on terror " .
Obama 's actions there are the yardstick by which he will be judged .
But the recession is already reshaping people 's lives in ways trivial and profound .
Sales of red meat are falling , while cheaper foodstuffs , such as pasta , are going up .
Car sales have collapsed by up to 30 % , perhaps meaning that the greatest American icon of the 20th century is struggling .
Frugal is the new cool , putting an end to hyperconsumption .
The orgy of credit card abuse is over .
A website called Debt Proof Living launched a daily email tipsheet last summer which now has 100,000 subscribers .
Oprah Winfrey forsook her annual holiday list of expensive gift suggestions in favour of more modest " favourite things " .
Salons and spas are seeing customers desert them as women pamper themselves on the cheap at home .
The demand for cosmetic surgery has collapsed with some clinics reporting a fall in patients of 30 - 40 % .
What was once seen as a standard luxury for the wealthy elite - inspiring the TV series Nip / Tuck - is now regarded as grotesque excess , alongside owning a polluting big car .
" It 's the new SUV , " declared Victoria Pitts - Taylor , author of Surgery Junkies
Tobar sees the changes in America reflected in his own life .
While living in Latin America he would return to the US with his young son .
" He would always say : why are the cookies so big here ?
And he was right .
Everything was bigger , including the people . "
That sort of excess , on everything from cookies to cars , is now on the way out .
The era of supersizing is over .
There has been a cultural humbling that makes consumption and sheer size more unacceptable than at any time in the past three decades .
New York Times columnist Bob Herbert has tapped into the zeitgeist better than most .
In a recent column that became a huge hit across the blogosphere and a talking point on cable news , he took America to task .
" I 've got a new year 's resolution and a new slogan for the country , " he wrote before going on to eviscerate the culture of debt - spending , blind consumption and rampant consumerism which , he said , had created everything from the Iraq war to the housing crisis .
Herbert 's new slogan was simple enough : " Stop Being Stupid . "
Hollywood is rightly often seen as the psyche of the American public .
So perhaps it is no wonder that the villain of 2008 was Heath Ledger 's chilling portrayal of the Joker .
Transcending the comic book genre , Ledger created a villain who sowed anarchy and chaotic destruction with little regard to motivation or the consequences for the innocent .
For many Americans , who have seen their houses repossessed , their pension funds wiped out and millions of jobs vanish , that is a pretty accurate reflection of what 2008 felt like .
And that sort of destruction produces a cultural cost as well as a cultural shift .
Across America , theatres from Broadway to Hollywood are closing shows as crowds stay away .
Attendances at the cinema are falling , hitting the production of new movies and putting actors and support workers out of jobs .
Art galleries are closing , auction houses are laying off workers .
The art market is going into a recession as deep as the rest of the economy .
The great US sports are all being hit hard in a major blow to national pride .
The National Football League has laid off 10 % of its staff .
Major league baseball has followed suit .
Nascar , whose roaring car fans and Nascar dads became a demographic , has a hiring freeze in place .
And while luxury may fall out of fashion , it is not as if quality is replacing it .
The stores that are booming in these grim times are the huge big - box outlets of Walmart and Target .
Anyone expecting the recession to drive Americans back into the arms of quaint family - owned shops on Main Street is likely to get an ugly wake - up call .
Low - paying Walmart , stuffed with cheap goods from China and with a famously union - busting management , is booming .
So busy were the crowds at one recent sales day at a Long Island Walmart that one employee was crushed to death .
Neither will the recession and the collapse of the car industry immediately bring about a greener , more public transport - friendly America .
Faced with hard times , Americans are not going out to buy electric cars or hybrid vehicles .
They are too expensive .
Instead , they are patching up and mending their old gas guzzlers and keeping them on the road longer .
America 's sense of rugged individualism and distrust of government solutions will remain , for good or for ill .
In this sense Obama 's new America will be just like the old one .
" It is too deeply ingrained , that sense of the individual .
It was right there at the founding of the republic , " said Tobar .
The hard times are also bringing real pain to the most vulnerable .
In Los Angeles , calls to suicide hotlines are up 60 % .
Like the first wave of a pandemic , the crisis is picking off the weak first .
It is hitting the young , who cannot find jobs in a marketplace where employers are not hiring and the old are refusing to retire because of their wrecked pensions .
It is destroying the lives of ten million or more illegal immigrants , who are the first to lose their jobs in a weakened economy .
Americans have even started doing their own gardening , which may be great for them but has put thousands of mainly Mexican landscape crews out of business .
Similarly with restaurants .
As Americans stay at home more , eateries across the nation are closing down and their mostly immigrant kitchen staffs are being laid off .
Money sent back to Mexico by illegal immigrants , which supports many communities there , is down about 7 % on last year .
The truth is that the rippling impact of the broken America that Obama is inheriting has spread out across the world , just as the influence of Reagan 's policies once did .
America now is more frugal , less consumerist and more community - minded .
But it is also poorer , angry and afraid .
Obama 's job is to address those fears .
America is a country desperately looking for a new president who can provide the answers to its problems .
But this will be no easy task .
Obama is truly inheriting a different country than his predecessor did .
It is too early to say whether it is a better one .
Scale of the problem
The size of the US economic collapse is huge .
Here are some of the main problems Barack Obama will have to face as 44th US president .
• Almost $ 7 trillion has been wiped off the stock market as Wall Street posted its worst performance since 1931 .
Millions of retirement plans and pensions were devastated .
• Some reports predict as many as eight million home repossessions in the next four years .
• Obama aides are working on a fiscal stimulus plan worth $ 850 bn over the next two years , much of it for infrastructure projects , in effect a second New Deal .
• More than 1.9 million Americans lost their jobs in 2008 up to November , and the year may end up at 2.3 million , the worst total since 1945 .
• Consumer spending has dropped at the worst rate since 1980 .
• House prices have declined at the fastest rate since the 1930s .
The economy has been shrinking for 12 months with no end in sight , making it the largest downturn for a generation .
Researchers watching the loss of ice flowing out from the giant island of Greenland say that the amount of ice lost this summer is nearly three times what was lost one year ago .
The loss of floating ice in 2008 pouring from Greenland ’s glaciers would cover an area twice the size of Manhattan Island in the U.S. , they said .
Jason Box , an associate professor of geography at Ohio State , said that the loss of ice since the year 2000 is 355.4 square miles ( 920.5 square kilometers ) , or more than 10 times the size of Manhattan .
“ We now know that the climate does n’t have to warm any more for Greenland to continue losing ice , ” Box said .
“ It has probably passed the point where it could maintain the mass of ice that we remember .
“ But that does n’t mean that Greenland ’s ice will all disappear .
It ’s likely that it will probably adjust to a new ‘ equilibrium ’ but before it reaches the equilibrium , it will shed a lot more ice .
“ Greenland is deglaciating and actually has been doing so for most of the past half - century . ”
Box , a researcher with Ohio State ’s Byrd Polar Research Center , along with graduate students Russell Benson and David Decker , presented their findings at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco .

The research team has been monitoring satellite images of Greenland to gauge just how much ice flows from landlocked glaciers towards the ocean to form floating ice shelves .
Eventually , large pieces of these ice shelves will break off into the sea , speeding up the flow of more glacial ice to add to the shelves .
Warming of the climate around Greenland is believed to have added to the increased flow of ice outward from the mainland via these huge glaciers .
Using daily images from instruments called MODIS ( Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ) aboard two of NASA ’s satellites , Box and his team are able to monitor changes in 32 of the largest glaciers along Greenland ’s coast .
They determined that during the summer of 2006 - 2007 , the floating ice shelves at the seaward end of those glaciers had diminished by 24.29 square miles ( 62.9 square kilometers .
But one year later -- the summer of 2007 - 2008 – the ice loss had nearly tripled to nearly 71 square miles ( 183.8 square kilometers ) .
Much of this additional loss is from a single large floating ice tongue called the Petermann glacier
Late this summer , the Ohio State researchers were able to watch as a massive 11 - square - mile ( 29 - square kilometer ) chunk broke off from the tongue of the massive Petermann Glacier in Northern Greenland .
At the time , they also noted that a massive crack further up the ice shelf suggested an even larger piece of ice would soon crack off .
Box said that some findings may have confused the public ’s views of what is happening around Greenland .
“ For example , we know that snowfall rates have increased recently in this region , ” he said , “ but that has n’t been enough to compensate for the increased melt rate of the ice that we ’re seeing now . ”
Their research is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .
Adnan Oktar is fond of challenging people , throwing down the gauntlet to Richard Dawkins and anyone else who thinks they can prove Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Oktar is the public face of the Atlas of Creation , a book of epic proportions – in size and production costs – that has thudded onto 10,000 doormats since its publication in 2006 .
In the ongoing debate about creationism , which has divided academic , scientific and religious communities , the Turk is something of a juggernaut .
His book , weighing the same as a three - year - old child , claims to refute the theory of evolution on every one of its 786 pages and has been lapped up by creationist advocates across the religious and political spectrum .
Almost as promiscuous as the book 's mailing list is the PR machine surrounding Oktar , which bombards journalists with offers of free flights to Turkey to interview the 52 - year - old .
The Guardian paid its own way to Istanbul to meet Oktar , en route to discover more about the Gulen movement , to find the high priest of creationism holding court in a plush gated development in Çengelköy , Istanbul .
His people – an array of sharp - suited , slick and shiny - haired Turks – filmed the interview for their own purposes .
The experience felt sinister , but not as sinister as his retinue refusing to give directions to the interview location .
Instead they insisted that a representative from Global Publishing – publisher of the Atlas – meet us at a gas station and accompany us to the house , a gaudy affair stuffed with figurines and gold - plated fittings .
Oktar , squeezed into a white trouser suit , declines to reveal how the Atlas industry is funded , nor will he say how much he is paid , or indeed whether he is paid at all .
Challenged to explain the apparent contradiction between his beliefs and his plush surroundings , he responds : " I want to resemble Prophet Solomon .
Prophet Solomon was like this .
He used to be well dressed .
He liked being well dressed .
His palace was beautiful ; there were beautiful people around him .
Allah is beautiful .
Allah loves those who are beautiful , wants everywhere to be beautiful .
Paradise is also beautiful .
[ The ] aim of a Muslim should be beauty . "
Not everything that surrounds Oktar is aesthetically pleasing .
He carries around with him a legacy of court appearances and allegations .
In May he was given a three - year prison sentence – which he intends to challenge – following a spate of arrests in 1999 .
Oktar also claims he was thrown in a mental institution as punishment after the publication of his first book .
This " persecution " is , says Oktar , a burden on those called to God : " I'm a writer but at the same time I am a man of dawah [ mission ] .
I support an idea .
Every such person has been put pressure on , defamed , oppressed because of his ideas or assassinated .
Anybody with an idea always sticks to his ideas , keeps spreading his ideas no matter how much he is oppressed , and this is what I think . "
What he thinks , unashamedly and unapologetically , is that Darwin was lying and that there has been no evolution .
He repeats this point throughout the interview .
" Almost 100 million fossils have been unearthed so far .
All of these show that plants , animals , humans and insects have never undergone evolution whatsoever and they were all created in the same way by God .
We can see this fact in each fossil we come across .
There is no fossil proving the contrary .
If they can show one , I will reward them 10 trillion Turkish Lira [ £ 4.4 trillion ] . "
Around a minute later he adds : " There exists no fossil to prove the Darwinian theory .
If they can show a few fossils , I will reward them 10 trillion .
But there are almost 100 million fossils proving creation .
In Turkey , we have exhibited thousands of them . "
Another 30 seconds passes before he says : " Also let them coincidentally produce a single protein that maintains life I will again give 10 trillion TL . "
He summons one of his men to fetch an Atlas of Creation and , thumbing through the pages , shows me why Darwin was wrong .
He explains how the illustrations of fossils prove that no creature has evolved , that all organisms remain the same as they were 100 m years ago .
" There is not one single fossil showing that humans evolved .
For example , a 100 - million - year - old crocodile , it did n't transform into a professor after a while . "
How does he reach these conclusions , I wonder , imagining him to have laboratories and researchers at his disposal .
Oktar himself , by his own admission , has no scientific experience or background .
He is not an academic .
He studied interior design .
Richard Dawkins has pointed out several glaring inaccuracies in The Atlas of Creation , but Oktar retains a powerful influence over various communities – especially Muslim ones – around the world .
Earlier this year two of his representatives gave a talk at University College London at the invitation of the university 's Islamic Society .
Oktar 's website lists more than a dozen such events in the UK in November and December alone .
On another website " complimentary " letters are featured from individuals and organisations following receipt of a Harun Yahya publication .
The content ranges from a polite acknowledgement of the book to wholehearted support for its message .
What does Oktar make of his global impact ?
" Hundreds of professor , scientists , students and public send e-mails to our internet sites …
We receive sincere messages that [ the Atlas ] has a great effect on them …
It made an atomic bomb effect .
Afterwards it had a radiation effect and it keeps going on .
Those who read the book tell others and those tell others .
It has an irresistible power .
That is why it has a demolishing effect . "
An exhausting 90 minutes later , the interview finishes with Oktar and his people disappearing into the basement to pray .
The sun has set and , with no idea where we are , we wait for our escort out of the house .
Time magazine has again demonstrated its irrelevance in the Internet age with a fatuous feature called  25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis . 
The failure here is two - fold : One , the editors  choices of whos to blame , and two , the reader poll ranking those choices .
Lets start with whos on the little list  or more to the point , whos not .
Time did an OK job of unearthing lesser - known names who definitely bear some culpability in the disaster  such as AIGs Joe Cassano , who did much to unleash the nightmare of credit - default swaps .
But how can anyone take this list seriously when it doesnt include Ben Bernanke ?
Yes , Greenspan ( who did make the list ) laid the foundation , but Bernanke built on it with abandon .
Perhaps its because the intelligentsia regards him a genuine scholar on monetary matters  you know , historian of the Great Depression and all that .
A far more respectable background than Greenspan , who hung out with Randians and extolled the virtues of the gold standard .
Wheres Tim Geithner , the guy whose fingerprints were on every boneheaded decision of 2008 , from Bear Stearns to Lehman and beyond ?
And wheres Robert Rubin ?
What , is there some numerical limit of Goldman Sachs guys the editors arbitrarily applied to the list ?
Hank Paulsons on there , so Rubin cant be ?
Seems like Time lays a lot Rubins faux - deregulatory handiwork on the shoulders of Bill Clinton , which I daresay might be a bit unfair .
Clinton revealed his navet on such matters when he remarked early in his first term ,  You mean to tell me that the success of the economic program and my re-election hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of f*$( #@g bond traders ? 
Oh , and then theres Times inclusion of  The American Consumer . 
Oh , that was clever , alright .
I bet the editors were congratulating themselves over the brilliance of that one 
 Gee , this is almost as good as choosing  You as Person of the Year a while back ! 
But this too is too harsh  consumers were merely taking their cues from the politicians and central bankers driving the ship .
Even worse than Times 25 choices are the rankings furnished by its readers .
I guess letting the readers vote is Times idea of Web 2.0 .
But the sheer folly of this is revealed when the number - one choice as ranked by the people who drove by the website , the premier villain of the financial calamity that s befallen us is drum roll , please Phil Gramm .
Phil Gramm ?!?
Yes , his name was the first on the faux - deregulation legislation that repealed Glass - Steagall in 1999 , and hes worthy of inclusion on the list .
But I suspect the reason he ranks so high is one that Time doesnt even mention in its write - up : His Kudlowesque comment last year , while on UBSs payroll and consulting the McCain campaign , that the recession is a mere figment of the collective imagination .
Mustve stuck in the craw of a lot of political junkies .
And if were going to beat up on former members of Congress , shouldnt we beat up on a couple of others who are still around , like Barney Frank or Chris Dodd ?
But whatever .
Times payroll and page count shrinks as the economy and the Internet take their toll .
Let us celebrate .

The Best of Dave Gonigam
Mr Richaud said that Nadia " had metal plates in her back after an operation , and each time she went through the gate , the alarm sounded the guards were never surprised because she had a medical certificate saying she had been operated " .
The Anglican Church of Australia and atheists agree on one thing - that blasphemy should no longer be a criminal offence .
The church and the Atheist Foundation of Australia ( AFA ) are among more than 150 organisations and individuals to make submissions to a freedom of religion and belief project , being run jointly with the Australian Multicultural Foundation , RMIT University and Monash University .
Released in September , the Australian Human Rights Commission discussion paper sets out to examine the extent to which the right of freedom of religion and belief can be enjoyed in Australia .
The church 's six - page submission said blasphemy should be made lawful .
Blasphemy is not a common law offence at a national level but a few federal laws , such as the Broadcasting and Television Act , still include it as an " objectionable item " .
Intel came up with a novel way to show how important the Internet and computing have become in the lives of Americans .
In conjunction with Harris Interactive , the company conducted a survey of adults in the United States under the prosaic banner “ Internet Reliance in Today ’s Economy . ”
But the first “ key finding ” from the study is a little more attention - grabbing .
According to the study , 46 percent of women and 30 percent of men would opt to forgo sex for two weeks rather than give up access to their precious Internet for the same period .
More broadly , those surveyed said access to the Internet ranked highest among the discretionary spending items they could not live without .
Cable television , dining out , shopping for clothes and gym memberships followed in declining importance .
Along similar lines , 61 percent of the women surveyed said they would rather go without TV for two weeks than lose access to the Internet for one week .
Using the data as a means of pitching products fueled by Intel chips , the company said : “ The survey revealed that 65 percent of adults feel they cannot live without Internet access , and even more — 71 percent — responded that it is important or very important to have Internet - enabled devices , such as laptops , netbooks and mobile Internet devices that can provide them with real - time updates on important issues including the state of the economy . ”
Harris Interactive polled 2,119 adults on Intel ’s behalf .
PALM BEACH , Fla. , Feb 6 ( Reuters ) - Israel 's recent war in Gaza has unleashed the worst outbreaks of anti-Semitism in decades , the U.S. head of the Anti-Defamation League said on Friday .
" This is the worst , the most intense , the most global that it 's been in most of our memories .
And the effort to get the good people to stand up is not easy , " Abraham Foxman told Jewish community leaders in a speech in this south Florida resort city .
Foxman said Israel 's military offensive against the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas , which began in the Gaza Strip in late December , had been answered with hatred and attacks against Jews " from Austria to Zimbabwe . "
Most governments were doing too little to stem " an epidemic , a pandemic of anti-Semitism , " he said .
Israel 's military invaded Gaza in a three - week offensive launched in late December , which Israeli leaders said was intended to stop Hamas from launching rocket attacks on Israel from the small territory .
Medical officials said the Israeli offensive killed 1,300 Palestinians , including 700 civilians , prompting widespread international complaints that Israel had used excessive force .
The Anti-Defamation League said recent anti-Jewish attacks triggered by the Gaza conflict ranged from the shooting of two Israelis by a man of Palestinian descent in Denmark to attacks on synagogues in Venezuela , Greece , Chicago and elsewhere .
In Turkey , an Israeli basketball team fled from the court after a crowd turned on them , calling them " killers . "
In Toulouse , France , last month an attack on one synagogue involved two cars packed with fire bombs .
Foxman said that in protests around the world , the Star of David had been equated with the Nazi swastika and Jewish leaders were threatened .
There had also been calls for boycotts of Jewish businesses in South Africa , Italy , Turkey and France .
" We need to insist that the civilized world stand up and say ' No ' in every single country in the international arena to condemn this vicious , hideous violence , " said Foxman , whose organization is a global leader in the fight against anti-Jewish crime .

This one 's not so much about the slick - fielding Big Cat as a person — sure , he did n't get along with reporters , but neither did Ted Williams — as about how he represents the team philosophy :
When the going gets tough , the Yankees go shopping .
After having spent his first ten seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Giants , the Yankees bought Mize in 1949 .
The Yankees won the World Series in each of his five years ( despite often platooning , he was Series MVP in 1952 and an All - Star in 1953 ) , while the Giants earned interest on his $ 40,000 purchase price .
NEW YORK / HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Top technology firms Microsoft , Nokia and Sony warned on Thursday of plummeting demand and pain to come as consumers rein in spending amid a brutal global economic downturn .

Consumer demand for gadgets has slumped as the financial crisis has grown into a broad recession that has already engulfed the United States and much of Europe and has damped demand in once - resilient emerging markets .
“ The consumer electronics sector is following the housing market and car industry into negative territory , ” said Strategy Analytics ’ Neil Mawston .
“ Consumers initially cut back on big purchases such as cars , and now they are starting to hold off on smaller purchases like cell phones . ”
Top cell phone maker Nokia reported a worse - than - expected dive in fourth - quarter profit , and warned the handset market had entered its worst year ever , with volumes to shrink 10 percent from 2008 .
Japan ’s Sony , maker of Bravia flat TVs , Cyber - shot digital cameras and PlayStation games machines , said it would post a bigger - than - expected $ 2.9 billion operating loss this business year due to sliding demand , a stronger yen and restructuring at its ailing electronics operations .
MICROSOFT SHOCKS
And Microsoft Corp shocked Wall Street with disappointing results , and plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs and stop offering profit forecasts for the rest of the fiscal year .
The world ’s top software maker blamed PC market weakness and the popularity of low - cost netbook computers .
Its shares fell 8.6 percent in early trading .
“ Clearly business conditions are worse than people were expecting , ” said Richard Williams , analyst at Cross Research .
“ This is a substantial amount of jobs cuts .
Microsoft has never had a layoff like this in my knowledge and it ’s sending a signal that the times are definitely changing . ”
NOKIA DISAPPOINTS
Nokia ’s said underlying fourth - quarter earnings per share plunged 46 percent year - on - year to 0.26 euros ( $ 0.34 ) , missing the average forecast of 0.30 euros in a Reuters poll .
Its shares fell to 4.5 - year lows on the news .
Profitability at Nokia ’s key handset unit roughly halved to the lowest level this decade , and the firm said it aimed to cut annual costs at its key handset unit by 700 million euros .
Nokia ’s rival , global No. 3 LG Electronics , earlier posted a record quarterly net loss , hit by weakness in its flat - screen affiliate and mobile phones .
Bucking the trend Apple shares rose more than 6 percent on Thursday after its quarterly profit beat expectations on strong iPod and Mac computer sales , and the company gave an outlook that cheered investors .

SONY STRUGGLES
Sony said it now expected an operating loss of 260 billion yen ( $ 2.9 billion ) for the year to end - March , after previously forecasting a 200 billion yen profit .
A downward revision had been expected , but the scale of the cut was far bigger than the 100 billion yen loss predicted by local media .
Sony ’s U.S. shares slumped 13.5 percent .
As inventories pile up and prices tumble , Sony is feeling the pinch across its operations , from semiconductors to movies and insurance .
Analysts say the firm , which generates two - thirds of its revenue outside Japan , needs to take more drastic steps .
Sony competes with Samsung Electronics in TVs , Canon Inc in cameras , and Microsoft and Nintendo in video games .
“ Sony has to consider ways to lower fixed costs not only for its TV business but for the whole company , ” said Nomura Securities senior analyst Eiichi Katayama .
“ It will have to start cutting development costs in addition to production costs . ”
Last month , Sony said it would cut 16,000 jobs , curb investment and pull out of some businesses to slash $ 1.1 billion in annual costs .
