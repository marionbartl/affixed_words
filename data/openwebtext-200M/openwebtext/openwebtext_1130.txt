A brief thought on legal drugs :
When I was a teenager , I thought drugs should be legalized and sold at the same prices .
Why not just put that money toward government costs ?
I thought I was really smart for telling people , “ You know , people are going to take drugs anyway , and making them illegal just makes them more attractive , so legalize and < poof > the problem goes magically away ! ”
As I saw more of the world , I started to see how this scheme would become a scam like anything else .
I then thought it would be best to legalize , nationalize and sell drugs at cost with no age restrictions .
Not only enhance “ freedom , ” but let natural selection reign .
The more I see of life — not going to different places , but getting better at observing what ’s been in front of me all this time — the more I think we need to segregate by type of lifestyle desired .
Some communities will want conservative living .
This means you roughly follow European - style “ Christian ” morals : truthfulness , simple pleasures , hard work , cleanliness , monogamy / chastity , honor , collectivism , helping out those who have fallen prey of chance , and so on .
This does n’t include the liberal fantasy of finding the most screwed up people out there to try to “ help ” so you can prove to your friends what a good egalitarian altruist you are ; it just means helping those in the community who have fallen into hard times … helping them out of those hard times .
For these people , legal drugs would be a big mistake and a bad idea .
So , no legal drugs in those communities .
If they ’re smart they ’ll ban alcohol , cigarettes and junk / fast food as well .
Why not ?
They have at this point taken a stand to their values and these things are outside the scope .
I no longer believe problems go magically away through legislation .
I expect this community would have drug problems , but it would have a punishment that ’s actually effective : exile .
Yep , you do n’t go to jail for doing drugs ; you do n’t get raped by bubbas and vatos and others in the joint ; you do n’t get called Satan .
You just get told that your values system does n’t match and you ’ll be happier elsewhere .
Gentle culling .
On the other hand , other communities would be liberal , and in those , having legal drugs would be a sacrament .
They could pick how they ’d want to implement it .
This means that no one ever goes to jail or faces any penalty for using drugs .
They would be drug free zones .
Twenty years down the road , we could look at each type of community and see which is the place we ’d want to live in .

Legislation to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) may be introduced in the House of Representatives as early as next week .
We must ensure that the President , congress , and our senate leaders speak out and co-sponsor a repeal of this discriminatory legislation .
DOMA denies same - sex couples from receiving federal benefits , even in states where marriages , civil unions , and domestic partnerships are legally sanctioned .
The momentum is on our side with the recent slide of victories in favor of equality , the time is now with a more progressive majority in place to eliminate DOMA .
Go to www.repealDOMAnow.org and join in the campaign for equal rights for all families .
Your BBQ and grilling exploits do n't require a premium barbecue — in fact with a little scavenging you can be sporting a spacious grill for very little cash outlay .
Follow this simple tutorial to turn a 55 - gallon drum into a grill .

Barbecuing is a forgiving process .
You need meat , heat , and a place to combine the two for an extended period of time .
A steel 55 - gallon drum has a large volume — great for keeping a stable temperature — and a broad cross section for laying out a variety of cuts and burgers .
Johnny Blegs , an industrious tinkerer , put together a tutorial at the DIY site Instructables which takes you from acquiring a drum all the way to putting the finishing touches on your new grill .
If you scavenge carefully , as he did , you can get your hands on nearly all the parts for free .
Even if you 're not as lucky , it 's not an expensive project given the size of the grill you end up with .
Check out the tutorial for additional photos and tips .

How to Build Your Own BBQ Barrel [ via Make ]
This , folks , is where I tread into shark infested waters .
But , I figure I have just as much right as anyone raised on the music of that foursome from Liverpool to list out their best tunes .
The Beatles have become , quite possibly , the most talked about , and subsequently fought over band in the history of recorded music .
Seriously !
I highly doubt spirited debates on which of Beethoven ’s Symphonies sucks harder than another have spawned through the course of musical history quite like those about the Beatles ’ songs .
Someone once said … or maybe I read it … that picking a ‘ worst ’
Beatles song is like choosing your least favorite color ; that is to say , you might love pink and not like brown , but you still own brown things .
You know ?
Now Beatlemania has sunk its claws into a whole new generation by not only releasing every one of the band ’s albums on new , remastered sets , but also the juggernaut air - guitar game , Rock Band .
The song list in Rock Band reads like a ‘ Best Of ’ on it ’s own with tunes like : I Am the Walrus , Here Comes the Sun , Dear Prudence , Revolution , and forty - one others .
This is certainly an ideal way for the modern youth to finally understand where much of the shitty mood - rock they listen to has some of its deeper roots .
Now , thanks to this Entertainment Weekly - issued list of the Top 50 beast Beatles songs as well as a far smaller ‘ worst of ’ , I figured it was my turn .
But , the point is , having such a wide array as 50 is a bit of a cop out .
That ’s why I ’ve narrowed it down to a far more difficult Ten .
It just seemed somehow more appropriate to bare more of my chest in preparation for the swinging axes to come .
I do n’t offer myself any more authority to create this collection than anyone else - though I will stipulate that it does help to know a bit about their music more than just a passing , ‘ Oh , that ’s the Beatles , is n’t it ? ’
So , as I don my verbal - protective armor … oh , and if you ’ve read this far , you could be eligible for a prize at the bottom !
Let ’s begin :
10 Any Time At All A Hard Day ’s Night
With a middle eight comprised completely of chords , this song comes in at number 10 … but not so much because of that .
This song fully represents a bit of a transition from the poppy stylings of the Beatles first few albums and truly gives John room to wail .
9 I ’ll Follow The Sun Beatles For Sale
Such a somber tune with not so much a chorus as a new stanza in the sorrowful story .
8 Ticket To Ride Help !
Wiki says , “ Lennon proudly claimed that it was the first heavy metal song given the droning bassline , repeating drums , and loaded guitar lines . ”
And that ’s precisely the point .
The drum beats are particularly amazing .
7 Two of Us Let it Be
Soft. Lilting .
Oddly , originally meant to be harder and ‘ chunkier ’ , this tune feels much like a ’ 50 ’s ‘ Duo ’ tune , which is , ultimately what it is .
6 The Fool on the Hill Magical Mystery Tour
Allegedly a song about the appearance and existence of God as a mysterious man standing on a hill near the band members .
Whatever the reason , it ’s a haunting tune .
5 Please Please Me Please Please Me
One of the band ’s biggest hits in the U.S. thanks in part to its composition .
It ’s mid-spot on this list is , in part , for its tricky vocals .
4 Ob - La -Di , Ob - La-Da The White Album
This one ’s simple : either you like it or you hate it , either way it ’s one of their most popular songs .
With a hefty nod from John ’s writing skills to the surging popularity of Reggae in Britain , life does , indeed , go on… bra .
3 In My Life Rubber Soul
Though this is Lennon ’s description , “ ” ridiculous ” , calling it “ the most boring sort of ‘ What I Did On My Holidays Bus Trip ’ song ” , and later , McCartney , “ I find it very gratifying that out of everything we wrote , we only appear to disagree over two songs ” , the other being “ Eleanor Rigby ” , the song is simply stunning and uses an opening guitar riff that can stand among the greats
2 And Your Bird Can Sing Revolver
The hard - rocking , dual - harmony guitar riff masterfully pulled off by McCartney and Harrison just proves the point that this band contained some of the finest musicians in modern music .
1 Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite Sgt. Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
Bizarre .
Musically complex .
A full - on Carnival atmosphere .
And easily one of The Beatles greatest contributions to the musical world .
Brilliant .

* Office for Web to be released in first half of next year
* Include free consumer version , two business versions
* Microsoft shares rise 2.7 percent ( Adds analyst comment , shares )
BOSTON , July 13 ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O will release three versions of its dominant Office software that users can access over the Web , catching up with products that rival Google Inc GOOG .
O launched three years ago .
The news helped send shares in the world ’s largest software maker up up 2.7 percent by midday , more than double the gain in the Nasdaq Composite Index .
It is the latest salvo in an intensifying war between Microsoft and Google .
[ ID :nN08420017 ]
Google announced plans last week to challenge Windows with a free operating system .
Microsoft introduced a new search engine , Bing , last month .
“ Microsoft is finally making the conversion through the Web - based world .
First , we saw that through Bing .
Now we are seeing that through Office , ” said Jefferies & Co analyst Katherine Egbert .
Microsoft will offer for free to consumers
Web - based versions of its Office suite of programs , including a word processor , spreadsheet , presentation software and a note - taking program .
Microsoft will also host one Internet business version of Office at its own data centers , charging companies a yet - to- be -announced fee .
Companies with premium service contracts will have the choice of running a second Web - based version from their own data centers at no extra cost .
The company hopes to make money by using the free software to lead users to its ad - supported websites , including Bing .
Analysts have said that Bing ’s early signs of success suggest Microsoft may be rounding the corner in efforts to turn around its money - losing Internet division .
Still , a free version of Office could hurt sales of Microsoft ’s top - selling and most profitable unit .
One of Office ’s most popular titles is a home version that sells for $ 150 .
It includes the four programs that Microsoft will give away .
“ Microsoft is in a tough spot .
Their competition is n’t just undercutting them .
They are giving away the competitive product , ” said Sheri McLeish , an analyst with Forrester Research .
The Office division rang up operating profit of $ 9.3 billion on sales of $ 14.3 billion in the first three quarters of the software maker ’s current fiscal year .
McLeish expects Microsoft to overtake Google in the market as the hundreds of millions of people who use Office flock to try out the Internet version .
Microsoft will release the web offerings when it starts selling Office 2010 , it next major release of the product , sometime in the first half of next year .
Its current version came out in January 2007 .
The software maker unveiled an early release on Monday at a conference for business partners in New Orleans .
It will be distributed to tens of thousands of testers .
Company spokeswoman Janice Kapner said the free Web version will provide “ a very rich experience ” and probably have more functionality than Google .
Office 2010 is among a wave of upgrades to Microsoft programs planned over the next year .
A new version of its ubiquitous Windows operating system is coming out in October and a new version of its widely used email server is also in the works .
Microsoft shares rose 2.7 percent to $ 23 , while the Nasdaq was up 1.2 percent at 1777.50 ( Reporting by Jim Finkle ; editing by Richard Chang and Andre Grenon )
Not to totally alarm you but drugs are now legal in Mexico , okay .
Here 's how much you can carry !
For " personal use , " Dr. Gonzo :
The maximum amount of marijuana for " personal use " under the new law is 5 grams - the equivalent of about four joints .
The limit is a half gram for cocaine , the equivalent of about 4 " lines . "
For other drugs , the limits are 50 milligrams of heroin , 40 milligrams for methamphetamine and 0.015 milligrams for LSD .
Navajo native Americans or the Diné live in the southwest of the USA .
They are famous for their sand paintings .
Navajo word for the sand painting is " iikaah " which means " the place where the gods come and go " .
Sand paintings are part of the ceremony performed by the Medicine Man .
He paints by letting the coloured sands flow through his fingers upon the ground of the Navajo traditional hut called hogan , where the ceremony takes place .
Sand paintings can also be created on a buckskin or some other similar cloth .
Materials used to make the painting are ordinary sand of different colours , crushed gypsum ( white ) , yellow ochre , red sandstone , charcoal , mixture of charcoal and gypsum , corn meal , flower pollen , powdered roots and bark .
The information that there are up to 1,000 different sand paintings known by the Navajo nation is absolutely fantastic .
Sand paintings are used only for healing .
Many of them include " yeibicheii " or " yeibeichai " .
They are known as the Holy People .
The Holy People of Navajo are Snake People , Spider Woman , Corn People , First Man , First Woman and others .
During the ceremony Medicine Man chants .
He ask the yeibicheii to come into the painting and heal the person .
The finished painting has to be checked .
Everything has to be in order .
The order and symmetry presented in the painting symbolize the goal or the state of harmony healed person needs to achieve .
Accuracy of the painting correspond with the effectiveness of the sacred tool .
Now when everything is ready the person sits on the sand painting and the Medicine Man continues with the ceremony .
The sand painting is kind of media for spirits to come and go .
It also attracts them .
Person sitting on the sand painting absorbs some of the power of the spirits .
They on the other side absorb the illness of the person which is being healed .
At the end of the ceremony the Medicine Man dips his fingers into a liquid and then splash some of this liquid onto the sand painting .
After the ceremony the sand painting is destroyed .
Some people present at the ceremony take little bit of the sand used and keep it in a pouch around their necks .
The Medicine Man disposes the used sand in a strict ceremony .
He walks along the following route – east – south – west – north .
Then he thanks to Father Sky and Mother Earth and scatters the sand in six directions or just buries it .
Everything from creating the sand painting till its destruction has to be done within 12 hours .
The chant is a name of the sequence during which the healing is done .
All chants are connected with the Navajo origin myth .
The most common chant used in the ceremony is the Blessing Way .
It is short and it can be used in many situations .
Chants can last for 5 to 9 days .
New sand painting is made every day .
The sand paintings are extremely important to the Navajo people .
Some more rules are observed .
Chants about the yeibicheii are sang only by men .
It is believed that this chants can hurt the unborn child .
Women which have menstruation also can not sing the chants .
That means that women of post - menstrual age can somehow participate in the event .
Only real medicine man has the right to create the sand painting .
It takes lot of time and effort to become a medicine man .
He has a special status in every Navajo community .
Before the ceremony medicine man has to pass three day period of purification , fasting , sweating , vomiting , sexual restraint , bathing , and a lone vigil .
During this period he also collects the above mentioned materials he is going to use to make a sand painting .
The medicine man like and other doctor receives a fee for his work .
Fees are agreed before the ceremony and may include money , beads or some cattle .
Sand paintings are truly private stuff of Navajo communities .
To somehow satisfy the interest of curious people kind of fake sand paintings are made .
They do not have the purpose like the real ones used in healing .
They look very nice and are sold to tourists .
Under even the most dire conditions , there is a gold standard when it comes to applying the rule of law .
It was set 65 years ago by a former attorney general of the United States .
At issue today is whether the current attorney general will uphold that standard .
Eric
Holder must decide whether to pursue Bush administration lawyers and one sitting federal judge who set the legal stage for officially sanctioned torture and other degrading practices that violated fundamental principles of international law .
As Mr. Holder wrestles with this decision , he must consider the gold standard set by his predecessor Robert Jackson at Nuremberg .
As World War II drew to a close and the defeat of Nazi Germany became certain , leaders debated what to do with the Nazis .
The Soviet leader , Joseph Stalin , argued that 50,000 German general staff officers should be executed .
In February 1945 at the Yalta Conference , British Prime Minister Winston Churchill favored shooting all the Nazi leaders .
In April , French Gen. Charles de Gaulle came out in favor of a trial .
The British continued to push for summary executions .
After President Harry Truman took office , he opposed executions and supported the idea of creating an international tribunal to try the war criminals .
Soon after Italian leader Benito Mussolini was shot and German leader Adolf Hitler committed suicide , the United States assumed leadership in the creation of a new international court to " expand international penal law beyond the traditional limits of the laws of war . "
On May 2 Truman appointed Robert Jackson as chief counsel to prepare the indictment of the Nazi leaders for atrocities and war crimes .
Jackson felt strongly that it had to be scrupulously fair .
" You must put no man on trial before anything that is called a court if you are not willing to see him freed if proven not guilty . "
His opening statement set the tone for the trials :
" That four great nations , flushed with victory and stung with injury , stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to reason ....
We must summon such detachment and intellectual integrity to our task that this trial will commend itself to posterity as fulfilling humanity 's aspirations to do justice . "
Most , but not all , of the 21 defendants were convicted .
Some observers say that US government employees who carried out acts that the United States had previously called torture ( when done by employees of other governments ) should be left in peace because they were following orders .
But Holder should recall the testimony of William Keitel , the ranking officer of the German Army : " I took the stand that a soldier has a right to have confidence in his state leadership , and accordingly he is obliged to do his duty and to obey . "
The Nuremberg tribunal sentenced Keitel to death by hanging .
Article 8 of the London Charter that established the Nuremberg court made clear that obedience to an order from a superior to commit a crime is not a defense but can be considered only in mitigation of punishment .
Since Nuremberg , following orders has ceased to be a valid defense in international law .
Until 2001 , the United States firmly and rightly adhered to that standard .
If the rule of law is to have any meaning at all , then lawyers must function within accepted boundaries of the legal discipline .
Those boundaries are very large , but they are not unlimited .
The lawyers Holder may pursue advised President Bush that the Geneva Conventions and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , ratified by the American government , could be ignored .
They further argued that acts that America had in the past called torture had now miraculously ceased to be torture .
Such positions put those advisers well outside even the furthest boundaries .
Some acts are morally wrong and cannot be defended .
Neither an order from a superior nor a Justice Department opinion can transform such an act into one that is morally right .
Water boarding is but one example .
There can not be a set of legal rules applicable to other nations and citizens but to which America need not adhere .
To regain its moral legitimacy , American must formally recognize that some of its official post - 9/11 practices were unlawful .
A truth commission composed of Americans and non-Americans would help assure that the inquiry would be fair and free of political grandstanding .
There is good precedent by the Carnegie Foundation .
In the 1940s to the Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal studied the American race problem .
Myrdhal 's report proved influential when the US Supreme Court came to rule on school segregation in 1954 .
That there will be a day of historical reckoning is beyond doubt .
In France the reckoning took 50 years .
In 1995 President Jacques Chirac formally and belatedly acknowledged " the dark hours that sullied our history and injured our traditions " admitting that the French Vichy regime government was complicit in World War II atrocities .
The issue is how quickly it will come .
The attorney general must find the courage to face it now .
Ronald Sokol is a member of the bar in the United States and in France .
He practices in Aix - en - Provence .
He is the author of " Justice After Darwin " and other books and articles .
We noticed the other day that tea partiers are being organized into a campaign of disruption and intimidation at health - care forums .
As Politico reports , the disruptions at town halls are becoming quite common .
It turns out that , as Lee Fang at Think Progress reports , the disruptions are being carefully planned by teabaggers :
This growing phenomenon is often marked by violence and absurdity .
Recently , right - wing demonstrators hung Rep. Frank Kratovil ( D - MD ) in effigy outside of his office .
Missing from the reporting of these stories is the fact that much of these protests are coordinated by public relations firms and lobbyists who have a stake in opposing President Obama ’s reforms .
The lobbyist - run groups Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks , which orchestrated the anti-Obama tea parties earlier this year , are now pursuing an aggressive strategy to create an image of mass public opposition to health care and clean energy reform .
A leaked memo from Bob MacGuffie , a volunteer with the FreedomWorks website Tea Party Patriots , details how members should be infiltrating town halls and harassing Democratic members of Congress .
Some of the advice being dispensed to teabaggers :
– Artificially Inflate Your Numbers : “ Spread out in the hall and try to be in the front half .
The objective is to put the Rep on the defensive with your questions and follow - up .
The Rep should be made to feel that a majority , and if not , a significant portion of at least the audience , opposes the socialist agenda of Washington . ” – Be Disruptive Early And Often : “ You need to rock - the - boat early in the Rep ’s presentation , Watch for an opportunity to yell out and challenge the Rep ’s statements early . ” – Try To “ Rattle Him , ” Not Have An Intelligent Debate : “ The goal is to rattle him , get him off his prepared script and agenda .
If he says something outrageous , stand up and shout out and sit right back down .
Look for these opportunities before he even takes questions . ”
That 's right :
We would n't want an intelligent debate , would we ?
Because God knows what kind of horrible things might result if Americans were thoughtfully informed .
Certainly the conservative agenda would not be realized .
Chris Good at The Atlantic reports that we can expect a long August with these kinds of events :
A website known for posting mug shots and court documents of arrested celebrities is purporting to have " outed " two Canadian residents as ringleaders of an online network of pranksters responsible for " cruel and outrageous hoaxes . "
The Smoking Gun says an unemployed 25 - year - old Windsor , Ont. , man founded the Internet group known as " Pranknet " that is responsible for " vandalism , threats , harassment , impersonation , hacking , and other assorted felonies " targeting Americans .
His online handle is Dex and his " second - in - command " is a 51 - year - old Toronto man who calls himself Hempster , the website says .
Posing as hotel employees , emergency workers and fire alarm officials , Pranknet members have " prodded unwitting victims to destroy hotel rooms and lobbies , set off sprinkler systems , activate alarms " and damage restaurants , the website says .
A number of the pranks were broadcast " live " on the Internet , says Smoking Gun .
Its scathing article provides links to some of them .
Another link is to an Orange County ( Florida ) Sheriff 's Office bulletin warning of a " disturbing trend " of pranksters duping hotel guests to commit destructive acts .
One incident involved a Pennsylvania hotel guest who was woken up by a caller and told a ruptured gas line required urgent precautions .
The guest was told to smash a window as well as the room 's television screen " since the tube contained an electrical charge that could spark an explosion . "
The guest complied , using the toilet 's tank lid as the caller suggested .
When the lid broke , the caller said to toss the TV out the window instead .
" Stepping gingerly around glass shards , the guest complied , " Smoking Gun says .
The website has a photo and comments by Dex , who called police when two Smoking Gun reporters showed up at the Windsor , Ont. home he shares with his mother .
Smoking Gun quotes
Dex as saying the hoodwinked individuals were " responsible for their own actions " and were " sheep " with " no brains of their own . "
When contacted by the Star , spokesmen for the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice would neither confirm nor deny if a Pranknet investigation is underway .
In turn - of - the - century Sweden , cancer - stricken , dying Agnes is visited in her isolated rural mansion by her sisters Karin and Maria .
As Agnes ' condition deteriorates and pain management becomes increasingly more difficult , fear and revulsion grip the sisters , who seem incapable of empathy , and Agnes ' only comfort and solace comes from her maid Anna .
As the end draws closer , long repressed feelings of grudging resentment and mistrust cause jealousy , selfishness , and bitterness between the siblings to surface .

Most TV commercials are annoying , but the tech industry takes the cake for making ads so bad that you have to question if it was intentional .
Ever seen Snakes on a Plane ?
Now imagine that the creators were given the Microsoft account and told , " Make us look cool with one of those ' viral videos ' that we hear the kids are so excited about these days . "
What else explains the awfulness of these commercials and infomercials ?
Who , in their wildest imagination , would think a video of a woman puking on her husband — three times — would increase the appeal of Internet Explorer 8 ?
Or that a creepy , unbelievably diverse group of weirdos hosting a " Launch Party " would help sell Windows 7 ?
We were close to puking ourselves .
Those are just a few examples of what you 're about to witness .
Here , we round up a list of the 8 most God-awful , weird , and horrible - beyond - apprehension tech video ads we 've ever seen .
In Jay Leno fashion , we 'll run down the list in reverse order , from least offensive to most offensive , for the sake of your stomachs .
Hang on tight .
8. MSI 's Butt - Crack - Compatible Notebooks
We can only imagine the altered mental state that MSI 's marketing team was when it concocted this bizarre ad .
We 're sure these spandex - clad actors are n't really catching notebooks with their butts — and it's a little funny — but geez Louise , it tickles us .
That does n't mean we 're perverts , does it ?
7. Nintendo's Cross - Dressing Legend of Zelda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmR0d8MJ-74
In conversations about the Legend of Zelda videogame series , we 're well aware that a lot of people mistakenly call Link , the main character of the game , Zelda .
That 's a funny mistake , because Link is the dude , and Zelda is the chick .
Perhaps Nintendo was poking fun at the Zelda - Link mixup when the company decided to cast a woman to play Link in this old Legend of Zelda : Link to the Past commercial .
That or Nintendo is just weird .
Actually , the rap song and the dancing make the latter theory seem stronger .
6. GE's Soulful Tribute to Its Locomotives https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWiK8iotJU
Why are there even GE Locomotive commercials ?
Who the hell is going to go out and buy a locomotive after watching a video on YouTube ?
We can tell this was an attempt at a clever joke , but the grizzly , bearded actors , who are probably just glad to have jobs at all in this day of industrial offshoring , do n't deliver .
Bonus :
There 's a keytar !
( Thanks for suggesting this one , @ CycleFreak ! )
5. Pets.com's Tone - Deaf Sock Puppet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXHrlm5Nk5w
Pets.com should 've taken a tip from the Taco Bell chihuahua , who was a charming cutie .
Boy was this website lazy with this sorry excuse for a puppet .
It looks like it was haphazardly stitched together by Rosie O'Donnell 's character in Another One Rides the Bus .
If you 're a pet community website , just use a real freaking dog !
And this video , which features the sock puppet singing in a painfully off - key way , is the worst of the bunch .
Even the nameless Wired.com staffers who kinda liked the sock puppet hate this commercial .
( Good call on this one , @ AlexisMadrigal )
4. Palm's Creepy Ice Maiden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKSD30jl_h0
An affectless , eyebrowless lady soft - talking like Christian Bale certainly sent shivers down our spines , but we doubt it really helped sell Palm Pre phones .
Bonus : parody videos like this one !
3. Microsoft's Cringeworthy Songsmith Spot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oGFogwcx-E
Microsoft should publish a book called How to Annoy Consumers and Humiliate People .
In American Idol fashion , Microsoft must have done a casting call for people with laryngitis , just to demonstrate that Songsmith can give even the worst vocalists the power to sing .
Well , the ad convinces us of the complete opposite .
Thanks to the trauma from watching this video , I probably have a psychological trigger that compels me to immediately punch a person in the jaw if I ever see them singing in front of a computer .
( Kudos for calling this one out , @a1 by and @pushkin504 ! )
2. Microsoft's Cheesy Windows 7 Launch Party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oWWt_L-qeo
This one 's especially astounding because the Windows 7 operating system is surprisingly cool — so it was difficult to conceive that the product 's marketing team could be so utterly lame .
You'd have to be a neutered space alien to identify with any of these soulless beings gathering for a " launch party " for Windows 7 .
Because , sure , sane human beings do that .
The last time I saw a video with such an awkwardly eerie vibe was when I wrote a research paper on the Heaven 's Gate cult .
Yeah , you know — that video they shot right before they committed mass suicide .
Same feeling .
The only thing that saves this informercial is that there 's a shorter parody video , which is hilarious .
This video is so bad , it almost takes the cake for the most horrible tech promo video of all time – except for the fact that Microsoft made one even worse earlier this year .
1. Microsoft's OMGIGP , a.k.a.
That Puking Video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbwyiPTnqIE
When Microsoft met with me to talk about Internet Explorer 8 , the company reps said Microsoft 's goal with IE8 was to erase perceptions of Internet Explorer 6 .
Apparently lurid images of puking were part of that strategy .
Sorry , Microsoft , but I still remember the atrocious IE 6 as clearly as the time I suffered from near - death pneumonia .
And your puke - fest video makes me want to keep a more - than - safe distance from IE 8 .
Drilling into the crust may provide insight into earthquakes and tsunamis ( Image : Jamstec / CDEX )
It sounds like the beginning of a Godzilla movie .
Off the coast of Japan , scientists are using a powerful drilling method for the first time in an underwater earthquake zone .
As long as no sleeping monster is rudely awakened by their methods ( and no geological nightmares ) , the team hopes to learn about the frictional properties of the rock in the area in order to better understand how earthquakes and tsunamis form .
The CHIKYU research vessel , operated by the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology , has drilled to a depth of nearly 1.6 kilometres beneath the seafloor while floating on 2 kilometres of ocean .
To achieve greater depths than with normal methods , the team uses a technique known as riser - drilling .
This relies on recirculating viscous “ drilling mud ” to maintain pressure balance in the borehole .

According to Bill Ellsworth , of the United States Geological Survey , petroleum drilling on land and from stable ocean oil - platforms regularly reaches depths of between 5 and 8 kilometres .
The deepest land - based hole , drilled for scientific research on the Kola Peninsula in Russia , reaches more than 12 kilometres , but drilling from a ship is a different matter .
‘ One chance ’
Nancy Light of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program , the organisation that coordinates research drilling projects like CHIKYU , says that this new vessel was designed to drill to depths of 12 kilometres beneath the seafloor , while floating on kilometres - deep , sometimes tumultuous seas .
The team say there is no chance of triggering a quake , but despite that the mission is technically difficult .
Ellsworth says that the scientists have one shot to properly install the sensors in the borehole , so they will have to get it right the first time .
“ It ’s risky science , no question about that , ” he adds .
While seafloor drilling at Kola - rivalling depths remains to be achieved , the team ’s current drilling has already yielded insight into the structure and formation of an area around the Nankai Trough ( see map of the region ) , off the south - east coast of Japan .
The trough is the result of a subduction zone that is created as one piece of oceanic crust – the Philippine plate – is forced beneath another – the Eurasian plate .
The huge geological forces at work here are capable of generating magnitude 8 earthquakes and large tsunamis that periodically threaten Asia .
In the coming years , the team plans to put pressure and temperature sensors in the borehole in an effort to find signals that may one day help predict quakes in the region .
UPDATED :
ACORN , calling the actions of some of its employees “ indefensible , ” has suspended advising new clients as part of its service programs and is setting up an independent review to see what happened .
ACORN chief executive Bertha Lewis said in a written statement that she was “ ordering a halt to any new intakes into ACORN ’s service programs until completion of an independent review . ”

• TWT RELATED STORY : ACORN fires back at critics after sting
The actions were taken , she said , “ as a result of indefensible action of a handful of our employees . ”
Videos of ACORN workers giving tax advice to people posing as prostitutes and other revelations have led to growing criticism of the organization in recent days .
Lewis continued : “ We have all been deeply disturbed by what weve seen in some of these videos .
I must say , on behalf of ACORN ’s Board and our Advisory Council , that we will go to whatever lengths necessary to reestablish the public trust .
For nearly forty years , ACORN has given voice to communities , and gotten results .
Right now , our nearly 500,000 member are working their hearts out for quality , affordable healthcare for every American and to help stop the foreclosure crisis .
We must get this process right , so the good work can go forward . ”
ACORN , an advocacy group , has fired at least four employees after hidden camera videos showed the group ’s workers giving financial advice to women posing as prostitutes .
The firings occurred in the group ’s Washington and Baltimore offices .
ACORN has been targeted for years by conservative groups that consider it a sometimes unsavory arm of Democratic electoral politics .
The Senate voted earlier this week to deny funding to the organization to help with the next census .
ACORN stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now .
It advocates for poor people .
It conducted a large voter registration effort last year and some employees were accused of submitting false registration forms with names such as “ Mickey Mouse . ”
ACORN has said only a handful of employees submitted false registration forms .
The first videotape was made public on a political blog , BigGovernment.com .
In her statement , Lewis said “ no new intakes will be accepted into ACORN ’s offices for service programs , effective immediately . ”
She also said the group would begin “ immediate in - service training for all frontline staff . ”
In addition , she said , “ ACORN ’s independent Advisory Council will help select an independent auditor / reviewer no later than September 18th to review all of the systems and processes called into question by the videos . ”
In early 2009 , ACORN set up an independent Advisory Council to help put together a new management team under Lewis .
Lewis was appointed to the job in the fall of 2008 after disclosure of a set of improper management decisions by the founder of the organization .
The Advisory Council includes John Podesta , president of the liberal Center for American Progress ; Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , a former lieutenant governor of Maryland ; Andrew Stern , international president of Service Employees International Union ; Henry Cisneros , a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ; John Banks , vice president of Government Relations Con Ed ; and Eric Eve , senior vice president of Global Consumer Group , Community Relations , of Citigroup .

While I am bearish on a 2/3 year horizon for certain , I have been cautiously trying to pick spots to sell risky assets for the past 3 to 4 months .
Over the past 2 weeks I have become more vocal because a lot of signs that a possibly significant reversal ( think more of a 10 % move than a 3 % move in major equity indices ) could be in the works .
The fundamental framework is simple : we are experiencing ( experienced ? ) a bounce in industrial production and it led markets up , while they were at the same time being supported by many incentives produced by the government to invest in distressed securities .
Given the amount of shorts the bounce also became a squeeze , and in turn it appears that the positive sentiment has spread .
Bear in mind the consumer is sensitive to a turn around by 50 % in equity markets , and it can help her / him forget partly his precarious situation , or at least give him hope .
Hope was also made more affordable by the " hope anything " programs in place , and the " cash to buy a car you do n't need " incentives , not to mention tax rebates .
This created an explosive cocktail , and while I think markets have gone way to far on the upside , and very little has been done to solve the real issues , one must recognize the move could potentially go a lot higher .
Unlike rates which can hardly go much lower than zero , stocks can go just about anywhere from these levels .
That 's why it 's key to watch the markets and see what indication they give us that we may , or may not , be turning soon .
First we tested the 88 week moving average , and like it or not , it has been your best friend over the past 20 years to trade stocks on a big macro picture .
Some ask why 88 ?
Well , that 's because it corresponds well to the pace of the long term dynamics for the S&P market .
Envelop theory states that to call a change of trend in a bull market for example , one need to find the moving average that best covers all the lows , and if there is one with a great fit , wait for a break to be confirmed , but in doubt buy every test of this support ( and conversely for bear markets ) .
Knowing that and looking at the 88 week moving average , it 's pretty clear ...
I added a few charts showing that oil has clearly broken support on the close last night , and is confirming the break today .
GBPUSD , which has traded in sync with risky assets for the most part on the big picture , triggered a H&S this morning with downside potential of at least 1.52 .
USDCAD as can be seen exhibits a lot of bullish divergence , and it is attemtping to break out through the resistance of the downtrend channel and out of a range that has been relatively important for the pair .
A break needs to be confirmed on a close though .
On the flipside , the confirmation level to validate a change in trend in the S&P future is a break of the support line at 1,041 .
That has not happened yet , so one could expect either a bounce or the end of the down move around that level .
So most asset classes indicate a break , but equities do n't for now .
Save some bullets , maybe cash in a little bit if you shorted the resistance yesterday , and observe with attention .
Key levels are all around us , and we already had a head fake reversal in June .
The number of people trying to short is what makes it easy for carry traders to squeeze .
Until the pain treshold of carry trades is crossed time is their ally .
Good luck trading ,
Nic

En 2010 estará listo el resolutivo del caso Cacho En 2010 estará listo el resolutivo del caso Cacho
Ante la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos , adelantó Lydia Cacho
Miguel Ángel Cordero
De acuerdo a información de medios veracruzanos , la periodista agregó que sacerdotes y políticos pederastas gozan de la protección de las autoridades mexicanas Para 2010 , la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos ( CIDH ) tendrá listo el resolutivo sobre el caso de pederastia que involucra al gobernador de Puebla , Mario Marín Torres , y al director del ISSSTE , Miguel Ángel Yunes Linares , adelantó Lydia Cacho Ribeiro .
De acuerdo a información de medios veracruzanos , la periodista agregó que sacerdotes y políticos pederastas gozan de la protección de las autoridades mexicanas .
No obstante , reconoció que ese delito no es exclusivo de funcionarios y curas aunque son los principales involucrados .
Lo anterior , luego de que la escritora Lydia Cacho asistiera como invitada de honor a la inauguración del Segundo Congreso Internacional sobre Explotación Sexual Infantil y Trata de Personas , en el World Trade Center , en Boca del Río .
La periodista dijo que el organismo internacional le comunicó que resolverá el año entrante el caso que ella misma denunció públicamente a través de su libro
Los demonios del edén una red de pederastia que implica a los dos personajes mencionados , además del empresario Jean Succar Kuri ,
Tal revelación le fue comunicada ayer por la CIDH , organismo que además le otorgó medidas cautelares de protección a ella , su familia y a las personas con quienes laboran en el Centro Integral de Atención a la Mujer ( CIAM ) en Cancún .
Este jueves , a través de un exhorto , la CIDH solicitó al gobierno de México adoptar las medidas necesarias para garantizar la vida e integridad de la periodista Lydia Cacho .
Las medidas cautelares fueron otorgadas el pasado 10 de agosto , pero hechas públicas apenas este jueves .
Durante su discurso en el evento que presidió , Lydia Cacho no mencionó el cargo ni el nombre del mandatario poblano , aunque se refirió a él como “ el góber precioso ” .
Trascendió que la invitación que recibió Cacho provino de la presidenta del DIF estatal , Rosa Borunda de Herrera , y del gobernador Fidel Herrera Beltrán , quien también fue evidenciado en una llamada telefónica con Kamel Nacif .
En entrevista previa a su participación en el congreso , dijo que México ocupa el segundo lugar en delitos de pornografía infantil a nivel mundial .
Además , repudió el nombramiento de Arturo Chávez Chávez al frente de la Procuraduría General de la República , funcionario que expresó off the record : “ Las matan porque son prostitutas ” .
También lo acusó de negligente por su desempeño en torno a los casos de asesinatos de mujeres en Ciudad Juárez cuando él fue procurador de Chihuahua .

Over the last five years or so , I ’ve often asked , “ Is Bill Maher really that ignorant ? ” I ’ve come to the conclusion that he is , and a couple of weeks ago laid out the evidence why right here on this very blog .
( Lately Maher has been issuing Tweets that call people who get flu shots “ idiots . ” )
Indeed , I even included in the post perhaps the most hilariously spot - on riposte to Maher ’s crankery .
This occurred when Maher proclaimed that he never gets the flu and would n’t get the flu on an airplane , which his guest Bob Costas to exclaim in exasperation , “ Oh , come on , Superman ! ”
Bob Costas won my respect that day .
My favorite part was when Maher looked at his guests , who were shifting in their seats , all embarrassed and unsure of what to say , and observed , “ You all look at me as though I ’m crazy . ”
Why , yes , Bill , we do .
Let ’s put it this way .
When Age of Autism likes you , you have a serious problem when it comes to being credible about medical science .
In that same post , I complained about Maher ’s being awarded the Richard Dawkins Award by the Atheist Alliance International ( AAI ) .
I liken giving Bill Maher an award that lists “ advocates increased scientific knowledge ” anywhere in its criteria , not to mention being named after Richard Dawkins , to giving Jenny McCarthy an award for public health , given that , at least when it comes to medicine , Maher is anti-science to the core .
Along the way , I ’ve ruffled the feathers of some of both Dawkins ’ and Maher ’s fans .
I regret nothing .
Not only do I regret nothing , but on September 18 , a mere two weeks before the AAI Convention , Maher provided me with more ammunition .
In fact , this is probably the most blatant bit of crankery I ’ve seen from Maher in a long time .
Watch and learn .
The “ alternative medicine ” nuttery begins at around the 0:50 mark :
Laetrile ?
Really ?
Laetrile ??
How 1970s cancer quackery !
The segment above comes from something called Overtime With Bill Maher .
Basically , it ’s a segment in which the audience submits questions , a few of which Maher and crew pick to respond to on the web after Real Time with Bill Maher airs .
This particular edition aired last Friday , and in it Maher makes several nonsensical and obviously erroneous claims .
It begins with a question from an audience member : “ Will the implication of universal health care help or hinder alternative medicine ? ”
You know that ’s just like holding a piece of bloody , dripping meat in front of a pit bull that has n’t eaten in two days , and Bill goes after it just like the pit bull would tear into a piece of meat–and with just as much grace .
Well , Bill does n’t do it immediately .
Rather , he does it after his guest , Jeffrey Toobin , paraphrases one of my favorite sayings by pointing out that “ medicine is medicine , ” continuing , “ If it works , it works .
If it does n’t , it does n’t . ”
To which Bill hops in ranting , “ That ’s not how this country works . ”
Do n’t we at SBM know it , Bill !
Quackademic medicine is infiltrating medical academia at every level .
How this country works these days is to accept pseudoscience and quackery as being on par with scientific medicine .
How this country works is for woo- friendly legislators like Senator Tom Harkin to force pseudoscience upon the NIH and to try to slip provisions in one of the Senate versions of health care reform legislation declaring “ alternative ” medicine practitioners to be considered legitimate health care practitioners .
None of this keeps
Maher from proclaiming that “ alternative medicine often is illegal in this country . ”
As if that would be such a bad thing .
Personally , I ’d say right to Maher ’s face that it ’s a good thing to protect patients from charlatans who claim to be able to cure terminal cancer , like Hulda Clark or Nicholas Gonzalez , every bit as good as Bill thinks it would be to protect the public from large pharmaceutical companies .
In fact , I ’d tell Maher that , in my not - so - humble opinion , the problem with this country is not that “ alternative medicine ” often is illegal , but rather that the most egregious examples of quackery are not illegal often enough and that quacks all too frequently quite literally get away with murder .
Maher then goes on to say that you can go to jail for “ so much as suggesting any alternative treatment for cancer . ”
Wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , Bill .
I bet Bill ca n’t name a single person who has ever been sent to jail for “ suggesting any alternative treatment for cancer . ”
( Not even Kevin Trudeau , although he did go to jail for credit card fraud years before he discovered “ alternative medicine . ” )
But Maher can go on to rant about how Toobin supposedly does n’t “ understand how much the pharmaceutical companies have their tentacles wrapped around the government in this country . ”
Toobin then ( weakly ) challenges Maher by asking , “ For selling people Laetrile ? ”
Maher responds that he “ does n’t know whether Laetrile works , ” but that he knows that “ the shit we ’ve tried for the last 50 years does n’t .
I know they ’ve made no progress as far as cancer in this country .
So , yes , there are people who actually go out of this country when they get cancer .
Some of them come back alive after a death sentence .
But in this country you ca n’t talk about that .
I might get arrested right now . ”
Wrong , again , Bill .
No one ’s going to throw you in jail for spouting your ignorant nonsense .
I would , however , love to know who these patients are who went out of the country for “ alternative ” medicine and survived ?
Coretta Scott King ?
Farrah Fawcett ?
Michael Landon ?
Steve McQueen ( who , by the way , used Laetrile , among all sorts of other “ alternative ” or “ unconventional treatments ” ) ?
Really , Bill , who are these survivors who were given death sentences and then remarkably cured at foreign clinics ?
Inquiring minds want to know !
Also , we do know that Laetrile does n’t work .
The studies were done well over 20 years ago and were resoundingly negative .
The NCI states that Laetrile does n’t work against cancer , and patients can suffer complications of cyanide toxicity from it .
If you “ do n’t know ” whether laetrile works or not , it ’s because you ’ve drunk the Kool Aid .
Bill ’s other problem is a common one .
Like all too many people , he appears to view cancer as one disease .
It ’s not .
In some cancers , we ’ve made enormous progress in the last 50 years .
For instance , most leukemias and lymphomas were death sentences 50 years ago .
Now many of them are highly treatable and even curable .
Lest you think that I ’m cherry picking the easy , another example is colorectal cancer .
For patients with metastatic colorectal cancer , for example , the time of survival and quality of life can both be significantly improved by the new generation of chemotherapeutic , antiangiogenic , and targeted therapies , as The Cheerful Oncologist pointed out two years ago .
In fact , I liked The Cheerful Oncologist ’s posts so much that I ’m going to steal the graph that he stole from this article to drive the point home :
As one can see , the survival for untreated metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) is in the range of 4 - 6 months .
Older adjuvant chemotherapy regimens could result in median survivals of approximately 12 months .
Over the last decade or so , recently developed chemotherapy regimens have pushed the median survival to nearly two years .
In fact , my best friend ’s father is evidence of that .
He has metastatic colorectal cancer but has been doing well for quite a while now .
He even still plays golf regularly .
He knows that sooner or later his cancer will claim him , but in the meantime he ’s enjoying his life for as long as possible , which is all that any of us can really do .
As the authors conclude :
FU has been the cornerstone of treatment for mCRC for over 40 years .
In the past few years , the introduction of more effective chemotherapeutic agents and targeted agents with their promising activities and mild toxicity profiles has pushed the overall median survival time from 12 months to 2 years .
However , as discussed , there are still many challenges facing oncologists .
Research is ongoing to understand these issues , and significant advances are expected through the implementation of well - designed clinical trials and continued preclinical investigation .
Moreover , if you look at the SEER Database , you will see a much different story .
For all cancers , five year survival has improved from 50.2 % in 1975 to 68.2 % in 2001 , and 10 - year survival has increased from 44.5 % in 1975 to 60 % in 1996 .
Moreover , it ’s not just quantity of life but quality of life .
For instance , thirty or forty years ago , women underwent either radical or modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer .
These days , maybe 25 % still require mastectomy and virtually none of them require radical mastectomy .
( Indeed , I ’ve never even seen a radical mastectomy , and I began my surgical residency in the late 1980s . )
That ’s because surgeons , as part of multidisciplinary teams including medical oncologists and radiation oncologists , figured out that it ’s usually not necessary to do a mastectomy to treat breast cancer .
The same survival rates can be obtained with less invasive surgery .
The same is true in other areas , such as the aforementioned colorectal surgery , where more and more colon operations are being done using minimally invasive methods .
It was science that accomplished this .
Not the outrageous quackery that Bill Maher promotes .
Science .
Bill Maher does n’t know what he ’s talking about .
As usual , at least when it comes to medical science .
True , we have definitely not made as much progress as we would desire , and there are still a depressing number of cancers for which we still ca n’t do much , if any better , than a couple of decades ago , but overall there has been slow progress .
It remains incredibly hard to have to tell so many cancer patients that we cannot cure them , but that there remain a number of patients with cancer that we can’t cure does n’t mean we ’ve made “ no progress . ”
That does n’t stop Maher from parroting the usual alt - med nonsense about “ wholistic ” medicine as opposed to drugging people with the evil products of the even more evil big pharma , after which he finiishes with his usual rant about Western medicine , in which he claims that the reason “ people are so sick ” is because “ Western medicine …only treats symptoms .
That ’s how they keep the scam going .
If you only treat symptoms , of course people are always going to be sick .
Yes , Nasonex will stop you from sniffling .
It will shove the mucus right down your throat . ”
I wish someone would shove the utter nonsense that Bill Maher spews on such a regular basis back down his throat .
I know some of my readers will think I ’m beating a dead horse over this .
I also know that I have n’t exactly endeared myself to AAI members by harping on just how idiotic it was to have chosen Maher for any award that has the word “ science ” anywhere in its criteria , given his support of anti-vaccine views , his apparent sympathy for HIV / AIDS denialism , and now his belief in cancer quackery shown in the video clip above .
It would n’t have mattered on iota to me if the AAI had chosen to give Maher a “ best atheist movie ” award or some sort of activism award .
But it did n’t .
It chose to give Maher and award , one of the criteria of which involves advocating “ increased scientific knowledge , ” and that irritated me mightily .
I even realize that my expressing just how disappointed I was in Richard Dawkins ’ nonchalant , “ he ’s anti-religion ; I do n’t know about his views on alt - med and really do n’t care ” reaction to criticism of the selection does n’t endear me to Dawkins ’ fans .
I do n’t care .
His “ shruggie ” attitude towards someone who should have been featured in the second part of Dawkin ’s documentary , The Enemies of Reason , as one of the quacks he skewered demands his being called out , preferably at the AAI conference , preferably along with Bill Maher .
O'Donnell 's argument clearly illustrates the utter sham that are the Republican talking points with these simple questions .
" Will you move to repeal Social Security , a socialist program ? "
" Will you introduce legislation to end Medicare , a government run , single - payer , socialist program ? "
You cannot say that you are against socialist style programs and government run healthcare without condemning these programs .
Well , you can , but then you would have to um .....
LIE !
Rep. Culberson had the best " deer in the headlights " moment that I have seen from a politician in quite some time .
And that moment exposed the soft underbelly .
This is the argument that needs to be made to those that would demagogue this issue in those terms , loudly .
Go to GOP townhalls ( if those gutless wonders would have them ) and ask them these same questions .
Signs on display should read " Rep. ' X ' why do you want to end Social Security ? "
And , " Why are you taking grandma 's Medicare away ? "
Submit letters to the editor of your local paper .
Write to your Congressperson and your Senator and get them on record as supporting these programs that they publicly say are reprehensible .
Go to their offices .
Demonstrate !
We could use a bit of 60's style activism right now .
Arm yourself with the facts , and stridently put them out there and dare them to challenge .
For example , here is a fact sheet for HR 676 that lays out costs and benefits of a US single - payer system .
My point is , we all must be the pit bull that O'Donnell was in this interview .
It 's this tone that is carrying the media battle and public opinion for corporate interests .
I know that this kind of intensity may not come easy to those of us on this side of the argument .
Education breeds tolerance , which breeds civility .
But we need to channel our inner Paddy Chayefsky who penned the phrase in " Network " , " I 'm mad as hell , and I 'm not going to take it anymore . "
UPDATE
Thanks to all , first time on the REC list .
And it could n't come at a more timely moment .
I go into hospital on Monday , where I fully expect to hear the words " you have cancer " .
My doctor has come out and said everything but those words .
If I may be personal , it 's cancer of the bladder , but it appears that it was caught early and everything I have read on the subject indicates that bladder cancer has very good outcomes when found early .
I have insurance , fortunately , but the deductibles and payouts for me will be somewhere between the moderate and extreme range .
Although the immediate outcomes may be favorable , this will now be a constant in my life and a constant in my budget from this day forward .
Switching jobs or starting that small business is out of the question now .
This just got intensely personal for me .
WASHINGTON -- ESPN and Major League Baseball have agreed to switch the starting time of a New York Yankees - Boston Red Sox game to avoid conflicting with Yom Kippur , the holiest day on the Jewish calendar .
ESPN told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Sept. 27 game was returning to its original start time of 1 p.m. ET .
It had been changed to 8 p.m. ; Yom Kippur , a day of fasting and atonement , begins at sundown that evening .
" I am pleased we were able to resolve this sensitive issue that impacted many baseball fans and are able to move the game at Yankee Stadium to 1 p.m. , " Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement .
ESPN will still televise the game .
Earlier this year , the NFL agreed to move the start time of the New York Jets ' home game against the Tennessee Titans on the same day from 4:15 p.m. to 1 p.m .
That change was made after Jets owner Woody Johnson sent a letter to commissioner Roger Goodell suggesting the switch , so that fans could arrive home before sundown .

Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich absolutely tore it up today on Capitol Hill .
In this video he is questioning Dr. David Gratzer of the Manhattan Institute .
One need only read the title of Gratzer 's new book , " The Cure : How Capitalism Can Save American Healthcare " ( complete with forward written by Milton Friedman ) to know what side of the debate he was on .
Gratzer was there to spew lies and right wing talking points about the Canadian health care system , but Kucinich was n't having any of it .
As always , my hat goes off to Dennis !
You can watch the entire CSPAN video here .
HAT - P - 7b is a bizarre slice of hell , a giant gas planet 40 percent larger than Jupiter that orbits so close to its sun that its year lasts just 2.2 Earth days and its atmosphere is more than 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit .
You would n’t want to live there .
But when Jon Jenkins took a deep breath at the Ames Research Center early one May morning and looked at the first scientific data flowing from NASA ’s newly launched Kepler spacecraft , he could hardly have been happier .
The Kepler spacecraft , for which Jenkins is the lead mission analyst , had detected the atmosphere of the planet , one of several hundred known “ exoplanets ” that circle other stars .
The result shows that Kepler ’s instruments are discriminating enough to find other planets similar to Earth circling other stars , planets potentially capable of supporting life .
“ I said , ” recalled Jenkins , a scientist with the SETI Institute , recounting his first words to his colleagues on the morning when he was the first to see the data , — ‰’ I think we are looking at our first science paper . ’ “
Consider it a scientist ’s version of “ Hallelujah ! ” NASA announced the result Thursday morning , which means that the $ 591 million Kepler mission being managed from the NASA center at Moffett Field is poised to discover in coming years whether there are many more planets like Earth , capable of supporting life .
HAT - P - 7 b does not .
But the detection of its atmosphere showed that more than a decade of hard work and faith for Jenkins and his fellow researchers at Ames had paid off .
The method used by the Kepler spacecraft to find planets in other solar systems — detecting minute fluctuations in light caused by a planet as it moves across the face of a distant star and then vanishes behind it — was working .
A gas giant like HAT - P - 7b is among the easiest for Kepler to track down because it is so large and because it is so close to its star , meaning its orbital period is very short and there are frequent transits across the face of its star by the planet .
Detecting Earthlike planets , which orbit more distantly from their suns and therefore have much less frequent transits , will take significantly more time .
HAT - P - 7b is one of about 350 known “ exoplanets ” orbiting other stars that have been detected by ground - based observations or spacecraft .
In the first 10 days ’ worth of data from the Kepler following its launch in early March , scientists were able to analyze the light signatures from 52,496 stars , including one in the constellation Cygnus , 1,043 light years from Earth , which showed distinctive drop - offs in its light emissions every two days .
“ It was something that was really exciting , ” said Jenkins , remembering the morning of May 14 , when the first scientific data was coming in from Kepler .
He was the first in his office at Ames that morning .
The Ames scientists began submitting proposals for the Kepler mission in 1992 , but NASA rejected their proposals four times , before finally approving one in 2001 .
The spacecraft was supposed to launch in 2005 , but budgetary and hardware problems forced delays .
A lot was riding on that first data and Jenkins was nervous .
“ I came in early that morning — I was holding my breath in anticipation , ” he said .
“ I procrastinated a little bit , and made some coffee .
I fiddled around a little before I started looking through the light curves to see what we would see . ”
Jenkins ’ computer showed distinctive drops in the light coming from HAT - P - 7 b ’s star , which he excitedly showed to Bill Borucki , principal investigator for the Kepler mission , and other Kepler scientists .
Borucki “ started trying to come up with arguments for how the interpretation might be wrong , ” Jenkins said .
“ One by one we knocked down all of Bill ’s objections . ”
Their findings were published in the journal Science on Thursday , an article Jenkins co-authored .
The Kepler scientists believe their spacecraft should at least double the number of known planets , creating a galactic “ census ” that will prompt whole new theories on how solar systems form .
With the result announced Tuesday , Kepler appears ready to start tallying new planets .
“ It was , ” Jenkins said of the realization that the probe was working , “ just really amazing . ”

This mosaic of image swaths from Cassini's Titan Radar Mapper features a large dark region that has many characteristics in common with lakes , including its channels and interior , yet its differences distinguish it from other similar features .
At the top ( north ) , the feature has characteristics of a shoreline , with round bay - like margins and channels that drain into it ; at left ( west ) and right ( east ) it is rimmed by bright , feathery , branching channel - like structures .
Saturn ? smoon
Titan may be worlds away from Earth , but the two bodies have somecharacteristics in common :
Wind , rain , volcanoes , tectonics and otherEarth - like processes all sculpt features on Titan , but act in an environmentmore frigid than Antarctica .
" It isreally surprising how closely Titan 's surface resembles Earth's , " saidRosaly Lopes , a planetary geologist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , Calif. , who is presenting the results of two new studies at theannual meeting of the of the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) in Rio deJaneiro , Brazil on Friday .
" In fact , Titan looks more like the Earth thanany other body in the solar system , despite the huge differences in temperatureand other environmental conditions . "
This viewof Titan comes from observations made by the Cassini - Huygens mission , which hasrevealed details of Titan 's geologically young surface , showing few impactcraters , and featuring mountain chains , dunes and even " lakes . "
The RADARinstrument on the Cassini orbiter has now allowed scientists to image a thirdof Titan 's surface using radar beams that pierce the giant moon 's thick , smoggy atmosphere .
As its name implies , Titan is no small moon , with a sizeapproaching that of Mars .
Titan getsabout 1 percent the amount of sunlight Earth receives .
Titan isthe only moon in the solar system known to possess a thick atmosphere , and itis the only celestial body other than Earth to have stable pools of liquid onits surface .
Lakes that pool on Titan 's surface are thought to be filled notwith water , but withliquid hydrocarbons , such as methane and ethane .
" Withan average surface temperature hovering around - 180 C [ - 292 degreesFahrenheit ] , water cannot exist on Titan except as deep - frozen ice as strong asrock , " Lopes said .
On Titan , methane takes water 's place in the hydrological cycle of evaporation andprecipitation ( rain or snow ) and can appear as a gas , a liquid and a solid .
Methane rain cuts channels and forms lakes on the surface and causes erosion , helping to erase the meteorite impact craters that pockmark most other rockyworlds , such as our own moon and the planet Mercury .
Other newresearch presented at the IAU General Assembly points to current volcanicactivity on Titan , but instead of scorching hot magma , scientists think these " cryovolcanoes " eject cold slurries of water - ice and ammonia .
The ammoniasignature seems to vary , which suggests that ammonia frosts are ejected andthen subsequently dissipate or are covered over .
Although the ammonia does notstay exposed for long , models show that it exists in Titan 's interior , indicating that a process is at work delivering ammonia to the surface .
RADARimaging has indeed found structures that resemble terrestrial volcanoes nearthe site of suspected ammonia deposition .
Newinfrared images of this region , with ten times the resolution of priormappings , will be unveiled at the IAU meeting .
" Theimages provide further evidence suggesting that cryovolcanism has depositedammonia onto Titan 's surface , " said Robert M. Nelson , a senior researchscientist , also at JPL , who presented results on Wednesday .
Thepresence of ammonia and hydrocarbons could have interesting implications forthe possibility of life existing on Titan .
" Ithas not escaped our attention that ammonia , in association with methane andnitrogen , the principal species of Titan 's atmosphere , closely replicates theenvironment at the time that life first emerged on Earth , " Nelson said .
" One exciting question is whether Titan 's chemical processes today supporta prebiotic chemistry similar to that under which life evolved on Earth ? "
Yet moreterrestrial - type features on Titan include dunesformed by cold winds , and mountain ranges .
These mountains might haveformed tectonically when Titan 's crust compressed as it went into a deepfreeze , in contrast to the Earth 's crust , which continues to move today , producing earthquakes and rift valleys on our planet .
Travel Portland has put together a fantastic look at the city of Portland .
I think it sums up some of the amazing things that makes Portland , Portland and why it ’s becoming one of the premiere travel and tour destinations in the US .
To keep up with the Best of Portland :
As a child , Meghan Swann had suffered several bouts of strep throat , and when she was a teenager , she thought she felt another one coming on .
The main symptom was familiar  a dull sore - throat pain .
But this time something was different ; there seemed to be a foreign object stuck in the back of her throat , something she could n’t quite swallow .
“ So I pushed on my tonsil , and something popped out , ” Ms. Swann said .
The yellowish object was about the size of a piece of gravel and had the sulfurous odor of bad breath .
“ I thought it was a piece of food or something , ” she said .
From then on , Ms. Swann , now 25 and living in the St. Louis area , engaged in a secret ritual : popping the mushrooming bits of debris out of her tonsils with a cotton swab whenever they got big enough to cause discomfort .
One day , she mentioned her problem to her mother  and was surprised at the knowing response .
Those squishy little things were tonsil stones , her mother explained , and she sometimes got them too .
This year , when Ms. Swann posted a blog entry about her stones , readers came out of the woodwork to tell her they also had the problem .
“ Wow , ” she remembers thinking , “ there ’s a lot of people out there with this . ”
j Query Tools is a collection of the most important user interface components for the web .
These are tabs , accordions , tooltips , overlays and scrollables .
They can dramatically improve the usability and responsiveness of your site .
They mainly focus on presenting information and visual appeal .
After all , this is exactly what most websites desperately want : to present their content to the reader in an easy and visually pleasing manner .
Other JavaScript UI libraries focus on desktop - like features such as drag - and - drop , sliders , sortable tables or draggable windows .
They are meant to build “ rich internet applications ” ( RIAs ) such as email clients , task managers , image organizers or feed viewers .
Websites are not desktop applications .
They are different .
The most exiting fact about this library is that it is a single JavaScript file weighs only 5.59 Kb !
This file can be included on your pages from free Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) so that it will be loaded to your customers fast no matter where they are on the globe .
You do n’t need to be a programmer to use these tools .
and you can copy their source code to your site and things will work .
Each tool is used in a similar manner and by learning one tool you can easily learn the other tools .
This tutorial introduces some of the basic functionalities from each tool .
We only scratch the surface here .
If you want to see more jQuery Tools website offers lots of demos to explore .
j Query Tools is open source and dual licensed under MIT and GPL 2 + licenses .
j Query Tools / Overlay
Let ’s begin with the Overlay tool .
It can be used to overlay any kind of HTML on top of the main document in various ways .
Overlaying HTML on top of the main document is one of the most common features in today ’s websites .
You need different kinds of overlays for different situations such as :
Great looking overlays for displaying your products .
Simple and snappy overlays for showing info or warning boxes .
Modal dialogs for prompting and alerting users .
“ lighbox ” style image galleries .
This tool handles all these different situations by offering a flexible effect framework .
You can use the effect that is most suitable for the situation at hand .
HTML setup
Here is the HTML setup for the example above .
<!-- trigger for the overlay .
the overlayed element is specified in rel- attribute --> < img id=" overlaytrigger " src="img/gustavohouse.jpg " rel= " #overlay " /> <!-- overlayed element , everything is styled with external stylesheet --> < div id =" overlay " > < img src="img/gustavohouse-medium.jpg " /> < div class =" details " >
< h2 > Berlin Gustavohouse </h2 > < p >
The Gustavo House in Storkower Strasse .
It was built in 1978 and reconstructed in 1998 by the Spanish artist Gustavo .
</ p> </div> </div >
JavaScript setup
// select elements and make them trigger an overlay $ ( " #overlaytrigger " ) .
overlay ( {effect : ' apple ' , expose : '# 004C7D'} ) ;
You select one ( or more ) elements from the document to be overlay triggers with a jQuery selector .
After that you call the overlay initialization function with various kind of configuration options .
expose configuration property specifies the color of the “ mask ” that is placed on top of the document .
effect property specifies the show / hide effect to be used .
If you want to understand this setup fully we recommend that you study the minimal setup for overlay .
Here is another demo that shows you an Apple effect for overlay .
j Query Tools / Tooltip
Tooltips are one of the most important JavaScript widgets on the web .
Although important , they also happen to be a very badly misunderstood and poorly implemented component .
This tool corrects the situation .
You ’ll get a professional piece of sofware that is easy to understand and use .
HTML setup
All you need is the trigger elements and a tooltip element .
All aspects can be styled with CSS :
<!-- a couple of trigger elements --> < div id =" tooltips " > < img src="img/tooltip/1.jpg " title= " My tooltip # 1 " /> < img src="img/tooltip/2.jpg " title= " My tooltip # 2 " /> < img src="img/tooltip/3.jpg " title= " My tooltip # 3 " /> </div> <!-- the tooltip --> < div id =" tooltip " > </div >
JavaScript setup
// select elements that will have tooltips $ ( " #tooltips img " ) . tooltip ( { tip : ' # tooltip ' , offset : [ - 15 , 2 ] , effect : ' slide '} // use dynamic plugin to take care of the repositioning of the tip ) .dynamic ( ) ;
Here is the minimal setup for tooltip .
Here we use the tooltip tool together with a dynamic
plugin which takes care of tooltip repositioning if it does not fit into the browsers viewport .
Just like the Overlay tool Tooltip also has an effect framework where you can specify how the tooltip is shown / hidden .
If you master JavaScript you can make your own effects .
j Query Tools / Tabs
Tabs are definitely the most popular user - interface component on the web .
And for good reason : they are intuitive to use , people are used to them , and above all your can organize your pages in a more user - friendly way .
It can load pane contents from the server , supports different kind of effects and has a solid plugin framework .
You can also use browser ’s back / forward buttons to navigate between the tabs .
HTML setup
We have the tabs and the container for the content .
The content area is called a “ pane ” .
Again .
Everything can be styled with css .
<!-- tabs --> < ul class = " tabs " > < li >< a href= " #page1 " >
Tab 1</a></li> < li >< a href= " #page2 " >
Second tab</a></li> < li >< a href= " #page3 " > Third tab</a></li> </ul > <!-- tab panes --> < div class= " panes " > < div > .. content # 1 ..</div > < div > .. content # 2 ..</div > < div > .. content # 3 ..</div> </div >
JavaScript setup
$ ( " ul.tabs " ) .tabs ( " div.panes > div " ) .history ( ) ;
We select one or ( more ) tabs and the associative panes .
history plugin takes care of the browsers ’ back / forward buttons .
If you want to understand this setup fully we recommend that you study the minimal setup for tabs .
j Query Tools / Scrollable
Scrolalble makes it easy to add customized scrolling functionalities to a website .
Whenever you wish to scroll HTML elements in a visually - appealing manner , this is the tool you need .
Here are some example scenarios where you would benefit from using the library :
Product catalogues
News tickers
Custom select boxes in forms
Image galleries
Video playlists
All kinds of navigational systems
HTML setup
<!-- " previous page " action --> < a class= " prevPage browse left " ></a> <!-- root element for scrollable --> < div class= " scrollable " > <!-- root element for the items --> < div class = " items " > <!-- scrollable items ... --> < img src=" image1.jpg " /> < img src=" image2.jpg " /> < img src=" image3.jpg " /> < img src=" image4.jpg " /> ... </div> </div> <!-- " next page " action --> < a class = " nextPage browse right " ></a>
JavaScript setup
$ (" div.scrollable " ) .scrollable ().navigator ( ).mousewheel ( ) ;
Select one ( or more ) scrollables from the page and make them scrollables .
Supply the amount of the visible items in the configuration .
We use a navigator plugin for scrollable to place those little navigation “ dots ” above the scrollable and a mousewheel plugin to enable scrolling with the mousewheel .
Look for more detailed explanation of the scrollable setup from jQuery Tools website .
Note that every single element of the above setup can be modified .
This includes the behaviour and styling .
You can also make vertical scrollables .
j Query Tools / Flashembed
Today the role of JavaScript is rising on a tremendous speed .
All major browser vendors are competing with each other to make the best JavaScript engine in the world .
We can expect to see more and more JavaScript widgets and goodies to appear on the market .
Not just these tools .
Having said that Flash technology still has an imporant role on the Internet .
Especially when you want to play videos there is virtually no competition .
Flashembed is a JavaScript tool that you can use to embed Flash objects on your website .
There are other tools for embedding Flash objects , but none of them offers the same flexibility and ease of use as this one .
Here we have installed three Flash objects with a simple one - liner :
$ ( " a.clock " ) .flashembed ( " clock.swf " ) ;
And here is our HTML setup .
< a class = " clock " ></a> < a class= " clock " ></a> < a class= " clock " ></a>
The result
Very powerfull .
Conclusion
It is recommended that you start designing your pages without using any JavaScript .
There are many examples of highly functional , good looking and user friendly web sites that are not using JavaScript .
The purpose of this library is to enhance an existing site with the great possibilities that modern JavaScript techniques has to offer .
This is essentially the idea of “ progressive enhancement ” which is a common design pattern today .
You should realize that highly professional sites do n’t overuse JavaScript just for the fun of it .
Scripting is only used when it truly makes the pages more readable and user friendly .
This is where these tools comes in to play .
j Query Tools is not a framework with a steep learning curve , lots of preliminary work and strict coding rules .
You are not tied to any predefined HTML or CSS structures .
You can include the library on your pages and start using it immediately .
You can freely design the look and feel of your site or you can use the desing we have on our demos as a template .
These tools can be easily combined .
Think of scrollables that trigger overlays or overlays that contain scrollables together with tooltips or whatever combination you can imagine .
The possibilities are endless .
And if that is not enough , you can harness the enormous power of the jQuery library .
Many times you see complex JavaScript components implemented that could be done with just a few lines of jQuery code .
For many websites , this may be the only JavaScript library necessary .
The old UNIX design philosophy “ tools , not policy ” is very important in web design .
BP and Shell are being told to tear up their membership of the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) in protest at the organisation 's attempts to incite a public backlash against Barack Obama 's energy and climate change bill .
The two oil companies are also being asked to bring a halt to their own political lobbying in Washington in letters sent to their chief executives from Greenpeace and the Platform environmental group .
" BP maintains its membership of the API through paying substantial fees based on the large size of BP 's business .
It is our concern that these fees are used by the API to undermine US government action on climate change and that BP 's membership of the API contradicts its position on the issue , " writes John Sauven , executive director of Greenpeace UK , in a letter to Tony Hayward , the BP boss .
The letter also questions the $ 8 m ( £ 4.8 m ) worth of spending on lobbying in Washington since the start of 2009 , saying this runs against the commitment made by BP 's former boss , Lord Browne , in 2002 that BP would from now on " make no political contributions from corporate funds anywhere else in the world " .
A similar letter has been sent to Peter Voser , the new boss at Shell .
The demands from Greenpeace follow revelations in the Guardian last Friday that the API was pumping money into a series of " citizen rallies " to put pressure on the Obama administration over its support for a climate change bill sponsored by Congressmen Henry Waxman and Edward Markey which comes before the Senate next month .
The proposed legislation , which has already successfully passed through the House of Representatives , marks a clear move by the US to adopt a greener political and economic agenda and ditch the kind of sceptical views on global warming that were the hallmark of the previous government run by George W Bush , himself a former oilman .
An email sent by Jack Gerard , president of the API , says the lobby group will provide " upfront resources " to pay for a highly experienced events company to organise the public protest meetings , but it says oil companies themselves should encourage their staff to go to some of the 20 rallies being considered .
" In the 11 states with an [ oil ] industry core , our member company local leadership – including your facility manager 's commitment to provide significant attendance – is essential , " the note says .
Greenpeace and Platform believe these actions are " astroturfing " – a determined attempt to create a false appearance of popular opposition to the Obama plans to control carbon emissions from oil while boosting wind and other cleaner technologies .
The environmentalists remind Hayward and Voser that their companies were once members of the API - backed Global Climate Coalition in the US which successfully campaigned against it signing the Kyoto protocol on the grounds that there was not enough proof that global warming was being made worse by man-made carbon dioxide pollution .
After protests , BP and later Shell withdrew from the GCC and started to make tentative investments in renewable energy , notably wind farms in America , which continue today .
The two companies are now actively involved in the United States Climate Action Partnership , which is seen by environmentalist campaigners to be playing a very positive role on driving forward the green agenda in a country only recently overtaken by China as the world 's biggest carbon producer .
BP said it was " highly unlikely " it would pull out of the API , which was just one of hundreds of trade bodies to which it was affiliated .
But it stressed that it was not involved directly in any of the planned public rallies .
" Our views on climate change legislation are fairly well known , " said a BP spokesman at its London headquarters .
" We support action to counter emissions although we favour market mechanisms , like trading schemes . "
Shell said tonight that it had told the API that it would not participate in the rallies but indicated it would not be leaving the organisation .
" Our focus is on seeking common ground with stakeholders that can aid Congress in enacting a fair and effective cap and trade program .
We will continue to express our position within API and other business and trade associations of which we are members , " added a spokesman at its headquarters in The Hague .
Meanwhile ExxonMobil , a stalwart of previous opposition to Kyoto but a company that insists it is not a climate change denier , seems to support the API wholeheartedly .
The part of the company 's website devoted to the " ExxonMobil Citizen Action Team " gives pride of place to an official letter from the API opposing the Waxman - Markey legislation .
A note above from Rex Tillerson , chairman and chief executive of the world 's biggest publicly quoted oil company , says : " Our elected officials make decisions that affect all of us .
It is critical that we as a company , and more importantly as individuals , are part of the political process .
By linking ExxonMobil employees and retirees to their elected officials , we can let our representatives know that the ExxonMobil family is an important force in civic life . "
This talk by Ceki Gülcü at Jazoon 2009 presents the SLF4J and logback projects .
SLF4J is a logging abstraction gaining wide acceptance in the Java community .
Logback is the successor of the log4j project .
The logging abstraction problem is presented .
SLF4J tackles this problem in a decidedly unsophisticated manner .
There are significant lessons to be learned from SLF4J ’s approach .
Logback , as the successor to log4j , is an evolution of the former project .
It builds on the log4j experience , first by modularizing according to intended usage and second by simplifying the implementation .
As a result , logback accomplishes more with less code .
In addition to lessons learned and design principles , the talk is accompanied by several examples .
Jobs on Twitter
While Twitter seems a bit like the Wild West these days with lots of unknowns and rumors of potential riches , it may hold promise for people in unexpected ways : new jobs .
With around 13 million current users ( and a projected billion , as predicted by the unauthorized leaking of proprietary Twitter corporate documents ) ,
Twitter promises free access to a market ripe for a constant stream of new , value - added information on a minute - by - minute basis — that we know .
It ’s a well known fact that affiliate marketers and people in direct marketing are using Twitter to leverage traffic and make sales , ” says vice president of DaVinci Institute , Deb Frey , who specializes in nontraditional marketing .
What we did n’t expect was that heightened traffic and sales would bring a proliferation of job titles and opportunities that have never existed before , a significant development especially when you compare job creation – currently a White House priority — in social media with the job destruction in other industries , like GM ’s 50,000 jobs lost .
On Indeed.com , a job aggregator , there are more than 7,000 jobs currently posted with the words “ social media ” in the description and more than 1,000 of them pay at least $ 110,000 per year .
Major global brands like Coke and Pepsi now have directors of social media , six - figure jobs centered on watching who is saying what about their brands , and leveraging that information for research , new product ideas and heightened customer service .
Mid -tier companies are also hiring VPs and directors , as well as in - the - trenches Twitter “ Watchers . ”
“ Some companies like Dell and Comcast have people watching for keywords like ‘ Comcast ’ or ‘ Dell ’ , and reply to those tweets , ” says Frey .
“ They manage their online reputation in this manner . ”
For example , during Comcast outages , customers who voice concern , complaints or questions are responded with a personal message from @comcastcares within minutes .
The greater the traffic , the larger the team will need to be to handle the service flow , as well as the information gathering opportunities .
Frey also points to small businesses , one in particular Moonfruit , who upped its followers from 400 to 47,000 in a few days by giving away an iPod / laptop daily for seven days in a contest that asked followers to come up with the catchiest phrase of the day using their name .
Its sales tripled and paying customers rose by 20 % .
Any company that ’s increasing its visibility exponentially will eventually need more manpower to handle volume as well as look at Twitter as a unique business stream .
Article continues below
Another paradigm breaker is Michael van Poppel , just 19 , who compiles all the breaking news ( through RSS feeds and other media sources ) as it happens during the day and feeds it to his Twitter account , Breakingnews , Frey says .
He makes money through affiliate marketing and textlink ads on his Web site .
He ’s gained more than 877,000 followers and plans to have an iPhone app out by next month , he adds , all by organizing information what ’s already out there .
He ’s carving a niche for himself out of content hunters that have n’t been on the radar before .
There are also those people with no products to sell or information to share .
These are the growing band of tweeting ghostwriters , a new “ profession ” that did n’t exist before Twitter .
These people who simply tweet for those with something to say but no time to tweet it .
Frey says they leverage writing , PR and social networking savvy to ghost - tweet for companies who need people to man their feeds .
Think celebrities who just want their fans to keep them in mind , start - ups looking for buzz and more .
Even though so much is still unknown about Twitter , it ’s evolving so quickly that new uses , new opportunities , and even a whole host of new professions are popping up to serve the platform .
Although we may not entirely know how to leverage the tool ’s monetary opportunities , for people with transferrable skills and entrepreneurial savvy , a host of jobs may be yours for the picking .
Via Mainstreet
Police believe Scott Williams was trying to shelter from the rain A man who is thought to have climbed into a bin before being crushed to death in a dust cart has been identified as a 35 - year - old Londoner .
Sussex Police said Scott Williams , from Wembley , had been reported missing an hour after his body was found at Sussex Waste Recycling Ltd in Newhaven .
A post -mortem examination revealed he had been crushed to death .
The dust cart , where Mr Williams ' body was found , had been collecting bins in Brighton .
A worker sifting through bin bags made the discovery on Monday morning .
' Tragic incident ' Police believe Mr Williams , who had been out with a friend and was seen in public houses in Brighton until 0100 BST on Sunday , had been in one of the large wheelie bin used by blocks of flats or businesses .
Officers are investigating how he came to be there and are treating his death as unexplained rather than suspicious .
The GMB union has called for large wheelie bins to be checked individually before they are emptied into refuse lorries .
Spokesman Robert Macey said the way they were currently collected in Brighton meant people could get trapped inside before being loaded on a cart .
A spokesman for Brighton and Hove City Council said : " This is a tragic incident .
The council has warned people not to get into our bins and have put stickers on the 700 street bins .
" We are also putting them on the other 1,000 bins we have in bin stores to remind everyone of the dangers .
" In addition we have worked with groups across the city to raise the issue with vulnerable people .
We really hope the message gets across so that this is n't repeated . "

Our firm is “ AV Preeminent Rated ” by Martindale - Hubbell , a nationally recognized legal resource service that rates both attorneys and law firms based upon peer reviews .
An “ AV ” rating is the highest possible rating , and measures such factors as legal ability , standards of professional conduct , ethics , reliability , communication , and diligence .
Shelton & Walkley Law Group offers over 75 years of combined legal experience .
We handle a wide range of civil matters , including those involving personal injury , real estate , construction defects , family law , and estate planning and probate .
Our firm is large enough to handle any size of case but small enough that you do not become just a number to us .
We handle each case with extreme dedication .
The foundation of our reputation is the dedication and attention that we offer to each of our clients and to their legal problems .
Our Oklahoma City personal injury lawyers are scrupulously attentive to our clients ’ objectives .
Our mission is to meet our clients ’ expectations efficiently and effectively — to be an ally on whom they can rely with complete trust and confidence .
A personal injury lawsuit may be brought when someone has been injured by another party ’s intentional or negligent acts .
This type of lawsuit may be pursued in the context of injuries resulting from a car accident , a motorcycle accident , a slip and fall , or nursing home negligence , among other examples .
Most personal injury lawsuits are pursued under a theory of negligence , which means that the plaintiff must prove that a duty was owed to them , the defendant breached the duty of care , and the plaintiff suffered injuries and losses as a result .
Oklahoma follows a rule of modified comparative negligence .
This means that a plaintiff 's damages will be reduced in proportion to their percentage of fault , but they still can receive some damages unless they were 51 % or more at fault .
Car accidents are a common basis for personal injury lawsuits in Oklahoma .
All drivers have a duty to use reasonable care while operating their cars , and this duty can be breached by behaviors such as speeding , tailgating , drunk driving , distracted driving , failing to obey traffic signals and signs , and driving aggressively .
When a driver fails to use reasonable care while operating a vehicle and causes an accident , it may be possible to hold the driver responsible .
Your ability to recover damages from the at - fault driver may depend on whether they are insured .
Unfortunately , some Oklahoma drivers do not drive with the liability insurance required by law .
In these cases , our Oklahoma personal injury attorneys can help you pursue damages under your own uninsured motorist policy .
Often , drivers of larger vehicles do not see motorcyclists , and they may brake suddenly , cut in front of a motorcyclist , or make a left turn into a motorcyclist , causing serious injuries .
If you are a motorcyclist involved in an accident , you should be aware that juries are frequently biased against motorcyclists , and insurance adjusters know this .
The bias can affect your ability to recover damages , even when the driver of a larger vehicle was clearly to blame .
This makes it especially important to consult an experienced personal injury attorney .
As with other personal injury lawsuits , comparative negligence is applied to motorcycle accident cases .
Your attorney can fight back against any argument that you were partly to blame .
In Oklahoma , property owners are expected to use reasonable care to maintain and repair their property for visitors .
There are three categories of visitors , and different duties are owed to each of them .
A personal injury attorney at our Oklahoma City firm can explain further how this works .
For example , people who come onto property for the property owner 's financial benefit are owed a duty of care in maintaining safe premises and providing warnings of hazards that are known or should be known .
In a premises liability lawsuit , the accident victim will need to show that the defendant was responsible for keeping up the property , the defendant knew or should have known about a dangerous property condition but either failed to maintain the property or warn visitors of the risk , and the plaintiff suffered injuries as a result .
When you place your loved one in a nursing home , you trust that the home will provide appropriate care and follow applicable laws and regulations .
Unfortunately , nursing home residents are often at risk of abuse .
Nursing home abuse comes in many different forms , including physical abuse , emotional abuse , sexual abuse , a failure to provide appropriate hygiene , a failure to provide medication and other medical care , financial abuse , and ignoring safety and health needs .
Pressure sores , unexplained bruises and fractures , personality changes , and withdrawal are common signs of nursing home abuse .
Nursing homes owe a duty to properly care for residents and protect them from abuse and negligence .
If you or your loved one was injured through the negligence or intentional abuse of nursing home staff , an Oklahoma City personal injury lawyer can help you pursue damages .
Regardless of whether you are buying or selling real estate , it is crucial to protect your interests by hiring an experienced real estate attorney .
Our firm handles issues such as real estate fraud , mortgage fraud , foreclosures , commercial lease disputes , the preparation of commercial leases , breach of contract claims , misrepresentation claims , breach of warranty claims , construction contract disputes , construction defects , quiet title actions , and easement and boundary disputes .
Each party to a real estate transaction has various obligations under the law .
For example , sellers of residential real property in Oklahoma are supposed to provide a disclaimer statement or a disclosure statement that includes all of the items that must be disclosed .
While there are numerous forms that can be used , it is often important to consult an experienced attorney .
Buying a home or investing in commercial property may be one of the biggest decisions that you make in your life , and often the process is time - consuming .
Unfortunately , some buyers discover that a property has defects .
In some cases , a property owner may be able to recover damages through a construction defect lawsuit .
Buyers may be able to pursue remedies through negligence , breach of contract , or statutory causes of action .
For example , Oklahoma 's Home Repair Fraud
Act provides that someone can commit home repair fraud in multiple different ways , including if they knowingly enter into a consumer transaction for home repair and misrepresent a material fact related to the terms of the consumer transaction or the preexisting or existing condition of any part of the property .
Divorce and other family law matters can be very stressful for all of the parties involved .
To obtain a divorce in Oklahoma , at least one spouse must have been a state resident for at least six months .
It is possible to obtain a divorce on no - fault or fault grounds , but most couples choose no - fault divorces .
At Shelton & Walkley Law Group , we handle matters related to divorce , spousal support , marital asset division , child support , visitation , prenuptial contracts , protective orders , child abuse protection , and paternity .
We also provide consultations about guardianships , which can become necessary for minors , the elderly , or the incapacitated .
Estate planning can help you avoid the time and expense of probate or guardianships .
There are several different kinds of documents that may need to be prepared in the course of estate planning , including wills , trusts , durable powers of attorney , and advance care directives .
Wills , for example , allow a testator to name a personal representative for their estate and provide for a spouse , children , pets , and any other loved ones .
In addition to estate planning , we provide legal representation to executors of wills when family members die , and we can help with various aspects of settling an estate .
Our firm also handles probate litigation , such as will contests , breach of fiduciary duty claims , fraud claims , and appeals .
Regardless of the legal matter confronting you , it can be crucial to obtain knowledgeable counsel and representation .
Our clients can expect an ally upon whom they can rely with complete confidence and trust .

Neil Ellerbeck recorded his wife 's phone conversations , the court heard An " obsessively jealous "
City banker strangled his wife during a row because her affairs had become " all too much " for him , an Old Bailey jury has heard .
Neil Ellerbeck , 46 , recorded 127 hours of calls between wife Katherine , 45 , and her lovers who included their son's tennis coach , the court heard .
The HSBC executive , who denies murder , also " squirreled away " money , fearing a divorce would cost him his wealth .
Mrs Ellerbeck 's body was found at their home in north London in November .
Edward Brown QC , prosecuting , said : " The defendant is an ambitious and successful man .
But he was a man with an obsessive and jealous nature .
" The defendant acted out of very considerable anger which got the better of the man - at the moment when the build - up of his wife 's behaviour became all too much for this obsessive and jealous man . "
Wife ' bugged '
Mr Ellerbeck lived with their two children in Enfield and " on the face of it had everything - a nice house and a private education for the children " .
But both he and his wife had embarked on affairs , the prosecution said .
Mr Brown said : " During the last few years their son , a very promising tennis player , had been coached at the local tennis club by Patrick McAdam .
" Kate Ellerbeck herself also used the club .
But her friendship with McAdam over time turned into something deeper and they began an affair .
With heightened suspicions and jealousies the defendant killed his wife , her death very likely the culmination of a violent argument
Edward Brown QC
" She also was intimate on one occasion with a friend she had known for many years . "
The court was told that the infidelity was the spark that led Mr Ellerbeck , a " controlling , jealous and secretive man " , to bug his wife and later commit murder .
He bugged the home telephone and had available specialist gadgets to monitor text messages sent from her mobile phone .
Police found more than 100 hours of tape recordings on a memory stick at Mr Ellerbeck 's Canary Wharf office .
They included a conversation between his wife and Mr McAdam discussing their physical relationship .
Cash withdrawn
The prosecution said Mr Ellerbeck had been systematically withdrawing cash from his main accounts to deposit elsewhere , moving £ 103,000 over 13 months .
A further £ 430,000 was moved from an account his wife did not know about to one held by his sister , the court heard .
It is alleged Mr Ellerbeck was moving the money to prepare for life after the end of his marriage .
And jurors were told that two weeks before Mrs Ellerbeck died she confided in her sister that she wanted a divorce .
Mr Brown said : " It is with this background , with all the heightened suspicions and jealousies , that the defendant killed his wife , her death very likely the culmination of a violent argument . "

First up : Ami in London spots the fallout over what we can only assume was an onslaught of hungry breakfast bandits .
Yup , we ’ve got those in the States , too … as Molly noticed at a grocery store in Ohio .
Adds Molly : “ Why anyone would want to take a single slice of bacon out of a box I can’t really say , but if they needed to post three notes it must have been a pressing issue . ”
( Um , maybe she needed a replacement underwire ? )
But perhaps she should have checked the lost & found first …
Meanwhile , this Post - it ( from a Mom in Florida ) and its subsequent responses ( from her punctuation - conscious , pork - loving children ) bring to mind the oh - so - creepy phenomenon that is thoroughly documented on the stellar blog Suicide food .
This note appears to have been written by an actual pig ( at least the Orwellian kind ) , but it appears instead to have been penned by the young son of submitter Irsh , of the aptly named blog Daily Piglet .
Irsh says she found this note taped to the laundry room door when she got home later after her son had already gone to bed .
“ I ’m not sure why he thought I was going to eat the bacon , ” she says , “ but I have to admit the idea of him not talking to me was briefly appealing . ”
Happy Rosh Hashanah , everyone !

I 've recently completed what is , to the best of my knowledge , the first complete translation of the Bible into Pig Latin .
This is the 319th translation of the entire Bible ; the New Testament has now been translated into 845 languages , and parts of the Bible have been rendered into 1629 tongues .
This translation is the culmination of millions of man-hours of work over the past 2000 years .
I owe a tremendous debt to all those writers , translators , monks , scribes , pharisees and whatnot who came before me , and especially to King James and his coworkers , upon whose magnificent translation I have based this version .
It is my sincere hope that this work will be of value to scholars , researchers , native speakers of Pig Latin , and all those who wish to further their understanding of scripture by seeing it presented in new terms .
As it is said , " In - ay e- thay eginning - bay as - way e- thay Ord-way . "
The Catholic Church may wish to consider conducting Mass in Pig Latin , as it combines the solemnity of Latin with the accessibility of English .
I hope this work will accelerate the movement toward incorporating Pig Latin into our educational system .
Pig Latin is one of the easiest foreign languages to learn , and English is far closer to its Pig Latin origins than to its roots in classical Latin .
In addition , the uses of Pig Latin encryption for e-mail security have barely been explored ; the potential benefits are incalculable .

MEXICO CITY ( CNN ) -- A 44 - year - old Bolivian drug addict and alcoholic who describes himself as a church minister was the sole person responsible for the brief hijacking Wednesday of a commercial jetliner , a Mexican official said .
Military personnel surround a hijacked Aeromexico jet after it landed Wednesday in Mexico City .
The suspect , Josmar Flores Pereira , told authorities he hijacked the Boeing 737 jet because the date -- September 9 , 2009 , or 9/9/9 , and 666 reversed -- held some significance for him , said Genaro Garcia Luna , the secretary for public safety .
" He said that because of that divine reference , he wanted to alert Mexico City of an earthquake , " Garcia told reporters .
Flanked by two police officers , the suspect -- wearing a white shirt and blue jeans -- was then paraded in front of the news media .
Chewing gum , he smiled .
" Christ is coming soon , " he told reporters before being escorted off .
He said that he had attached colored lights to a can and that there had been no bomb .
The hijacker took control of Aeromexico Flight 576 as the jet flew from the resort town of Cancun , telling a flight attendant he was one of three hijackers , Garcia said .

He said a cardboard box he had contained a bomb , and threatened to blow it up if his demand to speak to President Felipe Calderon was not met , Garcia said .
Calderon was in the presidential hangar in the airport preparing to depart when the incident began , leading him to cancel his planned flight , CNN affiliate TV Azteca reported .
The hijacking apparently went unnoticed by many of those aboard the plane , which landed five minutes ahead of scheduled and was moved to a remote area of the airport .
Passengers , clutching their hand luggage , walked from the plane and down a moveable stairway onto the tarmac , where they got into buses .
Pamela Cheatham , who said she was on the flight en route to Colorado , told CNN that nothing appeared amiss until the plane did not go directly to the terminal .
Instead , the pilot announced that , for security purposes , the plane was gong to have to sit on the tarmac for a few minutes , she said .
" But when we saw the SWAT team and guys with the guns on both sides of the airline , we knew something was up , " she said .
Moments later , the suspect and several other people were taken into custody , TV Azteca said .
The package turned out not to contain explosives , the station said .
Garcia said the other people who were detained turned out not to be involved .

A U.S. law enforcement official familiar with the situation said preliminary information indicated there were 112 passengers aboard the plane , all from Mexico , the United States or France .
" The flight was very tranquil , " said Marisa Lopez , a passenger who was seated in Row 24 with her baby .
She said the only thing that caught her attention was the large number of emergency vehicles that were lined up along the tarmac when they arrived , five minutes ahead of schedule .
" Really , it was all very peaceful , " she said .
" We saw nothing . "
Others were more aware of what was going on .
" It was very difficult , but the pilot told us to remain calm , " said another passenger , who added that many of the passengers were families returning from vacation in Cancun .

The woman said the hijacker never spoke to them during the 45 minutes they were held .
" We were scared , " said another woman .
" But it seemed like things got under control when we came down .
We were immediately surrounded , when we landed , by federal police . "
Flores ' wife , speaking with CNN by telephone from their home in the southern Mexican city of Oaxaca , said her husband had been looking for a way to get his message about God to the news media .
" He never wanted to hurt anyone , " said Elisa Melgar , 38 , the mother of their three sons and his wife of 18 years .
" As his wife , I support him , " she said , adding her husband had not touched alcohol or drugs for the past 17 years .
" He 's a man who was transformed by the power of God . "
A video posted on YouTube shows the suspect singing that God had saved him from a life of drug addiction .
All About Mexico
In hopes of getting a nibble , a bite , or , dare I say , landing a production deal , you are probably sending your material to an independent producer .
I ’m sure you conjured an image of a gleamingly efficient office , a cadre of identically uniformed interns neatly cataloguing incoming treatments and screenplays ( most of which are horrible , except yours ) and ( foremost in your mind ) the producer finishing reading the most recent crappy script just as yours is handed to him by his gleamingly gorgeous assistant .
You write it , you send it , they read it , they buy it .
A process that takes , at most , a week , on the outside .
Riiiiiiiiiiiight .
Most producers do n’t have assistants or development deals .
Some do , but most scratch and scrape to get by , just like all of us .
If they did have an assistant , they fired him recently to save money .
Producers ’ offices are crammed to the gunwales with heaps and piles and stacks of books and scripts and treatments , lobbed at them by agents , friends , and hopeful writers who waylaid them at conferences .
Their offices are a disordered mess .
A Matterhorn of submitted screenplays .
Most of which they do n’t want to read because they do n’t have time and because they already know they ’re mostly crap anyway .
They read this stuff because they have to .
I was with a producer recently , at his home office , and that visit served as the genesis for this little missive .
Please keep the producer in mind when you write and when you submit .
They are massively overworked and massively underpaid and have very very very little time for you or your script .
“ I ’ll get to that at Christmas when I have a little more time . ”
This he said about a screenplay submitted in June .
You need to know it takes eons for them to plow through other people ’s material before they get to yours .
Keeping in mind that they have ZERO free time , why are you going to send them a piece of material ( think “ time bomb ” that might go off in their face ) that will make them furious when they read it ?
I hate to sound arrogant , well I do n’t hate it that much , but if you are a beginning writer and have not done the checklist in my book , you do n’t have a prayer with producers or readers … or as my grandfather would say , “ You stand about as much chance as a flea fart in a hurricane . ”
This producer was picking up submitted screenplays , opening to any page , reading aloud horrible expositional dialogue , laughing to me about spelling mistakes , format errors , his irritation over “ its vs. it ’s , blue vs. blew , their vs. there ” and getting really pissed off that someone would dare to waste his time by sending a script that WASN ’T READY .
You must understand the producer has spent the last twenty years of his life working VERY hard to make movies .
If you send something that is unprofessional because you have not taken the time to get it right , they will laugh at you at best , or more likely , despise you .
The producer hating you is not , I repeat , not a recipe for success .
Proof that women 's chests really are a man 's ' first fixation '
Women have long complained that their faces are often the last thing men look at – and now a scientific study has proved them right .
Researchers found that virtually half – 47 per cent – of men first glance at a woman ’s chest .
A third of the so - called ‘ first fixations ’ are on the waist and hips , while fewer than
20 per cent look at the face .
Not only are breasts often the first thing men look at , they also glance at them for longer than any other body part , the experts discovered .
Perfect figure : Katherine Jenkins ' larger chest and slim waist indicate fertility
It ’s thought that the reason might be evolutionary , as women with larger chests and slim waists – such as opera singer Katherine Jenkins – have higher levels of the female hormone oestrogen , indicating greater fertility .
But the researchers conceded that there could be a more prosaic explanation .
‘ Men may be looking more often at the breasts because they are simply aesthetically pleasing , regardless of the size , ’ they said .
Subjects tested by researchers from New Zealand ’s University of Wellington were presented with six images of the same woman , digitally altered to increase or decrease the size of her bust , waist and hips .
Lads ' favourite : Kelly Brook is admired for her curves
The scientists recorded which areas men looked at first , the number of times they looked , and how long their gaze lasted , using cameras and mirrors to measure tiny eye movements .
The study concluded : ‘ Eighty per cent of first fixations were on the breasts and midriff .
Men spent consistently more time looking at the breasts and also made significantly more fixations upon them than other regions . ’
It also found that men began to gaze at the ‘ components of the hourglass figure ’ within 0.2 seconds .
The research also discovered that few glances were directed at the arms , lower legs and feet .

In Democracy in America , Alexis de Tocqueville worried that free , capitalist societies might develop so great a “ taste for physical gratification ” that citizens would be “ carried away , and lose all self - restraint . ”
Avidly seeking personal gain , they could “ lose sight of the close connection which exists between the private fortune of each of them and the prosperity of all ” and ultimately undermine both democracy and prosperity .
The genius of America in the early nineteenth century , Tocqueville thought , was that it pursued “ productive industry ” without a descent into lethal materialism .
Behind America ’s balancing act , the pioneering French social thinker noted , lay a common set of civic virtues that celebrated not merely hard work but also thrift , integrity , self - reliance , and modesty — virtues that grew out of the pervasiveness of religion , which Tocqueville called “ the first of [ America ’s ] political institutions , . . . imparting morality ” to American democracy and free markets .
Some 75 years later , sociologist Max Weber dubbed the qualities that Tocqueville observed the “ Protestant ethic ” and considered them the cornerstone of successful capitalism .
Like Tocqueville , Weber saw that ethic most fully realized in America , where it pervaded the society .
Preached by luminaries like Benjamin Franklin , taught in public schools , embodied in popular novels , repeated in self - improvement books , and transmitted to immigrants , that ethic undergirded and promoted America ’s economic success .
What would Tocqueville or Weber think of America today ?
In place of thrift , they would find a nation of debtors , staggering beneath loans obtained under false pretenses .
In place of a steady , patient accumulation of wealth , they would find bankers and financiers with such a short - term perspective that they never pause to consider the consequences or risks of selling securities they do n’t understand .
In place of a country where all a man asks of government is “ not to be disturbed in his toil , ” as Tocqueville put it , they would find a nation of rent - seekers demanding government subsidies to purchase homes , start new ventures , or bail out old ones .
They would find what Tocqueville described as the “ fatal circle ” of materialism — the cycle of acquisition and gratification that drives people back to ever more frenetic acquisition and that ultimately undermines prosperous democracies .
And they would understand why .
After flourishing for three centuries in America , the Protestant ethic began to disintegrate , with key elements slowly disappearing from modern American society , vanishing from schools , from business , from popular culture , and leaving us with an economic system unmoored from the restraints of civic virtue .
Not even Adam Smith — who was a moral philosopher , after all — imagined capitalism operating in such an ethical vacuum .
Bailout plans , new regulatory schemes , and monetary policy moves wo n’t be enough to spur a robust , long - term revival of American economic opportunity without some renewal of what was once understood as the work ethic — not just hard work but also a set of accompanying virtues , whose crucial role in the development and sustaining of free markets too few now recall .
The American experiment that Tocqueville chronicled in the 1830s was more than just an effort to see if men could live without a monarch and govern themselves .
A free society had to be one in which people could pursue economic opportunity with only minimal interference from the state .
To do so without producing anarchy required a self - discipline that was , to Max Weber , the core of the capitalist ethic .
“ The impulse to acquisition , pursuit of gain , of money , of the greatest possible amount of money , has in itself nothing to do with capitalism , ” Weber wrote in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism .
“ Unlimited greed for gain is not in the least identical with capitalism , and still less its spirit . ”
Instead , the essence of capitalism is “ a rational tempering ” of the impulse to accumulate wealth so as to keep a business ( and ultimately the whole economy ) sustainable and self - renewing , Weber wrote .
It is “ the pursuit of profit , and forever renewed profit , by means of continuous , rational . . . enterprise . ”
Weber famously argued that the Protestant Reformation — with John Calvin ’s and Martin Luther ’s emphasis on individual responsibility , hard work , thrift , providence , honesty , and deferred gratification at its center — shaped the spirit of capitalism and helped it succeed .
Calvinism and the sects that grew out of it , especially Puritanism and John Wesley ’s Methodism in England , were religions chiefly of the middle and working classes , and the virtues they promoted led to a new kind of affluence and upward mobility , based not on land ( which was largely owned by the aristocracy ) but on productive enterprises .
Nowhere did the fusing of capitalism and the virtues that made up the work ethic find a fuller expression than in America , where Puritan pioneers founded settlements animated by a Calvinist dedication to work .
One result was a remarkable society in which , as Tocqueville would observe , all “ honest callings are honorable ” and in which “ the notion of labor is therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary , natural , and honest condition of human existence . ”
Unlike in Europe , where aristocrats and gentry often scorned labor , in the United States , “ a wealthy man thinks that he owes it to public opinion to devote his leisure to some kind of industrial or commercial pursuit , or to public business .
He would think himself in bad repute if he employed his life solely in living . ”
This thick and complex work ethic , so essential to the success of the early , struggling American settlements , became part of the country ’s civic fabric .
It found its most succinct expression in the writings of Benjamin Franklin , whose well - known maxims , now considered quaintly old - fashioned , recommended to citizens of the new country a worldview that promoted work and the pursuit of wealth .
“ Time is money ” and “ Never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you promised ” and “ Early to bed , early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy , and wise ” voiced virtues that Franklin and his contemporaries viewed not chiefly as religious but as utilitarian .
A reputation for honesty makes it easier to borrow money for new ventures , Franklin counseled .
A man who displays self - discipline in his personal life inspires confidence in lenders and business partners .
This constellation of virtues , which Weber described as “ the ideal of the honest man of recognized credit , ” is how one gets ahead in life .
Franklin ’s best - selling writings had an enormous impact on America .
His ideas , widely applauded , permeated popular culture and education .
The leading grammar school textbooks of the nineteenth century , for example , by William Holmes McGuffey and his brother Alexander , inculcated children with the virtues of work and thrift .
To dramatize the “ Consequences of Idleness , ” McGuffey ’s Fourth Eclectic Reader told the story of poor George Jones , who frittered away his time in school and wasted the money his father had devoted to his education , winding up a poor wanderer .
In fifth grade , students memorized Eliza Cook ’s paean to labor , simply titled “ Work , ” which urged them to “ Work , work , my boy , be not afraid ; / Look labor boldly in the face . ”
Schooled in such attitudes , America ’s nineteenth - century youth embraced the rags - to - riches novels of Horatio Alger , Jr. , who sold some 200 million books with plotlines that are a road map of the work ethic .
In his first commercial success , Ragged Dick , Dick Hunter , 14 and homeless , impresses patrons with his honesty and industriousness and slowly rises in the world .
When he teeters on the verge of losing everything because a thief pilfers his savings - account passbook , bank officials recognize him from his regular visits to make deposits , and they have the thief arrested .
In a later novel , Bound to Rise , poor Henry Walton wins a biography of Ben Franklin for acing exams and , inspired by his life story , goes off to earn a fortune .
The work ethic even shaped American play .
The most popular game of its time , “ The Checkered Game of Life , ” produced by Milton Bradley in the mid-nineteenth century and sold door - to - door , challenged players to travel through life and earn points for successfully completing school , getting married , and working hard , while avoiding pitfalls like gambling and idleness .
In his patent application for the game , Bradley observed that it was intended to “ impress upon the minds of youth the great moral principles of virtue and vice . ”
Its success spawned a whole genre .
“ Many games with similar moral thrusts followed , ” observed Jennifer Jensen of the New - York Historical Society in an article called “ Teaching Success Through Play . ”
These games “ emphasized secular virtues such as thrift , neatness , and kindness . ”
The work ethic also distinguished the northern colonies from the southern , and later helped the North win the Civil War .
Many southern settlers came in search not of religious freedom but only of economic opportunity .
Instead of founding villages or towns with a common civic life , southern settlers developed isolated , widely separated plantations .
They cultivated a few staple crops using slave labor , instead of developing a diversified economy .
They created a society where a relatively few plantation owners acted like an aristocracy .
Rather than viewing all honest work as honorable , they developed what historian C. Vann Woodward calls the “ Southern ethic , ” which saw some work as fit only for slaves .
In the end , these attitudes proved the South ’s greatest vulnerability , as the North , shaped by the work ethic , brought to bear its industrial might against the narrow economy of the South , built precariously on tobacco and slave labor and a Cavalier rather than a Puritan ethic .
After the Civil War , this secularized version of the Protestant ethic served as a lodestar for millions of poor immigrants , many from countries with little experience of free markets and democracy .
Their assimilation into a culture that they recognized not as Protestant but as American reinvigorated the country , helping to set late - nineteenth - and early - twentieth - century America on a distinctly different path from much of Europe .
Many of these immigrants , ironically , absorbed their Franklinesque code from the American Catholic Church .
Key members of the church hierarchy — notably , New York ’s brilliant , Irish - born first archbishop , John Hughes , who rose from poverty — lived by the ethic and understood its role in the country ’s success .
Hughes set as his task the moral and economic uplift of Gotham ’s millions of poor Irish immigrants .
He founded a network of some 100 Catholic schools that taught Irish children not just the three Rs but also a “ faith - based code of personal conduct , ” as William J. Stern wrote in City Journal ( “ How Dagger John Saved New York ’s Irish , ” Spring 1997 ) .
Hughes ’s church was , as he put it , “ a church of discipline . ”
He fostered residential schools that taught vocational skills and conduct to thousands of orphaned or abandoned Irish street children and sent them off successfully into American society .
Catholic schools around the country copied his work , and many of them continue today to succeed even with at - risk kids .
By the end of the nineteenth century , the Irish had largely shaken off poverty and joined the American mainstream .
Waves of Southern and Eastern European Catholics followed them , as well as Eastern European Jews — some 20 million immigrants between 1890 and 1925 — who quickly replicated the success of the Irish in a country whose institutions emphasized and rewarded hard work , thrift , and self - improvement .
Within a single generation , one study shows , the average early - twentieth - century immigrant family had achieved income and educational parity with American - born families , so that the children of these immigrants were just as likely to be accountants , engineers , or lawyers as the children of families rooted here for generations .
The breakup of this 300 - year - old consensus on the work ethic began with the cultural protests of the 1960s , which questioned and discarded many traditional American virtues .
The roots of this breakup lay in what Daniel Bell described in The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism as the rejection of traditional bourgeois qualities by late - nineteenth - century European artists and intellectuals who sought “ to substitute for religion or morality an aesthetic justification of life . ”
By the 1960s , that modernist tendency had evolved into a credo of self - fulfillment in which “ nothing is forbidden , all is to be explored , ” Bell wrote .
Out went the Protestant ethic ’s prudence , thrift , temperance , self - discipline , and deferral of gratification .
Weakened along with all these virtues that made up the American work ethic was Americans ’ belief in the value of work itself .
Along with “ turning on ” and “ tuning in , ” the sixties protesters also “ dropped out . ”
As the editor of the 1973 American Work Ethic noted , “ affluence , hedonism and radicalism ” were turning many Americans away from work and the pursuit of career advancement , resulting in a sharp slowdown in U.S. productivity from 1965 through 1970 .
So great a transformation of values was occurring that , as George Bloom of MIT ’s Sloan School of Management wrote in a 1971 essay on America ’s declining work ethic , “ It is unfortunate but true that ‘ progress ’ is becoming a bad word in virtually all sectors of society . ”
Attitudes toward businessmen changed , too .
While film and television had formerly offered a balanced portrait of work and employers , notes film critic Michael Medved in Hollywood vs. America , from the mid-1960s onward , movies and TV portrayed business executives almost exclusively as villains or buffoons .
The era ’s iconic film , the 1967 Oscar winner The Graduate , is a prime example in its tale of a recent college grad adrift and questioning adult society ’s strive - and - succeed ethic .
No character appears more loathsome than a family friend who counsels the graduate , “ I just want to say one word to you — just one word : plastics .
There ’s a great future in plastics . ”
Such portrayals both reflected and strengthened the baby - boom generation ’s attitudes .
One 1969 Fortune poll , for instance , found that 92 percent of college students thought business executives were too profit - minded .
In this era , being virtuous became something separate from work .
When the Milton Bradley Company reintroduced “ The Checkered Game of Life ” in a modern version called “ The Game of Life ” in the mid-1960s , it abandoned the notion of rewarding traditional bourgeois virtues like completing an education or marrying .
What was left of the game was simply the pursuit of cash , until Milton Bradley , criticized for this version , redesigned the game to include rewards for doing good .
But its efforts produced mere political correctness : in the new version , recycling trash and contributing to save an endangered species were virtuous actions that won a player points .
Such gestures , along with tolerance and sensitivity , expanded like a gas to fill the vacuum where the Protestant ethic used to be .
The cultural upheavals of the era spurred deep changes in institutions that traditionally transmitted the work ethic — especially the schools .
University education departments began to tell future grammar school teachers that they should replace the traditional teacher - centered curriculum , aimed at producing educated citizens who embraced a common American ethic , with a new , child - centered approach that treats every pupil ’s “ personal development ” as different and special .
During the 1960s , when intellectuals and college students dismissed traditional American values as oppressive barriers to fulfillment , grammar schools generally jettisoned the traditional curriculum .
“ Education professors eagerly joined New Left professors to promote the idea that any top - down imposition of any curriculum would be a right - wing plot designed to perpetuate the dominant white , male , bourgeois power structure , ” writes education reformer E. D. Hirsch , Jr. , in his forthcoming The Making of Americans : Democracy and Our Schools .
The bourgeois values , however , had helped to sustain Weber ’s “ rational tempering ” of the impulse to accumulate wealth : they helped put the rationality in “ rational self - interest , ” or , as Tocqueville put it , “ self - interest rightly understood . ”
When the schools and the wider society demoted them , the effects were predictable .
In schools , for instance , the new “ every child is special ” curriculum prompted a sharp uptick in students ’ self - absorption , according to psychologists Jean M. Twenge and W. Keith Campbell in The Narcissism Epidemic : Living in the Age of Entitlement .
What resulted was a series of increasingly self - centered generations of young people displaying progressively more narcissistic personality traits , including a growing obsession with “ material wealth and physical appearance , ” the authors observe .
Thus did the sixties generation spawn the Me Generation of the seventies .
By the mid-1980s , a poll of teens found that more than nine in ten listed shopping as their favorite pastime .
The economic shocks that followed the tumultuous late 1960s , especially the devastating inflation of the 1970s , reinforced an emerging materialism .
Thanks to the Johnson administration ’s illusion that the country could finance massive social - welfare programs and a war without consequences , the U.S. by 1974 staggered under double - digit annual inflation gains , compared with an average annual gain of about 1 percent in the early 1960s .
The inflation hit hardest those who had embraced the work ethic , destroying lifetimes of savings in unprecedented price spikes and sending the message that “ saving and shunning debt was for saps , ” Fortune observed .
“ The lesson seemed to be , buy , buy , buy , before the money visibly crumbling to dust in your hand vanishes completely . ”
Once Fed chairman Paul Volcker ’s tight - money policy tamed inflation in the early 1980s , America began to pick itself up .
But it was a different country , one that had lost to some degree the “ rational tempering ” of the “ pursuit of gain ” that Max Weber had seen as the key to “ forever renewed profit . ”
The corporate restructurings of the 1980s , prompted by a new generation of risk - taking entrepreneurs and takeover artists who used aggressive financial instruments with provocative names like “ junk bonds ” to buy and then make over big companies that failed to remake themselves , reordered corporate America , shaking it out of its 1970s complacency .
But the plant closings , downsizings , and restructurings of the 1980s also stoked anxiety among workers , as the old ideal of lifetime employment at one paternalistic company gave way to a job - hopping career in a constantly changing business landscape .
While the results were often salutary — innovation for companies and income gains for the most talented players — the “ get it while you can ” mentality that developed among some workers and investors found its ultimate expression in the “ day traders ” of the technology stock boom , speculators with a “ right now ” time horizon rather than long - term investors .
When takeover - era titans Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky pleaded guilty to insider - trading charges , their confessions strengthened a growing sense that a new ethic had superseded the old standard of playing by the rules .
The 1980s version of the Horatio Alger tales was not an inspiring story of uplift but the popular movie Wall Street , with Gordon Gekko ’s infamous “ greed is good ” speech .
With government policy reinforcing the “ get it now ” mentality , a new era of consumption based on credit blossomed in the resurgent 1980s , and Americans turned from savers to debtors .
Ostentatious displays of wealth grew more common .
From 1982 , the year that Volcker finally tamed inflation , to 1986 , luxury - car sales doubled in America .
The average age of a purchaser of a fur coat — that ultimate status symbol — declined from 50 to just 26 in the mid-1980s .
To fuel such purchases , inflation - adjusted total U.S. consumer - credit debt rose nearly threefold , to $ 2.56 trillion , from 1980 to 2008 , while the nation ’s savings rate shrank from an average of about 12 percent of personal income annually in the early 1980s to less than 1 percent by 2005 .
Some middle - class Americans came to resemble not the thrifty bourgeoisie of the early Industrial Revolution but the landed gentry of that era who drained their real estate for cash to fund lavish living .
One stark illustration of the change : by 2006 , those who refinanced their mortgages were taking out in cash nearly a quarter of the equity they ’d accumulated — compared with just 5 percent a decade earlier .
A big reason Americans ’ debt was growing , in other words , was that they were borrowing against their rapidly appreciating assets as fast as they grew .
The denouement of this transformation was the 2008 meltdown of world financial markets .
America has certainly had its con artists , robber barons , and speculators before , but what distinguished the latest panic was that millions of mortgages belonging to ordinary Americans triggered it — mortgages that were foolhardy at best and fraudulent at worst .
A typical case is Bradley Collin , a 27 - year - old Minnesota housepainter with three kids .
He decided to try to make a killing in real estate because , as he told the Minneapolis Star - Tribune last year , “ I did n’t want to paint the rest of my life . ”
With the help of shady mortgage brokers , he and his wife simultaneously purchased four homes in new developments , intending to flip them for a profit .
To buy the houses , the Collins had to make four separate mortgage applications , lie on each about their intentions , and hide each sale from the other three lenders , because no bank would have given them money to purchase four homes .
When the local housing market stopped rising , the couple defaulted on their loans , abandoning the houses to the banks and helping further drive down their neighbors ’ real - estate values .
The Collins were hardly alone .
According to the FBI , reports of mortgage fraud soared tenfold nationwide from 2001 to 2007 .
No one knows precisely how deep the problem ran , but some mortgage servicers , examining portfolios of subprime mortgages that went bad in 2007 , found that up to 70 percent of them had involved some kind of misrepresentation .
Loans that required no verification of the borrower ’s income infamously became known as “ liar loans . ”
One mortgage lender who compared 100 of these loans with IRS tax filings found that in 60 percent of cases , the applicants exaggerated their incomes ( or underreported them to the IRS ) .
Occupancy fraud , in which investors intent on buying new homes and then quickly flipping them for a profit lied about their intentions , accounted for about 20 percent of all fraudulent mortgage applications .
Since the mortgage meltdown began in 2006 , builders in some regions have found that as many as a quarter of the buyers of the homes that they sold in new developments lied about their purposes .
This multitude of scams required the complicity of businesses that ultimately destroyed themselves and shattered an entire industry .
The fall of America ’s sixth - largest bank , Washington Mutual , which built an empire based on reckless lending , exemplifies these failings .
As the housing boom heated up , WaMu raced after a piece of the action at all costs .
Its supervisors chastised loan officers who tried to verify suspicious claims on mortgage applications .
Executives gave loan officers flyers that said , “ A thin file is a good file , ” according to testimony by former employees .
The lender set up phone banks , like penny - stock boiler - room operations , to sell home - equity loans .
Ultimately , swamped by over $ 11 billion in bad loans , WaMu was seized by the federal government and sold to JPMorgan Chase , an object lesson in what Weber called the pursuit of “ irrationally speculative opportunities , ” which undermines capitalism rather than nourishes it .
Needless to say , this is not what Adam Smith had in mind .
Smith laid the groundwork for the economic theories of The Wealth of Nations in his preceding book , The Theory of Moral Sentiments , which traces the evolution of ethics from man ’s nature as a social being who feels shame if he does something that he believes a neutral observer would consider improper .
Smith proposed that as societies evolve , they form institutions — courts of law , for instance — that reflect and codify these ethical perceptions of individuals , and that these institutions provide the essential backbone of any sophisticated commercial system .
Modern experiments in neuroscience have tended to confirm Smith ’s notion that our virtues derive from our empathy for others , though with an important qualification : the ethics of individuals need reinforcement from social institutions and can be undermined by the wrong societal message , as neuroeconomist Paul Zak writes in Moral Markets : The Critical Role of Values in the Economy .
When people find themselves bombarded by the wrong message — like the Washington Mutual employees whose supervisors constantly pushed them into riskier and riskier actions — some will resign in disgust , but others will gradually suppress what scientists call the brain ’s “ other - regarding ” behavior and the shame that goes along with it and violate their own ethics .
This mechanism of deception pervaded the recent housing bubble ; cheating to get mortgages became so commonplace that cheaters barely seemed to perceive that they were committing fraud .
A vivid case in point is New York Times economics reporter Edmund Andrews ’s remarkable confessional tale , “ My Personal Credit Crisis . ”
Andrews relates how he obtained a mortgage under dubious circumstances , aided by a broker who encouraged him to lie on his credit applications and a lender that , when its underwriters caught his intended deception , nonetheless allowed him to apply for another , riskier kind of mortgage .
Granted a loan so oppressive that he will eventually default , Andrews admits to feeling that he had “ done something bad ” but also feeling “ kind of cool ” for making such a big score .
Even today , society continues to reinforce Andrews ’s lack of shame : he received a contract to detail his credit woes in a provocatively titled book , Busted : Life Inside the Great Mortgage Meltdown , which was published this spring .
In the wake of the market crash , our national discussion about how to fix capitalism seems limited to those who believe that more government will fix the problem and those who think that free markets will fix themselves .
Few have asked whether we can recapture the civic virtues that nourished our commerce for 300 years .
We ’re not likely to find many churches preaching those virtues today .
Though America is more religious than most industrialized countries , today ’s pulpits hardly resound with the bourgeois work ethic .
While John Wesley once observed that religion produces “ industry and frugality , ” and the American Congregationalist preacher Henry Ward Beecher declared that the way to avoid poverty was through “ provident care , and foresight , and industry and frugality , ” today the National Council of Churches , to which these denominations belong , advocates for a left - wing “ social gospel ” of redistributing wealth ( see “ The Religious Left , Reborn , ” Autumn 2007 ) .
And though the Catholic Church once strove to assimilate generations of poor immigrants into American economic life , today its major social - welfare organization , Catholic Charities , has become an arm of the redistributionist welfare state ( see “ How Catholic Charities Lost Its Soul , ” Winter 2000 ) .
Even our evangelical churches , whose theology most resembles that of the great Protestant reformers , have focused their energies primarily on social issues , such as fighting abortion or gay marriage , or even inveighing against welfare reform that encourages single mothers to return to work .
True , a few groups , including the Consumer Federation of America and the Institute for American Values , have launched a national campaign , modeled on World War II efforts to encourage savings , to reintroduce thrift into American life .
But trying to teach adults about thrift or the patient accumulation of wealth through hard work , when they did n’t learn these things at home or in school , will be an uphill battle .
Could the schools do what they once did — create educated citizens inculcated with the ethical foundations of capitalism ?
That would require rededicating the schools to “ making Americans , ” as Hirsch proposes in his forthcoming book .
Promisingly , a few public and private schools around the country have replaced the child - centered curriculum with one focused on learning about our culture and its institutions .
Hirsch ’s “ Core Knowledge ” curriculum , for instance , introduces kindergartners to the Pilgrims , Independence Day , and George Washington ; first - graders to Ben Franklin and the concept of law in society ; and second - graders to the Constitution as the foundation of our democracy .
Other school reformers , according to David Whitman in Sweating the Small Stuff , have raised the achievement of low - income kids by using a “ no excuses ” model that teaches bourgeois “ virtues like diligence , politeness , cleanliness , and thrift . ”
But these examples amount only to a tiny handful , swimming against the educational mainstream .
Late in life , Adam Smith noted that government institutions can never tame and regulate a society whose citizens are not schooled in a common set of virtues .
“ What institution of government could tend so much to promote the happiness of mankind as the general prevalence of wisdom and virtue ? ” he wrote .
“ All government is but an imperfect remedy for the deficiency of these . ”
America in the twenty - first century is learning that lesson .
Scratch the highest - profile defenseman off Wednesday 's free - agent list .
Jay Bouwmeester agreed to terms on a five - year deal with the Calgary Flames on Tuesday night , forgoing unrestricted free agency .
Jay Bouwmeester joined a Flames defense corps that includes Robyn Regehr as well as two - time All - Star Dion Phaneuf .

Bouwmeester 's deal is worth an average of $ 6.6 million per season , a source told ESPN.com 's Pierre LeBrun .
He made $ 4.875 million this past season .
He did n't even entertain any other offers .
" It just got to the point where I was totally comfortable with things here , " Bouwmeester said Wednesday .
" It probably would n't have really mattered what else was out there .
I liked the situation .
I can't really explain it .
It 's just one of those things .
You just kind of know . "
The Flames had about $ 10 million worth of cap space to work with for 2009 - 10 .
" Jay is one of the most complete defenseman in the game , and we are very pleased to have reached an agreement that will make him an important component of the Calgary Flames success , " Flames general manager Darryl Sutter said in statement .
" We identified Jay as the priority player where we were going to focus our money .
We wanted an opportunity a few days in advance of the deadline , and that 's why we made the move we did this past weekend . "
The Flames ' personnel , particularly on the blue line , drew Bouwmeester to Calgary because he sees himself as a cog in the wheel of a high - end defense that includes Robyn Regehr , Dion Phaneuf and Cory Sarich .
" That 's what was one of the things that was real attractive here , " Bouwmeester said .
" You look at the solid group of guys they already have .
Robyn and Dion , and not just those two .
Cory Sarich , I 've played against him a long time .
It seemed like it would be an easy place to slide in and hopefully have some success . "
The Flames took a gamble Saturday at the NHL entry draft and sent a third - round pick and the rights to Jordan Leopold to the Florida Panthers in exchange for the rights to Bouwmeester .
" We had no intention of waiting for today , " Sutter said .
" We prioritized the position and the player .
We talked a lot of different ideas for him in terms of longer , shorter [ contracts ] , but what it always kept coming back to was this was the market he wanted to play in . "
Sutter later announced the signing of forward Fredrik Sjostrom .
" Freddie is a reliable two - way player , " Sutter said .
" We are happy to add him to our group as we identify him as a player who plays our style of game . "
Sutter continued with the youth movement on the back end by signing Adam Pardy , another 25 - year - old .
He had a goal and nine assists in 60 games as a rookie last season .
Defenseman Adrian Aucoin , Anders Eriksson , Rhett Warrener , forwards Todd Bertuzzi , Michael Cammalleri , Carsen Germyn and enforcer Andre Roy all became unrestricted free agents Wednesday .
Sutter did n't intend to re-sign them .
" Today no .
We 're not walking away on anybody , but at the same time the philosophy does n't change , " Sutter said .
" It 's about young players . "
Bouwmeester , a native of Edmonton , completed his sixth season with the Panthers in 2008 - 09 , recording 42 points with 15 goals and 27 assists .
The six - foot - four , 213 - pounder has 203 points in 471 career NHL games .
He was picked with the third overall draft pick by the Florida Panthers in 2002 .
" I am happy to have this deal done as Calgary was a team I was very interested in playing for .
I was encouraged by the commitment Calgary showed by acquiring me prior to July 1 , " Bouwmeester said in a statement .
" I am familiar with some of the players and believe we have a strong club that is poised to make the next step in becoming a championship club .
I look forward to contributing to that success . "
Calgary exited the playoffs in the first round for a fourth straight year last season .
Darryl Sutter hired his brother Brent as the new head coach with improving the defense in mind and the signing of the six - foot - four , 212 - pound Bouwmeester is another piece of that puzzle .
Bouwmeester played for Canada at the 2006 Olympics in Turin , Italy , as a replacement for injured Scott Niedermayer .
" You can put him in any situation , power play , penalty kill , five on five , four on four and because he 's such a smart player and such a great skater , he brings a lot of things to the table , " Brent Sutter said .
" He has a great understanding of how to play when the team does n't have the puck and how to pay attention to detail . "

WASHINGTON  Pressed by industry lobbyists ,
White House officials on Wednesday assured drug makers that the administration stood by a behind - the - scenes deal to block any Congressional effort to extract cost savings from them beyond an agreed - upon $ 80 billion .
Drug industry lobbyists reacted with alarm this week to a House health care overhaul measure that would allow the government to negotiate drug prices and demand additional rebates from drug manufacturers .
In response , the industry successfully demanded that the White House explicitly acknowledge for the first time that it had committed to protect drug makers from bearing further costs in the overhaul .
The Obama administration had never spelled out the details of the agreement .
“ We were assured : ‘ We need somebody to come in first .
If you come in first , you will have a rock - solid deal , ’ ” Billy Tauzin , the former Republican House member from Louisiana who now leads the pharmaceutical trade group , said Wednesday .
“ Who is ever going to go into a deal with the White House again if they do n’t keep their word ?
You are just going to duke it out instead . ”
WASHINGTON --
In her maiden Supreme Court appearance last week , Justice Sonia Sotomayor made a provocative comment that probed the foundations of corporate law .
During arguments in a campaign - finance case , the court 's majority conservatives seemed persuaded that corporations have broad First Amendment rights and that recent precedents upholding limits on corporate political spending should be overruled .

Fiji has been suspended from the Commonwealth after the South Pacific island nation 's military government failed to respond to a demand to begin restoring democracy , according to the organization 's head .
" This is a step the Commonwealth is now obliged to take in defence of its fundamental values and principles , and one that it takes in sorrow , " Commonwealth Secretary General Kamalesh Sharma said in a videotaped statement on Tuesday .
The 53 - nation Commonwealth had demanded Fiji meet conditions , such as resuming a dialogue with opposition groups and holding early elections , by midnight local time , or face suspension .
Sharma said Fiji responded to the request by the deadline , but it did not meet all of the group 's requirements .
Fiji has been under military rule since self - appointed Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama , the country 's armed forces chief , seized power in a 2006 coup .
His government had promised elections earlier this year .
Sharma said the Commonwealth remained open to " engaging with the Fiji interim government towards the restoration of constitutional democracy in the country . "
Under the suspension , representatives and nominees of Fiji 's interim government will be excluded from participation at all inter-governmental Commonwealth meetings and activities .
While Fiji will technically remain a Commonwealth member , the country will not be able to participate in Commonwealth sporting events , and all emblematic representation of Fiji at Commonwealth events and meetings will cease , the organization said .
Let ’s say you ’re a talk - show host and you get the one guy who precisely predicted the financial collapse a year before it happened .
You want to talk to him about the health - care reform debate and the financial implications of the current legislation .
Note also that the guest has been openly considering a run against an incumbent Senator .
As an interviewer , what strategy would you choose ?
A.
Ask him to detail in depth how he predicted the financial collapse and to provide parallels to what he sees in the health - care debateB .
Acknowledge his success in predicted the 2008 collapse , but focus instead on the financial implications of health - care reform as a separate topicC .
Research the topic thoroughly and debate him point - for - point on substantive matters within the billD .
Talk over him , do n’t allow him to answer anything completely , offer juvenile demands to force the guest to give complicated answers in “ 30 seconds ” , and berate him when he attempts to explain why that ’s the entire problem with the health - care debateMost interviewers will choose either A , B , or C , and all three are legitimate ways to interview an expert guest .
If you want D , you usually have to tune in to MS - NBC , where Lawrence O’Donnell filled in for Ed Schultz on The Ed Show and channeled his inner Wally George .
O’Donnell interviewed Peter Schiff , the man who tried to warn everyone that the housing bubble would burst and create a catastrophe , only in the sense that Schiff was allowed to remain on camera during an almost - uninterrupted diatribe by O’Donnell .
Why did O’Donnell act like a middle - school bully instead of a news interviewer ?
Apart from the fact that O’Donnell is a middle - school bully on air , Schiff wants to run against Chris Dodd for his Senate seat , and Schiff opposes ObamaCare .
Instead of allowing Schiff to actually explain why , O’Donnell simply shouts over him and issues ridiculous time demands , and does just about everything short of sticking his fingers in his ears and yelling “ NA - NA - NA - I - CAN’T - HEAR - YOU ” when Schiff tries to explain his positions .
You know , if MS - NBC was an actual news organization , someone there would be embarrassed .
The USA is suffering the most severe ammunition famine in living memory .
Gun fanciers , fearing a Democrat crackdown on every American 's right to pack heat , are clearing shelves at ammo shops and hoarding cartridges .
AP reports that the Remington Arms Company 's factory in North Carolina is now working around the clock trying to supply insatiable demand for rifle , pistol and shotgun cartridges .
" We 've had to add a fourth shift and go 24 - 7 , " Remington spokesman Al Russo told the news wire .
" It 's a phenomenon that I have not seen before in my 30 years in the business . "
The shortages are so bad that retail globocorp Wal - Mart has been forced to introduce rationing at the ammo counter in many of its stores .
Depending on calibre , customers may be limited to purchases of just 50 rounds at a time .
Apparently , classic .45 ACP pistol ammunition is especially scarce - a fairly good indication that it is in fact conservative Middle America rather than , say , inner-city criminals buying up all the ammo* .
According to the National Rifle Association , America 's pro-guns lobby , the people of the USA normally buy about 7 billion cartridges a year ( an average of 23 rounds per head ) .
The past year has seen that figure jump to 9 billion .
The FBI reports a 25 per cent climb in background checks made prior to gun sales .
The ammo rush has been dubbed the " Obama effect " by gun-industry people , but in fact there is no sign at present of any particularly aggressive move towards stricter federal gun laws .
Police forces across the States reportedly suffered from some ammo shortages earlier in the year , but this was in large part unrelated to the surge in civilian demand .
Rather , heavy use by the US military overseas made it hard to obtain ammunition such as 5.56 mm assault - rifle / intermediate - power cartridges , commonly used by plods and troops but much less so by civilian gun owners .
Meanwhile the ongoing shortages have seen ammo prices soar .
" Used to be gold , but now lead is the most expensive metal , " one gun enthusiast told AP .
" And worth every penny . " ®
Bootnote
* Most kinds of .45 have unexceptional muzzle energy and are big and fat , giving fairly poor performance even against light , flexible body armour .
It was the standard US military pistol round for a long time and many diehards still swear by it , but people who carry guns for a living - cops , soldiers , criminals - are mostly using other calibres these days .
( Some spec-ops troops still use .45 , as the bullet is subsonic and thus can be effectively silenced . )
EU monitors have not been allowed into S Ossetia to verify reports Russia says EU monitors have helped stabilise the situation in Georgia since last year 's war , but has rejected any similar role for the US .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the peace plan brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy " continues to be a most serious stabilising factor " .
He accused Georgia of trying to " drag the Americans into Georgia " and put them up against the Russian military .
Russian troops ousted Georgian forces from South Ossetia nearly a year ago .
Mr Sarkozy , acting on behalf of the EU , brokered a ceasefire after five days of fighting in and around the breakaway territory , where separatists are backed by Russian troops .
Russia has beefed up its military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia - another breakaway region in Georgia - and has recognised both territories as independent .

The Georgia - South Ossetia boundary remains tense , with both sides accusing each other of cross - border shooting .
Russia has heightened its forces ' state of alert in South Ossetia .
The Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister , Giga Bokeria , said Russia was escalating the situation by its actions and rhetoric .
Russia criticises Biden
The 225 EU monitors are spending more time keeping watch along the boundary , but so far have been unable to find evidence for any of the claims of violations , the BBC's Tom Esslemont reports .
Speaking in a Russian television interview on Wednesday , Mr Lavrov said the Georgia conflict had had " no effect whatsoever " on the decisions reached during US President Barack Obama 's visit to Moscow last month .
He said the position of Russia 's Western partners towards Georgia had changed and " there are no longer emotional outbursts , they are just going through the motions , I would say " .
But he criticised a recent interview that US Vice President Joe Biden gave to the Wall Street Journal , in which he described Russia as a weakened nation because of the economic crisis .
Mr Lavrov said that was " reminiscent of speeches by leading officials in the George Bush administration " .
Mr Biden voiced support for Georgia on a recent visit to Tbilisi , but he resisted Georgian pressure to send US monitors to the region .
The EU has urged Russia and Georgia to show restraint as the anniversary of the war , on 7 August , approaches .
The EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia ( EUMM ) is the only organisation now monitoring the boundary line .
It has called for unrestricted access on both sides of the boundary .
But Russian and Ossetian forces have not allowed EU personnel into South Ossetia to check the allegations of Georgian attacks .
Troop deployments Russia currently has about 1,000 troops in Abkhazia and about 800 in South Ossetia , Russia 's Deputy Foreign Minister , Grigory Karasin , said on Wednesday .
He said the strength would be increased to about 1,500 in each territory by the end of this year , " substantially lower than the initial figure " .
Last year Russia announced plans to keep 3,800 troops in Abkhazia and the same number in South Ossetia .
Meanwhile , a senior Russian commander , Gen Anatoly Nogovitsyn , said four captured US Humvee armoured vehicles would remain in Russian hands as " trophies " .
The vehicles had been used in joint US - Georgian military exercises .
Gen Nogovitsyn also said Russia had lost four aircraft and four pilots during the war with Georgia .
The fate of a fifth pilot , who flew a Tu - 22 bomber , was unknown , he said .

Consider the example of a chemical plant with a control panel that has 100 on / off switches used to regulate the manufacturing process .
You are given the task of finding the combination of switch settings that will generate the highest total output for the plant .
How would you solve the problem ?
One obvious approach would be to run the plant briefly with each possible combination of switch settings and select the best one .
Unfortunately , even in this very simplified example there are 2^100 possible combinations .
This is a surprisingly gigantic number much larger , for instance , than the number of grains of sand on Earth .
We could spend a million lifetimes trying various combinations of switches and never get to most of the possible combinations .
But there ’s a trick that can help us .
Once we start to try combinations , we might begin to notice patterns like “ when switches 17 and 84 are set to on , ’ production tends to increase when I put switch 53 to the off ’ position . ”
Such insights could help us to narrow down our search , and get to the answer faster .
This might not seem to be much help in the face of such an enormous number of possibilities , but the power of these rules is also surprising .
To illustrate this , think of a simple game : I pick a random whole number between one and a billion , and you try to guess it .
If the only thing I tell you when you make each guess is whether you are right or wrong , you would have very little chance of guessing my number even if I let you guess non -stop for a year .
If , however , I tell you whether each guess is high or low , there is a procedure that will get the exact answer within about 30 guesses .
You should always guess 500 million first .
For all subsequent guesses , you should always pick the mid-point of the remaining possibilities .
If , for example , the response to your opening guess of 500 million is that you are too high , your next guess should be the mid-point of the remaining possibilities , or 250 million .
If the response to this second guess is “ too low , ” then your next guess should be the mid-point of 250 million and 500 million , or 375 million , and so on .
You can find my number within about a minute .
A Genetic Algorithm works on roughly the same principle .
To return to our problem of the 2^100 possible combinations of switch settings , we can use a GA as an automated procedure to sort through the vast “ search space ” of possibilities and thus home in quickly on the best one .
This procedure has the same three elements as our procedure for guessing the number : a starting guess , a feedback measurement that gives some indication of how good any guess is , and an iterative method that exploits this feedback to improve subsequent guesses .
In order to establish the initial guess for the GA , imagine writing a vertical column of 100 zeroes and ones on a piece of paper .
If we agree to let one = “ turn the switch on ” and zero= “ turn the switch off , ” this could be used as a set of instructions for operating the chemical plant .
The first of the hundred would tell us whether switch 1 should be on or off , the second would tell us what to do with switch 2 , and so on all the way down to the 100th switch .
This is a pretty obvious analogy to what happens with biological organisms and their genetic codes and therefore , in a GA , we refer to this list as a “ genome . ”
The mapping of genome to physical manifestation is termed the genotype - phenotype map .
Eric Poses is the creator of the board game Loaded Questions .
A new , updated version of the game was just released last week .
Eric is a bit of a GeekDad himself , with two kids ( ages four and one ) now .
I got the opportunity to speak with him about Loaded Questions , taking a chance on board game design , and playing games with young kids .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Read the interview , or listen to the audio .
GeekDad :
Let ’s do obvious introductory questions first :
Tell me just a little about yourself .
Eric Poses : I ’m 35 , I live in Miami , and I ’ve been in the world of board games for 13 years now .
At the age of 23 I had an idea for a board game while I was working as a copywriter at an ad agency in Miami .
I thought the idea was great , I quit my job , invited friends over for pizza and beer .
We tested it out , and it worked well .
Not too many weeks or months afterward I produced 5,000 copies of my first game , Loaded Questions .
Shortly after that , I started driving around the country for 16 weeks selling the game out of the trunk of my car to mom and pop stores .
I ’d sleep on friends ’ couches .
I was just out of college , I was n’t married , no kids , like I am now .
Very few responsibilities , so I was able to camp out and sleep cheaply .
You know , I ’d splurge on a Motel 6 if I needed to .
During the trip the game was pretty successful .
I sold about 1,000 games , I got a lot of good media coverage .
That year , 1997 , Toys R
Us decided to test it in about a hundred stores and it tested very well .
The following year they brought it into all stores , and that ’s kind of the early success of Loaded Questions .
Today the game has sold a million copies and it ’s at Target , Toys R Us , Barnes & Noble , Borders , all the websites and such .
So that ’s the start of my board games–it started with the one idea .
GD : Well , that definitely takes guts , to quit your job before you start doing all your playtesting and producing .
EP : Well , like I said , I was 23 and young and dumb , it was kind of a dead end job .
I think I did test play the game a couple times before I decided to quit so I genuinely thought I had an idea on my hands .
And actually , my boss at the time — I let him know why I was quitting and , without a contract being presented to me , he did offer to bankroll the project in exchange for having a large percentage of the success of the game .
Thankfully , I decided not to do that and just went on my own .
So from that first idea , though , I certainly now think in terms of board games .
If I have an idea , I usually say : “ Oh , how can that be a board game ? ”
Or if I ’m in casual conversation with a friend and an interesting topic comes up or some sort of game we might play just organically , I think : “ Hey , how can that be packaged ?
How can that be turned into a more formal concept ? ”
GD : Have you published any other board games ?
EP : I ’ve done twelve games , five of which are Loaded Questions games .
A few years ago , I partnered with the New Yorker magazine and did a game based on their weekly caption contest that runs in the back of the magazine , where you see a cartoon and come up with your own caption .
I did a game called The Joke Game where , if you do n’t know the punch line , you make one up .
If you know the punch line you advance on the board and if you do n’t you ’re trying to come up with the funniest one .
Whoever writes down the funniest original one gets to advance .
You ’re trying to get your chicken , which is your game piece , across the road .
But , no , I ’ve had several duds , several that have done well , and then the Loaded Questions games have been my most popular games .
GD : Now did you write all of the questions for the first edition , and the new edition ?
EP : Pretty much .
The new black edition has more than 1300 questions and I ’m probably responsible for 1200 of them .
And I do write the content for all my games .
Except for the New Yorker game — I did n’t draw all the cartoons !
But the content for my other games , yeah , that ’s the real fun part I have with my business .
GD : What board games do you enjoy , before creating Loaded Questions , for instance ?
EP : Aside from test playing my own games to death , my wife and will definitely play the occasional Scrabble .
I like playing chess with friends , backgammon .
But in terms of party games , I ’ve pretty much stuck to the classics that your average non-gamer probably mentions : Trivial Pursuit , Monopoly with nieces and nephews .
Any new game out there I ’ll buy at your local Target or Barnes and Noble and check out , give it a go .
But in terms of common gameplay around the house , I ’d say that Scrabble and chess are the two most popular .
GD : Most of the games I play that I ’ve been getting into are more of the European “ designer ” games or “ tabletop ” gaming …
EP : … Settlers of Catan …
GD : … Carcassonne , and from there on .
But I did play a lot of Taboo in college …
EP : That ’s a great game .
GD : And I ’ve always enjoyed Balderdash , and Loaded Questions reminded me a little of Balderdash .
You know , everyone comes up with an answer and you ’re trying to guess the right one .
EP : Yeah , definitely , if you ’ve played Balderdash this will seem familiar .
GD : But I like the idea that with this one you ’re not trying to get the “ right ” answer .
You ’re trying to guess what everyone ’s answers are .
EP : Right .
The game tests players on how well they know each other , with all the fun personal questions .
So , yeah , the European games and all the role - playing games are definitely a different world than I ’m in .
You know , my games tend to be the adult party games , social interaction games .
Anyone in the game world has to have a great deal of respect for the kind of games you ’re talking about , which are much more complex , especially in terms of development .
For me , my games , it ’s : “ Hey , this would be a cool thing to do . ”
And then I ’ll sit down and whip up content , and work with my graphic designer to package something that looks really cool , and hope that like - minded adults will have fun playing this .
But my concepts are very simple : you get through the instructions in about 3 minutes .
GD : Yeah , I was very pleased to be able to read through the instructions and go : “ Look , it ’s the whole thing ! ” — front and back and that ’s it .
Now , I have to ask , since you ’ve got young kids at home , when you do your game development , and writing up all the questions which obviously takes a lot of time … when do you do that ?
EP : I do it at the office — I ’ll put a pot of coffee on at night .
You know , if I have to put in a little bit of Bailey ’s to keep me into it , then I will .
The questions also just happen , where if I ’m in my car , you know , someone might cut me off , and I ’ll think , “ What ’s the worst thing someone can do while you ’re driving ? ” and I ’ll write that down in my car .
So the questions happen all the time .
And then , just like I did in high school and just like I did in college , when I ’m getting close to production time and I go through the questions that I have and I say , “ Oh , shoot , I need at least a couple hundred more , ” I will pound it out where I will just lock myself in a room and just start writing .
It ’s amazing , how effective that ’s been for me for high school , college and the last thirteen years running my business , in terms of the cramming .
GD : Have you involved your kids in the creation process yet ?
Or playing ?
EP : Playing , actually , yes .
I just came out with a travel version for Loaded Questions and tried to skew it for — the original game is for teen to adult , and the travel version is ten to adult .
My daughter ’s only 4 , she ’s turning 4 , but I would sort through the questions that were appropriate for her and play the game with my daughter and my wife .
And she actually got into it .
You know , there were certain questions she could n’t understand but some that she could , in terms of how to properly answer and if she could actually have a perspective on it .
Like : “ What would be a terrible summer camp to go to ? ” is something we could have fun with .
Or “ What would be a funny name for a monster ? ”
So I had to pick and choose , but , it ’s great and it ’s fun to see their minds working and the content is certainly appropriate for anyone .
There ’s no dirty words or the subject matter is not too risqué — that ’s the adult version .
But , yeah , I have played with my daughter and she likes it .
GD : Okay , well , I might give this a shot with my 5 year old then .
EP : She ’ll like it !
With the black version you have — that ’s the new “ original ” version — you ’ll find at least a couple hundred questions that she ’ll really get a kick out of answering , I bet .
GD : I think like some of the other geekdads , you do n’t want them to grow up too quickly but at the same time , I really want her to get to the age where she wants to play the games that I play .
EP : Yes , that ’s very true .
I have that same thing going on at home .
GD : Although I guess in your case , you could start designing games : “ We ’re gonna get a five - year - old game next , and then a six - year - old game … ”
EP : Well , I have gone to her school and I made up a couple games for the kids in her class and the older kids .
So there ’s always homemade games that you can do .
And I did a homemade game out of Loaded Questions where it was basically , I did a big poster board of likes and dislikes .
Each kid came up and whispered to me one thing they liked and one thing they disliked .
And then I would read out , “ Okay , one of the kids in your class really does n’t like Batman .
Who do you think said that ? ”
All the kids were having fun trying to guess which one it was .
There were only fifteen kids in the class — not too many to choose from — and it was fun .
I did another funny game with them where I pretended I was a mad scientist who had just come down to Earth .
I would say , “ I have a great idea for an invention .
It ’s something that has four legs and you can sit on it if your legs were tired . ”
Everyone would say , “ That ’s a chair , silly ! ” and I ’m like , “ Wait , a chair ’s already been invented ?
That was the name I had for it . ”
And so I ’d go through a bunch of things like that and they were having fun with it .
So … you have to be really basic and silly for games for kids that young .
If you were to play with your five - year - old , the way we did it is : on her turn , you would read out the question and you ’d say , “ All right , mommy and I have our answers , one of us said this , one of us said that , who do you think said what ? ”
Or your daughter and your wife bring it , and your wife reads out the questions and answers and you have to guess who said what .
That ’s the home version .
GD : We may have to try that one out .
It ’s exciting getting more games that we can include our kids in .
EP : Are there games you guys play as a family now ?
GD : There ’s one that we play , it ’s actually a kind of dexterity game called Gulo Gulo .
It ’s little wooden eggs in a bowl that you have to pull out the right egg without knocking this egg alarm over .
The little kids tend to be much better at that than the adults .
You just use your fingers , so you know little kids with tiny little sticky fingers tend to do much better than clumsy adult fingers .
There ’s a very silly card game called There ’s a Moose in Your House .
It ’s very simple but basically you play empty rooms on someone and then you fill them with moose .
Actually , the high schoolers here really enjoy that one as well .
But it ’s something that is simple enough that preschool or elementary school kids can get .
And it ’s got silly photos of moose sleeping in a bed , or moose in the bathtub .
EP : There ’s that series of I Can Do That games .
They partnered with Dr. Seuss and … the content runs a little thin , after like two or three times playing it .
But it ’s something my daughter , when she was three , was really into .
You have to perform different activities .
So you turn over three cards and you have to balance a ball under your chin while you hop on one foot a few times .
But it only comes with about twenty - five cards .
Once you play the game a couple times : “ All right , I guess I have to put the ball under my chin again … ”
So I would maybe stay away from those games .
GD : And then we have the classics like Chutes and Ladders , and Hi-Ho Cherry - O and that sort of thing .
Well , did you have anything else you ’d like to share about Loaded Questions or any of your other games ?
EP : I think geekdads like you and me and other geekdads will truly appreciate the humor with the questions that I come up with in this version .
It ’s pretty much automatic fun and the one thing that you mentioned is , you look at the instructions and you ’re like , “ That ’s it ? ” and that ’s kind of a good thing .
You can kind of jump into the gameplay immediately .
I think that ’s one positive .
And I tell people that the RPGs and the advanced strategy games are beyond my pay grade but I ’m a pretty funny conversational guy , and hopefully that comes out in my games .
so there ’s definitely a lot of creativity and fun in them .
GD : All right , thank you very much !
It ’s been nice talking to you , and we ’ll look forward to trying out Loaded Questions !
The new Black edition of Loaded Questions is available at various major retailers as well as online .
There is also a new travel version available , released last month .
The older Blue edition of Loaded Questions , now about twelve years old , may still be in stock at some stores , but Eric mentioned that the new version has a completely different look to it , with new graphics , custom playing pieces and die , and a lot of additional content .

It was long , again .
He 's always long .
It kills him because his point gets lost .
It 's his father 's fault .
Brown never escapes the pulpit oratory he grew up with .
Old fashioned preaching bellows a series of fantastic assertions that he takes no trouble to explain .
If you do n't believe them already they strike you as silly .
But they liked it in the hall , it has to be said .
They were believers .
It made them feel good about being fighting collectivists .
We had a whooper in front of us .
She had a hoot that went in one ear and came out the other like a javelin .
Yes , I suffer , but I do n't complain .
It 's service , you see .
I sketch to serve .
Gordon ranged over the £ 600 bn he spends every year and pulled out some examples where people had benefited .
Hoot , hoot !
Minimum wage .
Waiting lists .
School buildings .
Scrapping that vile tory plan for ID cards .
Yes , real achievements .
But that 's enough of that .

Sarah Brown caused several diabetic episodes in the hall with her matrimonial endorsements .
I could take " my husband , my hero " but when she thanked voters " for welcoming us into the heart of your communities " there was a dangerous moment with the late lunch .
And when she said Gordon went to bed and got up in the morning thinking of the country and " always , always putting you first " then I knew I should n't have risked the second sundae .
And if he does think of the country all the time why is she so sure they 'll " be together for all times " ?

Gordon .
If you like the sort of things he does , you 'll forgive him the oratorical defects .
Me , I get short of breath at defects that stem from his personality .
His sectarian isolation .
His view of Conservatives is pathological .
He will " reject every piece of conservative advice . "
Why ?
" They are consistently wrong all the time ? "
Wot , always ?
So he has to justify his psychotic view and that means saying tories will take active and unhealthy pleasure in cutting funding for schools and hospitals .
It aint true .
And then to dramatise his rectitude he 's going to pass a law to make it illegal not to halve the deficit in four years .
But only because he knows he wo n't be in power to be arrested when it does n't happen .
Gordon believes that " measures , not men " are the important thing .
Napoleon believed that in war " moral qualities " ( i.e. Men ) outweighed " materiel " ( i.e. Measures ) by three to one .
If Napoleon is right , Gordon is suffering under a massive misapprehension and a fatal election strategy of his own devising .
It may yet happen ; Labour 's Go Fourth campaign may end in their coming third .
But , how did the ducks get in there ?!?
I was n't alone , you understand .
There were many other people who needed to get involved to make this happen .
There 's my friend whose car was so achingly in need of a rubber duck infestation .
Our supplier without whom we just would n't have been able to pull it off .
And of course , a secret army of pranksters with spare time , some moneys , and a penchant for mischief .
It all started in January of 2008 .
For reasons that seemed perfectly clear at the time , I had a genuine need to acquire some ducks .
That was when I first discovered Just Ducks , who are without doubt , one of the nicest companies I have ever worked with .
Having identified which ducks I needed for my other purposes , I was pricing them up .
Unfortunately ( for our friend with the car ) , the website shows prices for a lot of ducks .
Quite a lot of ducks indeed .
So many , in fact , that it got me to thinking of things you could do with thousands of ducks .
Around the same time I had pre-emptively acquired the spare keys for my friend 's MX5 .
I had no goal in mind , and at the time it seemed like the right thing to do .
I knew my risk of getting caught was about the same as the chance the friend in question had of parking properly .
I was probably just going to play the usual joke of moving it around the car park .
Something like that .
But then , the vision came .
The power of crazy coursed through me , and I had to fill that MX5 with ducks .
You have to understand two things .
One : I had to do something with that car .
Two : I must do it with thousands of ducks .
No other combination was acceptable .
Over the months that followed , many people asked why I was filling a car with ducks .
Those people have no sense of adventure .
My only reason was “ Because it 's thousands of ducks ! ” I could n't do it alone .
So I asked for help .
And the people who wanted to help found even more people to help .
Even Wikipedia helped , oh , and I hope this site gives them the evidence they wanted !
It 's against all laws of God and Man to fill a person 's car with rubber ducks and not take a picture ( Wikipedia )
Next , I made possibly the strangest phone call of my life .
I guess that being the UK 's biggest duck merchant you get used to people like me .
We made arrangements for the supply of 3,600 ducks ( for some reason , the manufacturer ships in boxes of 600 ) , and duly tried to pay .
Apparently , this triggered my bank 's anti-fraud mechanisms on my credit card .
Normally , I 'd be thankful that my bank prevent reckless duck purchasing willy - nilly .
Instead , I had to make a second , stranger , phone call , this time to my bank .
It 's one thing to order 3,600 ducks .
It 's quite another in cold blood to prove your identity , and declare to a call centre operative that you have a solemn intent to buy thousands of rubber ducks .
We then played the waiting game , until D - Day on the 15th of March , 2008 .
In the interim , we made sure our plans would work .
Our main problem : getting the owner to turn up on time .
Many of our hare - brained schemes involved random strangers who 've knocked a piece off his car or impersonating policemen .
It did n't take long for us to twig that man 's mighty need to eat roast dinners was our easiest approach .
Eventually , the day itself was upon us .
Everything was ready :
5 duck masks , the better to disguise ourselves
Purloined car keys
Remote spy camera and recording gear ( many thanks to Spy Review )
Digital cameras
A few balloons to protect the footwells , and of course
3,600 rubber ducks
Having got up well before noon we ventured out in the slightly nippy March air , and moseyed on down into position .
That was when we discovered our first opportunity for blunder ; the car had been parked directly outside the balcony of the owner .
We made an executive decision to fill the car in situ , rapidly , and hope that we were n't spotted .
We poured the ducks in to the car by ripping open black bin liners that we had previously filled .
While this was going on , we also attached the spy camera and picked what we thought was a sensible angle .
As an aside into the perils of live action pranks , it seems that the owner decided to walk around the car and end up directly behind the spy camera , rather than in front of it .
Ho hum .
In our haste to get the car full as quickly as possible , we managed to cover ourselves in the glory of another blunder by not considering how we were going to close the door .
I suppose I ought to clarify that .
It was n't a lack of planning , or that we had n't thought this one through , it 's just that we had n't had a dress rehearsal .
Seems our plan to use a sheet of cardboard as a fence over which we could pour the ducks worked .
The trouble was the bit where we thought we could slide the cardboard out slowly as we shut the door behind it .
A few hundred spilled ducks and some quick thinking , quick reactions , and quick chopping of cardboard later , and we managed to get the door closed , locked , and the holding in thousands of ducks .
So. 3 months of planning , a faux roast dinner lure , and a car filled with ducks .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Of course , the neighbours had been giving us a lot of attention up until this point .
What they had n't done was give us cause for concern .
Right up until the neighbours in the flat next door came out the back of the property , and round the front to get into their car .
WHY ?!
Was this the usual route to get out ?
Was it shorter ?
What would happen if the owner came out that way too ?
WHY GOD ?!
WHY ?
Why would they do that ?!
Fortunately , our supply master had even thought to bring along some walkie - talkies .
We posted a man at the back entrance , a man at the front , and all went into hiding .
For ages .
I 'm not talking five minutes here that felt like a long time because we were all in deep anticipation .
I 'm talking more than half an hour .
It was so long that we were worried that the camera would need a new tape and batteries .
We even rang him up and said the roast was ready early to try and hurry him out of the house .
Eventually , the moment was ours .
Softly , slowly , pondering across the road to his car , with a look of puzzlement detectable at 40 paces , came the owner .
As a bonus , along came his housemate from whom we had also kept our hijinks secret .
I think they thought it was about to explode or something — they were pretty cautious as they approached it .
Stop. Stare .
Look around in wonder .
Stare some more .
Look around again .
Spot camera man .
Walk in general direction of camera .
Discover remaining four buffoons hidden round corner , laughing incessantly .
Ask in amazement how all the ducks got in there .
To my surprise , and slight dismay , he took the whole thing in good humour .
We revelled in the telling him the details of the plan , visible signs of " WTF ? " coming from him and his housemate .
In the end , he was so mystified that he went and had a shower .
And so , as it begin to rain , we scooped all the ducks back up , disposed of the balloons , had a damn good laugh , packed the rest of the kit away , and went to the pub to celebrate .
Much fun was had by all .

You just knew all that Tetris playing you didyesterday was good for you , huh ?
A new study published by the big thinkers at Mind Research Network has found that " practicing Tetris " can actually improve brain efficiency and lead to a thicker cortex in other areas of the tabula rasa .
In short , the study was done in order to show that the brain can change with stimulation , and that " a challenging visuospatial task has an impact on the structure of the cortex . "
Of course , this is far from the first published report to use the quarter century - old title as its testing tool , but it 's certainly one of the best for getting your mum and pop to believe gaming really is good for the gord .
Hit up the read links below for all the details -- you know they 'll be firing off questions when you hit 'em with this .

- Most alarming for people like me , who at 84 years of age recently needed a quadruple bypass and aortic valve replacement , are the pronouncements of President Obama 's appointee , Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel , brother of Obama 's Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , who , according to a New York Post op ed article by Betsy McCauley , former Lt. Governor of the State of New York , stated , " Savings , he writes , will require changing how doctors think about their patients : Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath too seriously , 'as an imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of the cost or effects on others ' "
He also stated , " ; communitarianism ' should guide decisions on who gets care .
He says medical care should be reserved for the non-disabled , not given to those ' who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens ...
An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia .
'" In the currentdebate over health care reform , " rationing " has become a dirty word .
Meeting last month with five governors , President Obama urged them to avoid using the term , apparently for fear of evoking the hostile response that sank the ’ attempt to achieve reform . . . The case for explicit health care rationing in thestarts with the difficulty of thinking of any other way in which we can continue to provide adequate health care to people on Medicaid and Medicare , let alone extend coverage to those who do not now have it .
Health - insurance premiums have more than doubled in a decade , rising four times faster than wages .
. . Rationing health care means getting value for the billions we are spending by setting limits on which treatments should be paid for from the public purse .
. .
The debate over health care reform in theshould start from the premise that some form of health care rationing is both inescapable and desirable .
Then we can ask ,
What is the best way to do it ?
There is a puzzle listed at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mblum/research/pdf/grad.html that goes as follows :
Given a can of black and white coffee beans , do the following : Pull out two beans : if both are the same color , replace them with a white bean .
If the two are different , replace them with a black bean .
What color is the last bean ?
I thought about it for a while and figured out the answer , but I was unsatisfied with the way the puzzle is phrased , because there is n’t one set answer : from the information given the last bean cannot be said to be either black or white .
Instead , the answer is a simple method of determining the color of the last bean , given additional information .
This discrepancy led me to waste some time trying to find a determinative answer first , and then to question whether I really had the correct answer once I had found it .
But just giving the requisite information in addition to the above description gives too much of a hint , and collapses the puzzle to a much simpler one .
So I would phrase the puzzle like this :
Given a can of black and white coffee beans , you are allowed to do the following operation repeatedly .
Pull out two beans , then :
If the two beans are the same color , replace them with a white bean .
If the two beans are different , replace them with a black bean .
What simple method can you use to know what the color of the last bean will be ?
Now it ’s clear that there is no set answer , but hopefully I have n’t given away too much .
The answer will be in a separate post .

While you might already be ahead of the game if you are studying at all , you might as well make the most of the time you spend preparing for class and ensure that all those hours you put into reviewing notes and reading chapters actually pay off .
Here are some tips that can help you learn to study better and get more out of what you ’re studying so you can spend less time pouring over books and more time enjoying life at school .
1 . Find some peace and quiet .
Studies have shown that just 20 minutes of highly focused , quiet time can help you learn and remember more than hours of working with distractions and while multi-tasking .
So , to get the most out of your study time retreat to a place where you wo n’t be bothered by loud music or talking and can just focus in on your work .
2 . Get organized .
If your papers and materials are all over , you ’ll spend just as much time looking for what you need as actually reading through and absorbing material which does n’t make for a very productive use of your time .
Keep one notebook just for notes for a class and ensure that all your papers are in a place you can actually locate them .
It might take more planning up front but it will pay off in the long run .
3 . Take breaks .
Studying intensely can really take a toll on your brain and eventually make it hard for you to think clearly at all .
That is n’t much of a help when you ’re trying to understand difficult concepts or learn new things .
Take short breaks during your study time so you can rest your eyes and mind and come back refreshed and ready to learn .
4 . Have a schedule .
The problem with the way that many students study is that they wait until the last minute and begin cramming the day before a big test .
This really is n’t the most effective way to learn or remember new information .
While it might not be fun , spending time in the weeks leading up to a test reviewing the material will be much more beneficial and might actually help you remember the material after the test as well .
5. Consider the subject .
Each subject has a particular way in which it will be easiest to learn and remember .
Subjects that require memorization may be more easy to learn with flashcards and timelines while subjects like math that require problem solving might be better served with doing the practice problems in your book .
Spend some time figuring out just how you learn each subject best and then use that knowledge to maximize what you get out of your study sessions .
6. Study more frequently .
It is n’t the duration of your study sessions that really makes a difference , it ’s the frequency .
You ’ll learn a lot more through repetition , so break up your study time into shorter sessions every day rather than trying to cram it all in at the last minute .
7 . Write it down .
For most people , writing things down helps big time when it comes time to recall things on a test or even just during study time .
Take notes in class and use methods that require you to do something to actively participate in learning the material– not just reading it over and over .
8 . Be realistic .
You ’re not going to be able to memorize an entire month ’s worth of material in only one night of intense studying .
You likely wo n’t remember a good chunk of it .
Be realistic in how you break up your study sessions and tackle only the amount of material that you ’ll actually be able to benefit from studying – not the whole book at once .

I facilitated an openspace session on acceptance testing and collaboration between business people , developers and testers at CITCON Europe last week .
We started with a list of five common reasons why I ’ve seen teams fail with acceptance testing but added five more during the discussion , so here ’s an expanded top 10 list :
No collaboration — as a specification of a system that acts as the shared definition of done , acceptance tests need to be collaboratively produced and agreed upon .
Business people , developers and testers should all provide input , each from their own area of expertise .
The discussion that happens around the specification is actually more valuable than the tests themselves , as people build a shared understanding of the domain and the problem at hand .
If this discussion does n't happen , then teams still feel the effects of the telephone game .
Symptoms of this problem are developers writing acceptance tests themselves , testers being expected to handle everything about acceptance testing and business dictating tests without any feedback from developers or testers .
The solution for this are collaborative specifications and specification workshops .
Focusing on how , not on what — business specifications should be clear and understandable and allow the team to implement the best possible solution without prescribing the design or the implementation .
Too often tests describe how something should be implemented rather than what should be implemented .
Tests such as these are too low level , hard to understand and always turn out to be a pain to maintain long - term .
Instead of facilitating system change they inhibit it as people will be reluctant to introduce changes that break a lot of tests .
Symptoms of this problem are action - oriented acceptance tests , lots of workflows or duplication in tests and tests that are very technical .
The solutions for this are communicating intent and distilling the specification .
Tests unusable as live documentation — one of the greatest benefits of agile acceptance testing is that we are gradually building a human readable specification of the system .
This specification is ideally automated to a great degree so that we can be confident that it is in sync with the code .
This solves the problem of the running code being the only thing you can really trust about what the system does .
Correct , easily understandable and accessible documentation is crucial for future change .
If tests do n't serve as a live documentation that those benefits are lost .
Symptoms of this problem are very technical tests , long tests , hard to understand tests , tests that are poorly organised so that you can't quickly find relevant tests for a particular piece of functionality .
Solutions for this is to ensure that tests can be used as a live documentation , reorganising them and updating when the ubiquitous language changes .
Expecting acceptance tests to be a full regression suite — acceptance tests are primarily a specification of what the system should do and should deal with exemplars that represents whole sets of cases .
Specifying too much and covering all possible edge cases will make them hard to understand and might introduce an effect similar to paralysis by analysis .
So acceptance tests cannot provide a full regression test suite and additional tests are required ( including exploratory testing ) .
Symptoms of this problem are tests that are very long and verify a large number of similar cases .
Note that this does n't mean that regression tests can't be written and automated using the same tools as acceptance tests .
Focusing on tools — some teams focus too much on tools and features of particular tools , disregarding things that do not naturally fit into their chosen toolset .
This makes the specification vague in parts that are n't covered by a particular tool .
Instead of that , teams should be focusing on the business specifications and then choosing the right tool for the job .
In particular , tools should not play an important part in the specification workshop .
Symptoms of this problem are ignoring the UI ( as UI tests are hard to automate ) and wasting time on converting specifications in a format suitable for a particular tool during the specification workshops ( which breaks the flow of the discussion and wastes valuable time ) .
Not considering acceptance testing as value added activity — agile acceptance testing is not about QA , but more about specifying and agreeing on what needs to be done .
Teams that consider it part of QA often delegate the responsibility to it to junior programmers and testers , which effectively means that junior team members will be writing the specification ( which is wrong on so many levels that I do n't know where to start ) .
The solutions for this are specification workshops .
" Test code " not maintained with love — tests and code to automate them are often considered as less important than production code , so given to less capable developers and testers to implement and maintain .
This leads to huge maintenance problems later and can cause teams to completely abandon full suites of tests .
Acceptance tests are the specification of a system so they are crucial to the success of a project .
They also need to be maintained and kept in sync with the live project language and design in order to serve as a live documentation .
Objectives of team members not aligned — if the job of business analysts is only to deliver the specifications , the job of developers only to ship the system and the job of testers to ensure quality , then people wo n't pull in the same direction or invest time in producing good acceptance tests .
This is a management issue but failures with acceptance testing might make it more visible .
No management buy - in — successful acceptance testing requires an active participation of the business and with no management buy - in the benefits will simply not be there ( also related to # 1 ) .
Underestimating the skill required to do this well — introducing acceptance testing is a tall order and often means changing the way teams are organised and approach specifications .
This requires a lot of time and investment in skill - up , mastering tools , facilitating workshops and dealing with resistance to change .
Underestimating the effort required to do this properly might cause teams to think that they failed and get disappointed too early .

I , a former Islamic extremist , feel we have given in to the fanatics
Extremism : Abdulla Ahmed
Ali was found guilty of conspiring to murder thousands
Like many young British Muslims , I was ' radicalised ' at college .
Just as the three British - born men who were found guilty this week of plotting to blow flights out of the sky were recruited at school , I encountered extreme Muslims at the age of 16 and was slowly converted to their ranks .
At my East London college , the Islamic society was run by the extremist group Hizb ut Tahrir , which believes in setting up an Islamic state , destroying Israel , and denounces Western values .
At first , I , too , was convinced by their rhetoric .
However one awful violent moment changed me for ever .
A young African man was knifed to death by the Muslim contingent at the college , simply for being a non-believer .
After a petty row over the use of the snooker table , the Muslim group issued a call of Jihad against the young man and summoned their Hizb ut Tahrir contacts for ' outside backup ' .
An operative arrived and plunged a dagger into the boy 's heart .
The victim's name was Ayotunde Obunabi and I saw him lying dead .
To Hizb ut Tahrir his life was worthless because he was not a Muslim .
At that moment I understood the consequences of the rhetoric of radicalism .
The murder , in 1996 , compelled me to walk away from extremism .
Now I believe I have to speak out about what I see happening in Britain before a terrible act of terrorism claims yet more lives .
Although one fanatical Muslim cell has been caught , this is no time for complacency .
Make no mistake , terrorism is flourishing in our country as never before .
Why ?
Because a toxic combination of politically correct policy , denial and fear have opened the way for hate to grow in our midst .
Unwilling or unable to recognise the scale and cause of the danger we are all facing , our leaders have turned a blind eye to what is going on .
There are now tens of thousands of Muslims living in Britain , physically present in our country , but psychologically attached to Muslim - dominated countries .
Large parts of our cities have become Muslim ghettos , where you can wake up in the morning and go to bed at night without seeing a non-Muslim face .
They might as well be in Pakistan or Afghanistan for all the contact they have with ordinary Britain .
They can send their children to Muslim state schools , go to Muslim NHS doctors , and do business at the Islamic bank .
Not only this , but we , the taxpayers , fund many of these Muslim ghettos .
When immigrants arrive in this country to claim free housing from the Government , they are given a choice of Muslim areas to settle in .
Why do we allow this ?
Why not offer these new arrivals housing where they can integrate with the British people and learn about our nation 's culture ?
Meanwhile , our prisons have become recruiting centres for radical imams , or Islamic priests .
Around 10,000 ordinary Muslims are in our prison system , sharing space with convicted terrorists and extremists , putting them at risk of brainwashing .
But instead of protecting them from this , our system actually directs them towards these forces .
So when a young Asian drug dealer from Bradford 's streets goes down , he is designated a practising Muslim , whether he was previously religious or not .
He is issued with a prayer mat and a copy of the Koran and is handed over to the prison imams , many of whom come from the same Islamic school of thought that produced the Taliban .
Time and time again , I have seen Muslims go into prison as young Asian men , and return to their communities as something very different .
Then there are the satellite television stations that freely transmit the radical Islamic message straight into British homes .
Thousands of UK Muslims - watch the Islam channel for their news instead of the BBC or ITN .
The tragedy is that it does n't have to be like this .
There are four million Muslims living in America , and yet they are not producing ' home - grown ' bombers like ours , despite America leading the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that are so often cited by extremists as the root cause of their grievance .
Because of their stronger national identity , the Americans encourage immigrants to join their culture and newcomers are expected to be loyal to the U.S .
For us , it is not too late .
We can reverse the damaging policies that have made Britain a seedbed for terrorists .
But if we fail to do so , I fear we will see further carnage unleashed on our streets .
As was long expected , the FDIC ’s insurance fund is sooner or later going to be out of funds …
Geithner will ask Congress for more .
Either the Treasury will do it directly , or the underfunded FDIC will collapse under the obligations of Geithner ’s Public Private Investment Program and ask Congress for more funding .
Now the FDIC is considering all alternatives to avoid such a public relations disaster , even borrowing from banks , the institutions it insures :
Tired of the government bailing out banks ?
Get ready for this : officials may soon ask banks to bail out the government .
Senior regulators say they are seriously considering a plan to have the nation ’s healthy banks lend billions of dollars to rescue the insurance fund that protects bank depositors .
That would enable the fund , which is rapidly running out of money because of a wave of bank failures , to continue to rescue the sickest banks .
The plan , strongly supported by bankers and their lobbyists , would be a major reversal of fortune .
A hallmark of the financial crisis has been the decision by successive administrations over the last year to lend hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to large and small banks .
“ It ’s a nice irony , ” said Karen Shaw Petrou , managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics , a consulting company .
“ Like so much of this crisis , this is an issue that involves the least worst options . ”
Bankers and their lobbyists like the idea because it is more attractive than the alternatives : yet another across - the - board emergency assessment on them , or tapping an existing $ 100 billion credit line to the Treasury .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which oversees the fund , is said to be reluctant to use its authority to borrow from the Treasury .
Under the law , the F.D.I.C. would not need permission from the Treasury to tap into a credit line of up to $ 100 billion .
But such a step is said to be unpalatable to Sheila C. Bair , the agency chairwoman whose relations with the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , have been strained .
“ Sheila Bair would take bamboo shoots under her nails before going to Tim Geithner and the Treasury for help , ” said Camden R. Fine , president of the Independent Community Bankers .
“ She ’d do just about anything before going there . ”
Bankers worry that a special assessment of $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion over the next six months would crimp their profits and could push a handful of banks into deeper financial trouble or even receivership .
And any new borrowing from the Treasury would be construed as a taxpayer bailout that could open the industry to a political reaction , resulting in a wave of restrictions like fresh limits on executive pay .
Any populist furor could be avoided , the thinking goes , if the government borrows instead from the banks .
“ Borrowing from healthy banks , instead of the Treasury , has the advantage of keeping this in the family , ” said Karen M. Thomas , executive vice president of government relations at the Independent Community Bankers of America , a trade group representing about 5,000 banks .
“ It is much better for perceptions than having the fund borrow from somewhere else . ”
Ultimately , officials say , the deposit insurance corporation could settle on a plan that replenishes the insurance fund by doing some of both : borrowing from healthy banks to shore up the shorter - term liquidity needs of the fund , and imposing a special fee on banks to increase the longer - term capital level of the fund .
Since January the F.D.I.C. has seized 94 failing banks , causing a rapid decline in the deposit insurance fund .
Despite a special assessment imposed on banks a few months ago to keep the fund afloat , its cash balance now stands at about $ 10 billion , a third of its size at the start of the year .
( Another $ 32 billion has been set aside for failures that officials expect to occur in the coming months . )
The fund , which stands behind $ 4.8 trillion in insured deposits , could be wiped out by the failure of a single large bank , although the deposit insurance corporation could always seek a taxpayer bailout by borrowing from the Treasury to stay afloat .
Officials say that the F.D.I.C. will issue a proposed plan next week to begin to restore the financial health of the ailing fund .
There is no consensus among the five board members , consisting of Ms. Bair , two other F.D.I.C. officials , and the heads of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
Others may propose novel ways to replenish the fund , for example , by asking the banks to prepay the premiums that they were planning to make next year .
Borrowing from the industry is allowed under an obscure provision of a 1991 law adopted during the savings and loan crisis .
The lending banks would receive bonds from the government at an interest rate that would be set by the Treasury secretary and ultimately would be paid by the rest of the industry .
The bonds would be listed as an asset on the books of the banks .
Introduction
Sexual assault is perhaps one of the most common forms of modern day crimes .
While sexual assault is a criminal act punishable by law , it is still rampant , and many people often fail to get the best representation services .
The United States Department of Justice classifies sexual assault as any type of sexual contact that occurs without the consent of the recipient .
Some of the common forms of sexual assault that occur today include forcible sodomy , child molestation , fondling , attempted rape , just to name a few .
If you are accused of any of these types of sexual acts , it ’s vital that you gain access to the best legal services to avoid any criminal charges .
Defenses against sexual assault charges
Serving a prison sentence is not a pleasing experience for anyone .
There are several forms of defenses that one can implement against a given sexual felony .
The defendants in any type of criminal prosecution often profess innocence of the crime , and this is no different when it comes to handling sexual assault charges .
Besides that , the sexual assault defendants might also admit to engaging in the given sexual misconduct , and they might claim that the activities do n’t amount to sexual assault .
This is because the victim might have consented to the behavior .
Finally , the defendants might also claim no responsibility based on mental incapacity and insanity factors .
Types of defenses against sexual assault
Innocence
In a sexual assault case , one of the primary defenses is to claim for innocence .
The defendant may claim that they could not have engaged in the crime due to various factors .
Some of them including the fact that they were in a different location , which is otherwise referred to as providing an `alibi .`
To implement a valid defense on the alibi , the defense has the role of supporting their alibi with useful evidence .
The defendant may also claim that the victim identified them wrongly as a perpetrator in the case .
Similar to presenting an alibi , the defendant must give proof to support any such claim .
Consent
In some cases , the defendants in the sexual assault case might also admit to the case as presented .
That said , they might even argue that the victim ’s consent negates any such charges .
One of the main aspects of the sexual assault is that any such acts should be based on the will of the victim .
Therefore , if the defendant can show that the victim consented to the sexual activities , then this will offer a reasonable defense for the charges .
Demonstrating consent can in some cases be a challenging and controversial procedure for the defendant .
However , if the defendant can`t prove the consent , then they should try using the victims sexual past to demonstrate such a claim .
With a Houston criminal defense lawyer on your side , you ’ll know the best decision to make without all the guess work .
Insanity or mental incapacity
The defendants in a sexual assault charge may also claim that they suffer from some for a mental disease or challenge that should be held accountable for their acts .
There are various states that use as many different types of insanity defenses .
However , many of the states will classify an offender leniently , especially when they demonstrate any form of mental health complication .

David Kravets at Wired Threat Level blog reports that Hal Turner , a notorious shitbag " hate blogger " in New Jersey who was charged two months ago with threatening to kill judges and lawmakers , was secretly an FBI " agent provocateur " paid tens of thousands of dollars by our government to broadcast white supremacist rhetoric .
Snip :
Hal Turner , the blogger and radio personality , remains jailed pending charges over his recent online rants , which prosecutors claim amounted to an invitation for someone to kill Connecticut lawmakers and Chicago federal appeals court judges .
But behind the scenes the reformed white supremacist was holding clandestine meetings with FBI agents who taught him how to spew hate " without crossing the line , " according to his lawyer , Michael Orozco .
" Almost everything was at the behest of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , " Orozco said in a 45 - minute telephone interview from New Jersey .
" Their job was to pick up information on the responses of what he was saying and see where that led them .
It was an interesting dynamic on what he was being asked to do . "

WASHINGTON , Aug. 16 , 2009 --
You probably have cocaine in your wallet , purse , or pocket .
Sound unlikely or outrageous ?
Think again !
In what researchers describe as the largest , most comprehensive analysis to date of cocaine contamination in banknotes , scientists are reporting that cocaine is present in up to 90 percent of paper money in the United States , particularly in large cities such as Baltimore , Boston , and Detroit .
The scientists found traces of cocaine in 95 percent of the banknotes analyzed from Washington , D.C. , alone .
Presented here today at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society , the new study suggests that cocaine abuse is still widespread and may be on the rise in some areas .
It could help raise public awareness about cocaine use and lead to greater emphasis on curbing its abuse , the researchers say .
The scientists tested banknotes from more than 30 cities in five countries , including the U.S. , Canada , Brazil , China , and Japan , and found " alarming " evidence of cocaine use in many areas .
The U.S. and Canada had the highest levels , with an average contamination rate of between 85 and 90 percent , while China and Japan had the lowest , between 12 and 20 percent contamination .
The study is the first report about cocaine contamination in Chinese and Japanese currencies , they say .
" To my surprise , we 're finding more and more cocaine in banknotes , " said study leader Yuegang Zuo , Ph.D. , of the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth .
Zuo says that the high percentage of contaminated U.S. currency observed in the current study represents nearly a 20 percent jump in comparison to a similar study he conducted two years ago .
That earlier study indicated that 67 percent of bills in the U.S. contained traces of cocaine .
" I 'm not sure why we 've seen this apparent increase , but it could be related to the economic downturn , with stressed people turning to cocaine , " Zuo says .
Such studies are useful , he noted , because the data can help law enforcement agencies and forensic specialists identify patterns of drug use in a community .
Scientists have known for years that paper money can become contaminated with cocaine during drug deals and directly through drug use such as snorting cocaine through rolled bills .
Contamination can spread to banknotes not involved in the illicit drug culture because bills are processed in banks ' currency - counting machines .
Previous studies on cocaine in banknotes , however , had several drawbacks .
They often were based on sampling only a small number of banknotes , for instance .
Some tests destroyed the currency .
In the new study , Zuo and colleagues describe use of a modified form of a standard laboratory instrument termed a gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer .
It allows a faster , simpler and more accurate measurement of cocaine contamination than other methods , without destroying the currency .
The researchers used the method to analyze banknotes of several different denominations from the five countries surveyed .
The U.S. had the highest levels .
The scientists analyzed a total of 234 banknotes from the U.S. and found that up to 90 percent of the banknotes contain traces of cocaine .
Amounts ranged from .006 micrograms ( several thousands of times smaller than a single grain of sand ) to over 1,240 micrograms of cocaine per banknote ( about 50 grains of sand ) .
For comparison : A grain of sand weighs approximately 23 micrograms ; there are one million micrograms in a gram and 28 grams in an ounce .
The scientists collected U.S. banknotes from 17 U.S. cities and found that larger cities like Baltimore , Boston , and Detroit had among the highest average cocaine levels .
Washington , D.C. , ranked above the average , with 95 percent of the banknotes sampled contaminated with the drug .
The lowest average cocaine levels in U.S. currency appeared in bills collected from Salt Lake City .
The researchers studied 27 banknotes from Canada and found that 85 percent were contaminated with cocaine , with amounts ranging from 2.4 micrograms to over 2,530 micrograms of coke per banknote .
The researchers analyzed 10 banknotes from Brazil and found that 80 percent were contaminated with cocaine , still high but lower than the U.S. and Canada .
China and Japan had the lowest levels .
The researchers analyzed 112 banknotes from China and found that about 20 percent were contaminated with cocaine .
Of the 16 banknotes analyzed from Japan , only about 12 percent were contaminated with cocaine , the researchers say .
Despite the high percentage of cocaine - contaminated banknotes , Zuo points out that the amount of cocaine found on most notes was so small that consumers should not have any health or legal concerns about handling paper money .
" For the most part , you can't get high by sniffing a regular banknote , unless it was used directly in drug uptake or during a drug exchange , " Zuo said .
" It also wo n't affect your health and is unlikely interfere with blood and urine tests used for drug detection . "
This study was partly funded by the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth .

Mozilla Messaging has been hard at work incubating the next major version of the Thunderbird mail client .
A new beta release that was made available this week includes some nice user interface improvements and an extremely impressive new system for searching through messages .
Mozilla Messaging was spun off of the Mozilla Foundation in 2007 and established as a subsidiary with $ 3 million in seed funding .
Run by former ActiveState CTO David Ascher , its mandate is to advance Thunderbird and build a new generation of messaging tools based on Mozilla 's technology .
The Thunderbird 3 roadmap began to coalesce in early 2008 shortly after Mozilla Messaging got pushed out of the nest and the first alpha arrived several months later .
One of the major goals of Thunderbird 3 is to boost usability by simplifying configuration , making commonly - used features more accessible , and providing more flexibility for interacting with messages and other kinds of content .
The developers are also overhauling the extension system and delivering important performance improvements in areas like IMAP support .
In previous prereleases they introduced contextual controls into the message header view and added support for a tabbed interface .
They have continued experimenting with new user interface concepts in beta 4 with the introduction of an improved search display and support for unified thread viewing .
When the user clicks on a closed thread , the preview pane will show summaries of all the messages in the thread .
Each summary is accompanied by the name of the poster and the date that the message was sent .
This allows users to get an overview of the thread 's contents at a glance .
The same kind of combined message overview will also be shown when the user employs shift + click or ctrl+click to select multiple messages from the list .
One of the problems with e-mail discussions is that it 's sometimes difficult to find a specific message in a thread where the same subject line is used throughout .
By providing a short snippet of the email for context , the new thread overview mode in Thunderbird 3 makes it much easier to see the flow of the conversation and identify a specific posting later when you go back to a thread that you have already read .
This feature is a great addition to the mail client , but there are a lot of ways that it could still be improved .
It would be useful , for example , if the summaries could be expanded in place to show the whole message .
I 'd also like an option to be able to have the summaries displayed with indentation to indicate which messages are replies to other messages .
It might also be nice to have color coding on the names so it 's easier to see who the messages are from at a glance without having to read the names .
The most impressive new feature in this beta release is the revamped search view , which loads in a new tab when the user types a query into Thunderbird 's built - in search box .
It provides sophisticated interactive filtering features , including a nifty timeline that can be used to narrow your search to a specific year or month .
The messages that match the query are shown with excerpts .
Users can sort the results by relevance or date and can click a link in the interface to switch to a more conventional inbox - style view with all of the results .
The search box itself has gained Awesomebar - like autocompletion that will also make it easier to filter your searches .
The filtering sidebar of the search view will show a list of senders whose messages matched the query .
Next to each sender , it will show you the number of matching messages that they sent .
When you hover your cursor over one of the names , it will put an overlay on the timeline to show you what portion of matching messages for each month were from that sender .
You can click to see only the messages from that sender or you can remove their messages from the result list .
Below the senders in the sidebar , there is a folder list that functions basically the same way .
The only major downside of the new search feature is that it does n't show very many results at once .
You have to click a " Show more hits " button to load more .
It will incrementally increase the list of visible results , much like the " more " button on Twitter .
It would be really nice if additional results could be auto - loaded as the user drags the scrollbar down to the bottom .
It would also be useful to have a slider for adjusting the size of the excerpts , kind of like the article length slider in Safari 's RSS reader .
The new search feature and unified thread view both reflect the potential for taking advantage of Gecko's capacity for rich presentation to support more intuitive and functional user interface paradigms .
The new search feature shows that the Thunderbird developers recognize the power that can be unlocked by using HTML in innovative ways in a desktop mail client .
This is hopefully the first step towards moving beyond the conventional trifecta of folder tree , message list , and preview pane that have dominated desktop messaging interfaces .
Mozilla Messaging design expert Bryan Clark wrote a blog entry a few months ago about one of his experiments with rich mail visualization .
He shows how CSS transforms can be used to display a message on an isometric cube .
Although this example is somewhat frivolous and is n't intended for inclusion in Thunderbird , it 's a great demonstration of how emerging Web standards can empower new approaches to presenting mail .
Thunderbird 3 is off to a great start and already has some very nice improvements over previous versions .
Although users are increasingly adopting Web - based mail , there are many advantages to using a native desktop client , especially one that can use a built - in HTML rendering engine to deliver the best of both worlds .
The key to success for Thunderbird is going to be delivering a top - notch extension system that will allow users to get more value out of the client .
Mozilla Messaging has to make third - party developers think of Thunderbird as a messaging platform rather than a mere mail client .
Thunderbird 3 beta 4 is available for download from the Mozilla Messaging website .
For additional details , refer to the release notes .

Why You Should Hire a Tax Professional
There was a time when I did my own taxes .
I was sole proprietorship with very few itemized deductions .
Now , though , I ’ve got an LLC , several more deductions and retirement investments on top of savings .
My finances are still relatively simple , but they require a lot more paperwork these days — and a lot of time .
So I have a tax professional help me as part of my wealth management infrastructure to take care of my tax planning and preparation .
Advantages of using a tax professional
We have a complicated tax code .
As your finances become more complicated , so do your taxes .
Having a tax professional whose job it is to be on top of changes and to recognize benefits that you might be entitled to can greatly simplify matters .
A tax professional may know about a deduction or a credit that you passed over .
One of the greatest advantages of utilizing a tax professional is that you can take advantage of his or her specialized knowledge of the tax code .
Another benefit of having a tax professional is that you can plan ahead .
Tax planning allows you to work out a plan for your money over the coming year — a plan that can help you manage your money in such a way as to maximize your tax benefits .
A tax professional can point you in the right direction and use a certain level of expertise to help you make the most of your cash flow .
Finally , a tax professional can save you time .
It used to take me about four hours to prepare my own taxes .
I had to read instructions , make sure I did everything properly , and fill out the forms .
It was tedious , time - consuming work .
My tax professional does the same thing in about an hour .
I still have to gather my documents , but since I organize them throughout the year , this really is n’t very difficult .
The time savings of three hours is quite valuable to me , and worth the $ 450 I pay for my tax preparation .
Happily , about $ 350 of that is tax deductible as part of the business expenses associated with preparing taxes for my LLC .
Choosing the right tax professional for you
Just as when choosing a financial planner , if you decide that you want to engage the services of a tax professional , you should be careful about where you turn .
My cousin found out that her “ tax professional ” was lacking some certifications and did n’t really know what he was doing .
Make sure that you check up on your tax professional to ensure that s/he has all the proper credentials .
Other things to consider when choosing a tax professional include :
Local :
It can greatly simplify things if your tax professional is local .
You can sit down face - to - face with your professional and get to know him or her .
It also makes it easier to hold meetings as necessary .
Attentive :
You want a tax professional that will pay attention to your changing tax circumstances and ask you questions about your situation .
You do n’t want someone who merely punches last years figures into the computer .
Services :
Find out what services the tax professional offers .
Will s/he represent you in a tax audit ?
What is the charge for electronic filing ?
Be wary of “ early refund ” services , though .
In many cases these are actually costly loans against your tax refund amount .
Fees :
Of course you want to get the best deal .
But remember , pay $ 20 to your buddy , and you get what you pay for .
Look for someone who charges something close to the market rate for your area .
Call around to get an idea of standard prices from a variety of tax professionals .
Also , figure out whether you might be able to benefit from a tax professional that you can hire on retainer .
Then match up the services offered with the fees charged to determine the best value .
Personality :
You want someone you get along with , and whom you trust .
Meet with two or three of your top choices for a brief tax planning consultation and to discuss the services and fees .
Then choose someone that you like and are comfortable with .
Now is a great time to start looking for a tax professional .
Getting your tax professional acquainted with your situation prior to tax season can be very beneficial .
Plus , once tax season starts professionals are often too inundated with work to really give their full attention to meeting you .
Looking now means that you have the luxury to take your time and make sure that you get the best tax professional for your situation .
Although the original Oktoberfest in 1810 was in October , the annual 16 - day bash into which it has developed is now held during the last two weeks of September ( ending on the first Sunday of October )

Reuters Steps Up ; Says Linking , Excerpting , Sharing Are Good Things For The News
from the good - for - them dept
The Internet is n't killing the news business any more than TV killed radio or radio killed the newspaper .
Incumbent business leaders in news have n't been keeping up .
Many leaders continue to help push the business into the ditch by wasting " resources " ( management speak for talented people ) on recycling commodity news .
Reader habits are changing and vertically curated views need to be meshed with horizontal read - around ones .
Blaming the new leaders or aggregators for disrupting the business of the old leaders , or saber - rattling and threatening to sue are not business strategies -- they are personal therapy sessions .
Go ask a music executive how well it works .
I believe in the link economy .
Please feel free to link to our stories -- it adds value to all producers of content .
I believe you should play fair and encourage your readers to read - around to what others are producing if you use it and find it interesting .
I do n't believe you could or should charge others for simply linking to your content .
Appropriate excerpting and referencing are not only acceptable , but encouraged .
Let 's identify how we can birth it and agree what is " fair use " or " fair compensation " and have a conversation about how we can work together to fuel a vibrant , productive and trusted digital news industry .
Let 's identify business models that are inclusive and that create a win -win relationship for all parties .

A few weeks ago , after the AP announced its plans to crack down on people who it felt were linking / excerpting too much , we suggested that Reuters should speak up and respond to the AP 's position by encouraging linking and sharing of news .
It appears that Chris Ahearn , President , Media at Thomson Reuters , has taken us up on the offer , writing a nice little manifesto :
Why I believe in the link economy .
And , of course , helping to prove that , he linked to a bunch of other sites -- including our original blog post asking him to make a statement just like this ( in contrast , by the way , while I 've been quoted multiple times by the AP , I 'm pretty sure they 've never linked to Techdirt in an article ) .
His post is pretty much exactly what I 'd hoped Reuters ( or others ) would say ( though , Ahearn is better at being diplomatic about the AP ) .
Here are some key excerpts : Exactly .
There 's been too much misdirected blame placed on the internet , even though the internet has never been the problem .
Not keeping up with what readers want is where the mistakes have been made .
That 's basically exactly what I had suggested Reuters say ... so that 's great .
Once again , this makes me want to look for Reuters alternatives to any AP story I happen to come across .
Of course , I do n't agree with everything Ahearn has to say , though I do agree with the overall spirit of what he 's saying .
He talks about the need to agree " on a code of conduct and ethics . "
I 'm not against the , I just do n't see how it 's possible or even necessary .
These things tend to sort themselves out .
Players who are " bad actors " become obvious over time .
Good players get rewarded for it , and you deal with some questionable players on the margin .
Rather than worrying about what everyone else is doing , why not just focus on providing more value yourself ?
Then there 's this :
The thing is , the law says what 's fair use , not any voluntary agreement .
And " fair compensation " is n't determined by everyone chatting ( that could be seen as collusion , actually ) , but in the market actually doing deals .
I 'm all for discussions on positive business models that are inclusive and create win-win relationships .
That 's why we highlight examples of that all the time around here .
But I do n't think discussing good business models means getting an entire industry to agree to use them ahead of time .
For better or for worse ( well , I 'd argue for better ) , the world just does n't work that way .
The win -win business models are being developed already -- and that 's great .
Let 's keep looking at those success stories , and pull out the important lessons from them -- but that does n't mean everyone " agreeing " to things beforehand .
Unfortunately , that 's just not going to happen .
There are too many vested interests to make it work .
But the nice thing is that those who do n't figure it out get swept out with the tide .

It has been portrayed over the years as there being " lucrative deals " awaiting me in Hollywood .
But if you look at the record , I did n't make a movie for two or three years .
There were no lucrative deals awaiting me .
I left because I was in love with a girl in L.A. I missed it very much .
I should have hung around for years .
And I feel bad about it now .
The Kuwaiti base is a logistics hub for US troops in Iraq Kuwaiti officials say they have arrested six members of a " terrorist network " , linked to al - Qaeda , who were planning to attack a US military base .
An interior ministry statement said that all six Kuwaitis had confessed to the crimes after they were arrested .
The statement said they had also planned to bomb the headquarters of Kuwait 's internal security agency .
It mentioned other " important facilities " in the oil - rich emirate , but gave no further details .
ANALYSIS Frank Gardner , BBC News Kuwaiti opinions are divided when it comes to their country 's close alliance with the US .
Older Kuwaitis , especially those who lived through the Iraqi invasion of 1990 and seven - month occupation , remain grateful to the US for saving their country .
But some younger Kuwaitis see the US in hostile terms , as invaders and occupiers of Iraq , as a friend of Israel and as an enemy to Muslims .
In 2005 Kuwaiti security forces broke up an al - Qaeda - linked cell said to be plotting attacks .
" The state security has uncovered a terrorist network following al - Qaeda , and includes six ( Kuwaiti ) citizens who have planned to carry out a plan to bomb Arifjan Camp , the state security building and other important facilities , " the ministry said .
Al - Arabiya television said the group was plotting the attack for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan , which starts on about 20 August .
Camp Arifjan , a vast , purpose - built $ 200 m ( £ 120 m ) camp south of Kuwait City , is the main US base in Kuwait .
The heavily protected camp houses 15,000 US soldiers and is used as a logistics base for troops serving in Iraq .
Previous attacks against Americans in Kuwait include an incident in October 2002 , when two Kuwaitis opened fire on US Marines , killing one .
The following year , a civil servant killed an American contractor and severely wounded another when he ambushed their car near a US army camp .
Six Kuwaitis and stateless Arabs were sentenced to life in prison in 2007 for planning attacks on US troops and Kuwaiti security personnel .

O h , let 's not kid ourselves .
The birds of `pray ' who will be targeting women 's clinics in Canadian cities for the next 40 days really do n't care about saving lives .
If they did , they would n't be so much about intimidating the desperate women and girls who are seeking abortions .
That 's because , no matter how much they will attempt to cloak their vigils outside two Toronto clinics with solemn vows to " never stop defending life , " their true agenda is unveiled by their lack of support for babies once they 're born , their often impoverished mothers and the kind of sex education and contraception accessibility that would avoid abortion in the first place .
Nowhere on 40 DaysForLife.com is there any discussion of any of these matters .
That 's why it 's easy to assume that what the anti-choice movement is really about is exactly that : no choice for women .
No choice when it comes to their reproductive rights , no choice when it comes to being free to pursue independent lives , no choice to have careers , no choice at all .
All across North America , where the nutbar mobs south of the border are battling public maternal health care for women , and here in Canada , where Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's caucus , rife with members of the Christian right , is repeatedly supporting bills that would curtail reproductive rights , the pro-forced pregnancy cause appears to be gaining ground .
Indeed , a new study in a forthcoming issue of the journal Reproductive Health suggests a correlation between those U.S. states where there is the most thumping of the Good Book and higher teen pregnancy rates .
There are states – most recently Florida – where there are bills to ban contraception .
Some pharmacists and doctors , both here and in the U.S. , are refusing to provide the pill to patients , even married adult women .
There are reports in the blogosphere that Harper will replace Status of Women minister Helena Guergis – who has n't done much for women , but that 's another column – with the anti-choice Cheryl Gallant , who has fought against gay rights and even parental leave .
It just gets worse .
Last weekend , a prominent American anti-choice activist made a speech at the " Value Voters Summit " where she proposed that abortions be performed " in the public square . "
This is the true backlash against feminism , whose second wave became a tsunami after the pill became widely available in the late 1960s .
It 's all about keeping women down to those Biblical depths where they are little more than breeding stock , born to serve their masters .
What cracks me up is how often they attack the most backward and sexist Islamic countries for doing the exact same thing .
Last year , Alberta political scientist Michael Wagner , a favourite of anti-feminist groups such as REAL Women and Equipping Christians for the Public Square , authored a book about the Christian right .
He opens Standing on Guard for Thee : The Past , Present and Future of Canada 's Christian Right with a definition of what the movement stands for : " A collection of people , organizations and publications which , because of their conservative Christian principles , are determined to oppose the effects of the Sexual Revolution . "
That just about sums it up : shaming and harassing women back to the bedroom , baby 's room and behind her man .
How far , far , far away is that from former prime minister Pierre Trudeau 's declaration 40 years ago that , " There 's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation . "
No wonder Harper boasted two weeks ago , in a closed - door meeting of the party faithful , that he killed the mechanisms for women to protect their constitutional rights .
No wonder those 40 Days for Life vigilantes feel that their prayer days are about to hit a payload .

( Adds analyst comment , updates share price )
NEW YORK , Sept 23 ( Reuters ) - Shares of Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O jumped more than 8 percent on Wednesday on unsubstantiated talk that Microsoft Corp MSFT .
O may want to buy the video game publisher , but an analyst poured cold water on the idea .
“ There ’s talk that Microsoft might be interested in acquiring Electronic Arts .
It ’s unsubstantiated chatter , but it ’s out there , ” said Frederic Ruffy , an options strategist at WhatsTrading.com in New York .
But Trip Chowdhry , an analyst at Global Equities Research , said Electronic Arts was not on Microsoft ’s “ radar screen ” based on his industry contacts .
“ Our contacts just do n’t see Microsoft buying Electronic Arts , no synergies whatsoever , and also not Microsoft ’s corporate primary focus right now , ” Chowdhry wrote in an e-mailed note .
Last year , Electronic Arts , the publisher of popular titles like " Madden " football , unsuccessfully pursued a buyout of rival video game company Take Two Interactive Software TTWO.O .
The Redwood City , California - company , which has a market value of $ 6.5 billion , is frequently named by traders as a target for Walt Disney Co DIS.N and Time Warner Inc TWX.N .
Electronic Arts ’ shares were up 8.1 percent at $ 20.01 in afternoon Nasdaq trading .
Microsoft shares gained 1.1 percent to $ 26.05 .
An Electronic Arts representative was not available for a comment .
A Microsoft representative declined to comment .
On Tuesday , the stock of THQ Inc THQI.
O surged 13 percent as rumors swirled that the smallest of the major U.S. video game companies might be the target of a takeover .
Analysts said those types of rumors come up about once every quarter .

By David Paul Kuhn - September 24 , 2009
President Obama 's five Sunday television interviews included a telling thread .
" The media encourages some of the outliers in behavior , because , let 's face it , the easiest way to get on television right now is to be really rude , " Obama said on ABC 's " This Week , " repeating himself on other networks .
Obama was correct , but only in part .
It 's not only media that " encourages " the " outliers . "
The Partisan Industrial Complex is overwhelming American politics .
From the partisan media to the modern campaign , an entire industry flourishes on polarization .
Partisanship earns and spends billions annually .
As Ronald Brownstein wrote in " The Second Civil War , " the " country has been more polarized than it is today .
What 's unusual now is that the political system is more polarized than the country . "
Even as partisanship increasingly defines the American political system , the electorate has become less partisan in recent decades .
Independents have swelled to record levels , last seen in the early 1990s .
But Washington is more divided than any time since at least the Second World War .
President Barack Obama , only matched by George W. Bush , has the most polarized public approval rating since the advent of polling .
Last year marked the most polarized period in Congress since 1953 , when Congressional Quarterly first began quantifying partisanship .
Lawmakers now vote along party lines 90 percent of the time .
Systemic Partisanship
The most documented explanation for this hyper - partisan era is the gerrymandering of congressional districts .
The districts are designed to maximize voters from a single party .
Therefore , representatives increasingly depend on partisan voters for reelection .
Partisanship becomes both host and parasite .
The base of each party exacerbates this ill , pulling their leaders to their respective flanks .
As Obama 's approval rating slipped to the mid-50s , the political left urged the president to double - down on his liberalism .
Many progressives wanted Obama to take a lesson from W. Bush 's divisive push for tax cuts .
The tax cuts passed , as Democrats ruefully recall .
Philosophical puritans won the modern Republican Party .
Barry Goldwater was trounced in 1964 .
But that year he won the party from the moderate Rockefeller Republicans and one advocate to his side , Ronald Reagan .
Reagan eventually finished what Goldwater began .
The pull of political bases is not new .
The change is in how these bases have consumed their parties .
According to one study , between 1950 and 2005 , the portion of moderate lawmakers in Congress plummeted from about 45 to 10 percent .
Partisanship is the new politics in part because it works -- if " works " is defined in the interest of power rather than the public .
In 2005 , Democrats modeled themselves on the GOP of the early 1990s .
Democratic Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell called Republicans " unprecedentedly obstructionist " in 1994 .
Not long after , Mitchell 's party lost their majority .
By the summer of 2005 , Bush said Democrats " stand for nothing except obstruction . "
By 2006 , Democrats regained their dominance in Congress .
One strategic lesson , among several others , was that entrenched opposition often wins out , if it can hold out .
The current Republican leadership picked up the same playbook .
This past February , not one of the 176 Republicans in the House supported the $ 787 billion economic stimulus measure .
The GOP is similarly unified in its opposition to Democrats ' proposals for health care reform .
Once again , Democrats are calling Republicans the " party of no . "
Today 's Washington is the inverse of Obama 's central campaign pledge to " bridge " the partisan divide .
The president underestimated not only the ideological gulf separating the two tribes of Americans politics .
He underestimated the industry invested in that divide .
The Rise of a Billion Dollar Business
Political Action Committees ( PACs ) spending power has nearly tripled in the past decade .
In 2008 , Democratic and Republican PACs spent close to $ 60 million .
In 1998 , partisan PACs spent approximately $ 24 million , according to the Center for Responsive Politics ( CRP ) .
There are now some 12,500 registered lobbyists in Washington , according to CRP .
And experts believe the actual number is far higher .
The Washington Post placed the real number of DC lobbyists at 35,000 in 2005 , a number the Post reported had doubled since 2000 .
Health care alone , which has become a decidedly partisan debate , employs 3,300 lobbyists today -- six lobbyists for each of the 535 members of the House and Senate , according to Bloomberg News .
In 2008 , lobbyists spent about 3.3 billion , twice the amount spent in 2001 .
Partisan " 527s , " a type of activist organization , spent an additional $ 423 million that year , according to CRP .
The partisan beast owes some of its growth to the professionalization of politics .
Campaign communication spending alone totals more than a billion dollars annually , according to the American Association of Political Consultants ( AAPC ) .
The group 's formation itself , in 1969 , signified the professionalization of a rising class of strategists .
AAPC estimates that in 2008 political candidates for state and federal offices raised almost $ 7.68 billion , an increase of more than 50 percent since 2000 .
It 's political consultants who steward that spending .
And as Angela McMillen , the executive director of the AAPC , estimated , 99.9 percent of her memberships ' firms are partisan .
A Center for Public Integrity study found that about 600 political consultants and firms earned more than $ 1.85 billion in the 2004 election cycle .
That number likely rose in 2008 .
The stars may change in politics but the supporting actors remain ; it 's their business , after all .
The outcome is a machine that runs on polarization .
As Bill Bishop , author of the " Big Sort , " put it , " Modern political campaigns continue to be designed to increase political divisions . "
From micro targeting to get out the vote efforts , the marketing and emerging technologies of politics are principally focused on locating and rallying partisans .
The business of partisanship also increasingly shapes how Americans live .
In 2008 and 2004 , almost half of voters lived in a county where either the Republican or Democrat candidate won by a margin of 20 percentage points or more .
In 1976 , a year of more centrist campaigns , only about a quarter of Americans lived in one of these " landslide counties , " according Emory 's Alan Abramowitz .
The most partisan counties represent different Americas .
Obama 's landslide counties were urban .
McCain 's were in small towns and rural areas .
There are conservative and liberal book clubs , even dating services .
Liberals drink more Starbucks .
Conservatives drink more Dunkin ' Donuts .
Both the liberal Nation and the conservative Weekly Standard magazines offer annual cruises .
In the Standard 's words , one can " travel with like - minded conservatives . "
The result is segregation by choice .
It 's the partitioning of not merely thought but American experiences .
Each tribe has come to view the other as nearly foreign .
And what is foreign is therefore dismissed .
The cost is compromise .
And the outcome is a paralysis of governance .
The Blob : Partisan Media 's Growing Influence
The modern partisan media is both indicative of the problem and a prime instigator .
The media of the 19th century was hijacked by partisanship as well .
One Philadelphia editor accused Andrew Jackson of murdering his own troops .
But a new breed of objective journalism , however flawed , became preeminent in the last century .
Radio and later television , amid the decline of newspaper competition , eventually centralized news .
Walter Cronkite famously declared that " the only rational way out " of the Vietnam War was " to negotiate . "
Afterward , Lyndon Johnson told an aide , " If I 've lost Cronkite , I 've lost Middle America . "
No commentator has commanded that impact since .
It 's not that Americans are no longer getting their news from television .
Seven in 10 Americans say they still gather most of their news on the tube , according to the Pew Research Center .
It 's who is watching what .
Liberals watch MSNBC .
Conservatives watch Fox News .
And CNN is left in non-partisan purgatory .
MSNBC earned more weeknight viewers than CNN for the first time over a full quarter , as of the close of June .
To be sure , Fox holds the most sway .
Three times as many Republicans as Democrats , 34 percent to 10 percent respectively , get the bulk of their news from Fox .
Three times as many Democrats as Republicans say MSNBC is their primary news source as well , but the numbers are only 9 to 3 percent .
This explains , somewhat , why Obama spoke to every network but Fox on Sunday .
Fox 's programs now hold every spot in the top 10 most - viewed cable news shows , according to Nielsen .
Fox 's top three shows are also it 's most ideological : The O'Reilly Factor , Hannity and Glenn Beck .
Combined , the three shows have about 7.6 million viewers .
MSNBC 's ratings fall far short of Fox's .
But MSNBC 's most popular shows , therefore its greatest investment , feature its ideologically liberal stars -- Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow .
That investment in ideology begs another question .
Partisanship is demonstrably sought .
Ideology is a litmus test for new primetime stars .
But is partisanship also contrived or exaggerated to increase profits ?
Olbermann came from ESPN's " SportsCenter , " a background that made him great on television .
But ESPN is not a hive of political experience .
Fox 's rising superstar Glenn Beck has turned his show into an oppositional machine .
Beck successfully galvanized campaigns to push out Obama administration officials and helped rally conservatives to protest the president .
Beck reportedly once described himself as a " rodeo clown . "
It 's fair to ask , how much of Beck 's showmanship is just show ?
Only he knows .
The personal politics of Al Franken , in the time before he was a senator , were always more moderate than his image as a liberal activist .
Show or substance , this Beck sells .
His
Fox ratings are skyrocketing .
This week 's cover of Time magazine brandishes Beck .
Headline : " Mad man . "
Radio tells the same story .
The top ten talk radio shows are all conservative , according to the radio trade publication Talkers .
Fox 's Beck and Sean Hannity make both lists .
Rush Limbaugh continues to command the top spot .
Limbaugh 's radio audience is roughly equivalent to the population of America 's three largest cities , earning at least 15 million listeners weekly .
It was Limbaugh 's ideological format , which proved so profitable , that hundreds emulated .
Talk radio has grown more than three - fold since 1990 , according to Tuft 's Sarah Sobieraj and Jeffrey Berry .
Fox , in fact , modeled its format on talk radio .
And increasingly , online news is modeling its format on both mediums .
Liberals appear to have the lead online .
The liberal HuffingtonPost , according to Alexa.com , now gets more readers than The Wall Street Journal , the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post .
Huffington leads the list of online news blogs as well , with Michelle Malkin 's conservative website ranking third .
Liberals raise more contributions online than conservatives , sometimes drastically more .
The ideological business models online are also winning more readers .
One quarter of online news consumers typically visited websites that matched their political views during the 2004 campaign .
By 2008 , a third of online news consumption was directed toward like - minded websites .
The trend is strongest for college - age Democrats and Republicans , as well as those who are most engaged online .
The publishing industry has tapped into the same model .
Take a look at the New York Times bestseller list .
Three of the top 10 non-fiction books on last week 's list were ideological .
Consider the titles of these polemic reads .
Number one was Michelle Malkin's " Culture of Corruption . "
Ranking seven and eight , respectively , are " Liberty and Tyranny , " by Mark Levin and " Catastrophe " by Dick Morris .
By the titles alone , one might think that the United States was being invaded .
Ideologues are also increasingly prevalent within the chattering class .
Last year , the British Telegraph ranked " the most influential US political pundits . "
Topping the list was Karl Rove , who W. Bush called the " architect " of perhaps the most partisan campaign strategy in the modern day .
The nation has seen more divisive eras .
One of Thomas Jefferson 's hacks described John Adams as a " hideous hermaphroditical character . "
Andrew Jackson 's wife was repeatedly accused of adultery .
Nineteenth century Congress saw brawls .
Representatives carried guns .
Calling someone a " liar " actually led to duels .
It 's the contrast with the relative comity of more recent decades that raises eyebrows .
Certainly , political tectonics had a role .
The Southern Democrats who stood against the New Deal and the Great Society became Republicans .
Northeastern Republicans became Democrats .
But it was the arch partisans , like those who backed Goldwater and George McGovern , who helped drive the moderates out .
Decades later , there is a massive industry existentially invested in partisanship .
Republican Rep. Joe Wilson yells " liar " during President Obama 's health care address .
Wilson apologizes that night .
GOP greybeards scold him .
But one week after , Wilson and his opponent raise more than $ 3 million combined .
Partisanship literally paid off .
The Antares DLR - H2 flies its madden voyage over the northern German city of Hamburg .
The airplane powered by fuel cells was commissioned by the German Aerospace Centre ( DLR ) with the goal of developing fuel cells for a reliable on - board power supply for wide - body airliners .
The world 's first piloted aircraft capable of taking to the air using only power from fuel cells took off in Germany Tuesday , producing zero carbon dioxide emissions , its makers said .
" We have improved the performance capabilities and efficiency of the fuel cell to such an extent that a piloted aircraft is now able to take off using it , " said Johann - Dietrich Woerner from the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) .
" This enables us to demonstrate the true potential of this technology , also and perhaps specifically for applications in the aerospace sector , " he said .
Developed by the DLR , Lange Aviation , BASF Fuel Cells and Denmark 's Serenergy , the Antares DLR - H2 motor glider has a range of 750 kilometres ( 465 miles ) and can fly for five hours .
The system uses hydrogen as its fuel , and this is converted into electrical energy in a direct , electrochemical reaction with oxygen in the ambient air , without any combustion occurring .
The only by - product is water , and if the hydrogen fuel is produced using renewable energy sources , then the motor glider is genuinely CO2 - free , the DLR said .
" Although the fuel cell may still be a long way from becoming the primary energy source for the propulsion of commercial aircraft , it does already constitute an interesting and important alternative to existing energy systems as a form of reliable on - board power supply , " the DLR said .

For the last two years the " transition movement " has been a grassroots effort by thousands of ordinary people determined to begin the transformation towards a low - carbon lifestyle .
Today it became government policy .
Not for nothing is Ed Miliband 's green road map called the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan .
No longer are towns and villages like Transition Lewes – or my own community effort , Low Carbon Wolvercote – on their own .
Their demand – to be part of the low - carbon solution , rather than the problem – has been adopted wholesale by government .
Since the Climate Change
Act was passed last year , the UK has theoretically been committed to an 80 % reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 .
But that act was only half the battle won : the government still seemed to lack a strategic plan to actually meet the targets .
Indeed , many government policies – on building roads , expanding airports and so on – seemed to take us in the wrong direction .
Miliband 's white paper changes all that : the emissions reductions from each sector of the economy are quantified , and the policies to make them a reality spelt out .
The paper sets out , for example , how each government department will be expected to stay within its carbon budget , outlines plans for a five - fold expansion of renewable electricity generation by 2020 , increases the commitment to a new generation of nuclear power stations and brings forward measures to speed up the introduction of electric cars .
There are three carbon budgets now in planning , each covering a five - year period , and running up until 2022 , by which time emissions should have been reduced by a third from 1990 levels .
The plan is n't perfect , but it should give a new dynamism to the UK 's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – something that has been sorely lacking until now .
As if to illustrate the new sense of urgency , the Department for Energy and Climate Change has pledged to reduce its own emissions by a remarkable 10 % by the end of 2010 .
The budgets are important in particular because they are legally binding : indeed , the UK is the first country in the world to enshrine its carbon targets in law .
There are plenty of areas of controversy .
Wind power remains controversial , and a massive expansion of onshore wind can be expected to meet with major opposition – not least from Tories in the shires .
Plans for a Severn Barrage are also being narrowed down , much to the concern of conservationists worried about the local ecological impacts .
Nuclear is a perennially thorny issue .
But all these areas will benefit from a streamlining of the planning system , which aims to speed up new - build projects of national significance .
Another plus point is that the government plans to eschew carbon offsets from abroad , making all the cuts domestically – at least in the first five years .
( This does n't include big corporate emitters , which can already buy and sell credits within Europe via the EU emissions trading scheme . )
The plan also has a strong emphasis on one of the less sexy areas of emissions reduction : from the farming sector , where fertiliser use , land management and livestock add up to 7 % of our national emissions .
Now it 's over to us .
The original Transition movement provided a DIY action plan for how we could all – as individuals , communities and regions – do our fair share while the government dawdled .
Now the government has weighed in with a sensible national strategy , there can be no excuses about " waiting for the politicians to act " .
We are all responsible for reducing the threat our lifestyles pose to life on Earth – and we have to start now .
Customer Beaten to Death by Walmart Employees
At Walmart , theft is not tolerated .
At least not at the Walmart in Jingdezhen , China , where a customer died at the hands of Walmart employees who suspected her of stealing .
It started out when one of the Walmart employees suspected a female customer of theft .
The customer was then under surveillance for a few minutes before being approached by the staff .
The Walmart employee requested to search the customer ’s bag and the female customer refused to hand it over , stating that it was a violation of her privacy .
Next thing she knew , more Walmart employees gathered around her and started beating her up .
The customer managed to send an alert to her family through her cellphone and when her mother and sister showed up at the store , the staff members were still pummeling her .
They begged and pleaded for them to stop but to no avail .
Finally , the police showed up and put a stop to the incident and the victim was then rushed to the hospital .
Unfortunately , she died of wounds shortly afterwards .
So far , Walmart has not commented on the incident and it is unknown if any of the employees were arrested .

One time I had to get me a barium enema and I thought it was a pretty bad deal , but after I saw what happened to my friend Cal Thomas that day in the woods , it turns out it was n’t so bad after all .
Yeah , that was his name all right , Cal fucking Thomas .
Just like the guy you see yelling and screaming on the news .
I ’m a crotchety old bastard and can remember the days when they did reporting on the news , but those days are gone .
Nobody wants to watch information anymore .
They ’d rather pick a side and watch people yelling and screaming about shit .
People need stimulation , so I guess I do n’t blame them .
I fucking hated sitting there on my ass watching information too .
So , yeah , I figured the name would be familiar .
The tv Cal is like most people on the news : an old white guy .
I know he ’s got a mustache on his face , but I forget what team he plays for , Liberal or Conservative .
………… It do n’t matter anyway .
………… The Cal Thomas I ’m talking about had been a friend of mine for years .
Shit , back in the 50s we used to bang each other ’s wives and smoke grass with the Negroes .
When we got older and richer we decided it ’d be a hoot to go out in the woods and fucking kill things , so we started hunting .
Every Fall starting about ‘ 68 , me , Cal , and another friend of ours , Steve Loomis , took a trip far the hell away from our families .
We ’d go to some god - forsaken land like Wisconsin or Minnesota or South Dakota , crawl out into the woods about four in the morning all dressed up in khaki and psychotic orange , and just start fucking killing things .
One time we even went up into Canada to kill things , but spent most of the time marveling at all the Socialized Medicine they got up there .
… ……… Mostly deer , but we ’d kill anything –beavers , badgers , bears , housecats a little too far from home , you name it .
One time I even blew away a monarch butterfly with my Mossberg 500 shotgun and the damn thing vanished before my eyes .
It was hilarious .
………… The last day I went hunting was the last day of Cal ’s life .
I just ai n’t got the belly for it anymore .
Sure , I still put out antifreeze for the neighborhood dogs and stand out in the yard shooting songbirds with my pellet gun , but full - blown hunting just ai n’t possible for me now , not after what happened to Cal that day .
………… We were in South Dakota , the Black Hills area to be exact , in November , and we were having a hell of time finding anything to kill .
It was like the animals had heard we were coming and made themselves scarce .
We ’d been there three days with no luck and basically just wandered around the woods getting drunk on Busch Lite and bitching about how all we were doing was wandering around the woods getting drunk on Busch Lite .
………… About evening on that third day , we decided to stumble back to camp and pass out and give it another go in the morning .
It would be our last shot .
We were due back in the howling emptiness of family life in a few days and had to get on the road .
We were trying to be all optimistic and shit , but were actually feeling pretty low .
………… We were about halfway back to camp when Cal announced how he had to take a shit .
“ You boys go on without me , ” he said , “ I gotta take me a shit . ”
………… So me and Stevie went on without him .
Over my shoulder I watched Cal pull down his trousers and prop himself up against a pine tree .
He looked like he was settling in and gonna be there awhile .
… …… … “ Uh-oh , ” Stevie said to me .
“ He ’s gonna pass out . ”
… …… … “ Guaranteed , ” I said back to him .
………… If there ’s one thing you need to know about ol ’
Cal , it ’s how he liked to take shits .
Even when he was sober he’d be like 20 , 30 minutes on the throne .
And when drunk ?
Hoo boy , he was goner .
He ’d be a - droolin ’ and a - snorin ’ every time , pants around the ankles and knuckles in the muck .
I ca n’t tell you how many bar toilets I hauled him off of over the years .
………… We had wandered about 8 miles away from camp and so there was still another 4 miles to go and me and Stevie walked it pretty much in silence .
I had a real weird feeling in me , like something bad was gonna happen but I did n’t know what .
A kind of nervous , apprehensive thing that was in my stomach and wrapped around my balls and all up and down my spine .
The only time I ever felt anything like it was when the wife made me sleep with her , but it was real strange feeling it out here in the woods with the boys .
Looking back on it I see now that it was women ’s intuition .
………… About maybe a hundred yards from camp , Stevie spotted himself a deer and he up and shot it , scaring the hell out me since I did n’t know he had seen it .
All of a sudden he just fired and I about jumped out of my boots .
… …… … “ Holy hell , warn a guy , will ya ? ” I said to him , but he was already scurrying over to his kill with his knife out .
………… We do n’t ever keep nothing we kill since we ’re all committed vegetarians , but gutting an animal is a way fun experience I highly recommend you try .
Sometimes it ‘s even more satisfying than the kill itself .
I stood there and watched as Stevie sliced open the deer ’s belly and pulled out the innards , hiding my jealousy as best I could .
… …… … “ Ol ’ Cal missed it , ” I said .
“ Probably the only kill this year and he missed it . ”
………… “ Yep , ” Stevie said .
“ What a fucking tool .
We should play a joke on him , have a few laughs . ”
… …… … “ Like what ? ”
………… “ I do n’t know , something . ”
… ……… Suddenly , it hit me .
“ I got an idea , ” I said .
… …… … Now , do n’t ask me why this popped into my head .
It is what it is , though .
It was all my idea and I regret it to this very day whenever I think about it , which is pert near never since I ’m not a thinkin’ type man .
………… “ I say we sneak back and shove these guts under his ass . ”
As soon as I said it that apprehensive , nervous feeling I was telling you about got real , real strong inside me .
……… … Ol ’ Stevie loved the idea .
He LOLed and ROFLed to beat all hell .
“ I ’ll run get the cooler ! ” he said .
………… It was three hours later and full on dark by the time me and Stevie walked into camp .
We started breaking out the flashlights and cucumbers , chuckling away at how witty we were .
……… …“ That fucker ‘s sure gonna be surprised ! ”
Stevie said in his high - pitched , squeaky midget voice .
Did I mention that Stevie was a midget ?
Yeah , that ’s why we called him Stevie , even though the technical name for him was Steve .
He swears up and down he ain’t no fucking midget , though .
He says he ’s just vertically challenged , but do n’t you believe him .
He ’s a balls - out midget , all right , perfect dick - sucking height and everything .
………… We figured Cal would be along about sunup , ready to cuss us out , but when he did n’t show up by 7 am , we almost started getting worried .
……… …“ Where the hell is he , I wonder , ” I said to Stevie , cracking open my third beer .
“ It ai n’t like him to sleep in . ”
………… “ I know , ” said Stevie .
“ ‘ The early bird catches the worm , ’ he always says . ”
……… … “ And a penny saved is a penny earned . ”
……… … “ Word to your mother , ” agreed Stevie .
………… It was , oh , about nine when Cal finally got to camp .
He was walking real funny and real slow , like he was limping on both legs .
I figured he bit it somewhere out in the woods , but was I wrong .
All wrong .
………… As soon as we laid eyes on his face , we forgot about the joke we played on him the night before .
I ai n’t never seen anyone so white , even Hitler .
………… “ You ok ? ” I asked him .
……… … “ You boys ai n’t gonna believe what happened to me , ” ol ’ Cal said , his voice kinda shaky .
“ I had to shit so bad last night my insides came out ! ”
……… … “ What the… ! ? ”
Me and Stevie said at the same time .
My voice is real low and Stevie ’s voice is real high , him being a midget , and together we harmonized quite prettily .
……… … “ But it ’s ok , ” Cal said , putting up a hand .
“ I managed to get ‘em back in with the help of a stick . ”

Dear Bob ...
I have a reputation here for being a good writer .
That 's a problem , because I probably get 20 interruptions a week from friends and acquaintances that begin , " You 're a good writer .
I need to ... " followed by " send an important e-mail , " " write a short report , " " summarize some information , " or some other minor task that involves putting words together in ways that are persuasive and easily understood .

Then I 'm trapped .
I 'm supposed to be a team player , which means helping out and pitching in .
None of the requests are big ... mostly , they 're tasks I can knock out in 10 or 15 minutes .
Each .
But I 'm also supposed to do my own work , and while I 'm not overworked , my manager does give me enough to do that I can easily stay busy without doing work for my teammates they 're supposed to be doing for themselves .
Any thoughts on how I can say no without being branded as an unhelpful jerk ?
- Unhelpful jerk
Dear Doormat ...
I can think of several .
But first , a short essay on why you 're right to be concerned :
Businesses are social environments , and business society divides people into two categories : those who delegate and those who are delegated to .
Those who delegate are considered upwardly mobile leaders and valuable members of society .
Those who are delegated to are considered grunts , the great unwashed , or at best " skilled laborers " who are valuable where they are and should be grateful to have employment .
It 's a sad - but - true reflection of modern society that being highly skilled at an identifiable craft is considered a second - rate competency when compared to being a manager .
If you do n't believe me , listen to a group of business managers grousing because a sports figure makes millions of dollars a year .
What 's their complaint ?
Someone has the gall to be paid CEO - level compensation for doing actual , highly skilled work that persuades customers to pay for tickets .
Which brings us to your plight :
Your colleagues are , consciously , unconsciously , or as an unintended side effect , trying to turn you into one - who - is - delegated - to and themselves into one - who - delegates .
You 're right to understand that Just Saying No is a poor alternative .
That 's because it 's confrontational , which is considered bad form in most business environments .
Here 's what you can do instead :
Schedule : " I can't get to it today , and tomorrow is pretty full , too .
I can help you with this Thursday , if that 's OK .
And remember the rule around here :
If you want a favor , bring Starbucks . "
This last bit matters because it establishes a value equation instead of your providing a favor now in exchange for the possibility of a quid pro quo in the distant and unspecified future .
" I can't get to it today , and tomorrow is pretty full , too .

And remember the rule around here :

This last bit matters because it establishes a value equation instead of your providing a favor now in exchange for the possibility of a quid pro quo in the distant and unspecified future .
Quid pro quo :
Speaking of trading in favors , you can ask for one in return as a direct swap , assuming the asker is actually good at something .
" Tell you what -- I have to create a spreadsheet that does thus - and - such .
You 're good at Excel .
How about you put the spreadsheet together for me while I write the memo for you ? "
This changes your image from delegatee to skilled , win / win negotiator .

Critique : This is a variation on schedule .
" I can't get to it today , and tomorrow is pretty full , too .
But if you want to write a first draft , or at least an outline of what you want to say , I can squeeze in enough time to mark it up for you . "
This clearly places you in the management camp of business society , because many -- perhaps most -- managers in far too many businesses consider the important role of " coach " to be synonymous with critiquing the creative work of those around them .

Coach : Approach your manager , let him know you 're being swamped with writing requests and offer to conduct a series of brown - bag lunches to help your colleagues improve their writing .
This lets your boss know what 's going on in a politically acceptable way .
It shows you to be a team player who wants to help your teammates .
It gives your boss a way to put your teammates on notice that they 're responsible for improving their skills .
Best of all , it puts you squarely in the manager camp , because coaching is something managers do .
Whatever you do , though , do n't do a favor now in the hope of having it returned later on .
Even more important , do n't get trapped by an oddity of human psychology :
In general , and for some strange reason , people who are asked for a favor consider the asker to be a friend far more than the person who does the asking .

There are plenty of reasons not to partner professionally with a buddy , starting with how much you value your friendship
You ’ve heard about the importance of goal setting - we all have .
You know that people with written goals succeed and you might have read all about achieving ambitious goals .
The problem is , you do n’t have any ambitious goals .
You do n’t have any goals at all .
You ’re not really sure what you want from life – maybe something a bit more than what you ’ve currently got , but every time you try to write a list of goals , it seems like a futile exercise .
Here are four ways to identify the goals that you really want .
Relax Your Ideas on What “ Goals ” Mean
We often think that a “ goal ” has to be something big .
Maybe , you ’ve got the impression that goals need to be about money or success in some way that society has defined .
Relax !
A “ goal ” is simply something which you ’d like to do or achieve .
It could be buying a house or a car , yes , but it could also be something which might matter to no one in the world except you .
Goals are n’t things that you feel you “ should ” do , and any good life coach will steer you away from goals that have been imposed upon you by other people .
Start With What You Enjoy
We all have natural interests and passions .
They are those things that we get really excited about , even though our friends and family might be bemused .
Perhaps you absolutely love everything to do with baseball .
Maybe you really enjoy playing the trombone .
It could be anything !
Write down a list of five or ten things that you really enjoy .
Is there a goal buried in any of them ?
Perhaps , you ’ve always had a desire to coach Little League .
Maybe , you ’d really like to play your trombone in front of an audience .
What goals arise from your interests ?
How could your hobbies become part of something bigger and more meaningful in your life ?
If that does n’t work , think about what you do n’t like .
You might have a really hard time figuring out what you want from life .
Perhaps , your interests and hobbies do n’t seem to lend themselves to any actual goals .
In this case , try writing a list of things you do n’t want .
That could be things like :
I do n’t want to be overweight
I do n’t want to live a life without meaning
I do n’t want a bad relationship with my partner ( family / kids / etc )
I do n’t want to work in a job I hate
Write down whatever comes into your mind and turn them around to find your goals !
For example , the above list would become :
I want to reach and maintain a healthy weight
I want to have a meaningful life
I want a good relationship with my partner ( family / kids / etc )
I want to work in a job I love
Consider the Key Areas of Life
In the great book , The Success Principles , Jack Canfield suggests that there are seven areas where you should consider setting goals and lists these categories as :
Financial
Job / career
Physical health
Relationships
Personal development
Community
If you ’re still stuck in your goal - setting , go through these seven key areas .
Do you have a gut feeling that any of them are lacking or out of balance in your life ?
Do any particular goals or ambitions come to mind ?
You might find it a useful exercise to write down a score for how you feel you ’re doing in each area .
Rate yourself from 0 - 10 , with 0 being “ awful ” and 10 being “ perfect ” .
Look at the areas where you score low .
What could you do to raise that score ?
What goals might you set ?
Do you struggle with setting goals that are meaningful to you ?
What are your current goals ( if any ) and what made you decide to set them for yourself ?

Last week I was at the LASER 2009 summer school on Software Testing .
It was pretty interesting and one brief talk captured my attention .
The speaker , Martin Nordio , asked the audience if they knew Eiffel and only a few hands were raised .
So he asked if they knew Java instead .
Everyone raised his hand .
To show to the audience they were wrong in assuming they knew about Java , he showed 6 samples of source code written in Java and asked the audience what the program did and bet that no one would have the right 6 answers .
Let 's do the same here .
I 'm going to give you the exercises and will post the answers in my next blog entry .
1 . What is the value of b at the end of this code : foo ( ) { int b = 1 ; b++ ; } ?
2 . What is the value of b at the end of this code : foo ( ) { int b = 1 ; while ( true ) { b++ ; break ; } } ?
3 . What is the value of b at the end of this code and tell us if this executes normally or with an exception : foo ( ) { int b = 1 ; try { throw new Exception ( ) ; } finally { b++ ; } } ?
4 . What is the value of b at the end of this code and tell us if this executes normally or with an exception : foo ( ) { int b = 1 ; while ( true ) { try { b++ ; throw new Exception ( ) ; } finally { b++ ; break ; } } b++ ; } ?
5 . The previous sample was too long , what does this return : int foo ( ) { try { return 1 ; } finally { return 2 ; } } ?
6 . If you have answered properly to the above questions , then you are definitely quite an expert .
To prove it , tell us the value of b at the end of the call as well as the return value : int b ; int foo ( ) { b = 0 ; try { b++ ; return b ; } finally { b++ ; } } ?

A company wants to " license a technology " to draw advertisements on the Moon 's surface , which according to them could be watched from Earth .
If nobody shuts them down , I 'll be there at the launch .
With my land - to - air rocket launcher ready .

I thought this was a joke , but apparently this deranged people are serious enough about it to put out a press release and a 3D animation .
Robots to Advertise on the Moon WEST VALLEY CITY , Utah , July 20 / PRNewswire / —
It 's one giant leap for robot - kind .
New Shadow Shaping technology creates images on the Moon that can be seen from Earth .
Robots are used to create several small ridges in the lunar dust over large areas that capture shadows and shape them to form logos , domains names , memorials or even portraits .
Talk about the Man in the Moon !
You can even carve your initials in a heart to impress your sweetheart .
The advertising potential is mind - boggling .
Never in history have companies been able to penetrate every market on Earth , reach every person on the planet , and touch them at an emotional level only possible with the beauty of the Moon on a starlit night .
Twelve billion eyeballs looking at your logo in the sky for several days every month .
And since there is no atmosphere on the Moon , the images last for thousands of years .
" Finally dependency on government to travel beyond Earth is over , " says inventor David Kent Jones .
" This new commercial incentive will turbo charge space technology development .
Shadows are just the beginning ; eventually robots will be planting crops on other planets . "
Beginning July 20 , 2009 , the fortieth anniversary of man 's first step on the Moon , exclusive licensing for this patent pending technology is publicly available .
Moon Publicity is accepting bids from accredited investors and companies for 44 lunar regions until October 20 , 2009 .
You could license moon - imaging technology potentially worth a fortune in advertising value for about the cost of an SUV .
Minimum bids start as low as $ 46,000 .

Of course , anybody can do this .
The whole things sounds like a scheme to get easy money , yes .
I have a hard time thinking someone may take them seriously , but it 's a matter of time before some idiots actually manage to pull it off .

One Man Stands Up To The Wingnut Protesters Posted by Pile ( 9788 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Activists ]
When you think the left has no balls , take a look at this video of a single brave man who had the guts to show up at one of Glenn Beck 's coalition of crazy people holding a sign that says , " Public Option Now ! "
After being attacked and spit upon , he eventually completes his march through the protest with the help of several armed policemen .
It 's pretty amazing to watch the amount of hatred and vitriol spewed at this guy who is merely expressing an opinion .

Troughs – like the one the US economy seems to have fallen into – are nasty places .
Stagnant .
Sloppy .
Icky .
No one really wants to spend time in one .
Unfortunately , that 's where many unemployed Americans may find themselves over the next several months as the weak economy struggles to recover .
Friday 's unemployment report from the US Labor Department showed that the US lost fewer jobs in August than in any month during the past year .
But it also suggested that more people were looking for work in an economy where most employers still are n't hiring .
For the moment , the economy 's recovery is primarily manufacturing based .
Companies have cut their inventories so low that factories have to rev up just to replenish the stock .
But manufacturing is one of those areas that can boost production a lot before it needs to hire new people , points out Nigel Gault , chief US economist for IHS Global Insight .
" If we 're thinking of job creation , it 's going to have to be services that start to generate jobs . "
Services offer a mixed picture .
Healthcare / education continued to set all - time employment highs in August .
The federal government ( minus the US Postal Service ) is hiring .
Private - sector services lost only half as many as jobs in August that they did in July , but that still accounted for a decline of 62,000 positions .
The reason ?
Wholesale and retail trade , professional and business services , and the leisure industry all contracted in August .
Finance , insurance , and real estate companies are going through a structural downsizing in addition to a recession .
Then , there 's publishing and the post office , where downsizing does n't even begin to describe the long slide in employment .
Excluding the Internet , the publishing industry last month saw employment slip to 787,500 , a historic low in federal records going back to 1990 .
Post office employment dropped below 700,000 for the first time in 25 years .
Ouch !
For those who produce all those newspapers and magazines – and the people who deliver many of them house to house – this is no trough .
It 's a plunge that seems unending .
Last week , the postal service announced it had negotiated a buyout plan with two unions , where up to 30,000 employees could get a bonus if they opted to quit .

Tom Barrett Wikipedia
Thomas M. " Tom " Barrett ( born December 8 , 1953 ) is an American politician , former Congressman from Wisconsin and the current mayor of Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
Tom Barrett was elected Milwaukee ’s 38th Mayor on April 6 , 2004 , and won a second term in 2008 with 79 % of the vote – the largest percentage a Mayoral candidate has received in 40 years .
Tom Barrett grew up on Milwaukee 's West side , attended Marquette University High School , graduated from college and law school from the University of Wisconsin - Madison , was a member of both the Wisconsin State Assembly , and Wisconsin State Senate , and was elected to five terms in the United States House of Representatives .
Barrett and his wife , Kris , live in Milwaukee 's Washington Heights neighborhood with their four children : Tommy , Annie , Erin and Kate .
Here is a politician who is truly a good guy .
This probably is n't even a constituent .
Talk about better Democrats !
I think I 've found my candidate for next Governor of Wisconsin .
UPDATE I Just found this on Google Cache from last week August 7 , 2009 :
Ensuring public safety is one of my top priorities as Mayor .
Mayor Barrett walks the walk ...
UPDATE II
Despite the discussion in the comments that this was not political , some right wing nut has decided to spin this into a talking point for ... ( wait for it ) CONCEALED CARRY !
Amy L. Geiger - Hemmer in a community blog at Living Lake Country
All this aside , I hope that the mayor recovers .
And maybe this incident will make him do some soul - searching and wish he had been carrying a gun ....
Gosh , what am I saying ?!?.... How foolish of me !
Barrett is a true - blue liberal down to the core .
He 'd never acknowlege that having a gun may have served to protect him , his family and the victim being beaten .
He 'll never admit that a speedy dial finger is n't quite the same as being armed .
He could have ended the incident with one quick flash of a weapon ...
No , unfortunately in the future , all I can see is Mayor Barrett sitting down for a beer and peanuts to discuss the incident with his attacker .....
Kumbaya !
Disgusting !
UPDATE III h/t to mdboma from the comments :
Milwaukee Journal Sentinal
A suspect has been arrested in connection with Saturday 's beating of Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett , according to a report from a dispatcher over the police radio .
The police chiefs of Milwaukee and West Allis will hold a joint press conference at 2 p.m. to discuss the status of the case .
( snip )
Patrick Curley , Barrett 's chief of staff said the mayor was resting at the hospital Sunday morning .
Although he could not give details on the injuries , Curley said there were " no signs of major trauma . "
" He 's exhausted obviously , but he 's resting , " Curley said .
" All his vitals are good - he can carry on brief conversations . "

Champions of free will , take heart .
A landmark 1980s experiment that purported to show free will does n’t exist is being challenged .
In 1983 , neuroscientist Benjamin Libet asked volunteers wearing scalp electrodes to flex a finger or wrist .
When they did , the movements were preceded by a dip in the signals being recorded , called the “ readiness potential ” .
Libet interpreted this RP as the brain preparing for movement .
Crucially , the RP came a few tenths of a second before the volunteers said they had decided to move .
Libet concluded that unconscious neural processes determine our actions before we are ever aware of making a decision .
Advertisement
Since then , others have quoted the experiment as evidence that free will is an illusion – a conclusion that was always controversial , particularly as there is no proof the RP represents a decision to move .
Sound decisions
Long sceptical of Libet ’s interpretation , Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena of the University of Otago in Dunedin , New Zealand , attempted to tease apart what prompts the RP using a similar experiment , with a key twist .
They also used scalp electrodes , but instead of letting their volunteers decide when to move , Miller and Trevena asked them
to wait for an audio tone before deciding whether to tap a key .
If Libet ’s interpretation were correct , Miller reasoned , the RP should be greater after the tone when a person chose to tap the key .
While there was an RP before volunteers made their decision to move , the signal was the same whether or not they elected to tap .
Miller concludes that the RP may merely be a sign that the brain is paying attention and does not indicate that a decision has been made .
Miller and Trevena also failed to find evidence of subconscious decision - making in a second experiment .
This time they asked volunteers to press a key after the tone , but to decide on the spot whether to use their left or right hand .
As movement in the right limbs is related to the brain signals in the left hemisphere and vice versa , they reasoned that if an unconscious process is driving this decision , where it occurs in the brain should depend on which hand is chosen .
But they found no such correlation .
Paradigm shift
Marcel Brass of Ghent University in Belgium says it is wrong to use Miller and Trevena ’s results to reinterpret Libet ’s experiment , in which volunteers were not prompted to make a decision .
The audio tone “ changes the paradigm ” , so the two ca n’t be compared , he says .
What ’s more , in 2008 , he and his colleagues detected patterns in brain activity that predicted better than chance whether or not a subject would press a key , before they were aware of making a decision .
But Frank Durgin , a psychologist at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania , says that Brass ’s results do “ seem to undermine Libet ’s preferred interpretation ” , though they do n’t contradict it outright .

Some things are hard to remember .
Others are hard to forget — especially things that are traumatic .
But kids , it turns out , are better than adults at forgetting the bad stuff .
Now scientists think they know why .
According to an animal study in the September 4th issue of the journal Science , the brains of adults erect physical barriers that keep painful memories intact .
As adults , events that emotionally disturb us tend to get seared into our brains .
And those memories can resurface , causing anxiety , fear and even post - traumatic stress disorder .
But young brains are much more resilient — and can even erase unpleasant memories .
To get a better handle on this youthful forgetting , scientists studied the brains of young and old rats .
They found that in adult brains , a physical net forms around certain cells in the amygdala , a structure associated with emotional memories .
Adults that had been trained to associate a mild foot shock with a specific sound would flinch when they just heard the sound .
But using a drug to dissolve this barrier restored the older rats ’ ability to extinguish fearful memories .
So rats that got the net - busting treatment stayed calm when they heard the sound .
One of the few instances where a net loss is a real gain .

Speaking at the launch , Dominic said :
" This Government ’s approach to our personal privacy is the worst of all worlds – intrusive , ineffective and enormously expensive .
As we have seen time and time again , over - reliance on the database state is a poor substitute for the human judgment and care essential to the delivery of frontline public services .
Labour ’s surveillance state has exposed the public to greater – not less – risk . "
Measures Include :
* Scrapping the National Identity Register and ContactPoint database
* Establishing clear principles for the use and retention of DNA on the National DNA Database , including ending the permanent or prolonged retention of innocent people 's DNA
* Restricting and restraining local council access to personal communications data
* Reviewing protection of personal privacy from the surveillance state as part of a British Bill of Rights .
* Strengthening the audit powers and independence of the Information Commissioner
* Requiring Privacy Impact Assessments on any proposals for new legislation or other measures that involve data collection or sharing at the earliest opportunity .
Require government to consult the Information Commissioner on the PIA and publish his findings
* Immediately submitting the Home Office 's plans for the retention of , and access to , communications data to the Information Commissioner for pre-legislative scrutiny
* Requiring new powers of data - sharing to be introduced into law by primary legislation , not by order .
* Appointing a Minister and senior civil servant ( at Director General level ) in each Government ministry with responsibility for departmental operational data security
* Tasking the Information Commissioner to publish guidelines on best practice in data security in the public sector
* Tasking the Information Commissioner to carry out a consultation with the private sector , with a view to establishing guidance on data security , including examining the viability of introducing an industry - wide kite mark system of best practice

Communications Data Bill
7. Immediately submitting the Home Office ’s plans for the retention of - and access to - communications data to the Information Commissioner for pre-legislative scrutiny .
In line with the above recommendations , current Home Office plans for a Communications Data Bill to require the retention , and sharing across Whitehall , of communications data – including details of every private phone call made , e-mail sent ( or received ) and access to the internet - should be immediately subject to a Privacy Impact Assessment .
The Home Office should conduct the PIA in consultation with the Information Commissioner , and the outcome of the review published and reported to Parliament .
The Conservative Party 's Shadow Justice Secretary , Dominic Grieve , has launched a new policy paper ( ‘’) that , if elected , would seek to protect the peoples ’ right to privacy .
The paper includes a pledge to submit government plans for the retention of communications data ( i.e. logs of all your email , website and telephone accesses ) to the Information Commissioner ( ICO ) for a Privacy Impact Assessment ( PIA ) .
Under existing government plans the Interception Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) , which is part of the wider , will see all YOUR email accesses and website visits ( not content ) monitored and stored for a period of one year .
Many organisations , such as the NHS , Local Councils and Royal Mail could then be granted access to this data , not just the police .
The system is expected to cost a staggering £ 2bn over a 10 - year period , though mercifully plans for a centralised government database to store all the information have recently been scrapped .
Instead UK broadband ISPs will be required to maintain the information .
To resolve concerns the Conservative 's are proposing a number of new measures to protect privacy , which will include submitting Labour 's Internet snooping plans for a PIA .
A PIA is defined as a " " , and a search is undertaken for ways to avoid or minimise privacy concerns .
Although the PIA process takes the Data Protection Act ( DPA ) and other relevant laws into account , it does not focus on them .
A complementary process is needed to ensure legal compliance .
We welcome the tougher line against a government stance that has always appeared to be unnecessarily intrusive upon private personal communications .
However it remains to be seen whether any of this will result in a practical scaling back of privacy invading ISP data retention plans .
Choosing a Financial Planner
That is Right for You
While it ’s possible to be successfully manage your finances without a plan , those who create an actual financial plan are more likely to prosper in their personal finance lives .
And , while it is certainly possible to create your own financial plan , the fact of the matter is that it can help to have fresh eyes on the situation , and who has a certain level of expertise when it comes to finances .
It you really want to do it right , you should consider hiring a financial planner .
What is a financial planner ?
A financial planner is someone who advises you about your finances .
Financial planners can give you an overall view of your finances , and explain how your assets interact .
They can also provide you with help in reaching a specific goal , such as retirement planning or saving for college .
Some financial planners have specialties , while others provide broader financial advice .
A financial planner can help you choose investment vehicles and different types of accounts to maximize your financial situation and reach your goals .
It is important , also , to realize what a financial planner is not .
The Wall Street Journal offers this helpful insight :
Do n’t confuse planners with stockbrokers — the market mavens people call to trade stocks .
Financial planners also differ from accountants who can help you lower your tax bill , insurance agents who might lure you in with complicated life insurance policies , or the person at your local Fidelity office urging you to buy mutual funds .
One of the best ways to recognize a bone fide financial planner is to check for the CFP after the name .
A Certified Financial Planner has passed a rigorous test to gauge financial planning knowledge , and has had a certain level of experience and education .
When choosing a financial planner , the first thing you should look for is the CFP designation .
Deciding on the best financial planner for you
After you have found a few financial planners that are CFPs , check their credentials .
You also want to make sure these credentials are up - to - date .
Jeff Rose , CFP , at Good Financial Cents , recommends that you check these sources when doing a background check on your financial advisor candidates :
FINRA Broker Check
SEC Investment Adviser Search
NASAA Check
Advisor Check
You should also find out about how the financial planner gets paid .
Some planners receive commissions for steering you toward certain investments and financial products .
In these cases , you might find that your money is not going to where it will benefit you the most .
On the other hand , there are financial planners that operate on different systems .
Some charge flat rates per hour , or charge per service ( $ 1,500 for a financial plan , for example ) .
Still others charge a fee based on a percentage of your assets under management .
When your assets increase , so does the planner ’s income .
Choosing a fiduciary , someone who has pledged to act in the client ’s best interest , is a good idea .
Many financial planners will meet with you for free and go over some of the basics of your financial situation with you .
( Some planners may require account minimums , meaning you need to have a certain amount of assets for management . )
It is vital that you find a financial planner that you trust and feel comfortable with .
Watch out for planners who claim that you are going to get “ market beating ” results or make some other sort of promise .
Also , pay attention to the questions that a prospective financial planner asks you .
S/he should be interested in your goals , and should try to find out your risk tolerance and time horizons .
Also make sure that the planner you are contemplating hiring addresses your total financial picture and not just few narrow aspects of it .
Above all , the key to selecting a great financial planner is research , references and personal interviews .
In the end , choosing a financial planner is a lot like shopping around for any other product or service you want .
You need to do your research , possibly test the situation and make a decision based on what you are comfortable with .

More than 50 kinds of pesticides were found on some domestic and imported peaches tested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture last year , the Chicago Tribune said yesterday .
Five of the pesticides were in excess of EPA limits , and six of them have n’t even been approved by the EPA for use on peaches in the U.S .
Like a lot of other people , I buy fruits and vegetables that are cheap and in season .
So I ’ve picked up peaches on several occasions this summer and had a bunch in the fridge when I saw this report .
But it did n’t surprise me .
See , when I bring food home from the supermarket , or even an outdoor “ farmer ’s market , ” I assume that it ’s contaminated .
Right out of the gate .
So I wash the bejesus out of fruits and vegetables and cook meat like chicken and beef to a fare - thee - well .
Fish , of course , is loaded up with all kinds of chemicals that you ca n’t cook out even if you dumped it into a fryer while you took a shower and polished your shoes .
The Tribune ran some tests of their own and concluded that California organic peaches were much cleaner than the stuff examined by the USDA .
But my question is :
How do you know if a food is actually organically grown ?
Because there ’s a big sign over it saying so ?
Peaches have always had a pesticide problem , apparently .
They ’ve topped a listing of “ Dirty Dozen ” issued by the Environmental Working Group for years .
They not only require more chemicals to keep them from rotting , they also retain them because of their fuzzy texture .
The healthiest piece of produce on the EWG list is onions .
If you really want a healthful snack , go ahead and curl up in front of the tube with a nice plump Vadalia .
But personally I prefer a good peach .
So really , what else can you do but enjoy every bite of that sweet , juicy chemical goodness ?

Britain : Iraq War Going Well Despite Casualties
Michael Drudge
London
24 Mar 2003 , 11:11 UTC
British officials say the Iraq war is going well despite a string of incidents that have left 18 British servicemen killed or missing .
Prime Minister Tony Blair can expect questions about the casualties when he appears in parliament Monday .
British defense officials are playing down the impact of the accidents and battlefield incidents that have beset the British and American forces in the first four days of the war .
Sixteen British servicemen had died through Sunday in two helicopter crashes and the accidental shoot - down of a British jet by an American missile .
Two British soldiers went missing in action Sunday .
Junior Defense Minister Louis Moonie told British radio Monday the overall battle plan is proceeding as it was designed .
" Every death of one of our people is a tragedy for their families and a tragedy and great sorrow for all of us .
But it is important to put them into the context against the overall picture .
They are not setbacks , " he said .
" They are the sad inevitability of what we are doing .
But the fact is that the main line [ plan ] remains on course and that 's what we have to proceed with . "
Mr. Moonie also said he sees no reason to increase the number of British and American forces spearheading the invasion .
" I think if that were necessary then clearly it would have to be done , " he said .
" There is no thought at present that it is necessary .
The role of our forces always was to smash forward towards Baghdad as quickly as possible .
We want to remove this regime with the minimum disruption to the country and people of Iraq . "
Prime Minister Blair was preparing for tough questions in parliament later Monday about the British casualties and war strategy .
It will be his first appearance there since the fighting started .
Parliament voted last week by a three - to - one margin to approve Mr. Blair 's war plan .
But he still faces significant opposition within his own Labor Party over the war .
News article published courtesy of http://www.voanews.com
The day before Yom Kippur , I always go to a local appetizing store and buy as much smoked fish as I can carry home .
My selections are hardly ever tempered by my wallet , which is why I ’m staggered when I get the bill .
I do this from habit and because my family adores these foods .
But are bagels and lox mandatory to break the Yom Kippur fast ?
Ideally this meal should be restorative , easy to digest and readily assembled at the last minute .
Bagels and lox meet these criteria , so platters of smoked fish – along with kugels and sliced tomatoes – have become the menu of choice among many Ashkenazim in America .

But this year I became curious about Sephardic customs .
Perusing cookbooks , I discovered a treasure trove of break - fast recipes whose variety astounded me .
Sephardim often partake in dairy foods on this special night ; bagels and lox are not part of their culinary repertoire .
Surprisingly , some Sephardim break the fast with soups and stews calling for meat , and with dishes that are typical main course fare , as opposed to the brunch foods enjoyed by Ashkenazim .
While the break - fast menu varies among Sephardim from country to country , their entrees and side dishes are nourishing , delicious , gentle on empty stomachs , and economical .
They are well worth considering in a year when the stock market remains down and the cost of smoked fish is up .
The Sephardic custom of eating meat to break the fast has roots in Spanish tradition .
In “ A Drizzle of Honey : The Lives and Recipes of Spain ’s Secret Jews , ”  authors David Gitlitz and Linda Kay Davidson cited several instances of meat - based menus .
Jews in Castile , who clandestinely conformed to their religion to avoid the terror of the Spanish Inquisition , often broke the fast with fowl or other meat .
In Aragon , Spain , and in Portugal , fish and fowl were the preferred foods on this occasion .
The authors mentioned the late 15th - century custom of Rabbi Simuel of Teruel : “ After the fast , in the evening [ his family ] ate chicken .
Amazingly the family of Aldonza Deli of Teruel broke their fast with doves . ” 
While I ’ve never tried a dove – at Yom Kippur or ever – I ’ve always felt a nice bowl of chicken soup would be appealing after forgoing food for more than 24 hours .
In “ Jewish Food : The World at Table , ”  Mathew Goodman discussed the Sephardic custom of breaking the Yom Kippur fast with chicken soup .
In Italy , the broth is often heightened with turkey meatballs and pieces of pasta , which sounds very tempting .
Jews in Greece and Turkey end the fast with avgolemono , an egg - and - lemon soup in a chicken - broth base that is thickened with rice .
Light and delicious , it ’s a staple on Greek dinner menus year round .
Several cookbooks featured Moroccan lemon chicken with olives , a wildly popular break - fast stew , which richly deserves its reputation .
Morocco has spawned a spectrum of tempting break - fast recipes .
In “ The Jewish Holiday Kitchen , ”  Joan Nathan raved about both chicken couscous and harira , a thick soup brimming with stewing meat , fava beans , and lentils .
The original recipe dates back to biblical times .
Nathan ’s cookbook featured an easy but delicious recipe for Algerian chicken tagine ( stew ) with quinces , which the Jaffin family of Algiers served as a main course to break the fast .
Of course , no Jewish holiday meal is complete without fish on the menu .
In “ The Classic Cuisine of the Italian Jews , ”  Edda Servi Machlin waxed poetic about a sweet - and - sour fish in the Jewish style .
After tinkering with the recipe , I realized this piquant dish would be an excellent way to introduce Sephardic food to the usual smoked fish menu , a way to bridge the gap for those who are n’t ready to jump to meat .
Likewise , zucca disfatta , or pumpkin puree , is a pareve recipe that pairs well with meat dishes or smoked fish .
Claudia Roden in her landmark “ The Book of Jewish Food : An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York ”  explained that the dish was prepared to break the fast in charming Ferrara , Italy , the setting of the movie “ The Garden of the Finzi - Contini . ” 
Sephardic recipe possibilities go on and on .
Moroccan Jews also break the fast with a chickpea and chicken omelet .
Or there ’s hamine , eggs cooked for hours until their yolks turn creamy and their whites become light brown .
According to Roden , hamine , which are sold by street vendors in Israel , have come to epitomize Sephardic food there .
Like smoked fish , they are eaten at births and deaths , and to break the Yom Kippur fast .
Although Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews may come from different culinary traditions , we are tied by a common heritage .
Whether we eat dairy foods or meat , after the Day of Atonement we turn to each other , our families , and foods we can count on .
The following recipes were developed by Linda Morel .
Avgolemono ( Egg and Lemon Soup ) ( Meat )
This light soup hailing from Greece and Turkey is calming to empty stomachs .
Original recipes call for homemade chicken broth , but the canned broth in this version eases preparation at a busy time of year .
Yield : 8 servings

3 tbsp. olive oil
1 medium onion , chopped
5 carrots , cut horizontally into thin circles
1/2 cup uncooked rice

Simmer 25 to 30 minutes , or until rice is soft enough to eat .
3 . Meanwhile , whisk eggs in a medium - sized bowl until frothy .
Slowly drizzle in lemon juice while whisking .
4 . When soup is ready , uncover the pot and stir soup for a minute to release heat .
Remove a half - ladle of soup and gradually drizzle into egg mixture , whisking briskly .
( If you add soup too quickly , eggs will curdle . )
Repeat this 3 more times , until you ’ve added 2 ladles of soup to egg mixture .
5 . Stir pot of soup again to continue releasing heat .
Slowly drizzle egg mixture into pot of soup , whisking vigorously .
Soup will appear creamy .

Djadja Zetoon ( Moroccan - Style Lemon Chicken with Olives ) ( Meat )
Yield : 6 - 8 servings
Preserved Lemon Express
Jews throughout North Africa and in many Middle Eastern countries cook with preserved lemons , which are quartered , heavily salted , and stored in jars of oil for 3 to 4 weeks .

In a newly released video interview , al Qaeda deputy Ayman al Zawahiri extended a truce offer from the terrorist group to President Obama today if the U.S. withdraws from Afghanistan .
The video references the President 's speech in Cairo in early June , making it at least two months old , and suggesting that despite the U.S. manhunt for the terrorist leader , he is still able to follow current events .
Zawahiri , like bin Laden , has a $ 25 M reward for his capture .
Zawahiri said the truce was a continuation of Osama bin Laden 's 2006 offer to President George W. Bush , which required that U.S. forces leave Afghanistan as well as all Muslim countries in the Middle East .
Al Qaeda has often offered truces before launching an attack .
In the video , bin Laden 's deputy is made to look scholarly in a white turban and white robe , sitting in front of a large bookcase filled with Islamic texts background .
Zawahiri appeared healthy , gesturing often with his arms .
The 90 - minute video was released by al Sahab , al Qaeda 's propaganda division .
Much of the interview revolves around the war in Afghanistan and attempts to rebut President Obama 's recent speeches and interviews addressed to the Muslim world .
That he spends so much time refuting President Obama 's efforts to remake the Islamic world 's image of the U.S. suggests al Qaeda is concerned with how successful Obama has been in his effort .
Former CIA Counterterrorism chief Robert Grenier told ABC
News that the video " highlights the fact that al Qaeda feels threatened by Obama 's recent efforts " to improve America 's image in the Muslim world .
Recent polls have shown that after Obama 's PR campaign throughout the Middle East , perception of U.S. foreign policy has improved .
Zawahiri spends much of the video denouncing U.S. foreign policy and stressing to Muslims that the jihad is a result of American aggression .
Grenier points out that Zawahiri has frequently tried to sell al Qaeda as reacting to U.S. actions , not provoking .
Zawahiri also declares that the War in Afghanistan is over .
" What 's happening in Afghanistan is a lesson , which the Moslem world should learn , " he said .
" American forces have been defeated by the Taliban . "
Zawahiri Video
Grenier said that al Qaeda is " quite sincere when they make these offers . "
If the U.S. were to give up their efforts in the Middle East , Grenier saidd , al Qaeda would claim victory .
" It 's not realistic , but it is sincere . "
" This latest message from Zawahiri recycles many of the same themes he 's used in the past , " a U.S. counterterrorism official told ABC News .
" If he 's paying attention to what he reads - and he seems to keep up to speed on what 's going on in the world - surely he must understand that al Qaeda is feeling pressured at the moment , and that many prominent Muslim voices have increasingly criticized al - Qaeda 's ideology and terrorist tactics .

That 's how much Waldo — an autonomous underwater robot from the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota , Florida — costs .
Now they have to find it , and the bloody thing does n't even wear a white and red striped sweater .

I bet Mote 's scientist Gary Kirkpatrick does n't find the irony funny , however :
Waldo was making reports every two hours ,
Then , bam , it just stopped sending a signal .
There are a few possibilities that we think are likely :
It could have had a major leak or malfunction and sank to the bottom and is just sitting there .
Or , it could have had a malfunction with its computer or its communication system and is floating on the surface but unable to tell us that it 's there .

I 'm sad for Gary , but I find it delightful that Waldo is finally missing , even while this one does n't look like a dork .
Of course , these things can only happen in the great state of Florida , the only US territory that looks like a schlong .

Naturists have reportedly tested the trail - but there is some opposition
Germany is traditionally tolerant of nudity , but a plan to give naked ramblers their own wilderness path is still some way from the sunny uplands .
A campsite manager , Heinz Ludwig , aims to establish Germany 's first official naked ramblers ' footpath - an 18 km ( 11 - mile ) route in the Harz Mountains .
" But some people are against - it is not directly supported by the community , " he told BBC News .
" I want people to calm down , then we 'll try again next year . "
But he says fans of Freikoerperkultur - Free Body Culture , or FKK for short - have expressed support for the scheme .
It would attract naturists to the Wippra and Dankerode areas , in the central German mountain range .
Fully - clothed walkers would be free to use the path , too .
" It 's a secluded area , away from traffic , " Mr Ludwig said .
" In the GDR [ former communist East Germany ] people used to bathe there , too . "
He says some keen naturists have already tested the trail .
The plan is to open it officially next May .
A sign has been put up warning those averse to naturism that they might prefer to go elsewhere .
" If you do n't want to see people with nothing on then you should refrain from moving on , " it reads .
The path is overgrown in places , so some funding would be needed to tidy it up and maintain it , Mr Ludwig said .
NYC CAN Breaking News Bulletin - FORWARD WIDELY
September 10 , 2009
New York –
In a last minute decision , lawyers for the City of New York have conceded that the New York City Coalition for Accountability Now ( NYC CAN ) , a group comprising 9/11 family members , first responders and survivors , indeed did submit over 30,000 valid signatures to put the referendum for a new 9/11 investigation before the voters of New York City this November .
In an earlier letter from the City Clerk dated July 24 , 2009 , the City had claimed only 26,003 signatures were valid , 3,997 short of the requisite 30,000 .
The City ’s concession that over 30,000 of the 52,000 signatures submitted were in fact valid paves the way for lawyers from both sides to argue the legality of petition .
Asked whether he thought NYC CAN could overcome the City ’s challenge to the legality of the petition , legal counsel to the petitioners , Dennis McMahon , said , “ Absolutely .
Although the City has an incredibly successful record of shooting down ballot initiatives , we will be arguing from a fresh perspective that reflects the unprecedented events of 9/11 .
We believe the courts will see how critical an issue this is , and be persuaded with our legal reasoning and point of view . ”
A final determination on the legality of the petition will be reached in time for the referendum to be included on the November ballot should the petitioners prevail .
Representatives for NYC CAN , 9/11 family member Manny Badillo and Executive Director Ted Walter , arrived at the Board of Elections on the morning of Wednesday , September 9 , to assist the court - appointed referee in commencing a line - by - line review of the disputed signatures , only to learn the referee ’s review had been called off due to a last minute concession by the City .
Mr. Badillo immediately got on the phone to inform others of the news .
“ The City conceded we have 30,000 valid signatures .
Big victory . ”
The City ’s concession comes as a result of the immense effort put forth by 50 + volunteers who gave more than 1,000 hours over a two week period from August 10 to August 25 to identify a total of 7,166 signatures that were wrongly invalidated by the NYC City Clerk and Board of Elections .
On August 27 , NYC CAN filed the 631 - page Bill of Particulars cataloguing each of the 7,166 signatures it contended were in fact valid .
NYC CAN submitted another 28,000 signatures on September 4 to guarantee the referendum will go on the ballot if they win the court case , bringing the total signatures submitted to 80,000 .
631 - page Bill of Particulars Filed on August 27
NYC CAN must deliver its memorandum of law in response to the City ’s motion for summary judgment by Monday , September 21 .
The City will be given an opportunity to reply before the referee ’s decision is made on Monday September 28 .
Fast - track appeals will likely follow no matter who wins .
A final decision will have to be made by September 30 .
If the referendum passes in November , it would lead to the creation of a local , independent commission with subpoena power that would be tasked with comprehensively reinvestigating the attacks .

Patriots ACT .
Jim Callis of Baseball America is reporting that the Royals have agreed to terms with 3rd round pick C - Wil Myers .
The bonus is the expected , and long rumored , amount of $ 2 million .
Click here to read Callis ’ blog entry .
Myers is a HS player so it will be at least a year or two before we can even start projecting what he could realistically be in the Major Leagues , but anytime you draw comparisons to Dale Murphy it ’s certainly a good thing .
Of course , pre-GMDM , Chris George was often compared to Tom Glavine so comparisons are n’t worth much right now .
Regardless of what he actually becomes , Myers was considered a 1st round talent .
Many projections had the Royals taking him 12th overall , where they ultimately picked , still unsigned , RHP - Aaron Crow .
If Myers stays at C and reaches the majors , I just want to know if he can actually block pitches and perhaps throw out a baserunner every now and then .
If he can do that , and perhaps have an OBP north of 0.320 , I will be a happy camper .
I recognize that a 0.320 OBP is setting the bar low for Myers , but that mark has managed to evade Olivo and Buck their entire ML careers thus far .
As bad some of Dayton ’s decisions have been with regard to the ML roster , there is no doubt that Moore still has the support of ownership to spend money on the draft .
This is a point that should not be taken lightly or understated .
The Royals are still spending money and that is a good thing .
Hopefully DM starts spending money wisely at the ML level so the talent improves on the farm and in the big leagues .
Dog death at Woodfield prompts cruelty charge
A Cedar Rapids , Iowa , woman has been charged with cruel treatment to animals after a dog died in her car while she was at Woodfield Shopping Center in Schaumburg .
Ya Lan Lee , 29 , of the 2100 block of 25th St. , Cedar Rapids , was arrested around 3:30 p.m. Monday at an animal hospital in the 1300 block of north Roselle Road in Schaumburg .
Reports said she and her husband left their 4 - year - old female pug dog in their car while they ate at Woodfield .
The dog's body temperature was higher than the thermometer range of 107.4 degrees , reports said .
Lee 's court date is Sept. 24 .
Google 's Chrome was already the default browser on the VAIO NW we handled a month ago , and now the Financial Times delivers confirmation of a wider distribution deal between the search giant and Sony .
According to the report , new VAIO laptops and desktops will come with Chrome preinstalled -- an " experimental " arrangement -- and , most importantly , will default to Google for both their homepage and search queries .
Pair this with the agreement to bring over a million Google Books to Sony 's e-readers , and you start to see some clear lines being drawn in the sand .
Intriguingly , Google is said to be pursuing similar distribution pacts with other manufacturers , which would place Internet Explorer 's stranglehold on the uninitiated user under threat .
Your move , Microsoft .

Much to their dismay , Americans learned last year that they “ owned ” Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Well , meet their cousin , Ginnie Mae or the Government National Mortgage Association , which will soon join them as a trillion - dollar packager of subprime mortgages .
Taxpayers own Ginnie too .
Only last week , Ginnie announced that it issued a monthly record of $ 43 billion in mortgage - backed securities in June .
Ginnie Mae President Joseph Murin sounded almost giddy as he cheered this “ phenomenal growth . ”
Ginnie Mae ’s mortgage exposure is expected to top $ 1 trillion by the end of next year — or far more than double the dollar amount of 2007 .
( See the nearby table . )
Earlier this summer , Reuters quoted Anthony Medici of the Housing Department ’s Inspector General ’s office as saying , “ Who would have predicted that Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae would have swapped positions ” in loan volume ?
Ginnie ’s mission is to bundle , guarantee and then sell mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration , which is Uncle Sam ’s home mortgage shop .
Ginnie ’s growth is a by - product of the FHA ’s spectacular growth .
The FHA now insures $ 560 billion of mortgages — quadruple the amount in 2006 .
Among the FHA , Ginnie , Fannie and Freddie , nearly nine of every 10 new mortgages in America now carry a federal taxpayer guarantee .
Herein lies the problem .
The FHA ’s standard insurance program today is notoriously lax .
It backs low downpayment loans , to buyers who often have below - average to poor credit ratings , and with almost no oversight to protect against fraud .
Sound familiar ?
This is called subprime lending — the same financial roulette that busted Fannie , Freddie and large mortgage houses like Countrywide Financial .
On June 18 , HUD ’s Inspector General issued a scathing report on the FHA ’s lax insurance practices .
It found that the FHA ’s default rate has grown to 7 % , which is about double the level considered safe and sound for lenders , and that 13 % of these loans are delinquent by more than 30 days .
The FHA ’s reserve fund was found to have fallen in half , to 3 % from 6.4 % in 2007 — meaning it now has a 33 to 1 leverage ratio , which is into Bear Stearns territory .
The IG says the FHA may need a “ Congressional appropriation intervention to make up the shortfall . ”

“ TOGETHER we 'll go far . ”
Wells Fargo 's corporate slogan is a pledge to its customers , but it might just as well reflect the San Francisco banking giant 's optimism about its takeover of Wachovia , a teetering rival it snatched from under Citigroup 's nose last October .
Losses from the acquisition are “ still in the same zip code ” as the sum envisaged at the time , says John Stumpf , Wells 's chief executive .
In another sign of self - confidence , Dick Kovacevich will step down as chairman at the end of the year , a move that would be hard to imagine if the bank 's hands - on former boss were worried about the future .
Others are less convinced , suspecting Wells of understating Wachovia 's loan losses and questioning its accounting .
Fuelling these worries , says Dick Bove of Rochdale Securities , is “ extraordinarily poor ” communications and disclosure .
Alone among big banks ,
Wells does not hold a quarterly call for analysts .
Had it not bought Wachovia , Wells would be one of finance 's clear winners .
Long one of America 's more conservative lenders , it avoided the most noxious property loans and securities .
As Warren Buffett , a fan and shareholder , put it in April : “ What Wells did n't do is what defines their greatness . ”
Wachovia changed that .
It brings opportunities , but also risks .
On the positive side , the merger has doubled the number of Wells branches to more than 6,600 , giving it a footprint that only Bank of America comes close to matching .
Wells and Wachovia were “ mirror images ” of each other , says Mr Stumpf , with Wells strong west of the Mississippi and Wachovia powerful to the east .
This gives
Wells huge deposit - gathering power , as well as an opportunity to pump more products to Wachovia customers , who typically have four to five products with the bank , compared with almost six for Wells clients .
Mr Buffett sees echoes of Wal - Mart in Wells 's retailing ethic .
The merger gives Wells a formidable position in areas such as mortgages .
In the first half of the year it handled a staggering 23.5 % of all new home loans , according to Inside Mortgage Finance , a newsletter .
But Wachovia also brings credit problems that could take years to resolve .
A big worry is its range of “ Pick - A - Pay ” retail loans , which allowed borrowers to defer principal as well as interest payments : of those that were still current at the time of the merger , 3.2 % were seriously delinquent as of June 30th , up from 1.1 % in March .
The default rate on the bank's $ 38 billion of property - development loans is several times the national average ( though Wells argues that the official numbers do not reflect merger - related adjustments ) .
A big chunk of its $ 127 billion commercial - property portfolio consists of interest - only loans with a balloon payment at the end , the wholesale equivalent of Pick - A - Pays .
These will be hard to refinance .
Another worry is the large amount of credit protection that Wachovia is thought to have sold on risky tranches of mortgage - backed securities .
Wells points to its latest filing , which shows $ 105 billion of protection sold and a similar amount bought .
But the extent to which the latter really offsets the former is unclear .
Then there is capital .
Among big banks ,
Wells scores poorly on Tier - 1 common equity , the core- capital measure favoured by regulators ( see chart ) .
It is well below the 6 % level that is likely to be the minimum required in future .
And at some point it will have to repay the $ 25 billion of government capital it got last year .
Wells puts its relative capital paucity down to “ purchase ” accounting at the time of the Wachovia deal .
It immediately wrote down $ 40 billion of the $ 60 billion in total losses it envisaged .
This upfront hit took a big chunk out of its equity , but put it ahead of peers in dealing with losses .
Andrew Marquardt of Fox - Pitt Kelton estimates that Wells has swallowed 60 - 70 % of its expected losses , twice the proportion recognised by a typical large bank .
Wells also argues that analysts and regulators underestimate its earning power .
It generates pre-provision profits of around 3 % of assets , compared with 2 % for its peers .
Wells has already plugged the gap identified in this year 's stress tests , generating almost half the necessary capital internally ( and the rest from a share offering ) .
But , thanks to the uncertain economy and concerns about Wachovia , doubts linger .
Mr Bove likens the bank to a rumbling volcano .
If it blows , Wells will need lots more capital than it produces internally .
The return to Bojinka principles is significant because it represents not only an IED attack against an aircraft but also a specific method of attack : a camouflaged , modular IED that the bomber smuggles onto an aircraft in pieces and then assembles once he or she is aboard and well past security .
The original Bojinka plot used baby dolls to smuggle the main explosive charge of nitrocellulose aboard the aircraft .
Once on the plane , the main charge was primed with an improvised detonator that was concealed inside a carry - on bag and then hooked into a power source and a timer ( which was disguised as a wristwatch ) .
The baby - doll device was successfully smuggled past security in a test run in December 1994 and was detonated aboard Philippine Air Flight 434 .
The main charge in the baby - doll devices , however , proved insufficient to bring down the aircraft , so the plan was amended to add a supplemental charge of liquid triacetone triperoxide ( or TATP , aptly referred to as " Mother of Satan " ) , which was to be concealed in a bottle of contact lens solution .
The plot unraveled when the bomb - maker , Abdel Basit ( who is frequently referred to by one of his alias names , Ramzi Yousef ) accidentally set his apartment on fire while brewing the TATP .
The Best Laid Plans
The 2006 liquid - bomb plot borrowed the elements of using liquid explosives and disguised individual components and attacking multiple aircraft at the same time from Bojinka .
The 2006 plotters sought to smuggle their liquid explosives aboard using drink bottles , instead of contact lens solution containers , and planned to use different types of initiators .
The biggest difference between Bojinka and more recent plots is that the Bojinka operatives were to smuggle the components aboard the aircraft , assemble the IEDs inside the lavatory and then leave the completed devices hidden aboard multi-leg flights while the operatives got off the aircraft at an intermediate stop .
The more recent iterations of the jihadist airplane - attack concept , including Richard Reid 's attempted shoe bombing and the 2006 liquid - bomb plot , planned to use suicide bombers to detonate the devices mid-flight .
The successful August 2004 twin aircraft bombings in Russia by Chechen militants also utilized suicide bombers .
The shift to suicide operatives is not only a reaction to increased security but also the result of an evolution in ideology : Suicide bombings have become more widely embraced by jihadist militants than they were in the early 1990s .
As a result , the jihadist use of suicide bombers has increased dramatically in recent years .
The success and glorification of suicide operatives , such as the 9/11 attackers , has been an important factor in this ideological shift .
One of the most recent suicide attacks was the Aug. 28 attempt by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) to assassinate Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Nayef .
In that attack , a suicide operative smuggled an assembled IED containing approximately one pound of high explosives from Yemen to Saudi Arabia concealed in his rectum .
While in a meeting with Mohammed , the bomber placed a telephone call and the device hidden inside him detonated .
In an environment where militant operational planning has shifted toward concealed IED components , this concept of smuggling components such as explosive mixtures inside of an operative poses a daunting challenge to security personnel — especially if the components are non-metallic .
It is one thing to find a quantity of C - 4 explosives hidden inside a laptop that is sent through an X - ray machine ; it is quite another to find that same piece of C - 4 hidden inside someone 's body .
Even advanced body - imaging systems like the newer backscatter and millimeter wave systems being used to screen travelers for weapons are not capable of picking up explosives hidden inside a person 's body .
Depending on the explosive compounds used and the care taken in handling them , this method of concealment can also present serious challenges to explosive residue detectors and canine explosive detection teams .
Of course , this vulnerability has always existed , but it is now highlighted by the new tactical reality .
Agencies charged with airline security are going to be forced to address it just as they were previously forced to address shoe bombs and liquid explosives .
Who 's Involved
Currently , there are three different actors in the jihadist realm .
The first is the core al Qaeda group headed by bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri .
The core al Qaeda organization has been hit hard over the past several years , and its operational ability has been greatly diminished .
It has been several years since the core group has conducted a spectacular terror attack , and it has focused much of its effort on waging the ideological battle as opposed to the physical battle .
The second group of actors in the jihadist realm involves the regional al Qaeda franchise groups or allies , such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , Jemaah Islamiyah and Lashkar - e - Taiba .
These regional jihadist groups have conducted many of the most spectacular terrorist attacks in recent years , such as the November 2008 Mumbai attacks and the July 2009 Jakarta bombings .
The third group of actors is the grassroots jihadist militants , who are essentially do - it - yourself terrorist operatives .
Grassroots jihadists have been involved in several plots in recent years , including suicide bomb plots in the United States and Europe .
In terms of terrorist tradecraft such as operational planning and bomb - making , the core al Qaeda operatives are the most advanced , followed by the operatives of the franchise groups .
The grassroots operatives are generally far less advanced in terms of their tradecraft .
However , any of these three actors are capable of constructing a device to conduct an attack against an airliner .
The components required for such a device are incredibly simple — especially so in a suicide attack where no timer or remote detonator is required .
The only components required for such a simple device are a main explosive charge , a detonator ( improvised or otherwise ) and a simple initiator such as a battery in the case of an electric detonator or a match or lighter in the case of a non-electric detonator .
The October 2005 incident in which a University of Oklahoma student was killed by a suicide device he was carrying demonstrates how it is possible for an untrained person to construct a functional IED .
However , as we have seen in cases like the July 2005 attempted attacks against the London Underground and the attempted strikes in July 2007 against nightclubs in London and the airport in Glasgow , grassroots operatives also can botch things , due to a lack of technical bomb - making ability .
Après le projet de fichage de plus de 11 millions de britanniques ( soit un sur 6 , afin de vérifier s’ils ne pourraient pas , éventuellement , faire du mal aux petits enfants ) , la jeune femme fichée à vie , puis incarcérée pour … une fellation librement consentie ( et en attendant de savoir si elle sera condamnée à 10 ou 30 ans de prison ) , voici venir les parents accusés de pédo - pornographie pour avoir … pris des photos de leurs fillettes , dans leur bain .
A l’automne dernier , les époux Demaree déposaient la carte mémoire de leur appareil photo dans un magasin Wal Mart , en Arizona .
Jusque là , tout va bien .
S ’y trouvaient 144 photographies de famille , où l’on voyait leurs trois petites filles ( de 18 mois , 4 et 5 ans ) batifoler en toutes libertés .
S ’y trouvaient également 8 photos où elles apparaissaient , partiellement nues , dans leur bain .
Vous devinez la suite ?
Attendez .
Un employé zélé , persuadé d’avoir affaire à de dangereux pédo- pornographes , contacte la police , qui estime , dans un rapport , que « la petite fille semble poser de manière provocante « .
Les photos seront même qualifiées de « érotisme pédophile » relevant de l' » exploitation sexuelle « .
Logiquement , les trois fillettes ont été retirées ( en pleurs , bien évidement ) à leurs parents , le temps d’enquêter sur les moeurs coupables des Demaree .
Et comme de bien entendu , les enquêteurs , après avoir fouillé leur maison , ont trouvé 20 autres photos et vidéos où les fillettes jouaient toutes nues .
La maman a perdu son boulot ( forcément : elle était éducatrice dans une école … ) , et les deux parents ont été fichés au registre des délinquants sexuels .
Non contents de devoir se défendre de telles accusations envers leurs familles , amis , voisins et relations , ils ont aussi dû dépenser 75 000 $ en frais de justice .
Tout ça pour quoi ?
Pour rien .
Un mois plus tard , leurs enfants leur ont finalement été rendus et , au bout d’un an d’instruction , l ’accusation n’a finalement pas été retenue .
Les Demaree poursuivent aujourd ’hui Wal Mart , la ville et puis l’état d’Arizona .
La vidéo , avec plusieurs des photos « coupables » :
Quel couple de parents pédophiles serait assez débile pour aller faire développer des photographies à caractère pédo- pornographique de leurs propres enfants dans le supermarché du coin ?
A moins que la débilité , la concupiscence , l’hystérie ou la paranoïa ne réside dans le regard de ceux qui ont qualifié ces photos de pédo- pornographiques …
Comme le souligne Lisa Demaree , le plus effrayant , c’est de voir que « la photo la plus innocente qui soit de vos enfants peut , sous le regard de quelqu ’un d’autre , ê tre perçue comme quelque chose de profondément pervers « …
Dites : vous n’auriez pas , par hasard , de contenu à caractère pédo- pornographique dans vos appareils photos , caméras vidéo , disques durs , cassettes VHS , CD ou DVD … ?
Vous en êtes sûrs ?
Vraiment ?

Highway in the sky :
The gravitational corridors that could help spacecraft travel the solar system
Gravitational corridors could help spacecraft fly across the solar system like ships on ocean currents , it was revealed today .
Scientists in the United States are trying to map the twisting ' tubes ' so they can be used to cut the cost of space travel .
Each one acts like a gravitational Gulf Stream , created from the complex interplay of attractive forces between planets and moons .
Spaghetti junction : A computer graphic depicting gravitational corridors that weave around planetary bodies .
It is hoped spacecraft could travel along the currents as ships do on the ocean
Depicted by computer graphics , the pathways look like strands of spaghetti that wrap around planetary bodies and snake between them .
The pathways connect sites called Lagrange points where gravitational forces balance out .
Professor Shane Ross , from Virginia
Tech in the US , said : ' Basically the idea is there are low energy pathways winding between planets and moons that would slash the amount of fuel needed to explore the solar system .
' These are freefall pathways in space around and between gravitational bodies .
Instead of falling down , like you do on Earth , you fall along these tubes .
' Each of the tubes starts off narrow and small and as it gets further out it gets wider and might also split .
' I like to think of them as being similar to ocean currents , but they are gravitational currents .
If you 're in a parking orbit round the Earth , and one of them intersects your trajectory , you just need enough fuel to change your velocity and now you 're on a new trajectory that is free . '
Riding one of the gravitational currents was unlike exploiting the ' slingshot ' effect of a planet or moon 's gravity , a routine space travel technique , he explained .
' Its not the same as a slingshot , ' said Prof Ross .
' Slingshots do n't put you in orbit round a moon , whereas this does . '
Just one U.S. mission so far has made use of the concept .
The Genesis spacecraft was launched in 2004 to capture solar wind particles and return them to Earth .
Space highway : Scientists in the U.S. are trying to map the twisting ' tubes ' so they can be used to cut the cost of space travel
Following the gravitational pathways allowed the amount of fuel carried by the probe to be cut 10 - fold .
The mission ended in failure , but only because a parachute failed on landing .
The corridors were especially useful for voyaging between a planet 's moons , said Prof Ross , speaking at the British Science Festival at the University of Surrey in Guildford .
' Once you get to another planet that has its own tubes you can use them to explore its moons , ' he added .
' You could travel between the moons of Jupiter essentially for free .
All you need is a little bit of fuel to do course corrections . '
The trade off was time , he said .
It would take a few months to get round the Jovian moon system .
David Kaczynski on his agonising decision to inform on his sibling and why , despite their not having spoken for 20 years , he still loves him
Of all the riveting stories that David Kaczynski tells about his brother Ted , the most haunting is the tale of the rabbit in the cage .
One summer during their 1950s childhood , spent in a suburb outside Chicago , their father caught a baby rabbit .
He put it on display in the backyard in a little cage fashioned out of wood and wire .
A crowd of local kids , David among them , gathered round , jostling to get a better view .
Suddenly there was a cry from the back : " Oh , oh , let it go ! "
The boys turn round to find Ted looking distressed and panicked at the sight of the rabbit visibly trembling in its box .
The mood turned instantly from jovial to shame - faced ; how funny it had been to be ogling at the tiny animal , and how cruel it seemed now .
The father grabbed the box and quickly carried it to a wooded area across the street where he let the little rabbit go , back to the wild .
The story is poignant in part because Kaczynski's brother now lives in a cage built of concrete and reinforced steel within a " supermax " security prison , and in part because of how the story was recalled to David years later .
For he had forgotten all about the rabbit for the best part of 40 years , until his mother reminded him of it – on the day he told her that his brother was suspected of being the Unabomber , the " neo- Luddite " murderer who , over 17 years , waged a twisted campaign of mail bombings against targets including American universities and airlines , killing three people and injuring many more .
Kaczynski confessed to his mother that he had informed on Ted to the FBI , fearing further atrocities , and that because of his action , his brother could face the death penalty .
Kaczynski had no idea how his mother would react to the news .
Would she disown him for betraying his own brother ?
Would she for ever cast him out of her love ?
Instead , she took his head in her hands and kissed him .
" I know you love Ted , and would n't have done that if you had n't had to , " she said .
And then she told him the story of the rabbit in the cage .
" She told me that story , " Kaczynski says , " at the moment Ted was caught , was trapped , knowing perhaps he would end in the fulfilment of his own worst nightmare . "
Kaczynski knows a thing or two about the joys and the torture of being a younger brother , and has distilled his experiences of life as the brother of the Unabomber into an essay for a new collection of reflections on brotherly love and rivalry .
David calls his chapter Missing Parts – he has had virtually no contact with Ted for the past 20 years and has , in a sense , lost part of himself in the process .
By 1996 , when Ted was brought into court on 13 counts of bombing and murder , they had already been estranged for seven years .
Kaczynski recalls seeing
Ted again after all that time : " He walked into the court almost directly towards me , but he never made eye contact .
He just turned and sat down with his back to me . "
Kaczynski's essay is painful testimony to the ability of brothers to inflict almost unthinkable wounds on each other .
Ted cut off all relations with David in 1989 ; David shopped Ted to the Feds six years later .
But it also dwells on the kinder side of brotherhood ; on the friendship and loyalty that each bestowed upon the other , and on the love that Kaczynski still reserves for Ted despite his grotesque deeds .
Through the pall of anger and ugliness that descended over his brother , the vicious letters he received from Ted and the rants against technology , Kaczynski still remembers the small acts of kindness and affection that Ted extended to him in their younger years .
When David , aged three , could n't reach the door handle in their home , Ted improvised a new one for him out of an old spool of thread .
Every weekend , the brothers would be driven by their father into the forests outside Chicago , where they would revel in nature ( a theme that would build over the years ) , identifying plants and pitching tents .
" Some of the happiest experiences of my life were these with Ted ; out of doors , a release from confinement of various kinds , " Kaczynski says when we meet in New York .
" Growing up , I never doubted my brother 's fundamental loyalty and love , or felt the slightest insecurity in his presence . "
And yet , from an early age , Kaczynski was aware of something different , something inexplicable and out of place about his big brother .
Ted was hyper - smart – everybody knew that .
He was a mathematics whizz - kid and destined for Harvard and great things .
But he was also a withdrawn , awkward boy who recoiled from social contact .
" When we were young , friends and family would turn up at our house unannounced .
My feeling was ' Oh good !
Here 's Uncle Stanley or our friend Ralph ' – but Ted 's reaction was the opposite .
He saw it as an incursion into his world , and almost in panic would run upstairs to the attic .
I remember thinking , why did he have this aversion to people ? "
Kaczynski was only seven when he first formulated those doubts into words .
" What 's wrong with Teddy ? " he asked his mother .
In reply , she told him that when Ted was just a baby , he had been hospitalised for several days with a rash ; the experience of being separated from his parents had , she believed , hurt him deeply with lasting consequences .
Then she said something startling to her younger son : " Never abandon Ted , because that 's what he fears the most . "
And until he faced the awful decision of whether to turn
Ted over to the FBI , Kaczynski never did abandon him .
In spite of his brother 's growing eccentricities , he provided Ted with a social prop .
" It almost seemed I was his ticket to having social relationships . "
Indeed , it was because of David that Ted ended up in Montana , the rugged north - western state in which he built his now infamous remote wooden cabin .
Together they had bought a plot of forest land outside Lincoln , and there Ted constructed what was to become the headquarters of his bombing campaign .
Though David was the socially - adept half of the relationship , he continued to idolise and emulate Ted throughout his youth and well into adulthood .
He applied for Harvard , following in Ted 's footsteps , but was rejected .
Later , he decided to follow Ted 's example and go back to the land .
When Ted refused to let him build a second cabin on their shared plot in Montana , Kaczynski went instead to a wild part of western
Texas where , just like his brother , he lived without running water or electricity for eight years in a cabin he built by hand .
They would correspond frequently ; two spartan men in their cabin hermitages 1,000 miles apart .
But as time passed , it became clear they were not really communicating , and were , in fact , living in wholly separate wildernesses .
Kaczynski's vision of back - to - the - land was a spiritual journey of discovery , towards some inner understanding , whereas Ted 's philosophy , his cabinology , was all about getting away from the collective mess of the modern world .
There was a despondency , a sorry defeatism in him .
" You could call the difference between us one between the left brain and the right brain .
Ted was hyper - analytical .
It 's curious that he rejected technology because his way of thinking was very scientific , very binary . "
The moment that crystallised this yawning gulf between them came , paradoxically , at a time when the brothers had never felt more close .
It was 1969 and they had spent the whole summer together , travelling huge distances across Canada in search of a plot of land where Ted could begin his anti-civilisation mission .
At the end of the trip , as they were driving back to Chicago , they camped overnight in the grasslands of Nebraska .
They lay side by side , staring up at the immense night sky stuffed with stars .
David felt eager to get home , to familiar things and their mother 's home cooking .
" I wish we were home , " he said .
Ted felt the opposite : " Really ?
I wish we did n't have to go back , " he said .
Later , of course , the distinctions grew stark and ugly .
From 1977 , Ted began sending his parents angry , blistering letters accusing them of never having loved him .
Then , in 1978 , Kaczynski ended up sacking his own brother from a factory job in Illinois after Ted began harassing a fellow woman worker , posting crude and offensive limericks about her on the factory wall .
The timing was significant – only a few months before , in May 1978 , he had posted his first mail bomb to a university professor in Chicago , who was mildly injured in the blast .
A year later , he came close to blowing up an American Airlines jet but the bomb failed to detonate .
Over time , Ted 's homemade bombs became more sophisticated and powerful , and the first serious injury occurred in 1982 when a university secretary suffered severe burns to her hands .
Three people died during the 16 - bomb campaign – a computer rental store owner in 1985 , an advertising executive in 1994 , and ( the final target ) a timber industry lobbyist in 1995 .
Another 23 suffered often hideous injuries , the victims having often been selected – by dint of Ted 's loathing of technology – from university departments and airlines ; hence the moniker Unabomber ( University and Airline Bomber ) .
As the violence escalated , so too did the hostility Ted showed for his family .
The final rift came in 1989 , when Kaczynski wrote to Ted to tell him he was leaving his cabin retreat in Texas and going to live in New York state with Linda , a childhood friend with whom he had fallen in love .
Ted 's response was a 20 - page letter in which he tore into his brother , accusing him of lacking the integrity to lead a pure life .
" Wow !
It was like a metaphorical bomb for me , that he was so hostile , " Kaczynski says .
" It was at a different level to anything before . "
Ted ended the letter by saying that he would have nothing to do with his brother from then on .
If there was a family emergency , David was to put a line under the stamp on the envelope , otherwise Ted would just burn the letter unopened .
If David abused the privilege of the line under the stamp , by using it for anything other than a genuine emergency , all lines of contact would be terminated for ever .
Kaczynski only once used the line under the stamp , to tell Ted that their father was dying from lung cancer .
Ted did reply to that letter .
He thanked David for using the line appropriately .
He made no mention of their father .
In the end it was Linda , by now Kaczynski's wife , who connected Ted to the Unabomber .
She had noticed telling similarities from newspaper accounts .
At first Kaczynski had been sceptical , but then in 1995 when the Unabomber produced his 35,000 - word " manifesto " , excoriating the industrial revolution and modern science , David had a sinking feeling .
The tone was chillingly similar to some of the more hate - filled letters he had received from Ted , and there was one phrase in particular he recognised : " Cool - headed logicians . "
The recognition that his brother might be the Unabomber sent Kaczynski into a tailspin .
" It was a feeling of being trapped – trapped in this brother relationship , trapped in this dilemma in which people 's lives were at stake either way .
One way , if we did nothing , another bomb might go off and more people might die .
The other way , I turned Ted in and he would be executed . "
Weeks of agonising followed .
His mother 's exhortation – never abandon Ted !
– rang in his ears , but ultimately the decision was simple .
He could not stand idly by and watch more people die .
He went to the FBI .
His brother 's life was now at stake .
Though the authorities assured Kaczynski they would not seek the death penalty , they reneged on the promise .
The threatened capital punishment was only dropped after Ted was diagnosed with schizophrenia and pleaded guilty to all charges .
For Kaczynski , the years since Ted was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 have been like a prolonged discourse in what it is to be a brother .
There has been plenty of time to reflect on what happened , on what Ted did .
He does n't feel guilt so much as regret .
" That time I sacked him , could I have been less angry , tried a different approach ?
Could I have been more understanding , a better brother ? "
Kaczynski is still trapped in the definition of being the Unabomber 's brother .
He now devotes his working life to campaigning against death row , inspired by his sense of betrayal by the federal prosecutors .
As head of New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty , he seeks to build bridges between victims of violence and the relatives of the perpetrators .
His closest friend is Gary Wright , a computer store owner from Utah who had more than 200 pieces of shrapnel lodged in his body from one of Ted 's bombs .
Kaczynski has no idea how Ted is doing in his cage in a high security prison in Colorado .
He never replies to letters , and the prison authorities will not say how , or even if , he is being treated for his mental illness .
Kaczynski thinks often of that rabbit .
" Where Ted is , in some senses , is his worst nightmare .
Totally under other people 's control , enclosed , cut off from the sky and the wilderness . "
Sometimes Kaczynski will be driving down the road from his home in upstate New York and , glancing in the rear - view mirror , he 'll see Ted driving the car behind .
A moment later , he 'll realise it 's just another man with a beard .
He remembers how the Unabomber once sent a bomb to an airline executive .
It was concealed in a hollowed - out copy of a book .
Its title : Ice Brothers .
Brothers : 26 Stories of Love and Rivalry , edited by Andrew Blauner and with a foreword by Frank McCourt , is published in the US by Jossey - Bass books .

Thanks to David Darts , there seems no need anymore for a hard - to - carry - around Kiosk of Piracy .
Check out it for yourself :
Well , it almost fits in your pocket , depending on your pants , your mileage may vary .
While your still waiting for the kOS ( Kiosk Operation System ) you can mod your boot screen on Mac with this little helper and one of these logos .
Hackerspaces.org is a great wiki about hackerspaces worldwide .
We added the Kisok as a hackerspace and our running projects ( TPK & KOP OS ) .
We are looking for some help with the KOP OS .
Ok , we 'll try to explain how to built your own The Pirate Kiosk .
You need 3 things :
a database dump of The Pirate Bay and / or all the torrent files hosted there
of The Pirate Bay and / or all the hosted there a tracker software and
and a website
At first , we downloaded a dump of TPB from TPB itself .
After that , we downloaded some pages from TPB and defaced the HTML , but you do n't really have to this .
All you need is a website indexing all the torrents you have .
That is still our biggest problem , we have no solution for a working details .
php nor for getting the .torrent out of the database .
So we just linked to the .torrents we downloaded here , here and here ( you need all of these three ) .
K , now you have the site , and hopefully an index , but no tracker .
We encourage you to use the opentracker , powering both TPB and TPK .
The opentracker is available here .
There is a tutorial available on BTarena , but you do n't all of the apache stuff ( especially vhost configuration ) , since the tutorial is written for people joining the ( online ) BTarena network .
Yeah , and after some Club - Mate , Photoshopping and apache2 mod_alias vodoo we got an running copy of the Bay for your hood .
( Or you can paper - craft your own . )
As a next step we want to create a dump of your code .
Also , we still dream of a Pirate Kiosk kiosk - software .
There should be pretty easy solution involving Linux Live CDs or somehing like this .
If you know the voodo to do this , plz tell us 🙂
Do n't hesitate to contact our development department at dev@kioskofpiracy.org
No other info but clever
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian soccer fans have been told to drink whisky on their trip to Wales for next month ’s World Cup qualifier to ward off the H1N1 swine flu virus , the head of the country ’s supporter association ( VOB ) said Monday .
Bottles of malt whisky are displayed at a whiskey merchandising event in Tokyo February 10 , 2008 .

“ We urge our fans to drink a lot of Welsh whisky as a form of disinfection , ” VOB head Alexander Shprygin told Reuters .
“ That should cure all symptoms of the disease . ”
Russia ’s Health Ministry has issued a public warning against traveling to Britain because of the spread of the H1N1 virus but Shprygin said he expected at least several hundred fans would go to Wales for the September 9 qualifier in Cardiff .
“ Health officials say this virus is very dangerous but being a fan myself I can tell you that for a real fan nothing is more important than the well - being of the team , ” said Shprygin , who also sits on the executive board of the Russian FA .
“ Russian fans do n’t fear anything or anybody so this virus will not stand in our way of supporting our team . ”
The Russian FA also said health issues should not prevent fans from traveling .
“ We do n’t want our team to be without any support for such an important match so we urge our fans to go to Wales despite the health warning , ” a spokesman said .
Germany lead European Group
Four with 16 points from six games , one ahead of Russia , with Wales in fourth place on nine points from seven matches .

Tom Ridge wants to have it both ways .
He sat on his hands then to save his job and now he wants to get paid again .
Remember , he could have made a difference .
Now he describes the terror alerts he propagated as " political " when he has a book to sell , but it 's not sitting well with a lot of us , especially when he already knew that in 2004 .
First , the timing of terror alerts raises questions that are n’t adequately answered .
If there ’s no intent to benefit the president in a re-election year , Ridge should say more than “ we do n’t play politics ” at the Department of Homeland Security .
Especially after doing a virtual campaign ad by announcing “ new ” threats just after the Democratic convention and praising “ the president ’s leadership in the war against terror . ”
And it was n’t said off the cuff or in answer to a question .
It was said in prepared remarks .
It makes Ridge more salesman than guardian , more political servant than public servant .
Same with failing to divulge the full context of information on potential terror sites later revealed as three to four years old .
How does pushing the president while holding back the truth give anyone confidence “ we do n’t play politics ” ?
Maybe he ’s told what to say , when and how , and maybe that ’s why he wants out .
A source close to Ridge tells me the relationship between Ridge and the White House “ is n’t what it used to be . ”
Still , it ’s his gig .

THE SCENE :
The house , left , is where the shooting happened .
The victim ran to the middle of the street , right , before he fell and died .
I hear gunshots piercing the air and begin to run for the door in my flip - flops .
Was I going to die ?
That ’s all I could think of .
I run from the dining room , Thai food flies out of the container in my hand and I open the front door , which I usually need help opening because it jams .
I hear someone running behind me and think they might have a gun .
My adrenalin is pumping and I feel like I ’ve overdosed on caffeine .
I run out of the driveway , turn left on the street , and look back .
All I see is the young robber with the marijuana T - shirt standing in the middle of the street at the end of the driveway .
“ I ’m gonna die ! ”
That is all he says in the most dramatic tone I ’ve ever heard anyone use .
As I stare at him , he looks at first like a normal - functioning person .
The next thing I know what looks like his internal organs and blood are streaming out of his mouth .
He slowly collapses to the middle of the street as I continue to run in panic .
I knew I had witnessed his last words :
It was hard to think about .
My nature is to help but I knew there was nothing I could do .
I kept running because I did n’t know whether I was going to get shot .
I still do n’t understand why I ’m still alive and how things ended up as they did .
I feel blessed to be able to experience life and write this story .
I had taken a walk with my mom earlier that morning and we were discussing life .
My mom actually told me that morning that when it ’s not our time to go , we do n’t go .
The young guy who died in the street was trying to steal marijuana and cash .
His sordid death underscores why so many people are fighting for marijuana to be legalized .
A plant that is supposed to be used for healing — but has a high street value — is what drew the guys to the house .
‘ If an opportunity comes , take it ’
This is how this tragic story began : I was just beginning to eat the first couple of bites of pineapple curry with chicken and shrimp and had just taken my first sip of my Thai iced tea .
Knock , knock , knock .
Someone was at the door unannounced .
I asked myself , who could it be ?
The tenant of the house , with whom I was watching a movie , answered the door .
“ Who is it ? ” he asked .
A Hispanic man and a young white man barged into the house .
The Hispanic guy waved around a silver gun with a large barrel and kept asking for someone named Scooter .
I ’d never even heard of anyone with that name before and I did n’t understand what was going on .
He asked the tenant of the house where all the weed and money was , who pointed to a jar on the table and told him that was all the weed he had and he did n’t know a Scooter .
I told the gunman I did n’t live there .
I did n’t know what was going on and did n’t want to be part of it .
I told him I was just trying to eat my Thai food and watch the movie .
I inched out of my chair like I was going to leave and he told me to fucking sit down and he was n’t fucking around because he ’s a thug and he ’ll shoot out my fucking knee caps .
He asked if we ’d ever seen the movie Pulp Fiction .
I said no , I had n’t .
Then he pointed his gun at my face and told me to give him my food .
He began to scarf down my curry .
My mind was racing like a turbo engine .
Was I really going to die ?
While we were being tormented the two robbers were laughing and having a good time .
The younger robber was smiling and asking where was the money .
I was in such shock that when the Hispanic man handed me my food back I continued to eat it .
I would never have eaten it after that , but I did n’t know what else to do .
I tried not to look at either robber and just focus on the movie .
The Hispanic man became very angry when he saw I was watching the movie and not looking at him .
He told me to look at him because he ’s a fucking thug and he ’s not fucking around .
He told us he would shoot us and thugs do n’t mess around .
As I listened to him and looked up at his face , he looked like a very scary junkie .
He looked spun out of his mind on hard drugs and was shaking the entire time .
We were the ones who were threatened with death and he was the one with the gun but he was shaking more than we were .
He then told me to stand up , empty my pockets , and give him everything I had .
I did exactly what he asked and did n’t argue .
He then pointed at some ground - up marijuana on the table that was yellow and had already been vaporized out of a vaporizing machine .
It was trash and had no use .
The tenant of the house scooped up the pile of vaporized herb and put it in a napkin for him .
Then the Hispanic guy ate some of the tenant ’s food and pointed the gun at him .
In an extremely hostile manner he repeated over and over he was n’t messing around , that he was a fucking thug , and he would fucking shoot .
He then opened the fridge , pointed at some glass bottles in the back corner of it with his gun , and said he was going to take all the beers .
He chugged root beer in a glass bottle very fast while pointing the gun at us and eventually realized there was no beer in the fridge :
It was all root beer !
He asked why the fuck there was a bunch of root beer in the fridge and was very angry it was n’t real beer .
He pointed his gun at the tenant ’s head and told him to open his fortune cookie and read it aloud .
The tenant did exactly what the robber said .
He opened the cookie and read aloud , “ If an opportunity comes , take it . ”
The Hispanic man repeated what the fortune said after the tenant read it and he laughed .
At that point I was very confused about what was going to happen .
Then he proceeded to walk past where the tenant was sitting .
He was wondering where to find money or weed .
Neither of the robbers noticed the almost Christmas tree - sized medical marijuana plants in the back yard with a medical prescription sign posted .
It was very odd because the Hispanic man had spent a long time standing in view of the sliding glass door with the plants right behind it .
The Hispanic man was very angry and began opening drawers and trying to find anything he could steal .
Then he finally noticed some herb drying on a string in a bedroom .
He became very excited and said , “ See , I knew there was more . ”
He told the tenant to go into the room where the herb was hanging and face the back wall .
The next thing I know gunshots are fired and I ’m running to the door in the deepest fear I ’ve ever had .
I sprint out of the driveway , and there I am at the scene where I started my story .
I sprint all the way home .
I sit by myself for hours in severe anxiety with no one to talk to .
I had no cell phone to call anyone because the Hispanic guy had stolen everything from my pockets .
Fear , depression , sadness , confusion , chaos , and loneliness were a few of the emotions I was experiencing .
I had no idea what had happened on the other side of the wall but I expected the worst .
I heard the shots and saw the man dying in the street but I still had and have many unanswered questions .
Why did the robbers enter without hiding their faces ?
Did n’t they think we would see their faces and report what happened ?
How did they get there ?
How were they going to take all the stuff they were going to steal ?
Was there a getaway driver waiting for them ?
What were they going to do with us before they left with all the stolen stuff ?
Would they have tied us up , or what ?
How would things have turned out if both robbers had guns ?
The robbery clearly was n’t well planned .
The Hispanic guy was more into talking himself up and taking his time to torment us than hurrying to steal stuff and bail out .
The white robber spent most of the time laughing and listening to what the Hispanic robber was saying .
They were in no hurry at all ; they were taking their time .
My family finally arrived home and my relative who was visiting from out of town for the weekend said I should go to the police substation and report what happened .
As we were just getting ready to leave our driveway , deputy sheriffs surrounded us with rifles and pointed them at us .
I was lying on the ground with a gun pointed at my head yet again .
I could n’t believe my family was forced to deal with all the anxiety of the whole situation and having guns pointed at them as well .
As the deputies put me in handcuffs while my face was in the dirt and the gun was being pointed at me , I felt a deep , indescribable sadness .
I had just seen someone die and I thought the tenant of the house , with whom I watched the movie , was dead as well .
I just wanted answers , but that ’s not what I got .
After cuffing me they put me in the back of their squad car .
I asked them to put my seatbelt on when they began to drive off .
They stopped and apologized .
They were from a different part of the county so I directed them how to get back to the scene of the crime .
I sat in a depressed state of mind .
I was squished in the back seat with my hands cuffed in a very uncomfortable position .
The detective working the case was finally able to confirm the tenant of the house was alive and OK .
I was so surprised and relieved to know that he was all right .
I did n’t understand how he survived or why the white robber was dead , when the Hispanic guy was the one with the gun .
The detective talked to me through the back window of the car and told me that he would meet me at the substation for an investigation .
I waited at the station in the back of the car and saw the tenant of the house in a blue one - piece outfit in the back of another car .
I was so happy to see that he was alive .
I went into an empty room with the detective and he interviewed me and I told him every detail I could remember .
I waited at the station and signed some mandatory paperwork .
The deputy sheriffs told the tenant ’s father to give me a ride back to the crime scene , where detectives were still investigating .
They told me to strip down and they gave me one of the blue outfits like the tenant had been wearing .
I took off all my clothes in the middle of the street and the detectives took them for investigation purposes .
They also took some stuff out of my vehicle , which was still parked in front of the crime scene .
One of the items taken included my digital SLR camera , which I would have used to take pictures to go with this story .
The Hispanic guy with the gun told the tenant to face the back wall right after the fortune cookie was read .
The tenant later told me he picked up a loaded gun that was on the floor right in front of him .
The only loaded gun that was in the house was in the spot right where the robber told the tenant to be .
The tenant did just as the fortune cookie said and began shooting at the Hispanic guy .
The tenant said the Hispanic man ’s gun locked up when he tried to shoot .
When I went back to the house to get a better understanding of exactly what happened , I noticed a red stain from a puddle of blood and brain gel very close to where I had been sitting .
I could have easily been hit by a bullet .
I still do n’t know how the kid who died got shot .
The tenant said he was only shooting at the Hispanic guy .
Was it a ricocheted bullet ?
I was told that the bullet hit him in the back of the head .
That explains why he looked normal and did n’t look like he got shot at first .
I only saw the front of him when he was in the middle of the road .
Another home invasion robbery gone wrong that happened because of marijuana took place just a few months ago in Morro Bay .
In that incident , the robbers were stopped by the tenants of the home in a bloody gun battle as well .
A girl I went to middle school with got shot in Los Osos a few months ago .
I also witnessed the scene of a death in a surfing incident in Shell Beach exactly a week after I saw the robber die in Los Osos .
My good friend almost died in a car crash at the edge of a cliff the same night of the shooting I witnessed .
It ’s not right that people are dying over marijuana and money .
It ’s also not right that people think they can just go into other people ’s homes and do whatever they want .
Everyone wants to be treated with respect and be loved .
Life has unlimited potential if you stay committed to what you believe in and do n’t give up on yourself .
To all those who are suffering emotionally because of this incident , I send you my blessings .
This is an extremely emotional thing to deal with for anyone involved directly or indirectly .
Lifetimes can truly be gone in the blink of an eye .
I hope by reading this you are reminded of how precious life is .

The official version
Much remains unanswered in Los Osos shooting
BY KYLIE MENDONCA
On July 18 , SLO County sheriff ’s deputies responded to reports of a shooting at 12th Street in Los Osos , just after 7:30 in the evening .
When deputies arrived , they found a young man lying dead in the street .
Another man was shot , though not fatally , and rushed to the hospital after an apparent attempted armed robbery .
The street in front of the house was closed to traffic through the night and into the next day , as deputies attempted to put the pieces together : two men entered the house with a gun ; one left in a body bag , the other in an ambulance .
The apparent intended victim of the robbery , a young man growing medical marijuana , was at the house when police arrived .
He was shaken , but unharmed .
Neither was his friend hurt , an unlucky visitor to the house that night .
Neither of the attempted robbery victims ’ names has been released , nor have many details of the incident , which was described in initial reports as a “ shootout . ”
So far , only the dead man ’s name has been released , Kelsea ( or Kelsey , the spellings from civil and criminal records vary ) Grant Alvarez of Templeton , a 20 - year - old man with green eyes and a colorful criminal past , dating back to just about the moment he turned 18 .
At the time of the shooting , Alvarez had an outstanding warrant for probation violations , dating back to a 2008 incident when he led police on a car chase .
That incident itself was a violation of a previous probation
agreement .
Alvarez was also under court order to stay 100 yards from an Atascadero man at all times .
In January he was convicted of a felony for the chase , and an additional misdemeanor charge for driving without a license .
He was sentenced to 180 days jail time , which would have kept him behind bars until July 14 , but he served only four days after good behavior credits and credit for time served .
The apparent victim , whose home was invaded that night , could face charges for his role in the shooting , according to sheriff ’s spokesman Rob Bryn , because the gun he used in his defense was unregistered .
In California possessing an unregistered gun is a crime and when an unregistered gun is used in a crime , the severity of punishment is “ enhanced . ”
Bryn declined to comment on any other details .
On Inverses of Haskell Functions
Recall that given a function , a function is called a left inverse of f in case .
In other words , we want g to undo whatever f did to its parameter .
A function has a left inverse if and only if it is injective , a .k.a. one - to - one .
Question :
How can we obtain left inverses of Haskell functions automatically ?
In other words , I ’d like to have a function
f :: a -> b
and obtain , without explicitly writing it , another function
g :: b -> a g . f = ( id :: a -> a )
I might first set out to accomplish the gold standard ; to do this automatically , for an arbitrary domain .
Alas I would n’t get very far .
To succeed in that task would imply that the proposition is constructively valid .
But it is n’t even classically valid , so that ’s hopeless .
Of course , if the domain of f is enumerable , I can in principle simply try all inputs to f in parallel until I find one that works … this is not terribly satisfying , however ; it ’s completely impractical for most purposes .
So what if I restrict the domain of f further ?
In particular , I will require that f operate polymorphically on values of some type class , and then restrict the type class to ensure that I can get inverses easily .
By requiring that f be polymorphic , I can ensure that only “ good ” ( i.e. , easily invertible ) things happen in the implementation of f .
( By the way , we need rank - 2 types for this . )
class Fooable a where foo :: Int -> a -> a foo ' n = foo ( - n ) -- an inverse for ( foo n )
I now proceed to implement an automatic inverter for functions defined from and to Fooable types .
newtype FooInversion = FooInversion { unInversion :: Fooable a => a -> a } instance Fooable FooInversion where foo n ( FooInversion inv ) = FooInversion ( inv . foo ' n ) invertFooable :: Fooable a => ( forall b. Fooable b => b -> b ) -> a -> a invertFooable f = unInversion ( f ( FooInversion id ) )
Finished !
I did something a little tricky there , I suppose — I defined functions from Fooable things to Fooable things to actually be Fooable things themselves .
Not too unusual a trick to play in abstract algebra , really .
-- Declare a Fooable instance for testing instance Fooable Int where foo = (+ ) --
Define a QuickCheck property to ensure it 's working prop a b = invertFooable ( foo b ) a == a - b
Unfortunately , while this worked out , it ’s fairly fragile .
It turns out that Fooable is n’t really a terribly useful type class .
The only fully polymorphic functions that can be defined from Fooable things to other Fooable things are actually finite iterations of one operation .
I can add other operations , sure , but the thing I ’m missing is any kind of choice .
Since I have no way to inspect the value I ’ve got as input to my function , I ca n’t make good use of if , case , pattern matching , or anything else of that form .
While it might be interesting to characterize precisely what type signatures can exist in the Fooable type class without making inversion impossible , I ’m going in a different direction .
Suppose that Fooable contained functions to inspect properties of the value you ’re working with .
Then we ca n’t play the trick above quite as cleanly as one might hope .
class Barrable a where look :: a ->
Int bar :: Int -> a -> a bar ' n = bar ( - n )
Now if we tried to proceed as before , how should we define look in the inversion instance ?
Really , we can only get an inverse for specific sequences of operations that we end up in , when computing in the forward direction .
To implement that , we need to know the input ( for the forward function ) in advance , and compute with it .
data BarInversion a = BarInversion { unBarInversion :: Barrable b => b -> b , barInvertible :: a } instance Barrable a => Barrable ( BarInversion a ) where look ( BarInversion f x ) = look x bar n ( BarInversion f x ) = BarInversion ( f . bar '' ) ( bar n x ) where bar ' ' y = let y' = bar ' n y in if look y' == look x then y' else undefined invertBarrable :: ( Barrable a , Barrable b ) => a -> ( forall c. Barrable c => c -> c ) -> b -> b invertBarrable x f = unBarInversion ( f ( BarInversion id x ) )
This is similar to what was done above , except for two changes :
In addition to an inverse function , BarInversion carries around a current value at which the inverse is defined .
The inverse function checks to ensure that all the properties of the current value that are observable via the type class are the same , since the original function might have relied on those properties in deciding what to do .
If they do n’t match , it gives up .
The intention is that our look function does n’t really give away the house ; i.e. , it provides partial , not complete , information about the value .
So for our test case , we ’ll only give partial information :
instance Barrable
Int where look n = n `div` 5 bar = (+)
Now :
let f = invertBarrable 5 ( bar 2 ) f 7 == 5 f 8 == 6 f 9 == 7 f 10 == 8 f 11 == 9 f 12 == *** undefined ***
In other words , as long as the input is observably the same as the point at which we performed the forward calculation , the inverse is available .
If not , then the result is undefined .
We ’ve got a partial inverse , at least .
It ’s worth noting that even if the inverse were only defined at the one point we started with , the inverse function could be valuable .
Note that the type of invertBarrable only requires that x be of some Barrable type , and that the inverse operation on som Barrable type .
They need not actually be the same type !
This is quite useful if , for example , you want to trace some other computation through the calculation of the inverse .
I think I ’ll write another blog post on the practice of tracing one calculation through another one using type classes … but , some other time .
To All My Valued Employees ,
There have been some rumblings around the office about the future of this company , and more specifically , your job .
As you know , the economy has changed for the worse and presents many challenges .
However , the good news is this :
The economy does n't pose a threat to your job .
What does threaten your job however , is the changing political landscape in this country .
Of course , as your employer , I am forbidden to tell you whom to vote for -- it is against the law to discriminate based on political affiliation , Race , creed , religion , etc .
Please vote who you think will serve your Interests the best .
However , let me tell you some little tidbits of fact which might help you decide what is in your best interest .
First , while it is easy to spew rhetoric that casts employers against employees , you have to understand that for every business owner there is a back story .
This back story is often neglected and overshadowed by what you see and hear .
Sure , you see me park my Mercedes outside .
You 've seen my big home at last years Christmas party .
I 'm sure all these flashy icons of luxury conjure up some idealized thoughts about my life .
However , what you do n't see is the back story .
I started this company 12 years ago .
At that time , I lived in a 300 square foot studio apartment for 3 years .
My entire living space was converted into an office so I could put forth 100 % effort into building a company , which by the way , would eventually employ you .
My diet consisted of Ramen Pride noodles because every dollar I spent went back into this company .
I drove a rusty Toyota Corolla with a defective transmission .
I did n't have time to date .
Often times , I stayed home on weekends , while my friends went out drinking and partying .
In fact , I was married to my business -- hard work , discipline , and sacrifice .
Meanwhile , my friends got jobs .
They worked 40 hours a week and made a modest $ 50 K a year and spent every dime they earned .
They drove flashy cars and lived in expensive homes and wore fancy designer clothes .
Instead of hitting the Nordstrom 's for the latest hot fashion item , I was trolling through the Goodwill store extracting any clothing item that did n't look like it was birthed in the 70's .
My friends refinanced their mortgages and lived a life of luxury .
I , however , did not .
I put my time , my money , and my life into a business with a vision that eventually , some day , I too , will be able to afford these luxuries my friends supposedly had .
So , while you physically arrive at the office at 9 am , mentally check in at about noon , and then leave at 5 pm , I do n't .
There is no " off " button For me .
When you leave the office , you are done and you have a weekend all to yourself .
I unfortunately do not have the freedom .
I eat , **** , and breathe this company every minute of the day .
There is no rest .
There is no weekend .
There is no happy hour .
Every day this business is attached to me like a 1 day old baby .
You , of course , only see the fruits of that garden -- the nice house , the Mercedes , the vacations ...
You never realize the back story and the sacrifices I 've made .
Now , the economy is falling apart and I , the guy that made all the right decisions and saved his money , have to bail - out all the people who did n't .
The people that overspent their paychecks suddenly feel entitled to the same luxuries that I earned and sacrificed a decade of my life for .
Yes , business ownership has is benefits but the price I 've paid is steep and not without wounds .
Unfortunately , the cost of running this business , and employing you , is starting to eclipse the threshold of marginal benefit and let me tell you why : I am being taxed to death and the government thinks I do n't pay enough .
I have state taxes .
Federal taxes .
Property taxes .
Sales and use taxes .
Payroll taxes .
Workers compensation taxes .
Unemployment taxes .
Taxes on taxes .
I have to hire a tax man to manage all these taxes and then guess what ?
I have to pay taxes for employing him .
Government mandates and regulations and all the accounting that goes with it , now occupy most of my time .
On Oct 15th , I wrote a check to the US Treasury for $ 288,000 for quarterly taxes .
You know what my " stimulus " check was ?
Zero. Nada .
Zilch .
The question I have is this :
Who is stimulating the economy ?
Me , the guy who has provided 14 people good paying jobs and serves over 2,200,000 people per year with a flourishing business ?
Or , the single mother sitting at home pregnant with her fourth child waiting for her next welfare check ?
Obviously , government feels the latter is the economic stimulus of this country .
The fact is , if I deducted ( Read : Stole ) 50 % of your paycheck you 'd quit and you would n't work here .
I mean , why should you ?
That 's nuts .
Who wants to get rewarded only 50 % of their hard work ?
Well , I agree which is why your job is in jeopardy .
Here is what many of you do n't understand ; to stimulate the economy you need to stimulate what runs the economy .
Had suddenly government mandated to me that I did n't need to pay taxes , guess what ?
Instead of depositing that $ 288,000 into the Washington black - hole , I would have spent it , hired more employees , and generated substantial economic growth .
My employees would have enjoyed the wealth of that tax cut in the form of promotions and better salaries .
But you can forget it now .
When you have a comatose man on the verge of death , you do n't defibrillate and shock his thumb thinking that will bring him back to life , do you ?
Or , do you defibrillate his heart ?
Business is at the heart of America and always has been .
To restart it , you must stimulate it , not kill it .
Suddenly , the power brokers in Washington believe the mud of America are the essential drivers of the American economic engine .
Nothing could be further from the truth and this is the type of change you can keep .
So where am I going with all this ?
It 's quite simple .
If any new taxes are levied on me , or my company , my reaction will be swift and simple .
I fire you .
I fire your co-workers .
You can then plead with the government to pay for your mortgage , your SUV , and your child 's future .
Frankly , it is n't my problem any more .
Then , I will close this company down , move to another country , and retire .
You see , I 'm done .
I 'm done with a country that penalizes the productive and gives to the unproductive .
My motivation to work and to provide jobs will be destroyed , and with it , will be my citizenship .
While tax cuts to 95 % of America sounds great on paper , do n't forget the backstory :
If there is no job , there is no income to tax .
A tax cut on zero dollars is zero .
So , when you make decision to vote , ask yourself , who understands the economics of business ownership and who does n't ?
Whose policies will endanger your job ?
Answer those questions and you should know who might be the one capable of saving your job .
While the media wants to tell you " It 's the economy Stupid " I 'm telling you it is n't .
If you lose your job , it wo n't be at the hands of the economy ; it will be at the hands of a political hurricane that swept through this country , steamrolled the Constitution , and will have changed its landscape forever .
If that happens , you can find me in South Caribbean sitting on a beach , retired , and with no employees to worry about .

theatlantic :
Tea party polling has been an inexact science , and data like these have been used to count ( inaccurately ) how many people are involved in the movement .
Pollsters have gotten more specific at times , asking whether people are members of tea parties , and then asking those people what they think of things , but even self - identification does n’t seem too reliable to me .
What this suggests , however , is that the movement has lost some of its draw .
I ’m not one to overblow the sampled responses of 1,504 adults reached by phone between Feb. 22 and March 1 ( which is what these numbers reflect ) , even if Pew is one of the more respected polling entities around .
But agreement with the movement — and whatever it signifies to each individual respondent — has dropped by more than a third since September , according to Pew …and that seems to be saying something .

This is part 6 of a 7 part guide on how to start a small business .
In this lesson , you ’ll learn about small business accounting and bookkeeping .
Probably the most boring and tedious part of running a business is keeping track of earnings , expenses and maintaining “ the books ” .
For me personally , I hate tallying up the numbers and documenting all of my expenditures , mileage etc …
Hell , I have enough problems making sure that my checking account is balanced every month !
But over the past few years running our online wedding business , I have come to realize that while keeping accurate numbers is boring , analyzing the numbers is actually fun and eye opening !
That ’s why I let my wife take care of the books while I just look at the reports : )
Rather than bore you to death defining mundane accounting terminology or explaining the nitty gritty of accounting and bookkeeping , I thought that it would be more interesting to let you in on how we keep track of and utilize the data we maintain for our online wedding linens business .
Two Main Ways To Keep The Books
First off , there two main ways to maintain your books , the cash method and the accrual method .
In general , a business that carries inventory must use the accrual method of accounting which is why we use this method for our wedding linens business .
What this means is that income and expenses are treated and taxed when it is earned rather than when the money is actually received .
For our wedding linens business , let ’s say that I received a $ 10000 deposit in 2009 to make 100 dozen handkerchiefs for a customer to be delivered in 2010 .
Under the accrual method , I ca n’t declare this money as income in 2009 because I have n’t delivered yet .
Conversely , if I need to spend $ 2000 dollars upfront on the materials in 2009 , I must take this as an expense in 2009 and not 2010 .
The opposite of accrual accounting is called cash accounting in which income and expenses are taken when things are actually paid for .
In general , the cash method is only used for service oriented businesses but can be used for any business that is unincorporated and has annual receipts of less than a million bucks .
The cash method is a more intuitive way of keeping track of the books because it represents an accurate assessment of your cashflow .
Why does all of this matter ?
Because the IRS says so .
We chose the accrual method because my wife used to use the accrual method while working as a financial analyst for a Fortune 500 company .
How We Track Expenses
The way we keep track of expenses is extremely high tech and requires a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering to implement .
In our office , we have 3 bins .
One bin is labeled entertainment , one bin is labeled cash expenses and the third one is labeled assets .
Whenever we travel , go out to eat or spend any money on entertainment , we throw our receipts into the “ entertainment ” bin .
The date and amount is usually already printed on the receipt but on the back , we also jot down the business purpose and the business relationship with the person we are entertaining .
This extra information is important in case you ever get audited .
Whenever we make a business related expense outside of entertainment , we throw the receipt into the “ cash ” bin .
This includes things like office supplies , ISP bills , internet charges , thread etc …
Finally , the third bin is reserved for business expenses that fall under the category of capital equipment or furniture .
Leafing through this bin right now , we have a receipt in there for a sewing machine , a desk chair and some computer equipment .
Basically , anything in this bin is an asset that might potentially need to be depreciated over time .
Under normal circumstances though , we do n’t have to depreciate anything thanks to section 179 ( You can read about section 179 in our small business taxes article ) .
In each of our cars , we carry a notebook where we jot down the number of miles we ’ve driven on behalf of our business .
For each entry , we make sure to write down the date , the beginning odometer reading , the ending odometer reading and the place that we drove to .
Each mile is worth around 50 cents ( check the IRS for the exact deduction ) , so we make sure we write down every last mile .
For more information on how to expense a vehicle , please refer to my article on How To Deduct Your Vehicle On Your Taxes .
How We Track Income
All of our income is tracked automatically in our shopping cart software .
At the end of the month , our website creates a report itemizing everything that we sold , at what price and to which customer .
Our shopping cart also lists any related fees associated with each transaction such as paypal fees , credit card fees and shipping fees .
My wife then takes this data and imports this information into her master spreadsheet which includes the cost of goods and other information extracted from our receipts in the expense bins .
Everything outside of manually entering and scanning expense data from receipts is more or less completely automated .
What We Do With The Data
The fun part about having all of this data is that you can use it to recognize trends with your business .
Here are some of the useful ways we use the data that we gather from our business numbers .
Pricing – Every quarter , we analyze our top selling products to see if there are any obvious trends .
At this time , we also play around with the prices a little bit by increasing prices of items that are selling well and reducing the prices of products that are n’t moving that well .
By analyzing the results of our pricing experiments , we then make corresponding adjustments .
It ’s an iterative process , but over time we can usually get a good idea what the optimal pricing sweet spot is for the majority of our products .

Seasonality – Certain items in our store sell better during certain times of the year .
For example during Thanksgiving , sales of our linen napkins go through the roof .
We discover these trends by creating product trend graphs with our numbers .
By analyzing these graphs , we know when to stock up on certain items during certain times of the year so we can carry less inventory .

Reducing Taxes –
By knowing the finances inside and out for our business , we can usually make well timed purchases .
For example , if our business profits are especially high for the year , we will sometimes push up the timetable for some of our purchases .
Depending on our profit level , I might decide to go ahead and upgrade my computer or purchase that laptop a little bit early to offset our business earnings .

Avoiding Tax Penalties –
By keeping track of our profit level , we can make sure that we do n’t get penalized come tax time .
Since I have a full time job , my wife and I do n’t actually pay estimated taxes for our business at the present time .
Instead , I increase the withholdings from my paycheck in order to cover the tax bill for the business .
Keeping accurate profit / loss statements are essential in order for me to know how much to withhold .

Demographic Data –
By analyzing our sales , we ’ve noticed that many of our customers live in specific areas of the United States .
While we do n’t currently use this data , we might choose to launch demographic based advertising in the future to target local customer sweet spots .

Experimentation – Keeping accurate numbers allows us to see the direct effect of any experiments we choose to run .
For example , last year we added cross selling to our list of strategies and noticed a quantifiable increase in order size .
Sometime in the future , I plan on implementing a plugin to recover lost sales and keeping accurate data will allow us to analyze the impact on our top line

We are currently looking into hiring an answering service to take some of our phone orders .
Since we keep track of all of our phone conversations including time , date and length of call , we can easily make an accurate assessment of how much it ’s going to cost us and whether outsourcing makes economic sense .

Dr. Sarah Myhill , MD , is a UK - based fatigue specialist focused on nutrition and preventive medicine .
This article , from her educational patient website , was updated in June 2009 .*
_________
There is a general belief that a high fat diet results in high cholesterol , which results in arterial and heart disease .
This is a myth put about by the food and pharmaceutical companies to promote low fat foods and cholesterol lowering drugs .
There is n’t a scrap of evidence to support this theory – indeed the single largest culprits in arterial disease are sugars and refined carbohydrates .
Cholesterol is an essential molecule without which we would all be dead .
It is the raw material from which many essential molecules are made , including :
• Hormones , in particular the adrenal and sex hormones ,
• Vitamin D ( which is highly protective against cancer and heart disease ) ,
• Serotonin receptors ( which help protect us against depression ) ,
• Bile salts ( essential for digesting foods ) , and so on .
The highest concentrations of cholesterol are found in breast milk , where it is essential for infant nourishment .
Cholesterol comes into play in healing and repair of blood vessels .
Blood vessels have a delicate lining and are at the mercy of turbulent blood flow .
Turbulence is created where blood vessels divide and blood pressure is high .
In this event the lining becomes damaged and has to be repaired .
The first sign of repair is a fatty streak , then plaque formation and plaque stabilization .
This process involves LDL ( ‘ bad ’ cholesterol ) and HDL ( ‘ good ’ cholesterol ) .
Simplistically :
• LDL lays down the fat ,
• And HDL carries fatty lumps away .
• It is the ratio between the two which is important .
So do not be satisfied with just being told that your total cholesterol is whatever – the important result is the ratio between the good cholesterol and the bad cholesterol .
[ Roughly , above 60 mg / dL HDL and below 100 LDL is desired .
Determined by a Lipid Profile Test ( 1 ) ]
The first clue that this may be a problem is the total cholesterol , but in every case one needs a breakdown .
Causes of a high total cholesterol with poor ratio include :
1. Borderline Hypothyroidism
Indeed , 30 years ago a raised cholesterol was almost routinely treated with thyroid hormones .
See “ Hypothyroidism . ” [ Thyroid Profile Test ( 2 ) ]
2. Vitamin D Deficiency
Cholesterol is the raw material which , through the action of sunshine on the skin , is converted to vitamin D .
If the body perceives the deficiency in vitamin D3 – and this is almost universal in our low sunshine climate – then the liver pushes out more cholesterol so that when sunshine does land on the skin there is plenty of substrate for vitamin D3 to be made .
Vitamin D3 deficiency is itself a major risk factor for arterial disease . [ 25 - Hydroxy Vitamin D Test , aka 25 ( OH ) D. ]
3. Vitamin B3 Deficiency
B3 ( niacin ) is essential for the metabolism of cholesterol , and deficiencies are common .
Niacin is found in high protein foods , milk , mushrooms , greens , ‘ enriched ’ breads / cereals .
The converse is also true – high levels of vitamin B3 bring cholesterol levels down .
The only problem is that the supplemental form of B3 which does this has a tendency to cause flushing .
The body does acclimatize to this , and one needs to start off with small doses such as 100 mgs three times daily and build up gradually .
4. Copper Deficiency
There is an inverse relationship between cholesterol levels and copper – so the higher the copper in the blood ( so long as it is in the normal range ) the lower the cholesterol , and vice versa .
Copper rich foods include nuts , split peas , liver , meat , butter .
The best test of copper is to measure superoxide dismutase [ SODase Test ( 3 ) ] , since this is a good functional test of copper and incidentally zinc levels .
Zinc , associated with immunity , fertility , behavioral health , is obtained in meats , nuts , egg yolk and is often low in vegetarians or people on low protein diets .

A high cholesterol with poor ratio of HDL / LDL may be a symptom of arterial damage .
That is to say , cholesterol is being mobilized for healing and repair .
So anything which damages arteries will cause a secondary rise in LDL cholesterol .
Things to consider would be :
• Diet .
Dairy is pro-inflammatory , refined carbohydrates are high glycemic index .
Try a Stoneage Diet , which emphasizes vegetables , nuts & seeds , meat , fish and eggs , low carb fruits such as berries .
A Stoneage Diet helps prevent obesity and diabetes .
• Stress – lack of sleep , high adrenaline lifestyle , lack of exercise .
• Poor antioxidant status .
Results in excessive inflammatory reactions .
See “ Antioxidants and Free Radicals – What They Are and What They Do . ”
• Poisoning by heavy metals , pollution – damages artery walls directly .
Any or all of the above could result in high blood pressure .
See “ A Primer on Blood Pressure . ”
The Problem with Statin Drugs
The main problem with statins is they make too much money for drug companies and therefore are mindlessly promoted .
The interesting thing about statins is that they do reduce one ’s risk of many diseases , but the degree to which they protect one is not commensurate with the degree to which they reduce cholesterol levels .
We now know the reason why .
Statins are vitamin D mimics – they look exactly like vitamin D and have many of vitamin D’s beneficial effects .
Vitamin D evolved because sunshine is very pro-inflammatory and vitamin D is very anti-inflammatory .
Ability to make vitamin D in the skin in response to sunshine allows people to tolerate the inflammatory effects of sunshine .
This anti-inflammatory effect spreads through the whole body .
Many degenerative diseases of ageing are associated with inflammation , and vitamin D protects against this .
Therefore it is highly protective against arterial disease , heart disease , cancer , autoimmunity ( including multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes ) , neurodegenerative conditions , osteoporosis , allergies , and so on .
However , statins inhibit two important enzyme systems .
• Firstly statins inhibit formation of Coenzyme Q 10 .
This is the most important antioxidant inside the mitochondria ( cellular energy factories ) , and the main acceptor and donor of electrons .
If Coenzyme Q 10 formation is inhibited [ Coenzyme Q 10 Test ( 4 ) ] this means that mitochondrial function will go slow and the aging process will be accelerated .
There is now good evidence to show that poor mitochondrial function is a central part of chronic fatigue syndrome , and this explains why statins almost invariably make patients with chronic fatigue worse .
( See the recent article by Dr. Myhill and colleagues , “ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Mitochondrial Dysfunction . ”
In conjunction with this work , they developed a Mitochondrial Function Test ( 5 ) . )
• Statins also inhibit formation of selenium based - proteins such as glutathione peroxidase .
This is one of the most important antioxidants in the blood .
It is a combination of the above two factors which explains the devastating effect statins have on muscle metabolism in some people .
People get obvious muscle soreness , stiffness , weakness and fatigability .
Heart muscle is little different from normal muscle , so it is no wonder that the heart is also affected , and this can result in heart failure .
In fact there is now good evidence to suggest that it is statins that are responsible for the epidemic of heart failure due to heart muscle disease that we are now seeing clinically .

Pour ne pas être reconnu par les systèmes automatisés d’identification biométrique , le héros de Minority Report se faisait transplanter de nouveaux yeux .
L’histoire se passait en 2054 .
Suivant la même logique , le tiers des demandeurs d’asile reçus aux permanences de la sous - préfecture de Calais en ce début d’année 2009 se mutilent eux aussi les doigts , afin d’en « effacer » leurs empreintes digitales …
Le phénomène est bien connu , tant par les policiers , les autorités que par les ONG qui viennent en aide aux réfugiés , mais personne ou presque n’en avait parlé , et aucun article de presse ou billet de blog n’y avait expressément été consacré .
Le Monde Diplomatique , dans sa « valise diplomatique « , vient de m’en offrir l’opportunité : pour éviter d’être identifiés par les policiers , et donc « reconduits » dans le pays où ils ont préalablement été arrêtés - et où leurs empreintes ont donc déjà été fichées - , un grand nombre de réfugiés préfèrent brûler leurs doigts au fer rouge , avec des clous chauffés à blanc , de l’acide sulfurique ou de produits chimiques plus ou moins divers , des rasoirs de type « Bic « , du plastique ou du papier de verre , pour éviter de « voir leur corps se transformer en un élément qui joue en leur défaveur « …

En 2003 , les Big Brother Awards ( dont je suis ) avaient nominé la société Steria , en charge du volet biométrique du système Eurodac ( lui aussi nominé cette année - là ) , une base de données biométrique - ou , plus précisément « décadactylaire » ( les dix doigts plus la paume ) - répertoriant , au 31 décembre 2007 , 1 005 323 ( .doc , .pdf ) demandeurs d’asile et immigrants clandestins - de 14 ans , au moins …
Steria vantait alors l’exceptionelle efficacité de son système , « capable de traiter 500 000 comparaisons par seconde avec un taux de précision de 99,9 % « .
Depuis , le règlement européen Dublin II a permis de mettre à éxécution la procédure de « réadmission » de ceux qui ont préalablement été fichés .
Le taux d’erreurs ( .pdf ) ?
6 %…
40 180 réfugiés ont ainsi été identifiés entre 2003 et 2005 , mais seuls 16 842 ont pu être « réadmis » dans le pays ( généralement la Grèce , ou l’Italie ) qui les avait préalablement fichés .
58 % des réfugiés fichés ont donc réussi à échapper à la procédure de « réadmission « , pour la simple et bonne raison qu’une fois identifiés , nombreux sont ceux qui préfèrent prendre la poudre d’escampette plutôt que d’être « expulsés « …
D’un autre côté , ces mutilations ne servent pas à grand chose …
Non seulement les empreintes digitales se reforment assez rapidement , entraînant certains réfugiés à se brûler les doigts « environ une fois par mois « , mais elles n’empêchent pas forcément non plus les policiers de les identifier , ne serait - ce que parce qu’ils peuvent aussi être reconnus par les empreintes de leurs paumes … entraînant les réfugiés à se brûler , non seulement les doigts , mais aussi l’intérieur de leurs mains .
« No comment » ( Grand Prix du Documentaire au Festival International du Film des Droits de l’Homme de Paris en 2009 ) , réalisé en 2008 par Nathalie Loubeyre et Joël Labat et consacré aux migrants cherchant , depuis Calais , à atteindre le Royaume - Uni , montrait comment les réfugiés se mutilent les doigts , au fer rouge , ou au papier de verre - séquences qu’ils m’ont autorisé à mettre en ligne :
En août 2008 , Julie Rebouillat , du collectif de photo - reporters Contre - faits , publiait cette photo :
Continuellement , un feu est gardé allumé .
Il permet de chauffer l’eau ( pour le thé , la lessive ou la toilette ) , mais également d’y faire brûler des barres en fer avec lesquelles les migrants se mutilent le bout des doigts pour effacer leurs empreintes digitales .

J’ai donc vu passer des centaines des milliers de projets , technologies et politiques orwelliennes … et les Big Brother Awards avaient nominé Steria , et Eurodac , dès 2003 …
Il n’empêche : d’aucuns pourront peut - être trouver cela « bizarre « , d’autant que les autorités - tout comme les ONG - trouvent presque cela « normal » ( au vu des nombreux autres problèmes qu’ils rencontrent ou suscitent « par ailleurs « ) , mais la révélation de ces mutilations est l’une de rares informations qui m’ait vraiment choqué ces derniers mois …

NB : l’expulsion de la « jungle » de Calais a permis à d’autres journalistes d’évoquer ces mutilations , qui viennent ainsi d’être évoquées dans l’émission Interception sur France Inter ce dimanche 20 septembre , ainsi que dans le Canard Enchaîné du mercredi 23 septembre , sous la plume de Dominique Simonnot :
Leurs doigts sont lisses , leurs paumes aussi .
Empreintes effacées , brûlées .

La technique de gommage est simple : « En Lybie , on les a cramés sur du plastique , rapporte un Ethiopien , mais ça colle et ça pue , les flics de Kadhafi l’ont senti tout de suite et nous ont battus ! »

– Je brûlerai mes pieds !
– Ils prendront ton oreille , c’est unique aussi …
– Je les couperai… »
Voir aussi l’effarant récit , que je découvre , et qu’en avait fait Lily en février dernier :
Le menu du moment pour des dublinisables érythréens d’Italie… , et qui montre également comment les autorités se jouent de la loi , fichent ( ou pas ) les réfugiés , et se servent ( ou pas ) de leurs empreintes digitales …
Kafkaien :
Voir des hommes et des femmes se brûler les doigts sur du fer rougi par les braises n’est pas une image facile à oublier .
Comprendre pourquoi ils en sont arrivés à faire ça est encore moins facile à avaler .
Souvent dans la jungle , on entend : « _Ha !
je vais me couper les doigts !
_ Ils prendront la paume de ta main .
Je me couperai la main .
_ Ils prendront tes pieds .
Je me les couperai .
Ils prendront ta rétine . »

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A broad healthcare overhaul emerged unscathed on Friday from the first week of Senate committee debate , with Chairman Max Baucus keeping fellow Democrats in line and shielding key elements from Republican attacks .

Four days of sometimes contentious battle in the Democratic - controlled Senate Finance Committee left the main tenets of Baucus ’s bill untouched and gave reform advocates hope that Republican Senator Olympia Snowe would back the final version .
Snowe , a member of the bipartisan “ Gang of Six ” negotiators who failed to reach agreement on the plan before the panel ’s debate , was the only Republican to cross over and side with Democrats on several votes during the week .
Her support would be a big step toward winning approval in the full 100 - member Senate , where Democrats have little margin for error with a 60 - vote majority -- exactly the number needed to clear Republican procedural hurdles .
“ The battle lines are taking shape , ” said Len Nichols , director of the health policy program at the New America Foundation .
“ The Democrats appear very disciplined , and it ’s pretty clear that Snowe might still support this thing -- which is what they need . ”
Baucus ’s proposal , one of five healthcare bills pending in Congress , closely mirrors President Barack Obama ’s plans to rein in costs , tighten regulations on insurers and expand coverage to many of the 46 million uninsured people living in the United States .
Baucus won every key fight during the first week of debate .
He protected the White House ’s $ 80 billion deal with drugmakers and kept Democrats together to preserve an individual requirement to buy insurance and reject Republican efforts to block some cuts in the Medicare insurance program for seniors .
Baucus had brought his fellow Democrats on board before the debate by incorporating into the bill a package of Democratic amendments aimed at making insurance reforms more affordable for workers .
Snowe crossed party lines to support Baucus on the vote on the individual insurance mandate and on other votes , but the other Republican “ Gang of Six ” negotiators -- Charles Grassley and Mike Enzi -- stayed in the Republican camp .
IN SEARCH OF A BREAKTHROUGH
“ They need a breakthrough moment where they find some middle ground , and I still think at the end of the day they will find it , ” Bob Blendon , a health policy and political analyst at Harvard University , said of lawmakers working on healthcare .
“ There is no reason for people who are going to move over and compromise to do it early , ” Blendon said .
“ You have your maximum advantage by taking your time .
The people who are going to compromise have n’t done it yet . ”
The Senate panel renews debate on Tuesday with a battle over Democratic amendments to add a government - run “ public ” insurance option in the bill -- the only one of the five pending healthcare measures in Congress without it .
The public option is favored by Obama as a way to create competition and lower insurance costs , but critics say it could undermine the private insurance industry .
Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and John Rockefeller , who will bring up the public option in committee , say it may have a hard time passing the more conservative Senate Finance panel but will have stronger backing in the full Senate and House of Representatives .
“ The committee is what starts the debate and gets people thinking , ” Schumer told reporters .
“ As the process moves on , for the public option and for some other things , it gets better and better . ”
In the House , where Speaker Nancy Pelosi has promised a final bill will include a public option , Democratic leaders met on Friday to work on blending the chamber ’s three pending bills into one measure for floor action .
They said they were making progress on trimming the total cost to $ 900 billion -- all three bills were at $ 1 trillion or more .
“ We are narrowing the number of issues we have to deal with , ” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters .
She said they were looking at proposals in the two Senate committees , including a tax on high - cost insurance policies included in the Finance bill .
She said no decisions had been reached and the group would meet again next week .

Although exercise is good for your health , extreme exercise may be physically addicting .
Rats given a drug that produces withdrawal in heroin addicts went into withdrawal after running excessively in exercise wheels , according to new research .
Rats that ran the hardest had the most severe withdrawal symptoms .
The scientists who conducted the study reason that if excessive exercise is addicting , then maybe , to feel good , addicts could take moderate exercise instead of drugs .
The findings also shed light on the potentially fatal eating disorder called anorexia athletica , in which exercise undertaken to shed pounds becomes as compulsive as taking drugs , resulting in even greater weight loss .
" Excessive running shares similarities with drug - taking behavior , " the researchers wrote in the August issue of Behavioral Neuroscience , published by the American Psychological Association .
For those looking for an excuse to hit the couch , however , this study looked at excessive , not moderate , exercise .
" As with food intake and other parts of life , moderation seems to be the key .
Exercise , as long as it does n't interfere with other aspects of one 's life , is a good thing with respect to both physical and mental health , " said lead author Robin Kanarek , PhD , of Tufts University .
For several weeks , 44 male and 40 female rats were allowed to either run in exercise wheels or remain inactive .
To simulate anorexia athletica , the researchers divided the active and inactive rats into groups whose members were either given food for one hour a day or around the clock .
Rats in all four groups were then given naloxone , a medicine for heroin overdose that produces immediate withdrawal symptoms .
Active and inactive rats responded very differently to naloxone , which was given in proportion to their weight .
The active rats showed withdrawal symptoms like those seen in narcotics addicts : trembling , writhing , teeth chattering , and drooping eyelids .
The active rats who had access to food for only one hour a day both ran the most and displayed the most severe withdrawal symptoms .
Like people with anorexia athletica , they ran so much that they lost significant amounts of weight .
Additionally , the more a given rat had run , the worse its withdrawal symptoms after naloxone .
In contrast , regardless of how much they ate , inactive rats responded very little to the drug .
Because of the way the active rats responded to naloxone , they seemed to have undergone the same changes in the brain 's reward system as rats addicted to drugs .
" Exercise , like drugs of abuse , leads to the release of neurotransmitters such as endorphins and dopamine , which are involved with a sense of reward , " noted Kanarek .
Insights into behaviors that trigger the release of the brain 's " reward " chemicals may lead to addiction treatments that incorporate moderate exercise , according to the researchers .
The findings also suggest that active rats given limited food may make a good experimental model for studying and developing treatments for anorexia athletica , added Kanarek .
Because rats and humans share many nervous - system traits , researchers frequently carry laboratory findings like these out into the real world .

The park should have been right there .
A long set of stairs , leading through a children ’s playground to a track where Krishna Gurung was planning to jog .
She was running every day now , trying to lose the twenty pounds she had gained since coming to New York from Nepal .
She looked around in frustration .
It was seven o’clock on a Friday morning and raining again , as it had been for what seemed like weeks .
Who knew the U.S. had a rainy season ?
No matter — she would jog with an umbrella .
The 53 - year - old Krishna had come here , to Woodside , Queens , to visit her daughter Anu , whom she had n’t seen since Anu moved to the States twelve years ago .
Krishna had been here for a couple of months now , and Anu and her husband , Shyam , had taken her on family outings around Manhattan and down to Washington , D.C. Krishna ’s native Pokhara is a city of 200,000 , but New York was a different story .
Krishna spoke no English ; her tongue refused to form those mushy R’s and meowing vowels .
Even the street and building numbers had to be translated for her .
The Nepali language has its own way of writing numbers , insidiously close to ours but not identical .
The numeral 1 looks like 9 , 4 like 8 , 5 like 4 .
To help keep Krishna safe , Anu and Shyam had defined a kind of comfort zone for her .
Roosevelt Avenue , shaded by the elevated track of the 7 train , formed its southern boundary , and Broadway the northern one .
The house , on 62nd Street , represented the area ’s westernmost point ; the intersection of Roosevelt Avenue and Broadway ( the two streets merge ) its eastern one .
The area spans less than twenty blocks , and as long as the 7 - train tracks were in sight , Krishna could find her way home by following them .
Anu had also outfitted her mother with an emergency kit : a cell phone with the home number preprogrammed , some cash , and a laminated card with Anu ’s home address in English on top .
The park with the jogging track sits on a green hill on Woodside Avenue at 54th Street , a fifteen - minute walk from Anu and Shyam ’s house .
There is basically one turn required to get there — a right on Roosevelt .
But something — the early hour , the rain — disoriented Krishna .
She followed 62nd Street toward Roosevelt Avenue , as intended , and that ’s where she made her mistake .
Instead of turning right , toward the park , she turned left .
Believing she could n’t get lost if she kept the train tracks in sight , Krishna marched on .
When she arrived at the corner where Roosevelt meets Broadway , she recognized it as the eastern tip of the safety zone .
If she turned left there , she could be home in ten minutes .
But left was now right , and Krishna turned in the wrong direction , spinning out of the neighborhood .
She was confused now .
The avenue looked familiar , but only in the sense that it looked like every other avenue .
The city was like a mountain range , cartoon - simple from a distance , indecipherably complex up close .
After a bit of wandering , Krishna passed a Hindu temple , Satya Narayan Mandir on Woodside Avenue , where Anu had once taken her .
Krishna was Buddhist , despite her name , but spoke Hindi well .
There were people inside the temple who could have helped her , yet the sight of it only strengthened Krishna ’s feeling that she was close to home and did n’t need help .
She looked around , saw a distant bridge that resembled the elevated 7 - train tracks , and set off for it .
What Krishna thought was the train trestle was actually the BQE overpass .
She crossed under it and walked alongside Queens Boulevard .
She marveled at the garish colors of Pop Diner and was briefly startled by a lifelike , if green , deer statue in front of the nearby Queens Borough Elks Lodge .
But all these new sights did n’t quite add up , and Krishna did n’t know what to do .
She had left the house wearing American jogging clothes — later to be described on a missing flyer as a burgundy top , black velvet track pants , and white sneakers with blue and yellow stripes .
She was also wearing a $ 1,000 gold chain around her neck , $ 4,000 worth of gold bracelets on her right arm , and a pair of bulky gold earrings ( Nepalese women tend to wear their wealth ) .
What she did n’t bother to bring was the preprogrammed cell phone or address card Anu had given her .
Or cash , a credit card , or any I.D.
It was past 8 a.m. now , and Krishna was gradually coming to terms with an undeniable set of facts .
She was thousands of miles from home , unable to communicate with anyone , alone , without money , and hopelessly , utterly lost .
Krishna is a Gurkha , a member of a Nepalese people famed for its tireless trackers and fearless soldiers .
The British had used Gurkha battalions since 1817 , and still do .
Even in the modern U.K. , their regimental heraldry includes a fully functional kukri knife .
She was n’t scared , not yet anyway , so much as determined .
She was faced with a task and set out to accomplish it : I ’m going to find home .
She wandered the stretch of Queens Boulevard for a time , poking around side streets with alien names like Jacobus and Ireland .
Krishna still believed
Anu ’s home was just around the corner .
In reality , she was now in Elmhurst and heading toward LeFrak City .
Krishna knew the word home .
She also knew help — Anu had taught it to her as part of her emergency - training boot camp .
Somehow , from the depths of memory , a third word appeared : mistake .
Perhaps these words could be fashioned into something useful .
“ Help , mistake , home . ”
No , even better : “ Help , home , mistake . ”
This could work .
She approached a friendly looking man with it , but he recoiled .
Am I saying it right ?
“ Help , home , mistake . ”
She tried it again , on a woman with a small child , but got the same reaction , plus a few unintelligible words over the shoulder as the woman speed - walked away , pushing her stroller .
This was hopeless .
Even if someone understood her , she would n’t be able to understand the response .
At about 10 a.m. , Krishna saw two girls in tracksuits and sneakers , walking purposefully in front of her down Queens Boulevard .
She concluded they were going jogging in the same park she had been headed for .
The scale of the city was still incomprehensible to her — she did n’t even ponder the idea that there could be other parks .
So she followed the girls around the corner and down Grand Avenue , for a dozen blocks .
When Krishna began to lose faith in the effort , a promising thatch of greenery appeared in front of her , and she hurried toward it .
But it was n’t a park .
It was a Catholic cemetery .
Shocked by the size of it , Krishna missed the moment when her accidental tour guides abruptly disappeared .
Steeped in the supernatural lore in Nepal , she assumed the two girls were apparitions .
Cemetery ghosts .
She kept walking .
Soon it was past noon .
Her feet were beginning to hurt .
Hunger made itself known .
Having wandered for five hours , she was now nearly five miles away from home and more uncertain than ever of how to find her way back there .
Back in Woodside ,
Anu , who works as an au pair , had awakened around 8 a.m .
By 9 , she knew something was off — her mother should have been back from her jog .
Another hour later , Anu called Shyam , who was at work in New Jersey .
He took the rest of the day off and returned to Queens .
Anu ’s first thought was a robbery gone wrong .
After all , Krishna was wearing all that jewelry .
Anu had never been mugged herself but was convinced , from films , TV , and press , that this sort of thing happens all over the place and to everybody .
“ In New York , ” she says , “ you see this story every time you read the newspaper . ”
Shyam assumed the voice - of - calm role , but Anu was still worried .
Even if there was n’t a robbery , so what ?
Her mother , the mother she had brought all the way here , the mother who had , upon her arrival , essentially become a child — naïve , vulnerable , dependent on her — was gone .
The Gurungs , like many Gurkhas , prefer to exhaust all other options before involving the police , but by 6:30 p.m. the couple had become concerned enough to call 911 .
Almost an hour later , when no one had showed up at the house , they went to the police themselves .
The Gurungs ’ house , it turns out , stands near the border of three precincts , and an hour or so was wasted on jurisdictional back - and - forth .
When the family finally got to the right precinct , they were told the officers were waiting for them at the house .
To Anu ’s shock , the police began by conducting a full - blown search , looking under the bed and into the closets while a detective started by asking if she and her mother had had an argument recently .
At 9 p.m. , the police filed a missing persons report .
They told Anu that they would begin calling hospitals and checking for a Nepalese Jane Doe matching Krishna ’s description .
They suggested the family do the same .
The Gurungs brought with them from Nepal a deep belief in astrology and fortune - telling .
On Friday night , a friend of Anu ’s went to a local fortune - teller , who told her Krishna was “ under water . ”
Anu began to cry .
Shyam tried to convince her that “ under water ” might mean “ in the rain ” — it was , after all , still raining .
But he , too , began to imagine the worst .

Krishna , meanwhile , had spent most of the afternoon gradually wending her way south .
At one point she wound up in Brooklyn .
She then picked up on the same cue that had already betrayed her — the elevated train tracks .
Although Krishna did n’t know it , she was now following the J line back toward Queens .
She still assumed that walking under the trestle would eventually get her home .
As darkness fell , around 8 p.m. , Krishna found herself in East New York .
She walked into the enormous bus depot at the intersection of Jamaica Avenue and Broadway and roamed among empty buses until someone shooed her away .
Several more times she tried to approach people with “ Help , home , mistake . ”
It did n’t do any good .
Later , she wandered up a ramp and onto the Jackie Robinson Parkway .
Cars whizzed by , dangerously fast .
After another bit of walking , she came across a second cemetery .
This one was bigger than her native village .
It seemed bigger than Kathmandu , the capital .
Its size , stretching toward the horizon , made the mind ache : a city of the dead nestled inside a city of the unresponsive living .
She spent hours wandering in the dark , and all she saw were graves .
Anu did n’t sleep that night .
By the morning , she was convinced Krishna was dead .
It was all her fault — dragging her mother to America , tossing her into this vast concrete maze .
Shyam kept telling
Anu that her mother would come home any minute now , but after 24 hours , that was getting harder for anyone to believe .
A burst of hope came directly from Nepal .
Krishna ’s husband , Maita , spooked by , but mistrustful of , the American psychic ’s prediction , went to a different astrologer in Pokhara .
That one saw Krishna “ in a park near the water . ”
This was vastly preferable to the “ under water ” vision .
Maita called Anu and relayed the vision .
The family went searching the East River waterfront .
Krishna told them what she had seen — the city of the dead , the green deer , the ghosts in tracksuits .
Midway through the night , Krishna had found her way out of the cemetery .
Led by the light of a distant McDonald ’s billboard , she walked along the cemetery border , past darkened gas stations and body shops , until she came upon a 24 - hour coffee shop .
The shop was deserted except for a single middle - aged waitress whiling away the graveyard shift behind the counter .
Krishna opened the door , triggering the chime , and sat down in the booth closest to the door .
The waitress offered her a sandwich and a glass of water , but Krishna was too proud to accept food from a stranger .
Could n’t they tell from the gold ?
She was no beggar .
She had a perfectly lovely home ; she just could n’t find it at the moment .
After a moment of silent negotiation with herself , Krishna took the water .
She felt her head grow heavy and dozed off , waking to a rude shove a couple of hours later .
The waitress ’s shift was over .
The man who had come to relieve her yelled at her , probably for letting a vagrant in , and kicked out Krishna .
Krishna slept a little more on a cemetery bench , woke with the sunrise , and decided to retrace her steps , orienting herself by the light from the east to walk north , the direction she believed would lead her home .
A friend of the Gurungs ’ would later report a sighting of her in Ridgewood .
He saw her from afar and did n’t realize she was lost .
By Saturday afternoon , Krishna had gotten herself back on Queens Boulevard .
She looked for the green deer , but could n’t find it , and hatched a new plan .
Off in the distance , about four miles away , the Citigroup tower loomed , the tallest building in the borough .
Krishna decided that the tower marked the city ’s center or main square .
So she marched to Long Island City , narrowly bypassing Woodside on the way .
She ’d been gone now for almost a day and a half .
Just a few blocks north , the clan was pulling together to find one of its own .
The call was put out to the Gurungs all over the United States .
Uncles , aunts , and cousins were streaming in from Boston , Baltimore , Virginia , and South Carolina .
The house on 62nd Street became a center of almost martial operations .
Small teams trawled Woodside , Maspeth , LeFrak City , Hunters Point , Astoria ( where a subset of the Nepalese community resides ) .
Point persons were assigned — Anu , Shyam , Anu ’s sister Babita and Shyam ’s friend Pravakar .
A rotating team of volunteers stayed at Anu and Shyam ’s home , in case Krishna unexpectedly called or came back .
Anu went to the corner store and used the copy machine to print out 500 missing - person flyers in English and Nepali .
Each showed a photo of Krishna taken on the family trip to Washington , D.C. , looking characteristically stoic , with the Capitol in the background .
In Long Island City , Krishna was crushed to find out that the skyscraper she had been marching toward was n’t the city ’s focal point .
A larger , impossibly larger city opened up behind it , across the river — with dozens , hundreds of skyscrapers filling the western horizon .
Exhausted , she made her way to the river and began studying the waterfront .
Later , Krishna could n’t even explain why she thought going over to Manhattan was a good idea that afternoon .
She was grasping for anything even remotely familiar ; Shyam and Anu had taken her to Manhattan over the Queensboro Bridge , so she had a vague notion that they would look for her along the same route .
She soon found a grime - covered bridge and crossed it , but the city on the other side was a bit weird .
It was small , for one thing , and seemed to have only one street .
One of the most notable structures was a huge parking garage .
Krishna dutifully walked around the garage and , having wasted an hour or so , decided to return to Queens .
She made her way back over the bridge , leaving behind what she had initially taken for Manhattan but what was , in fact , Roosevelt Island .
The darkening sky portended another wet night on the streets .
Exhausted , she began looking for a place to sleep .
This is when the hallucinations came .
Krishna began to hear the voices of her daughters , Anu and Babita .
They were speaking from two different directions , Anu into Krishna ’s left ear and Anu ’s sister , Babita , into the right one — they were talking over each other .
Mostly , they just repeated the word mom : “ Ama . ”
With the daughterly din in her head , Krishna moved ahead .
She found a fountain in a small waterfront park and drank .
She found a public restroom in another park and cleaned herself up ( accidentally walking into the men ’s room first ) .
She came upon Astoria Park , where Anu had taken her before , and once again felt a trace of hope that she could regain her compass .
The voices kept going .
Ama. Ama .
Later , she ’d say she heard Shyam ’s voice too , paired with that of Anu ’s , but she would just say that to be nice to her son - in - law .
In the gathering darkness , Krishna left the waterfront and turned east , toward Ditmars - Steinway .
Had the sun not set , she might have seen the flag of Nepal hung in the front yard of one house she passed : another missed shortcut home .
Instead , she wound up at a power plant that sits on the northernmost tip of Astoria .
It looked like the end of the world , a vast landscape of asphalt and silent machinery .
Krishna settled on a concrete bench just outside the fence .
She pulled a piece of cardboard she ’d found under her and fell asleep sitting up , legs crossed , head bowed , her daughters ’ calls growing quieter in her ears until they wafted away .
Forty - eight hours had passed since Krishna had disappeared .
At midnight on Sunday , Anu was on her 40th sleepless hour .
Shyam was beginning to worry for his wife ’s health .
He did n’t know it was possible to cry nonstop for almost two days , that a human body had such a pool of tears to dispense .
On Sunday morning in Pokhara , Maita went to a different astrologer for a second session , taking along Krishna ’s picture for a more accurate reading .
The astrologer studied the photo , concurred that Krishna was “ in the park , ” and added that she was closer than the Gurungs thought .
The search party continued combing Queens .
The birds awakened her .
A flock had perched on a small tree next to the concrete bench , chirping like mad .
It was 5:30 on Sunday morning , and the rain had passed .
The cardboard under Krishna was wet and spongy .
Her feet were swollen , and her sneakers cut into her feet .
She got up and continued walking for six more hours .
She saw a man hose down a car in his front yard and asked him for some water from the hose .
She saw a guard ’s booth at the entrance to a parking lot that said notice in blue and white , an inscription that looked to her like police ; she accosted the man inside , mistaking him for an officer .
When he did n’t respond , it only fortified Krishna ’s newfound belief in the callousness of New Yorkers .
She was now on the verge of losing consciousness .
Even the hallucinations had taken leave of her .
She just walked , putting all her concentration into the very process of moving forward while staying upright .
The direction no longer mattered — it was all the same everywhere .
She would never find home , never see Anu or Babita .
She walked some more .
“ Are you okay ? ”
Did she just miraculously learn English ?
Is that what happens to people at the last flicker of sanity — total understanding ?
No , it was n’t English .
Or Nepali either .
It was the other language she knew but did n’t think useful here — Hindi .
The speaker was a taxi driver .
He had pulled up behind her , stopped the car and was now hanging out of the window , concerned .
Krishna does n’t remember what he looked like .
She does remember thinking , without a shadow of doubt , that he was a god .
She told him so .
“ No , no , ma’am , ” said the driver .
“ I am a man .
Do you know where you live ? ”
“ Woodside ” came to her .
It was n’t much , but it was enough .
“ Woodside , ” she said , “ Woodside .
Woodside .
Woodside . ”
The cabbie knew what she meant — the Nepalese neighborhood .
It was easy to find .
Every other house had a flag in front of it .
He would have taken her directly to Anu ’s home , but as soon as she saw some familiar landmarks — a Chinese fruit vendor and a Sports Authority sign — she asked the driver to stop the car and let her out .
Then she walked the remaining few blocks home .
Anu ’s friend Aarati , manning the home front , heard someone open the door .
A second later , she was frantically mashing buttons on her cell phone .
It was noon on Sunday , 53 hours since Krishna ’s first wrong turn .
Anu , Shyam , and Aarati ’s mother were methodically combing a local park one more time , on the astrologer ’s advice .
When Aarati ’s call came , they ran to Shyam ’s Nissan and sped home .
Anu cried in the park , and she cried in the car , and she cried when she saw her mother for the first time in almost three days .
Then she cried for a few hours more .
When she woke up the next day in her own bed , Krishna told the family what she had seen .
She told them about the city of the dead , the green deer , the ghosts in tracksuits .
Krishna soon confided in her daughter that she ’d like to go back to Nepal , and left for Pokhara six weeks later — well before her visa ran out .
Against all odds , she had developed a mild but persistent claustrophobia .
She spent most of her remaining New York nights sleepless , and would often slip outside in the dark .
She ’d drape a blanket over the top step of the porch and sit there , looking at the night sky and a Buddhist flag flapping on the lawn pole , her head thrumming with the maddening knowledge of the enormity that hid just beyond the corner .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Bats , birds , box turtles , humans and many other animals share at least one thing in common :
They sleep .
Humans , in fact , spend roughly one - third of their lives asleep , but sleep researchers still do n't know why .
According to the journal Science , the function of sleep is one of the 125 greatest unsolved mysteries in science .
Theories range from brain " maintenance " — including memory consolidation and pruning — to reversing damage from oxidative stress suffered while awake , to promoting longevity .
None of these theories are well established , and many are mutually exclusive .
Now , a new analysis by Jerome Siegel , UCLA professor of psychiatry and director of the Center for Sleep Research at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and the Sepulveda Veterans Affairs Medical Center , has concluded that sleep 's primary function is to increase animals ' efficiency and minimize their risk by regulating the duration and timing of their behavior .
The research appears in the current online edition of the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience .
" Sleep has normally been viewed as something negative for survival because sleeping animals may be vulnerable to predation and they can't perform the behaviors that ensure survival , " Siegel said .
These behaviors include eating , procreating , caring for family members , monitoring the environment for danger and scouting for prey .
" So it 's been thought that sleep must serve some as - yet unidentified physiological or neural function that can't be accomplished when animals are awake , " he said .
Siegel 's lab conducted a new survey of the sleep times of a broad range of animals , examining everything from the platypus and the walrus to the echidna , a small , burrowing , egg - laying mammal covered in spines .
The researchers concluded that sleep itself is highly adaptive , much like the inactive states seen in a wide range of species , starting with plants and simple microorganisms ; these species have dormant states — as opposed to sleep — even though in many cases they do not have nervous systems .
That challenges the idea that sleep is for the brain , said Siegel .
" We see sleep as lying on a continuum that ranges from these dormant states like torpor and hibernation , on to periods of continuous activity without any sleep , such as during migration , where birds can fly for days on end without stopping , " he said .
Hibernation is one example of an activity that regulates behavior for survival .
A small animal , Siegel noted , can't migrate to a warmer climate in winter .
So it hibernates , effectively cutting its energy consumption and thus its need for food , remaining secure from predators by burrowing underground .
Sleep duration , then , is determined in each species by the time requirements of eating , the cost - benefit relations between activity and risk , migration needs , care of young , and other factors .
However , unlike hibernation and torpor , Siegel said , sleep is rapidly reversible — that is , animals can wake up quickly , a unique mammalian adaptation that allows for a relatively quick response to sensory signals .
Humans fit into this analysis as well .
What is most remarkable about sleep , according to Siegel , is not the unresponsiveness or vulnerability it creates but rather that ability to reduce body and brain metabolism while still allowing that high level of responsiveness to the environment .
" The often cited example is that of a parent arousing at a baby 's whimper but sleeping through a thunderstorm , " he said .
" That dramatizes the ability of the sleeping human brain to continuously process sensory signals and trigger complete awakening to significant stimuli within a few hundred milliseconds . "
In humans , the brain constitutes , on average , just 2 percent of total body weight but consumes 20 percent of the energy used during quiet waking , so these savings have considerable adaptive significance .
Besides conserving energy , sleep invokes survival benefits for humans too — " for example , " said Siegel , " a reduced risk of injury , reduced resource consumption and , from an evolutionary standpoint , reduced risk of detection by predators . "
" This Darwinian perspective can explain age - related changes in human sleep patterns as well , " he said .
" We sleep more deeply when we are young , because we have a high metabolic rate that is greatly reduced during sleep , but also because there are people to protect us .
Our sleep patterns change when we are older , though , because that metabolic rate reduces and we are now the ones doing the alerting and protecting from dangers . "

Friday , September 4 , 2009
Official United States government data revealed on Friday that the jobless rate in the US rose to 9.7 % last month , with the economy having shed 216,000 jobs .
The unemployment rate is the highest it has been since June 1983 .
According to revised government statistics , 276,000 jobs were lost in July and a further 463,000 in June .
The figures were higher than earlier estimates of 247,000 and 443,000 .
The economy has lost 6.9 million jobs since the recession officially began in December 2007 .
The total number of unemployed in the country is now at 14.9 million .
Nigel Gault , the chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said that the news was not as bad as it seemed , saying that " the decline last month was too good to be true , really .
It 's too early for the unemployment rate to be coming down , of course we 're still losing jobs . "
" What I would take encouragement from is the fact is the trend in the rate of decline in jobs is still improving , that private sector jobs were down 198,000 , that 's 50,000 better than the previous month and it's almost 200,000 better than the month before that , " he said .

Carrie Jones has n't had sex with her husband Hal , a City banker , for the past four years .
Nor does she want to .
Sex is something she can no longer summon the effort to endure - with the man she married , at least .
She admits she stays in her sexless relationship for the sake of her children , aged nine and 11 , and will remain celibate until the day they are grown up and she feels able to leave .
At which point , she confesses , she will probably abandon her husband and begin a sexual odyssey to find the satisfaction that eludes her .
An unusual case ?
A sorry lack of libido ?
She insists not .
" If I thought I was unique in my sexual disappointment I 'd probably be suicidal , " muses Carrie , 45 , a publishing executive , who lives in North London with Hal and their children .
" I remember the first time my girlfriends and I admitted that we all felt the same about married sex as parents : we could n't be bothered with it and felt guilty for not wanting to sleep with our husbands .
It was a revelation .
I remember thinking : ' Thank God !
It 's not just me !'
Scroll down for more ...
" Now I believe there are thousands of other married women who would love to admit sex is n't all it 's cracked up to be .
But , if the constant cliches in women 's magazines and chick - lit are to believed , we should all be enjoying prowess in the boardroom and swooning every night in the bedroom .
" It 's the great taboo that no one dares admit - that sex is often a let - down . "
So convinced is Carrie that her experience of sex in marriage - initially pleasant , dwindling to nothing at all after having children - is a universal one that she has just written a book , under an assumed name , highlighting the disappointment of her sex life .
" It 's a sort of ' Frigid Jones ' Diary ' , " she laughs , though she is not joking .
" I want to break the taboo .
Sex frequently is n't the chandelier - swinging experience that certain authors would have us believe is every woman 's rite of passage .
" For me , the sense of being special to Hal faded away just as it did with previous boyfriends .
I became obsessed with agony columns , poring over letters talking of boring marriages and the temptation of affairs and willing just one agony aunt to advise someone to run off with a lover .
" Of course , they never did .
It was always : ' Go and work at your marriage . '
But I did n't want to work on mine .
I wanted someone to say : ' Actually , perhaps nothing will make you want to sleep with your husband again , ' which is how I feel .
" I 've made my choice .
For now I 'm caught up in marriage 's net , bound up with responsibilities to my children .
My interest in sex with the person I was supposed to be closest to has died .
I could leave but for now I 'll wait because of the desolation it would wreak on my family .
" I want to maintain the family unit because it makes other things possible , like doing things together with the children .
But one day , when they are older and I can think about my own needs again , I may leave and start all over again .
" In the meantime , I want to tell other women that they are not alone in not wanting to have sex with their long - term partners .
I do n't think it 's possible to maintain the passion of the initial chase .
But it does n't mean you wo n't experience those feelings again with someone else . "
She may be considering an extreme - some would say distasteful and selfish - course of action for the future but Carrie 's upbringing was very conventional .
A Cambridge graduate , she was raised in Yorkshire , the only child of teacher parents whose marriage , she says , " was pretty dull " .
She and Hal were introduced by friends when they were both 33 , and she admits that they " clicked brilliantly " .
They had sex up to five times a week before having children .
But like her previous experiences , the longer the relationship lasted , the more disappointing it became .
" The problem is that sex in a long - term relationship inevitably becomes less alluring as domesticity sets in , " she says .
" Hal and I were very well suited in terms of our personalities and common interest in books , music , art and films but we never had the kind of wild , passionate sex that leaves you wanting more .
" Like most successful long - term partnerships , our relationship was n't built on sex or passion .
At best , sex was simply fine . "
But even the " fine " sex Carrie recalls was soon replaced by despondency once the couple 's first child was born .
" I did the middle - class mother thing in a big way , " she says .
" I gave up my career , breast - fed each child for a year and spent my days in a dizzy whirl of playgroups and coffee mornings .
" I 'd flipped from wife to mother , and it gave me excuses - often genuine - to cold - shoulder my husband 's sexual advances .
He knew I was tired from the children and was always very understanding .
He 's an unusually kind and tolerant man . "
Indeed he must be .
Certainly , once the first flush of love and lust gives way to familiarity , domesticity and parenthood , few would argue that making love is the wanton adventure it was .
But Carrie goes one step further .
She believes that marriage and motherhood are simply not conducive to having a sex life at all .
" Providing a stable home for children is totally incompatible with having an exciting sex life .
The two things are violently at odds , " she adds .
" After umpteen years with the same person , sex is bound to get boring .
Some people put themselves first , have affairs or simply leave their marriages in search of sexual adventure .
" I 've chosen to sacrifice sexual thrills in order to do the right thing by my kids . "
But a martyr Carrie is n't , and surely Hal does not feel she is doing the right thing by him .
The couple still share a bed , though physical contact is strictly off limits .
" We 've never discussed the demise of our sex life , " she says .
" It was more a case of reaching a low ebb of energy on my part .
" For a long time I did n't even realise it was the end of marital sex for us .
But when years have passed , you realise it ended a long time ago . "
Unbelievably , her poor , unsuspecting husband is not only unaware of her plans to leave him .
He also , she insists , has no idea that she has written a book or posed for these pictures .
She seems as confident of him not finding out as she is that he is understanding of her feelings .
For when asked whether she worries that Hal may seek sexual gratification elsewhere , she says : " I 'm not concerned .
I do n't think that would happen .
It 's not Hal 's fault that I wish to remain celibate ; it 's nothing he 's said or done .
He 's a good man and a great dad .
It 's just that I do n't want to be intimate with him any more . "
Such cold words must leave her husband reeling ?
She insists not .
" There 's a general understanding between us that I 'm keeping the family unit together , " she says .
" Children need to be brought up by parents in a monogamous marriage .
I would n't want to blow that apart , and I certainly would n't want the burden of being a single parent .
" I know from taking the kids on holiday on my own once when Hal was working that having sole responsibility for them is exhausting . "
So what of her sexual history ?
It seems that Carrie was n't always this uninterested in sex .
She admits to having 23 lovers before she married .
" Ten were proper boyfriends , " she recalls .
" I regretted having sex with six of them , loved three of them but only one of the 23 ever gave me an orgasm .
" As I entered my thirties , it was obvious my sex life had a recurring , rather depressing pattern : intense desire to begin with followed , if the relationship survived long enough , by a slow winding down into indifference .
" Only an affair with a married man called John bucked the trend .
But that was doomed by its very nature . "
Five years ago , Carrie almost cheated on her husband after regaining contact with an old flame on the website Friends Reunited .
" I nearly lost my virginity to Mark when we were 17 , but my mother arrived home as we enjoyed a fumble in my bedroom , " she recalls .
" He was gorgeous , looked like a man even back then in his school uniform , and remained in my consciousness for all those years .
" When I looked on Friends Reunited , it was an enormous thrill just to find Mark 's name .
I e-mailed him immediately .
He replied with an update on his life and said he was single - I was intoxicated .
" We began to exchange flirtatious emails , then text messages and phone calls which became increasingly fraught with sexual tension .
" After a few months of tantalising cyber sex , I booked a flight to go and see him in Germany , where he was living , over Easter 2003 .
But between booking the flight and the departure date , Mark found a girlfriend .
I was distraught , my hopes of sexual adventure dashed . "
Did Carrie not feel an ounce of guilt about her plans to cheat on Hal ?
" I had been feeling so sour about my sex life with Hal .
" But , back in contact with Mark , I suddenly discovered that my sexual urge was n't dead as I had feared , just dormant .
" It was glorious to feel aroused again , and those feelings blocked out any guilt I might otherwise have felt about Hal .
" For the few months that Mark and I flirted online , I had two existences : one where I cooked and cleaned and went frigidly to bed at night .
And another where I had butterflies in my stomach and stole off to write sexy , flirty emails and text messages to a man I had n't seen for more than 20 years . "
Eventually Carrie was forced to confess her feelings about Mark to her husband after he discovered the email exchanges between the two on her computer .
Astonishingly , Hal comforted her while she sobbed and , she says , for a short time the pair were closer and more able to talk .
" But as time went on , it became clear this was just an interlude in our marriage rather than a permanent change , " admits Carrie .
" The old coldness returned and , since then , I have been unable to have sex with my husband . "
Such a sorry tale of a sexless , unfulfilling marriage is in stark contrast to the current throng of writers littering the Amazon book charts with jaw - dropping memoirs of lurid sex lives .
Carrie admits that part of her envies those authors who claim to be having lots of sex and , more significantly , love it .
The other part of her just does n't believe them .
" I do wonder if they are just writing what they think the audience wants to hear , " she says .
" I read their accounts of wild sex lives and then ponder my own sexual encounters and wonder : ' Where was the fun , the screaming ecstasy , the fireworks ? ' "
Perhaps when her children are grown up , Carrie will do as she intends and leave her marriage .
Only then will she know whether the fantasy of taking in multiple lovers and never committing to one man is a greater thrill than being in a monogamous marriage .

Recently , the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals kicked a law suit brought against the United States by ‘ birther ’ Stephen Lee Craig .
Craig had alleged he was the victim of ‘ involuntary expatriation ’ , because the Congress had failed to define to his satisfaction the term natural born citizen .
My circle of friends has a turn of phrase for the self - styled expert who is bone ignorant on a subject , but does not hesitate to pontificate as if he knew more than he does .
That turn of phrase is “ I read a book once , ” as in the one book , read the one time , ( not even the same book several times ) providing overarching authority .
It is a phrase which , in the right company , speaks volumes with a few words .
Feel free to adopt the phrase .
Advertisements
Mr. Craig , who was as unwise as to act as his own lawyer – at least , that is my understanding of the term ‘ pro se ’ – tried to enlist the three appellate judges in his efforts to define the term natural born citizen .
You see , Mr. Craig wanted to define the term natural born citizen according to a book The Law of Nations , by Swiss political philosopher , Emmrich de Vattel , an old tome written in 1758 :
“ THE Law of Nations , though so noble and important a subject , has not , hitherto , been treated of with all the care it deserves .
The greater part of mankind have , therefore , only a vague , a very incomplete , and often even a false notion of it .
The generality of writers , and even celebrated authors , almost exclusively confine the name of “ Law of Nations ” to certain maxims and treatises recognised among nations , and which the mutual consent of the parties has rendered obligatory on them .
This is confining within very narrow bounds a law so extensive in its own nature , and in which the whole human race are so intimately concerned ; it is , at the same time , a degradation of that law , in consequence of a misconception of its real origin . ”
In other words , even de Vattel himself did n’t believe anyone really read the darn thing , despite all of the references to it in his own time .
In a new twist on the phrase “ I read a book once , ” Craig is asserting his meaning of natural born citizen because …. wait for it … the founding fathers read a book once , this book , so it must be true that de Vattel ’s definition was what the founding fathers had in mind when they wrote the constitution .
Of course , the founding fathers did n’t SAY that , not in so many words .
What they did say in very clear words in the very first article of the constitution was that Congress should define citizenship ; and Congress did , in numerous pieces of legislation over the years .
I could n’t make this up ; I have a good imagination , but not THAT good .
Right here in comments on Politicususa , birther believers have brought up the Law of Nations , as if it were some kind of final authoritative word on the subject .
I wonder how long before it sinks in just how discredited that argument really is ; and how quickly after that another crackpot birther notion takes its place .
The kicker is that I doubt that Craig ever read Law of Nations , in translations OR in the original French …. which is the best way of course , to understand de Vattel .
“ Woe be to him that reads but one book . ”

Natural gas from shale formations is the new magic phrase in the oil and gas industry , as new technologies have led to stunning increases in potential resources and anticipated profits .
Now some want to see if it carries any political magic .
With new discoveries of the fossil fuel in massive but difficult to drill shale deposits , advocates claim that climate legislation means a job boom for gas engineers and drillers , and revenue for producers .
They say a cap on greenhouse gas emissions could lead power plants to switch to gas from coal , which emits about double the carbon dioxide of gas .
Some experts -- but not all -- say that a strong mandate to expand wind power and other alternative energy generation could be a boon for natural gas generators , which are a likely future source of backup power for renewables .
At the same time , some politicians on Capitol Hill are pushing for new natural gas incentives in climate legislation moving through Congress .
They note that the fuel resource sits in many states , like Michigan and Pennsylvania , whose lawmakers are needed for passage of a bill .
" If you took a map of swing - state senators and look at where these new gas finds are , they match , " said Sen. Mark Udall ( D - Colo . ) .
" It 's more than ironic . "
He said he and his colleague Sen. Michael Bennet ( D - Colo . ) are working with other senators on provisions to promote natural gas in global warming legislation .
New benefits for gas are " going to be an essential part of my support for a bill , " Bennet said yesterday .
The first - term senator is himself a possible swing vote on a climate and energy package .
Another potential swing voter , Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) , also said yesterday that he would like to see more legislative text favoring natural gas .
Such a plan could be one of many bargaining chips that get lawmakers behind a climate and energy bill in the Senate , he said .
' Bigger than nuclear '
A former U.S. Senate aide who has been in close contact with Capitol Hill offices said natural gas " could be much bigger than nuclear " in getting politicians on board .
Legislation sponsored by Reps. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) and Edward Markey ( D - Mass . ) passed the House last month establishing a mandatory cap on greenhouse gases , but the fate of the measure remains uncertain in the Senate .
A bill draft has yet to be released in that chamber , and Democratic leaders are searching for 60 votes to block a filibuster .
Many natural - gas advocates believe that a carbon cap will benefit natural gas by default , but the industry also is pushing for things such as fewer carbon offsets in a climate bill .
Offsets allow emitters -- such as big coal - dependent utilities -- to meet carbon caps by paying for projects outside their own factories , like forestation projects overseas .
That offsetting allows them to avoid switching to gas as an alternative fuel .
Rod Lowman , president and CEO of the newly formed America 's Natural Gas Alliance , said in a recent interview that he was " concerned " about the number of offsets allowed in the Waxman - Markey proposal .
The shale discoveries brought natural gas to the political forefront .
In recent years , the oil industry developed technologies to drill horizontally into gas - bearing shale seams and fracture the rock with high - pressure water injections , called hydrofracturing .
These techniques make it possible to recover shale gas reserves that were separated in many tiny pockets that could not be tapped economically before , said John Curtis , a Colorado School of Mines professor .
According to a 2008 report from the Potential Gas Committee , estimates of gas resources surged from more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) in 2006 to more than 1,800 tcf last year .
Much of that jump came from shale gas , which made up 616 tcf of the 2008 total .
Some politically convenient geology
The geographic locations of these new shale gas resources overlap with the home states of many Senate lawmakers , like Sens. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) and Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) , who could make or break the outcome of global warming legislation .
During the House vote , majorities of delegations in Arkansas , Kentucky , Oklahoma , Ohio , Louisiana , Pennsylvania and Texas -- sites of major shale gas resources -- opposed the Waxman - Markey bill .
House majorities from New York and Michigan , where shale gas is also found , backed the bill , and West Virginia 's delegation split evenly .
Reid Detchon , executive director of the Energy Future Coalition , finds it puzzling that the natural gas industry has n't lined up more forcefully behind the climate legislation moving in the Senate .
Gas figures to be a big winner if climate policy mandates an ambitious renewable energy standard and restraints on power plant carbon dioxide emissions , he said .
In addition to being a potential coal replacement , gas generation is the obvious backup for the fivefold to tenfold increase in wind and solar generation that may be mandated in a climate bill .
Gas - fired power plants can ramp up quickly when clouds block the sun or the wind stops blowing .
" Natural gas is best " for that role , said Jeffrey Eshelman , vice president of public affairs of the Independent Petroleum Association of America .
" It 's abundant .
It 's a natural backstop for renewable energy .
It makes all the sense in the world to bring all of it online . "
The Energy Information Administration last year analyzed how energy use would change if the nation were getting 20 percent of its electric power from wind in 2030 , and predicted that gas turbine generation would increase significantly to back up wind power , but that more expensive combined - cycle gas generation from coal would be displaced by wind .
Experts argue that the scenario for wind and natural gas is n't clear yet .
New energy actor lacks a complete script
" Gas would be the backup for wind , but you lose part of the gas market to new wind generation , " said Harry Vidas , vice president of natural gas consulting at ICF International .
" It 's not obvious how that works out . "
Robert Zavadil of EnerNex Corp. in Knoxville , Tenn. , a prominent consultant on the wind integration issue , said that a big buildout of wind generation could reduce the need for backup by natural gas plants , since a drop - off in wind production in one area could be offset by stronger wind flows elsewhere .
It 's possible that the shale gas phenomenon is so new that it has n't reached its full political weight with Congress .
For example , two of the biggest shale gas plays are the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana and Texas and the Marcellus Shale , extending from New York 's Southern Tier through western Pennsylvania and into Ohio and West Virginia .
" Only in the last 18 months have Haynesville and Marcellus proven themselves productive , " said Curtis , who oversees the Potential Gas Supply report .
Norway 's national company StatoilHydro , the world 's largest offshore oil producer , paid $ 3.4 billion last year for a one - third interest in 1.8 million acres in the Marcellus region .
The company said it believes it may recover up to 3 billion barrels equivalent of shale gas , according to OilandGasInvestor.com .
A new Pennsylvania State University report that was requested by state legislators predicts that the Marcellus Shale could add $ 14 billion to the state 's economy in 2010 , create more than 98,000 jobs and generate $ 800 million in state and local tax revenues .
Yet the economic benefits may not come for a while , making shale gas a potential tough sell for lawmakers looking for immediate results .
Uncertainties linger about price and quantity
In Congress , the major political issue surrounding shale gas these days is a protest against tighter regulation by U.S. EPA .
" There 's a great deal of potential , " said David Morehouse , a senior petroleum geologist with the Energy Information Administration .
" We clearly have the technical capability to produce it .
It 's a matter of cost versus price .
The resource is there .
How much of it ultimately will be produced , nobody really knows yet .
They 're just guessing . "
That uncertainty works against shale gas 's political impact .
Also working against it is the power of the coal lobby .
Some two dozen states contain coal reserves , and the industry holds some of the deepest lobbying coffers on Capitol Hill .
Many of the states that contain significant shale gas reserves -- like West Virginia -- also have a long - standing coal industry with close ties to its members of Congress .
That puts many lawmakers in a situation in which they have to weigh support for coal against the requests of natural gas .
And the coal industry is fighting hard to make sure that its views rise to the top .
In an interview yesterday , a spokesman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , or ACCCE , emphasized that mass switching away from coal to natural gas would lead to electricity price spikes .
Gas has a history of price volatility , and the shale discoveries wo n't change that , he said .
It 's clear that natural gas interests " have joined together to talk about how they can game a climate policy so as to gain market share , " said Joe Lucas , senior vice president for communications at ACCCE .
Similarly , the National Mining Association , which represents many coal companies , is running a series of ads saying , " America ca n't afford to put most of its electricity eggs in the natural gas basket . "
" To quote Queen Victoria , we are not amused , " said Luke Popovich , a spokesman for the association .

Publisher says manga's " future publication is to be determined "
On Sunday , authorities have identified the body discovered at Arafune mountain as that of missing Crayon Shin-chan manga creator Yoshito Usui through dental records and other means .
The body was discovered 120 meters below the mountain 's Tomoiwa cliff and reported at about 10:25 a.m. on Saturday by a male climber .
Usui 's backpack , camera , and other items had fallen about 50 meters away .
Inside Usui 's backpack was his mobile phone , wallet , and clothes .
A police helicopter from Gunma Prefecture airlifted the body on Sunday afternoon .
Police from the nearby town of Shimonita concluded that the 51 - year - old creator died from collapsed lungs and other injuries sustained across his entire body sometime in the afternoon of September 11 .
According to Usui 's family , Usui had said that he was " going hiking for a day in Gunma Prefecture , " as he often did , on the morning of September 11 .
His mobile phone was last detected in the vicinity of Karuizawa , a town about 100 kilometers ( about 60 miles ) northwest of his Kasukabe home , on Monday .
Karuizawa is located in the mountainous eastern part of Nagano Prefecture , near the border of the equally mountainous Gunma Prefecture .
In particular , Usui was said to have expressed his intent to climb the Arafune mountain , which towers 1,422 meters ( 4,665 feet ) high at the border between Nagano and Gunma Prefectures .
According to Gunma Prefecture 's police , there are no guardrails near the top of Tomoiwa cliff , but the established climber 's trail is too far from the cliffside for someone to fall .
Authorities had been searching this area since his wife reported his disappearance on September 12 , after he did not return the night before .
The editorial staff at Futabasha 's Manga Town magazine has stated on Sunday night that the " future publication [ of Crayon Shin- chan ] is to be determined . "
Futabasha said it was " going through great shock , now that the worst outcome has come to past .
There are no words to express the anguish of the surviving family , but we just pray for his happiness in the next world . "

Update : More background information added .
Update 2 : Crayon Shin-chan follows the exploits of Shinnosuke Nohara , a mischievous ( fictional ) kindergartner in Usui 's own Kasukabe City .
Usui launched the manga in Futabasha 's Weekly Manga Action magazine in August 1990 , and he has continued to work on the series after moving it to Manga Town and other Futabasha magazines .
Shin'ei Doga has been adapting it into a top - 5 - rated television anime series since 1992 , and the television series has itself inspired 17 anime films .
CMX Manga has been releasing Yoshito Usui 's original Crayon Shin-chan manga in English in North America .
Funimation has been adapting the Shin-chan television anime series into dubbed English , and the Adult Swim network used to run episodes every Sunday morning .
Update 3 : According to Futabasha in a Monday news conference , the last photograph in Usui 's digital camera was of the bottom of the cliff from the vantage point of the top .
Futabasha 's staffers believe that Usui accidentally fell while taking photographs of the cliff .
Thanks , Toru .

I ’ve been thinking a lot about the correlation between quality and pricing when it comes to coffee .
When I did a few posts about coffee pricing , I got some negative feedback .
One of the issues raised was that coffee quality is improving and it therefore it demands a higher price .
One comment I received suggested that not accepting the higher price was somehow an endorsement of lower quality coffee .
Correct me if I am wrong , but wine drinkers openly discuss price and quality – and do n’t accept claims that more expensive wine is always better wine .
Is it really taboo to be honest about seeking certain flavor profiles at different price points ?
I do n’t believe there is always a direct correlation between price and quality .
To illustrate this point , I ’d like to describe the two best cups of coffee I ’ve ever had .
On September 27 , 2007 , I had the best cup of coffee in my life .
It was the grand opening of Trabant ’s Pioneer Square location .
For the event , they brewed up the award - winning Panama Esmeralda in their Clover machine .
This is what I wrote about the coffee the next day .
What can I say ?
The legends are true .
This was the best cup of coffee I have ever had .
The coffee had so many unique characteristics , many unique to Central American beans as well as some qualities that I ’ve only tasted in East African beans .
It was amazing .
Imagine a jam band of rock superstars making the best song on the best sound system .
That ’s a perfect cup of coffee .
The Esmeralda was $ 130 / lb unroasted .
It was $ 200 / lb roasted .
It was roasted by 49th Parallel in British Columbia , Canada .
Other cafes were charging between $ 9 and $ 15 for a single cup of this special coffee when brewed in a Clover .
Clover Coffee Machine
The second best cup of coffee I ’ve ever had was a Kenyan Peaberry that I home roasted in 2004 .
I do n’t recall the exact lot .
I had been home roasting different regions of Kenya coffee for years and I just kept improving my roast profile .
Then everything clicked .
The cool California mornings , combined with an optimal resting period , made for a superb cup of coffee .
I took it into work and all my co-workers lined up to receive some of the coffee brewed in my press pot .
We had been working together for two years at this point and they all agreed that this coffee was their favorite .
Westbend Poppery
The Kenya Peaberry was ordered from Sweet Maria’s .
With shipping it cost me about $ 5 a pound .
It was roasted using a Westbend Poppery which I purchased on eBay for $ 40 .
My French press cost me about $ 20 .
Let us review the 2 coffees .
Panama Esmeralda Kenya Peaberry Green Coffee Price per lb $ 130.00 $ 5.00 Roaster 49th Parallel Me Roasted Coffee Price per lb $ 200.00 $ 6.25 ( 20 % weight loss ) Roasting Cost per lb $ 70.00 My Time Additional Roasting Costs – $ 40 Popcorn Popper Brewing Method $ 11,000 Clover $ 20 French Press Cost per Brewed Cup $ 9 – $ 15 + tip 14 cents
* I did n’t include the electricity used to run the home roaster , but I also did n’t include the fuel charges to get to and from the coffee house .
Was the Panama Esmeralda brewed through a Clover better than my home roasted Kenya ?
Absolutely .
Was it 50 or 100 times better ?
No it was n’t .
There is n’t always a direct correlation between price and quality .
Although I love the award winning expensive coffees , it is nice to know that you can still get a stellar cup of coffee on a budget .

Henry Waxman 's investigation began with letters to the insurance industry 's powerful trade group and its consultant regarding grassroots tactics .
Waxman insurance probe began in July
House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman raised eyebrows this week when he launched a financial probe into the nation ’s largest insurance companies , which are at the center of the health reform battle .
Now POLITICO has learned that Waxman ’s recent investigation began almost a month earlier than previously thought — with letters to the insurance industry ’s powerful trade group and its consultant regarding grassroots tactics .

A committee spokeswoman defended the probes — saying lawmakers need to know that private insurance money is being spent effectively as part of the effort to control costs .
But the trade group , America ’s Health Insurance Plans , is crying foul , saying Waxman is merely trying to bring it in line behind his version of the health reform bill .
“ Congressional oversight is not a tool that should be used to chill dissent , ” said AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach .
“ These investigations are nothing more than politically motivated , taxpayer - financed fishing expeditions designed to intimidate and silence health plans . ”
The letters are just the latest volley in a low - level battle Waxman is waging with health industry titans .
First , the powerful chairman made it clear he is not bound by an $ 80 billion deal among the White House , Senate Finance Committee and the pharmaceutical industry when he included provisions in the House bill the industry opposes .
And now he is turning up the heat on the insurance industry – whose opposition helped scuttle President Bill Clinton ’s health reform efforts in the 1990s .
Earlier this week , Waxman sent letters requesting detailed financial information including compensation , revenue and profit numbers to 52 insurance companies with annual premiums greater than $ 2 billion .
But nearly a month earlier , on July 21 , Waxman and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Bart Stupak sent letters to AHIP and Dewey Square Group asking for emails and internal documents about a news report in April that several senior citizens had not written letters to the editor submitted under their names .
Waxman ’s committee ’s spokeswoman said Waxman was merely trying to gather information critical to the health care debate .
“ If we 're going to get health costs under control , we need to make sure that our private health insurance dollars are spent as efficiently as possible .
That means our premium dollars should be paying hospitals and physicians for providing health care , not wasting resources on administrative bloat , ” she said .
Zirkelbach said Waxman ’s letter to AHIP was sent five days after AHIP sent Waxman and two other Democratic chairmen an eight - page letter detailing concerns with the House health reform bill , including opposition to a government - run insurance option and cuts to the Medicare Advantage program .
After that letter , “ the committee demanded that AHIP provide internal documents and emails regarding an isolated , three - month old incident that had already been resolved , ” he said .
A month later , Zirkelbach said , Waxman asked the 52 companies for information about what meetings employees attended , where they stayed , and what they ate , and “ details about employee compensation far beyond what was asked of companies participating in the TARP program . ”
Last October after the Treasury Department announced plans to pump $ 125 billion into troubled banks , Waxman wrote to the chief executive of Citigroup asking for the number of employees paid $ 500,000 between 2006 and 2008 .
In this week ’s letter to insurance companies , Waxman asked for the individual names of those who made more than $ 500,000 between 2003 and 2008 and a list of company events held outside the office .
The committee also sought dividend payments , net income and premium revenue numbers as well as claims payments , expenses and insurance product profits .
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue wrote to Waxman and Stupak on Friday saying he was “ deeply troubled ” by the letters the committee sent to insurance companies and urged them to “ disavow this letter and withdraw it immediately . ”
A prominent Democratic lobbyist , who represents health care and other interests , also called the letters “ an an overreach that has the potential to backfire on Democrats .
I know nobody likes the insurance industry , but to bludgeon them when you ’re losing the legislative debate just looks bad . ”
In the episode in question , an insurance industry source said the seniors were sent a pre-written letter to the editor supporting Medicare Advantage and asked to sign and submit it .
AHIP included copies of the letters in question signed by the seniors in their response to Waxman .
Dewey Square had earlier admitted that an intern misrepresented himself as a grandson of one of the seniors when calling the newspaper to see whether the letter had been printed .
" Dewey Square has produced documents to the committee conclusively demonstrating that every letter sent by DSG to a newspaper or member of Congress was a letter that had actually been signed by the individual .
We have every confidence that the committee is acting professionally and appropriately , " said a Dewey Square spokeswoman .
Chris Matthews decided to take seriously Nancy Pelosi 's choked - up discussion of concern about the violent undertone of recent right - wing rhetoric -- which of course has the right - wing a - holosphere chortling in blithe dismissal -- on Hardball earlier this week .
So he brought on author Gerald Posner and the SPLC's Mark Potok to talk about it .
It prompted an interesting discussion about the relationship between the wild rantings of right - wing talkers and the ugliness that is manifesting itself on the street in our discourse -- especially now that we have right - wing nutcases who attend churches where the preacher tells them killing Obama would not be murder showing up at presidential rallies with AR - 15s .
MATTHEWS : ... The question here is very serious .
What is it in the atmosphere that allows a person to feel comfortable showing up at a political event carrying a gun , in some cases two guns , and letting people know they 're armed ?
What is it in the atmosphere that lets a person bring a sign that compares the president of the United States to an animal or to a Nazi ?
What is it makes them feel comfortable doing that kind of crap in public ?
I wonder if it is n't the atmosphere of language that 's being used today .
Your thoughts , sir , Mark .
MARK POTOK , SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER : I think it is the atmosphere , the language that 's being sort of ejected into the atmosphere , I think that , you know , what we 're hearing , in particular from our — quote , unquote — “ leaders , ” from both political leaders and commentators .
I mean , you know , yesterday Rush Limbaugh was on the air talking about an incident in which black kids attacked a white kid on a school bus , an incident that police said was not racially motivated , and saying that what we need are segregated buses , that this is the only way , I suppose , that white people can be protected from black people .
I think when we have characters like Limbaugh saying that on the air to millions of Americans , many of whom actually revere the man , you know , it 's not surprising that people feel that , you know , the race war is around the corner and that we 're allowed to say these kinds of things .
...
GERALD POSNER : ... Chris , you have hit the nail on the head .
It 's a license that allows somebody who's on the edge to cross the edge from thinking about acting out to actually crossing the line and being violent and thinking they can change history with a single bullet .
And we have shown time and time again that that 's possible .
It 's not simply the overt threat to the well - being of the president that 's important here .
There 's also the threatening nature of packing heat openly at a public meeting where the presence of guns is highly likely to be interpreted by your fellow citizens as an implied threat to their well - being should they happen to disagree .
That is , they not only threaten the president , these guns intimidate and silence your fellow citizens .
The flip side of this was Glenn Beck , responding also to Pelosi 's remarks , and insisting that we pay it no mind , because the people she 's concerned about are just crazy , and there 's nothing we can do about them .
Beck : Look -- Timothy McVeigh -- nutjob !
Nutjob !
On the fringe of the right !
That , President Clinton tried to blame on Rush Limbaugh .
It was ridiculous then , and it 's ridiculous now .
Harvey Milk -- killed by a guy who was hepped up on Twinkies .
It was ridiculous then -- it 's ridiculous now .
The shooter -- and Timothy McVeigh -- crazy people !
It 's madness .
This was largely the position taken by Jesse Walker at Reason earlier this week , when he drew up what appears to be the first serious attempt at critiquing my book , The Eliminationists : How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right .
When panicky centrists are n't willing to draw an unbroken line from peaceful conservatives to the violent fringe , they posit a somewhat subtler link .
The killers , they acknowledge , are n't taking their marching orders directly from Fox News and AM radio .
But by giving serious attention to theories associated with the fringe right — that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is preparing concentration camps , that Barack Obama is not a natural - born U.S. citizen —
Glenn Beck and other broadcasters are validating the grievances of potential killers , giving them the impression that they are n't alone .
This validation is buttressed by the sweeping , sometimes violent rhetoric about " liberals " that you hear from partisan celebrities , such as Ann Coulter 's joke that McVeigh should have blown up the New York Times building instead .
In The Eliminationists and on his blog , David Neiwert tries to establish a chain linking " eliminationist " behavior in American history ( lynchings of blacks and Asians , the slaughter of American Indians ) , eliminationist rhetoric on the mainstream right ( the Coulter wisecrack ) , and von Brunn–style efforts to eliminate people directly .
The theory is interesting , but it has two enormous problems .
The first is that it ignores the autonomy of people on the fringe .
Not just the radicals who commit the crimes , but the radicals who do n't commit crimes .
There 's a complex ecology at work here , one demonstrated most clearly in those cases when militiamen alerted authorities to terrorist plots in their midst .
Words have influence , but they influence different people in different ways ; you can't reduce media effects to simple push - pull reactions .
Accusing Glenn Beck or Bill O'Reilly of validating right - wing violence is n't so different from accusing pornography of validating rape , Ozzy Osbourne of validating teen suicide , or Marilyn Manson of validating school massacres .
Actually , it is quite different from that .
Because what The Eliminationists describes is not artistic expression or mere point of view , but rather ideological exhortation -- rhetoric specifically intended to inspire both belief and action .
The former has only a tenuous causal connection at best , while the latter has a long and well - established causal connection to violent behavior .
Surely Walker does n't believe for a minute that radical anti-Israeli speech emanating from Hamas has no connection to the suicide bombers who board buses in Tel Aviv .
It 's hard to imagine anyone not acknowledging that radical Jihadist anti-American speech does n't inspire Al Qaeda 's acts of terrorism .
Nor even that the Ku Klux Klan race baiters of the ' 20s and '30s did n't help inspire various acts of lynching and " race rioting " .
Accusing Beck and O'Reilly of validating right - wing violence is n't like connecting Marilyn Manson to Columbine -- which is to say , connecting something that only tenuously could be said to actually inspire or advocate violence .
It 's much more like connecting radical imams to 9/11 .
Ideologues who inspire violent action through radicalizing propaganda have been with us for many decades , even centuries .
The fact that , in recent years , the more action - prone of the people who violently respond to these exhortations are increasingly confined to the fringes of American politics does n't mean there is n't still serious culpability on the part of those who indulge rhetoric that winds up unhinging people .
I frequently use the case of David Lewis Rice to explain and illustrate this point :
On Christmas Eve 1985 , Charles and Annie Goldmark were at home with their sons Derek , 12 , and Colin , 10 , preparing for a holiday dinner when the doorbell rang .
It was Rice , a 27 - year - old unemployed transient , posing as a taxicab driver delivering a package .
He brandished a toy gun and forced his way into their home , then set about using chloroform to render all four Goldmarks unconscious .
He then proceeded to kill them slowly , using a steam iron and a knife that he used to insert into at least one of the victim 's brains .
Annie was pronounced dead on the spot , Colin pronounced dead on arrival , while Charles died there a short while later ; Derek finally succumbed 37 days later .
But Rice was n't just a deranged loony -- though he probably fit that description too .
He also was a deranged loony who had been set into action by the malicious lies of a group of right - wing haters , whose venom became his inspiration ...
Sociologist James A. Aho , in his book This Thing of Darkness : A Sociology of the Enemy explains where Rice got his inspiration :
Ed Fasel [ fictitious name ] was head of the local Duck Club chapter .
It was from Ed that Rice received the tragic misinformation that Charles and Annie Goldmark were leading Seattle Communists .
In the course of discussions concerning local subversives and crooks who were presumably frustrating Rice 's efforts to secure a job , Fasel , mistaking Charles for his father John , related to Rice that the Goldmarks had been investigated and that Charles was " regional director of the American Communist Party . "
Rice took this to mean that Charles was the " highest obtainable target I could reach , the greatest value informationally . "
After handcuffing the Goldmarks , Rice intended to interrogate them about the next person in the conspiratorial hierarchy , possibly to preempt at the last moment the impending invasion of alien troops [ a conspiracy theory to which Rice subscribed ] .
What occasioned Fasel to dredge up a name associated with an event that had occurred two decades previously in another part of the state ?
In a Seattle Port Commission election during the summer of 1985 , one of the candidates was Jim Wright , a Republican .
Wright 's campaign manager was none other than Ashley Holden , a defendant in the Goldmark trial .
[ Holden had been a leading torchbearer in the McCarthyite " Red fever " that swept Washington state in the late 1940s and ' 50s , and had been one of the people who falsely accused the Goldmarks in print of being part of the Communist Party . ]
Upon discovering this unusual link , the Seattle media jumped on it , and the name " Goldmark , " with its unfortunate connotations , " got out again , " to use one informant 's phrase .
In my interview with him , Holden convincingly insisted that he knew nothing of the Duck Club nor any of its members .
" I deplored the murder , " he said .
" There is no question , " he went on , parroting local wisdom , " Rice was demented . "
Now , did " Fasel " or any of his cohorts have criminal or even civil liability in this matter ?
Almost certainly not .
But did they have the blood of the Goldmark family on their hands ?
Most of us would judge that they did indeed .
That is to say , there was a level of moral and ethical culpability involved in the irresponsible speech that inspired David Lewis Rice .
When you fill an unstable person 's head with a pack of crazy ideas that inspire them to act out violently , there are social and economic consequences that deservedly ensue .
The critical components that distinguish irresponsible free speech from responsible are interworking pieces : whether it is intended to harm by scapegoating or demonizing , and whether or not it is provably false .
In the Goldmark case , the things the Duck Club told Rice not only demonized the Goldmarks , but they were also things that were simply not true -- though the tellers wished ardently that they were , they were purely concoctions of their fevered imaginations .
This is true of so much far - right wingnuttery -- the " Birther " conspiracy theories , the FEMA - camp claims , the " constitutionalist " theories about taxation and the Federal Reserve , to list just a few examples -- and yet people believe them anyway .
This rhetoric also acts as a kind of wedge between the people who absorb it and the real world .
There is always a kind of cognitive dissonance that arises from believing things that are provably untrue , and people who begin to fanatically cling to beliefs that do not comport with reality find themselves increasingly willing to buy into other similarly unhinged beliefs .
For those who are already unhinged , the effects are particularly toxic .
All of these theories , you 'll observe , serve the explicit purpose of supporting a scapegoating narrative .
And a number of them have been featured in some shape , form , or fashion , in the mainstream public discourse because they have been presented seriously for discussion by various right - wing talking heads , most notably Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs .
But pointing out their ethical and moral culpability inevitably means that they immediately blame it on the " crazy " people , and who can take responsibility for " crazy " people ?
Part of the problem is that we actually have seen this happen time after time after time :
A mentally unstable person is inspired by hateful right - wing rhetoric to act out violently -- and yet because of that mental state , the matter is dismissed as idiosyncratic , just another " isolated incident . "
And over the months and years , these " isolated incidents " mount one after another .
But simply ascribing these acts to mental illness is a cop-out .
It fails to account for the gross irresponsibility of the people who employed the rhetoric that inspired the violent action in the first place , and their resulting moral culpability .
Next , inevitably , they complain that we 're only trying to silence them :
This is a familiar refrain that comes up every time anyone raises a socially damning issue like this one :
We 're trying to oppress them , to silence their voices , by pointing out how morally and ethically bankrupt they are .
Actually , we 're just pointing out how bankrupt they are .
No one here has said anything about silencing their voices -- we just want them to face up to the consequences of their irresponsible rhetoric .
It 's called culpability :
They obviously are not criminally culpable , nor likely even civilly culpable .
But they are morally and ethically culpable .
We do have serious differences of opinion here .
We strongly believe that there 's a clear , common - sense connection between the paranoiac fearmongering that has passed for right - wing rhetoric since well before Obama 's election ( and has become acute since ) and violence like that in Pittsburgh , or in Knoxville : horrifying tragedies , in which the sources of the criminal 's unambiguous motives are that very same hysterical fearmongering -- whether it's about the evil socialists , stinking immigrants , or conspiring gun-grabbers who 've taken over the country since Election Day .
...
The point is not to silence the people saying these things , but to point out how grotesquely irresponsible they are -- in the hopes that they will cease doing so , and start acting responsibly .
It 's their choice to use irresponsible rhetoric .
It 's not just our choice but our duty , as responsible citizens , to stand up and speak out about it .
And make no mistake : Rhetoric that whips up irrational fears among the public , that demonizes and dehumanizes and scapegoats -- that 's irresponsible rhetoric .
And we are calling the American Right on it .
Think about what Bill Clinton actually said after Oklahoma City ( and carefully note the difference between this and what the Right now claims he said ) :
In this country we cherish and guard the right of free speech .
We know we love it when we put up with people saying things we absolutely deplore .
And we must always be willing to defend their right to say things we deplore to the ultimate degree .
But we hear so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each other .
They spread hate .
They leave the impression that , by their very words , that violence is acceptable .
You ought to see -- I 'm sure you are now seeing the reports of some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today .
Well , people like that who want to share our freedoms must know that their bitter words can have consequences and that freedom has endured in this country for more than two centuries because it was coupled with an enormous sense of responsibility on the part of the American people .
If we are to have freedom to speak , freedom to assemble , and , yes , the freedom to bear arms , we must have responsibility as well .
And to those of us who do not agree with the purveyors of hatred and division , with the promoters of paranoia , I remind you that we have freedom of speech , too , and we have responsibilities , too .
And some of us have not discharged our responsibilities .
It is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech and behavior .
If they insist on being irresponsible with our common liberties , then we must be all the more responsible with our liberties .
When they talk of hatred , we must stand against them .
When they talk of violence , we must stand against them .
When they say things that are irresponsible , that may have egregious consequences , we must call them on it .
The exercise of their freedom of speech makes our silence all the more unforgivable .
So exercise yours , my fellow Americans .
Our country , our future , our way of life is at stake .
Of course , the right - wingers mewled piteously after Clinton gave that speech , too .
They claimed he was trying to silence them , when in fact he was quite explicit about not doing that .
Nonetheless , it became part of established right - wing lore that " Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh for Oklahoma City . "
This , as we 've already noted , is palpable nonsense :
Because we believe in freedom of speech and freedom of thought , there will probably always be haters like Richard Poplawski among us .
Inevitably they will be driven by fear : the fear of difference .
Because to them , difference of any kind is a threat .
And what we know from experience about volatile , unstable actors like them is that they can be readily induced into violent action by hateful rhetoric that demonizes and dehumanizes other people .
And thanks to human nature and those same freedoms , we will certainly always have fearmongering demagogues among us .
But the purveyors of such profoundly irresponsible rhetoric need to be called on it -- especially when they hold the nation 's media megaphones .
That was as true in 1995 as it is now .
Which brings us to the second part of Jesse Walker 's critique :
The second problem is the implicit version of history .
Neiwert has uncritically embraced the idea that the militia movement began in 1992 , so it 's easy for him to imagine a progression from the old lynch mobs to the right - wing ' 80s underground to the '90s militias to Republicans who tolerate militia - style arguments .
But if Churchill is right about the origins of the militia movement , the original eliminationists might have a different , more dangerous set of descendants .
I 'm not sure what in the hell Walker is talking about here .
Nowhere have I suggested that the militia movement began in 1992 .
And I have n't uncritically embraced anyone 's theories about their origins .
After all , I was there and reported on them at the time .
I 've been reporting on them since .
Walker seems oblivious to the fact that my first published book was a study of the " Patriot " movement of the 1990s from a Northwestern perspective , titled In God 's Country .
It was published by a small academic press , so I can't blame him if he has n't read it .
But a little research would have revealed to him that the book is based on my on - the - ground reportage involving the extremist right in the Northwest dating back to the 1970s and picking up in the early '90s .
I come by my conclusions honestly -- that is , through firsthand experience as a journalist .
I covered the Montana Freemen standoff and subsequent federal trials , as well as the activities ( and ultimately federal court trials ) of militia activists in western Washington , northern Idaho and eastern Oregon as well .
I interviewed numerous militia leaders and even more of their followers , and I dug through the extant sociological research to understand better what made them tick .
What I can tell you is what I laid out in the book , with the full body of evidence : that the militias were actually an outgrowth of the larger " Christian Patriot " movement that became an umbrella term for the American extremist right in the mid-1980s .
The militias were seen as a means to recruit new believers from the mainstream , by appealing to their " libertarian " ideals and their fears about guns and government power .
This shift was best recorded by Aho in his seminal text The Politics of Righteousness : Idaho Christian Patriotism , which was published in 1990 .
It contains the first real dataset of information about this segment of the American Right .
It describes , on page 10 , the " Christian Patriot " organization calling itself the Oregon Militia .
So the concept of Patriots forming militia cells certainly predated 1992 .
Now , did the militias ' recruitment efforts -- their attempt to mainstream themselves -- entail the very sort of appeals that Robert Churchill describes ?
Certainly .
But the far - right bloc that now calls itself the Patriots have always tailored their appeals in such fashion .
They are nothing if not adaptable .
I 've only just picked up Mr. Churchill 's book , but here 's my impression from my initial cursory glance :
It 's written from the perspective of someone who was n't there , and is more interested in promoting a provocative thesis than digging to get to the whole truth .
Churchill , for instance , devotes a great deal of time to the work and writing of Mike Vanderboegh , who made great show of trying to drive out the racists from the militia movement .
But Vanderboegh had virtually no influence within the movement and was generally shunned by " real " Patriots .
Yet at the same time , Churchill makes no mention whatsoever of Col.
James " Bo " Gritz , who was a major figure in the movement and one of its important figureheads .
The Gritz example is instructive : I interviewed him on multiple occasions , and inevitably tried to get him to discuss the rumors that he was involved in Christian Identity , the white - supremacist religious movement which stipulates that Caucasians are the true children of Israel , and that Jews are Satanic and non-whites soulless brutes .
Gritz was almost always evasive on this count , even though it was well known that he'd had a significant falling - out with Identity leader Pete Peters over the latter 's insistence on the death penalty for homosexuals .
But what he did tell me , on more than one occasion , was that politically , he identified with libertarians ( and particularly Ron Paul ) .
Later , it emerged that Gritz was indeed deeply enmeshed in the Identity movement .
He 's now fairly public about it , having married the daughter of one of Identity 's more prominent preachers .
This is fairly typical of the Patriot movement in general and its " militia " components specifically :
They love to present a normative front that is non-threatening and whose deep radicalism is not immediately apparent .
But eventually the real agenda emerges .
It 's important to understand that these folks in fact see themselves as residing outside the mainstream .
They embrace their radicalism and are proud of it , make wry jokes about it .
To the far right , even Fox News is part of the " liberal media " establishment that does n't dare tell the whole real truth about the nefarious Jewish cabal that really runs America .
So when they see someone like Bill O'Reilly or Glenn Beck or Lou Dobbs repeating for a mass national audience things they believed were only understood by people like themselves , it has not only a powerfully validating effect , but even moreso a permission - giving one .
Just as hate - crime perpetrators believe they are acting on the secret wishes of their larger communities , violent extremists have a need to believe that they are acting heroically , on behalf of their nation or their " people " .
Mainstream validation tells them they are supported .
Mark Potok explained this to Chris Matthews in that Hardball segment :
MATTHEWS : Let me ask you -- let me ask Mark of the Southern Poverty Law Center , let me ask you this thing here of the South .
What is it about the cause — we used to hear the phrase the cause for the people who did n't like what happened in the Civil War afterwards .
They thought they lost the war they should have won .
This attitude about how you got to carry — I heard a guy talking the other day in front of the Lee Mansion about you got to keep the battle going , the battle , showing up at these rallies in Washington against Obama .
What is the battle out there that 's being fought by the right , especially in the South ?
What is this ?
What is this thing out there ?
POTOK : Well , I think — I think , in the South , it 's a very particular form of white nationalism .
I mean , you know , there are a great many people down here who truly believe that the war had nothing to do with slavery , the Civil War , you know , that it was about tariffs or the North imposing an industrial system on the South or any one of any number of other things .
You know , this is very much alive in the minds of a lot of people down here , including academics in many cases .
So , you know , all of this rhetoric , all of these ideas have consequences .
I mean , I think it 's worth saying , overall , when we talk about the subject , that , you know , hate criminals , people who go out and murder people who do n't look like them , are not typically people who think of themselves as criminal thugs .
They are very typically people who think that they are acting on the wishes of the community .
They are the brave young men standing up to defend their community .
So , you know , when you have a Limbaugh or other public figures saying Obama 's a racist , he has a hatred for white people , as Glenn Beck said on FOX News the other day , you know , there are some people out there , some small sliver of the population , who feel , you know , what the brave young warriors ought to do is go out there and defend the white race , and that may very well mean taking a shot at the president .
MATTHEWS : Well , I thank you both for joining us on this terrible subject .
...
By the way , I think that everybody who does these horrible crimes in history does so thinking that , somewhere , there will be warmth for him ; somewhere in the country or in the world , there will be people who will respect and love him for what he did .
That thought is frightening .
And all the more frightening for being hard , cold reality .
No matter how ardently the American Right would like to whitewash it all away .

The Aldine Independent School District 's knack for coaxing strong test scores from students in some of the Houston area 's most poverty - stricken neighborhoods earned it the distinction as this year 's best urban school system in the nation .
The prestigious Broad Prize for Urban Education comes with $ 1 million in college scholarships for Aldine 's graduating seniors .
This was the fourth time the north Houston - area district was a finalist for the prize , which honors large school systems making notable gains in student achievement .
Aldine Superintendent Wanda Bamberg , who
accepted the award at an afternoon ceremony in Washington , D.C. , said she deliberately did not prepare a speech .
“ I did not want to jinx it , ” Bamberg said as her staff gathered at district headquarters to watch the announcement live via the Internet .
When Aldine was revealed as the prize winner — instead of the perennial bridesmaid — district employees erupted in claps and cheers .
“ Aldine shows us that it 's possible for a district facing tough circumstances to get excellent results , ” U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a statement .
“ We need to highlight the success of Aldine and districts like it so that others can follow their examples and lift up all students . ”
Third from Texas
Aldine , which serves about 60,000 mostly poor and minority children , is the third Texas school district to win the Broad prize since it was established in 2002 by the California - based Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation .
Brownsville ISD won last year , and Houston ISD was the award 's first recipient .
The scholarship prize money will go to Aldine seniors graduating in 2010 based on financial need and a record of academic growth in high school , according to the Broad Foundation .
Students attending four - year colleges will be eligible for up to $ 20,000 , while those enrolling in two - year schools can receive up to $ 5,000 .
As a three - time runner - up for the Broad award , Aldine racked up $ 250,000 in scholarship funding each time .
The other finalists for the prize this year were school systems in Broward County , Fla . ; Gwinnett County , Ga. ; Long Beach , Calif . ; and Socorro , Texas , a district in the El Paso area .
A panel of eight judges , including three former U.S. education secretaries , selected the winner .
“ I think people were really rooting for ( Aldine ) , ” said Austin lobbyist Sandy Kress , a member of the Broad nominating committee who once served as an education policy adviser to former President George W. Bush .
“ People across the country understand that for some significant period of time folks there have really been building something and sustaining it . ”
The 100 largest U.S. school districts that also serve a large number of low - income children are automatically eligible for the award .
Strong test performance
Contest officials noted that Hispanic and low - income students in Aldine outperformed their peers statewide in reading and math at all grade levels in 2008 .
Black students scored higher than their counterparts in math at all levels , but fell behind in reading in elementary school .
The district 's weakest area is science , where 63 percent of black students passed the state test in 2008 , compared with 71 percent of Hispanic students and 82 percent of Anglos .
Sixty - eight percent of low - income children passed , according to state data .
Aldine also drew praise from the judges for its “ clear , rigorous expectations ” for staff , its recruitment of top - notch teachers and the budget autonomy it gives principals .
Aldine parent Carlos Deleon , who has had three children educated in the district , attributed its success to “ the community , the parent involvement and , of course , most important , the good teachers . ”
“ When I hear they 're awarded more scholarships , ” Deleon said of the students , “ wow , that 's great .
These kids work so hard . ”

Two so - called " party " drugs and a man-made cannabis substitute will be banned by the end of the year , the Home Office has announced .
At the moment , these " legal highs " are sold openly across the UK and on the internet , but ministers say they are an " emerging threat " .
The two drugs , known as BZP and GBL , have been linked to a number of deaths .
Charity DrugScope said law alone was " a blunt instrument " and greater education was needed about the drugs ' effects .
To that end , the Home Office said it would begin an awareness campaign in university freshers ' weeks in September to highlight the dangers .
' Liquid ecstasy '
In May , a coroner in Sheffield linked BZP , also known as herbal ecstasy , to the death last year of 22 - year - old mortgage broker Daniel Backhouse .
It is understood that Mr Backhouse had also taken ecstasy .
Hester Stewart , who was 21 and a medical student , died after taking GBL in Brighton .
Both drugs would be classified as Class C. Sussex University student Hester Stewart died after taking GBL Hester Stewart 's mother , Maryon , has campaigned for legal highs to be banned .
She told the BBC News Channel : " I 'm delighted .
I think the Home Office is moving in the right direction .
" We need to tell people that GBL plus alcohol can equal death .
Hester had n't had that much alcohol and then later on that evening an old friend of hers gave her half a dose of GBL which he said was safe .
" So the two mixed together just sent her into a coma and she did n't wake up .

" She was studying molecular medicine but she was clearly unaware that it was dangerous and I think that is the key message to get across to young people , just because it 's legal does n't mean it 's safe . "
The government wants to ban all cannabis substitutes made from man made chemicals called cannabinoids , which mimic the effects of marijuana .
It is often sold under the name Spice for about £ 20 .
Cannabinoids would be controlled as a Class B drug , alongside cannabis .
The Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he was acting on advice from the government 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs :
He said : " Legal highs are an emerging threat , particularly to young people , and we have a duty to educate them about the dangers .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" There is a perception that many of the so - called legal highs are harmless , however in some cases people can be ingesting dangerous industrial fluids or smoking chemicals that can be even more harmful than cannabis . "
BZP and GBL would carry a prison term of up to two years for possession and 14 years for dealing .
GBL is taken as a substitute for the " date rape " drug GHB , which is already outlawed .
The Home Office says the GBL , originally an industrial solvent , can cause serious heart problems , vomiting , anxiety attacks , mood swings and seizures .
BZP has been linked to similar conditions .
' Lumped together ' Martin Barnes , chief executive of DrugScope , said : " While we support the classification of substances such as GBL and BZP , the law alone is a blunt instrument .
LEGAL HIGHS BZP was first trialled as a worming treatment for cattle , but never widely used as it caused fits in some animals GBL is an industrial cleaner used to strip paint and remove graffiti and is taken in liquid form
Spice is a powerful herbal smoking mixture imported from China that gives a " cannabis - like " effect " We have concerns that in lumping all these substances together as ' legal highs ' , the significant differences in the effects and potential harms might be hard for young people to identify .
" It is important that public information and education campaigns are comprehensive and ongoing . "
Mr Barnes also said that while cannabis - substitute Spice should be controlled , there were questions over whether it should be a Class C or B drug .
" A review of the Misuse of Drugs Act was promised by the government in January 2006 , but was subsequently dropped .
" Given the number of substances being made illegal under the Act with the likely prospect of more to come ... it is even more important that the classification system is reviewed . "

IPod Touch as deadly sniper accessory ?
Awesome .

A lot of placarrds at the Tea Party protests expressed a sense of ownership , a feeling that something was being taken away from people , with the key form of this taking being taxation .
This is hardly a fringe position – claims that ( over - ) taxation is theft are relatively common fare .
Perhaps relatedly , there is a broader sense of robbery – that the country itself is being stolen ?
To what extent might leftist observers agree with or sympathise with this sort of thing ?
To start with I think it ’s important to distinguish ‘ simple claims ’ and ‘ exclusive claims ’ .
To have a simple ownership claim on something is to have a right to control and enjoyment of it , but a right which must be balanced against the like rights of others .
An exclusive claim overrules all others ( or permits them only as very secondary qualifications ) , and so if I have an exclusive claim on something , that excludes anyone else doing so .
Property as it exists in our society is , with some qualifications , an exclusive claim – moreover , an exclusive claim that persists unchanged over time , and encompasses rights of use , exclusion of others , enjoyment of further products , and crucially tradeability to any other person .
Its justifications , however , are usually valid if under stood as arguing for simple claims .
For instance , the fact of having expended effort and time to create something certainly gives you a claim to it , in that to be entirely deprived of it would not just be unpleasant but unfair .
But that need not imply that other simple claims on it , such as from those who contributed to allowing you to make it , or from those who need it , are necessarily ruled out ; nor need it imply that your claim on it fully possesses all the components of a property right , or that it bears any strong relation to the particular property - rights respected by our legal system .
By distinguishing the two , we can grant what is intuitive in various property - justifying arguments , while still denying their conclusion , and supporting communism .
This , in essence , is what is wrong with rights - based capitalist arguments .
With that in mind , let us look back at opposition to taxes .
The average person in a capitalist - and - statist society is greatly impoverished relative to what they would have if either a ) society ’s wealth were divided into equal - sized chunks and each person given exclusive claim to one chunk , or b ) society ’s wealth were partly thus chunked but , wherever convenient , made collective property in such a way as to maximise people ’s ability to use and enjoy it .
So overall , most people are alienated from social wealth .
Now we might think that people have roughly equal simple - claims on the accumulated social wealth – although over particular things one person might have stronger claims than another , overall the differences even out .
But do they ?
The short answer is ‘ yes ’ ; the long answer makes reference to the interdependence of different branches of both waged and unwaged labour , the role of socialisation in making labour possible , the amount which was produced by past generations , whose members are now all dead , natural human equality , and of course the falseness of all arguments for the existing distribution .
But I wo n’t go into that .
The point is that there is a systematic dispossession of most people .
And one component of that alienation is through the state and through taxation .
The way that taxes are collected is largely outside of even such democratic control as elections can exert , which is besides puny .
And the spending of taxes is similarly outside people ’s control .
Note that this is true both for things we might think are worth spending taxes on , and for things we do n’t .
The building of roads and provision of social security are very worthwhile things ; but insofar as the process by which they are funded is taken out of public hands and put into state hands , it remains merely a comparatively benevolent piece of dictatorship .
( Of course sometimes democratic control is exerted – people of whatever assemblage apply sufficient pressure to some part of the state that they are able to dictate the funding of a particular project .
But this is never more than a drop in the ocean )
So to that extent , we can agree with anti-tax protests : they show us people correctly identifying and objecting to their own mass dispossession .
And we can only applaud many of the items chosen to symbolise this general point : bank bail - outs , political corruption , etc .
On the other hand , we might also disagree strongly , and perceive in the expression that this feeling receives , not only the distortions of capitalist ideology , but also , I think , statist ideology .
Because taxation and state property is only one side of people ’s dispossession .
The other side is private dispossession by property - owners .
This is not just dispossession from one ’s inheritance , namely access to an equal share of the wealth accumulated by past generations ; it is not just dispossession of one ’s creation , through the extraction of profits from labour ; it is also through the everyday ‘ dispossession ’ of one ’s time and creativity by alienated work under a boss .
And because ownership is largely a matter of control , even self - employed people – even capitalists – even society as a whole is dispossessed of itself by the autonomy of the market and the drive for profit .
If all of this is correct , then the actual level of taxation is not a significant political question – the burden of taxation is ( who pays , who does n’t ) , but the essential idea of private property becoming state property is , fundamentally , a matter of indifference : one robber robbing another ( indeed , another who is in the same gang , for there are more shared interests than opposed ) .
The perception that taxation is uniquely theft , relies on taking the initial fact of everyone having a simple ownership - claim on the social wealth , and turning those simple claims into exclusive claims ( i.e. , property rights ) , which in turn requires splitting that social wealth into a great aggregate of commodities , each of which belongs to someone specific .
It then also requires supposing that the property each person deserves is roughly equal to what they receive in the ‘ normal ’ functioning of the economy – if you earn very little , you deserve very little .
If you earn millions , you deserve millions .
This supposition is n’t entirely divorced from reality : there are plenty of particular cases where someone ’s income does show a correlation to their efforts or productivity .
But one must suppress all of the conflicting cases in order to make this generalisation .
Taxation then takes on the entire weight of whatever sense of dispossession people may feel .
In a way this the state ’s rhetorical own fault : having presented itself as a neutral and impartial force standing apart from society that treats the rich and the poor equally , it sets itself up to be perceived as an alien and parasitic force that oppresses the rich and the poor equally .
Simplistic statism turns into simplistic anti-statism .
What might motivate the acceptance of this pro-capitalist view of who has claims to what ?
Certainly , it is widely and constantly available , endorsed by society , and thus very easy to ‘ slip into ’ .
But if it were slipped into , it would be slipped out of again just as easily , and not clung to .
What ’s the pay - off ?
That ’s a big question to which I will only suggest a short answer , which is that by accepting a socially - approved mythology , one can take on an identity situated at a privileged , accepted , focal point .
A prime example of such an identity in the Tea Party protests is ‘ American ’ : people claim for themselves the position of ‘ American ’ ( and associated ideas , such as independence , the founding fathers , hard - working , victory in WWII , etc. ) and thereby can situate themselves in a socially - endorsed worldview in a pretty good place ( a good place as in – in this worldview being American is fantastic , you ’re at the centre of the story of America inventing freedom and spreading it around , etc. )
I talked a lot about this , of course , in my last post , so I wo n’t go over it much more now , except to link this to the idea of ‘ theft ’ : “ I want my America back ” .
If that symbolic identity is taken away , whatever succour it gave against a more general sense of dispossession is also taken away , and that dispossession is added to .
Which brings us back to the initial distinction between exclusive claims and simple claims .
A ‘ simple claim ’ on , not accumulated social wealth , but ‘ the truth ’ ( not factual truth , but truth about importance , meanings , and narratives ) , is simply to demand that the mythology show you yourself , and the socially - accepted narratives situate you as a sort of protagonist .
And everyone has a legitimate such claim – that ’s what a culture is for , after all , allowing people to be recognised by other people as meaningful and important .
An exclusive claim , on the other hand , demands that not only should a story with you as the protagonist be socially accepted , but that it should be the one true story , and anyone not reflected in that story not be able to assert their own .
This has led us a little away from the issue of taxation itself , but I think it ’s vital to factor it into feelings around taxation , because there ’s more to ‘ anti- tax ’ views than money – indeed , there ’s more to money than money .
Money is at least as much about that sense of self - affirmation and being at the centre of a narrative as it is about satisfying direct needs .
In its guts , the psyche does n’t care much for distinctions between one form of self - affirmation and another ; and it ’s very very clear that what ’s coming out in a lot of anti-tax protests is coming from the guts of the psyche , not from scholarly economic opinions .
Ultimately taxes do represent ‘ theft ’ , in the sense of an unjust denial of people ’s legitimate claims on wealth ; but they ’re not uniquely theft , and reducing taxes in general would simply mean shifting one form of dispossession to another .
Really undoing that dispossession means advancing democracy in the economy and in politics simultaneously , and a skew to one or the other just gives that section of theives a way to shift their booty to a storeroom run by another branch of their gang .
Ancient Millimeter - Precise Ruler Unearthed in the Burnt City
1/31/05
Tehran , Jan. 31 ( Iranian Cultural Heritage News Agency ) -
An Ancient ruler with half a millimeter precision was discovered in the Burnt City , Sistan - Baluchistan , southeast of Iran .
The Burnt City which is located a few kilometers out of Zabol , Sistan - Baluchistan province , dates back to some 5000 years ago and belongs to a developed civilization living at the time when cities of the world were just beginning to form .
Recent excavations in the archeological site of the Burnt City led to the discovery of a ruler with millimeter measurement units .
Experts believe now that the ancient residents of the city used precise units for measurements and was skilled in areas of mathematics and geometry .
" During the recent excavations , we found a piece of ebony wood 10 - centimeter long with some cuts which have evidently been made with a sharp tool .
After carrying out the necessary tests and studying the wood under microscope , we found out that the cuts were divided in one millimeter and half millimeter measures , " head of the excavation team , Dr. Mansour Sajjadi , told CHN .
The piece of wood has therefore been identified as a ruler used in subtle industrial works of the city .
Its measurement precision ( one millimeter and half a millimeter ) indicates that mathematics and geometry were developed at that time .
Sajjadi believes that people have had other tools for measurement , but the discovered ruler was used in their subtle works such as jewelry creating , in which they were skillful .
So far many valuable items , including one of the first examples of animation and backgammon , have been discovered there .
Email is a powerful tool used by millions everyday .
For me , thanks to my friends and family , its a way to gather crazy story 's , interesting sometimes funny pictures , videos , and of course jokes .

After the recent controversies surrounding the treatment of Indian students in Australia , the relationship between the two countries may be about to face another test .
An Indian student has allegedly fled the country before being sentenced for culpable driving which killed one young Queenslander and seriously injured another .
Gold Coast student Dean Hofstee , 19 , was killed in Melbourne last October .
A speeding car slammed into him and his friend Clancy Coker outside a city hotel .
Indian student Puneet Puneet , 19 , later pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable driving .
Police estimated the learner driver had been travelling at 150 kilometres per hour in a 60 k ph zone .
His blood alcohol reading was 0.165 .
Outside the County Court in Melbourne yesterday , Mr Hofstee 's father , Peter Hofstee , said he was bitterly disappointed that Puneet appeared to have fled the country before his pre-sentencing hearing .
" It would be important for Dean to see that justice is done .
I certainly hope that the authorities manage to extradite him [ Puneet ] back to Australia to face the charges and finalise the matter , " he said .
Judge Lisa Hannan issued an arrest warrant for Puneet .
Victoria Police believe he fled to New Delhi using the passport of another Indian student on June 12 , just a few hours after reporting for bail .
Extradition a tricky process
Australia and India agreed to an extradition treaty in June last year but the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it is not yet in force .
A professor of international law at the Australian National University , Don Rothwell , says the arrest warrant issued in Melbourne cannot be executed in India until the treaty comes into force .
" For the time being , providing that the Indian fugitive remains in India , he would effectively be exempt from the reach of the arrest warrant , providing he stays in India , " Professor Rothwell said .
" Once the extradition treaty enters into force , Indian authorities would be bound to uphold and process the extradition request , and to seek to lodge an arrest warrant within India to seek out and detain this individual . "
Professor Rothwell says he does not think this case will delay the treaty .
" In 2008 in addition to the extradition treaty , Australia also concluded a mutual assistance treaty dealing with matters of criminal interest between the two countries , and since then of course we 've had the terrorist events in Bombay and no doubt the Australian Federal Police have got interests in matters that are occurring in India , " he said .
" I think the Australian Government , perhaps even the Indian Government , has made clear that they 're going to differentiate the recent troubles about Indian student concerns in Australia from other important aspects of bilateral relationships .
" So it would be hoped I think , and perhaps even expected , certainly in Canberra , that this would not be an issue which would delay the eventual entry into force of this extradition treaty . "
Late yesterday , Victoria Police charged a 20 - year - old Indian student living in Melbourne .
They allege Sukhcharanjit Singh gave his passport to Puneet .
Singh appeared in court and has been remanded in custody .
The head of the largest adult video production company in the world plans to start pushing for the inclusion of porn on the Playstation Network .

If Vivid Entertainment head Steve Hirsch succeeds , he will look into getting adult videos on the Xbox 360 and perhaps the Wii , the co-founder of Vivid told Kotaku .
" Our point is pretty simple , " Hirsch told Kotaku .
" As long as age verification is in place that ( Sony ) feels comfortable with we see no reason why adults should n't be allowed to access adult movies on the Playstation 3 . "

Hirsch said his company , that has an extensive catalog of films including Bad Wives , Seven Deadly Sins and Tristan Taramino 's Expert Guide to Oral Sex 2 , is in the process of drafting a formal request to send to Sony Computer Entertainment , but that they have not yet discussed the idea with the company .
Sony officials did not respond to requests for comment for this story .
Hirsch says they 've decided to broach the subject now with Sony because of the console maker 's decision last month to allow Japan 's DDM .
TV to bring on - demand Blu-ray quality HD adult movies to the console .
That service is only available in Japan .

" They had made it clear in the past they were not interested , " Hirsch said .
" Now that they have agreed to in some way allow adult films on the Japanese platform we are going to move forward and make a formal request . "

Sony 's reluctance to allow adult films on their platform is not a new issue , Hirsch said they confronted the same issues when Blu-ray first came out .
" We do support Blu-ray now , but Sony did not want adult Blu-ray for a long time , " he said .
" The way they stopped that from happened was that there was only a few places where you could get Blu-ray replicated and authored .

" For a long time it was only HD - DVD that would allow us to replicate in HD .
Ultimately Sony came around . "
And Hirsch hopes the same will happen with the Playstation Network .
The idea is that there would be an Adults Only section on the Playstation 3's online network , which already rents and sells more mainstream movies .
There are a number of ways to verify that a person is 18 before they get access to that area , Hirsch said .

Hirsch understands it will be an uphill battle .
" It is certainly something that creates a lot of attention , when you talke about adult content being put on any new platform , " he said .
" It is n't that dissimilar to getting it on cell phones .

" Certainly we understand there is going to be some resistance on Sony 's part when it comes to adult content on their console .
We all understand there are kids who use the Playstation every day and we want to keep content away from them , but there are also adults who use it . "
Vivid Entertainment is currently drafting a letter that they plan to send to Sony by the end of the week , he said .
And if things go well , Hirsch will look into getting adult content on Microsoft 's Xbox Live video service and other gaming platforms .

" It is something as an industry we would like to accomplish , " he said .
" If we move forward here we would look at other potential gaming platforms like the Xbox 360 .
The Wii seems to skew a little young . "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Four young men falsely accused of raping an 18 - year - old student at Hofstra University were trying to return their lives to normal Friday after an ordeal that two of them described as traumatic .
From left : Jesus Ortiz , Kevin Taveras , Stalin Felipe and Rondell Bedward were falsely accused of rape .
" I was really scared .
I could n't believe what was basically going through my mind .
It was like a big nightmare , and I thought I was going to do time for something I did n't do , " 20 - year - old Kevin Taveras told HLN 's " Issues with Jane Velez - Mitchell . "
" It was devastating , " he said .
" I was there just letting the clock tick and tick . "
Authorities dropped charges and freed the four men hours after their accuser changed her story about having been forcibly tied up and sexually assaulted in a dormitory bathroom .
" The woman admitted the encounters with each of the men were consensual , " Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice told reporters at a news conference Thursday .
The woman recanted her story Wednesday after authorities told her that part of the incident was recorded on a cell phone video , Rice said .
Watch Taveras describe being falsely accused »
" That was when she began to tell the truth , " she said .
Authorities have not released the accuser 's name .
" I believe that it is a question of potential safety for her , and the investigation is ongoing , " Rice said .
It is against the law to report a crime when none occurred , Rice said .
Authorities gave no indication whether the woman may face charges .
" Her actions and her demeanor depict a very troubled young woman in need of much help , " Rice said .
Hofstra University has suspended her pending hearings into the matter .
Only one of the four accused is a Hofstra student .
He has been allowed to return to campus .
None has publicly described what happened that night .
CNN affiliate WABC - TV of New York spoke with another of the accused , Stalin Felipe .
" We respect women , " he said .
" We know how to treat a lady .
The thing they said with the rope , come on .
That 's disgusting .
That 's what we were looked at as : disgusting men . "
" It did traumatize us , " Felipe said .
" I 'm just happy to be home finally . "
Taveras also spoke with WABC .
" It was traumatizing , " he told the station .
" It 's supposed to be innocent until proven guilty . "
They thought they might go to prison for 25 years for something they did n't do , Taveras said .
" We were treated like animals , " he said .
His mother felt as though " she was imprisoned with me , " Taveras told HLN .
" My whole family was imprisoned because of this . "
Taveras ' attorney had sharp criticism for police in the case .
" They paraded their photos in front of the media .
They held this press conference .
They released all these terrible details about this alleged rape that never took place , " Victor Daly - Rivera said .
The Nassau County Police Department had no comment , Sgt. Anthony Repalone told CNN on Friday .
At the news conference Thursday , the department 's chief of detectives , Steven Skrynecki , explained how the investigation went in the wrong direction .
" Initially , the story that was provided to us matched some of the physical evidence that was collected , " he said .
" There was n't a lot of physical evidence in this case , which made this case problematic , and which is one of the reasons why these types of investigations are always ongoing . "
He added that some of the evidence " was not available to us initially , so our actions were based on a series of platforms .
As information came to our attention , we evaluated that information and we took appropriate steps within that segment of the investigation . "
Hofstra University President Stuart Rabinowitz sent a message Friday to the campus community .
" The heart - wrenching events of this past week have shocked , unsettled and saddened every member of the Hofstra community , " he wrote .
" As we work through this very difficult period , I ask that we come together as a community with shared values ; that we make this a time of healing and that we find support and comfort from each other . "
He added that Hofstra " is a very safe campus . "
District Attorney
Rice said she hopes the case will not have a " chilling effect on how the public perceives claims of sexual assault and the willingness of real victims of sexual assault to come forward and tell us what happened . "

Stoltenberg : " We can continue "
Norway 's centre - left ruling coalition has won a narrow victory in general elections , near - complete results show .
With 99 % of votes counted from Monday 's poll , PM Jens Stoltenberg 's Labour - led coalition secured 86 seats in the 169 - seat parliament .
If confirmed , it would be the first time a government in the oil - rich Scandinavian country has survived an election in 16 years .
A total of 85 seats are needed for an absolute majority .
The centre - right opposition parties were expected to win 83 seats .
Final results are expected later on Tuesday .
' Four more years ! '
" All the votes have not been counted and it is close , " Mr Stoltenberg said .
Siv Jensen 's party wants to broaden privatisation in health and education
" But the way it seems now , it looks like we can continue , " he added .
And he the jubilant prime minister told his supporters at a rally in Oslo : " Four more years ! "
Siv Jensen , the leader of the right - wing opposition Progress Party , said : " Everything suggests that ... Jens Stoltenberg and Labour have won the election " .
Mr Stoltenberg , in power since 2005 at the head of a three - party coalition , has emphasised his success in guiding Norway through the economic crisis .
The Progress Party campaigned on a platform of lower taxes .
Ms Jensen also wants to see tighter immigration , and stoked controversy by claiming Norway is being " Islamified " .
More than 10 % of Norway 's residents have foreign origins .
They include many asylum seekers from Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia and Eritrea .
' Safe hands '
Mr Stoltenberg had said voting for the government was the safest option .
" The Labour Party has the best policies for stabilising the economy and protecting jobs , " he said after casting his vote .
The world 's fifth - largest exporter of oil experienced only a brief recession and has Europe 's lowest unemployment rate .
The Progress Party had pledged to spend more of the country 's vast oil wealth at home and to broaden privatisation in both the health and education sectors .
Two months ago , 4,000 US Marines descended upon the Afghan village of Garmsir in southern Afghanistan and managed to take the territory over which the British had battled over for three years .
Go big , go strong , go fast , their Brigadier General , Lawrence Nicholson , had ordered – and they did .
Yet yesterday there was a notable absence of arrogance among the new inhabitants of the British military 's most southerly and often most lethal front .
The Marines speak with nothing but respect for those who held this ground in far fewer numbers – the British servicemen who passed , as some might say , this poisoned chalice on to them .
If anything , there is muted admiration for how they coped with less equipment , particularly with their vehicles .
With roadside bombs now the Taliban 's weapon of choice and the greatest threat to troops on the ground , many in Britain have been calling for greater protection for British troops .

Yesterday , the US commanders of the 2nd Battalion , 8th Marines ( 2/8 ) who now occupy Forward Operating Base Delhi spoke with admiration of the professionalism of the soldiers that they had replaced – but equally of the lack of armour on their vehicles and the fact that they had women serving on the front line .
The British Jackal vehicle could reach more sections of this inhospitable territory than the Americans ' larger , heavier MRAP ( Mine Resistance Ambush Protected ) – which serves to point out the long - held argument that manoeuvrability is as important as protection .
But the young Marines were in no hurry to swap places with the British .
" The biggest thing I noticed was the vehicles they drive .
Your guys are friggin ' gutsy .
I would n't get shot at in one of those , " said Corporal Aaron Helvig , 21 , from Arizona .
Lance Corporal Sean Simmonds , 22 , from Connecticut , was one of the first to arrive for a hand - over with the Light Dragoons battle group .
" They know how to drive , that 's for sure , " he said of the British troops .
" They just go as fast as they can , they are not worried about being blown up .
It is hard to find drivers like that .
And their medics were awesome .
I would n't mind working with them again at all . "
For years in Iraq , the commonly held view was that the Americans had taken on the tougher fight in Baghdad while the southern area around Basra was the softer option .
Today , no one is any doubt that the British have been fighting and dying in one of the most lethal parts of Afghanistan .
Lieutenant Colonel Christian Cabaniss , the commanding officer of 2/8 , praised the British efforts .
" From my perspective , they were doing all the right things , " he said .
" They knew what they should do , they just did n't have the resources to do it .
The plan we executed on 2 July had been done before but in pieces .
We just had the resources to execute it all at the same time and stay .
That is the difference .

" They did everything in their power to make our transition smooth .
A lot of British blood had been spilled in the south and I see our part as a continuation of their efforts . "
For some of the younger Marines involved , the hand - over was the first time they had ever met a Brit and , one conceded , he had rather feared they would be somewhat stuck up .
Instead the clean shaven , fastidiously polite Marines landed in Delhi to be greeted by the sight of a bunch of " bad ass " troops in shorts and flip flops , long adapted to this searingly hot , harsh environment .
" They were easy to talk to .
I did n't expect that , " said Sergeant Andre Livsey , 22 , from Massachusetts .
" We always think the British have higher standards , would think of us as a little immature .
But we found out they are just like us . "
Lance Corporal Antwuan Browne , 24 , from Maryland , noted that " they swore a lot " , explaining : " We do n't swear when there are women and officers around . "
Once they got over the " incomprehensible " accents , the Marines said , they began trading in time - honoured tradition ; Marines gleefully swapping Light Dragoon or Mercian Regiment T - shirts and badges for their own , or their ration packs for a British one .
" You guys have got cool ass MREs [ ration packs ] .
That tropical drink mix , tell them they need to ship that to America , " said L / Cpl Browne who confessed to a new - found love for Scotch eggs .
Most of all , they stood in wide - eyed jealousy of the fact that the British , unlike the US Marines , allow women attachments to frontline units .
" I thought it was weird how the women interacted but pretty cool and they knew just as much as the guys , " said L / Cpl Simmonds .
A stunned sounding Cpl Helvig recalled : " The first day a British female soldier just walked up to the shower in a towel in front of us , took a shower and walks away . "
The Stars and Stripes now flies over shrapnel pitted buildings and sandbag fortifications of Forward Operating Base Delhi .
But the Union Flag has not disappeared .
The US Marines moved the flag a few feet along , to flutter above the memorial to the 14 British soldiers who lost their lives here .
Soon another one is to be built next to it , this time dedicated to the 14 men that the 2/8 and attached units have already lost in the two short months that they have been here .
" This thing is because of September 11 and it is more our fight but your guys are here to help us and it is extremely appreciated .
We know that not that many people would be here for the Americans and we think it is really cool the British are .
We have got each others ' backs , " explained Cpl Helvig .
Cpl Sheffer said : " It is like a brother situation .
We fight all the time but it 's just for shits and giggles .
Somebody outside , like Afghanistan , comes to fuck with you and you join up and kick some ass . "
" Yeh , " interjected L / Cpl Browne .
" Like brothers in arms . "

If you think that your mobile phone bill is out of control , that 's apparently because it is .
A new Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) survey has found that mobile users in the US , Canada , and Spain pay almost five times more for wireless service than their counterparts in the Netherlands , Finland , and Sweden , who pay the least . �
More generally , the report nicely ties together a few trends in the telecom industry : texting services have become significant profit centers , and service providers have cut back on equipment spending during the downturn .
The striking thing is that , by doing so , they 've managed to actually grow profits despite the economic turmoil .
The portions of the report that are available to the public indicate that , across countries , prices ranged from $ 11 to $ 53 for a medium usage plan of 780 voice calls , 600 SMS messages , and eight multimedia ( MMS ) messages .
That 's a pretty wide range , and North American users are at the top end of it .
As for the reason behind the disparity between US rates and those abroad , the CTIA , a wireless industry trade group , has already released a rebuttal to the report that attributes the disparity to differences in calling patterns .
Since the average US calling profile is nearly three times greater than the OECD 's " high usage " basket ( and , in fact , the average US calling profile is nearly six times greater than the OECD 's " average " usage basket ) , it is no surprise that most other sources show the price per-call ( or price per- MOU ) in the United States is the lowest among the OECD countries .
In other words , Americans use way more minutes than customers in other countries , so if you look at the actual per-minute cost , they 're lower because the US is buying in bulk , so to speak .
In addition to calls , SMS " continues to be a particularly lucrative market for operators . "
This news wo n't come as a shock to governments in either the US or Europe , which have been looking into how wireless carriers price SMS messages for over a year now .
Both AT&T and Verizon recently testified before Congress about their text messaging charges , and the two companies ' representatives denied that they colluded to double text messaging prices over the past five years .
The reps indicated that their companies were merely responding to Sprint 's decision to raise SMS prices , and they also pointed out that the doubling in message pricing only applies to plans that do n't include a fixed number of messages for a fee .
The text messaging trend stands in sharp contrast to the cost of voice calls , which the OECD study says have declined by an average of 21 percent for low usage customers , 28 percent for medium usage , and 32 percent for high usage .
The combination of declining voice prices and rising SMS fees fits with the generational change in mobile usage patterns , as younger users prefer text - based forms of communication like SMS and IM .
The study notes that many of the carriers are aiming their text messaging packages specifically at younger users .
The report also takes note of a phenomenon that was starkly evident in this latest round of quarterly earnings releases : bandwidth providers across the industry , from Comcast to AT&T , saw profits jump , while network infrastructure makers from Cisco to D - Link saw huge revenue declines .
Clearly , service providers are extracting more money from the use of existing equipment .
It 's good news for them , but equipment makers are getting whacked for the second time in a decade as infrastructure spending slows dramatically after a period of frenzied investment .
In any case , the report makes it clear that North American carriers have become extremely adept at keeping their income streams growing regardless of what 's happening with the larger economy .
There may be national differences in usage habits , but the data suggests that service providers would figure out a way to work around them .
The US Department of Justice has weighed in on Jammie Thomas - Rasset 's $ 1.92 million liability for damages , calling the amount perfectly constitutional .
In fact , Congress intended for such massive damages to fall like a stone upon even noncommercial P2P users .
Thomas - Rasset was the first defendant in the RIAA 's 18,000 - person war on file - sharing to take her case all the way to trial .
After two trials , she ended up owing $ 80,000 per song , for a total of $ 1.92 million , an amount promptly challenged as " unconstitutional " by the defense .
But the DOJ says that the range for statutory damages was clearly laid out by Congress to apply precisely to such cases .
The amounts involved were last increased in 1999 as part of the Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act , which " improved " statutory damages by raising the maximum to $ 150,000 per infringement .
According to Congressional thinking at the time , these amounts were not intended solely to apply to massive corporations ; the DOJ quotes an explanation from the negotiations that says higher damages are necessary because " many computer users are either ignorant that copyright laws apply to Internet activity , or they simply believe that they will not be caught or prosecuted ... "
The DOJ adds that Congress also wanted to " deter the millions of users of new media from infringing copyrights " by setting the awards this high , and that there is nothing problematic about this unless the amounts are " so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportioned to the offense and obviously unreasonable . "
$ 1.92 million for downloading and uploading 24 songs does not reach this threshold , says the government .
" We are pleased the Administration has filed a brief supporting our position , " an RIAA spokesperson told us .
" Its views are consistent with the views of every previous Administration that has weighed in on this issue . "
Statutory damages are certainly a useful tool ; as the DOJ points out , the actual damages can be tough to quantify in many copyright cases , and so statutory damages provide a relatively straightforward system for taking claims to court .
But the damage awards in this case and in the recent Joel Tenenbaum P2P case have been life - altering , bankrupting judgments when applied to young , noncommercial infringers .
Given the publicly stated antipathy toward this litigation from both federal judges overseeing the cases , the post - trial damages ruling should be worth waiting for .
Not helping Joel Tenenbaum 's case , however , is the front page of The Pirate Bay — which is now displaying a graphic of Tenenbaum labeled " DJ Joel : The $ 675,000 mixtape . "
Naturally , it provides a link to all of the songs Tenenbaum was sued over .
( For the record , Team Tenenbaum says it had absolutely nothing to do with this . )
Obama encourages more savings in retirement plans .
Is stimulus helping you ?
View photos CNNMoney.com readers describe how President Obama's $ 787 billion stimulus package has helped them -- or has n't .
WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Obama on Saturday announced changes that the IRS plans to make to encourage workers to save more of their paychecks .
" Even before this recession hit , the savings rate was essentially zero , while borrowing had risen and credit card debt had increased , " Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address .
" More broadly , tens of millions of families have been , for a variety of reasons , unable to put away enough money for a secure retirement .
...
We cannot continue on this course . "
Most of the following changes will take effect immediately because of rule changes made by the Treasury Department .
Auto enrollment in retirement plans :
To make it easier for smaller and medium - sized employers to automatically enroll workers into retirement plans , the administration will clear up some bureaucratic paper - work hurdles for employers to offer that option .
Employees could still choose to opt out of the retirement plans .
Saving tax refunds :
To make it easier for those owed tax refunds to save , the IRS will allow tax filers in 2010 to recoup their refund by issuing U.S. savings bonds .
Sick days and vacation time become 401 ( k ) money :
To make it easier for workers to rack up savings , the White House will make it easier for employers to convert ( or allow workers to convert ) unused vacation and sick leave pay into 401 ( k ) contributions .
Americans have not been good savers in recent decades .
Recently , personal savings rates have increased , rising from essentially zero last year to about 4.2 % in July , according to government statistics .
But even among those with savings in the bank , the nest egg is relatively lean .
Of workers 55 years or older , about half have less than $ 50,000 in savings , excluding their homes and pensions , according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute .
" Today , the administration announced steps we are taking to make it easier for working families to save , particularly for retirement , " said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in a prepared statement .
" Working Americans should be able to retire with dignity and security , but nearly half of the nation 's workforce has little or nothing beyond Social Security benefits to get by on in old age . "
However , the impact of many of the administration 's changes could be modest , since the changes will be voluntary for employers and employees .
Senior administration officials explained that the moves are meant to complement legislative proposal announced earlier to encourage workers to build retirement savings , which would n't go into effect until 2011 .
The officials said they 're not sure how much the new rules will help boost national savings rates but that they 're targeting those who are saving too little .
They acknowledged that a spike in short - term savings could hurt the recovery , but say they believe their changes will have a longer - term impact .
Most of the changes would not impose new mandates on employers .
For example , a company that does n't compensate employees for unused vacation and sick leave , under " use it or lose it " policies , would not be required to start compensating employees for unused time through 401 ( k ) contributions .
The measures detailed Saturday are in addition to two other Obama proposals to promote retirement savings .
Both seem to be in limbo , pushed behind bigger priorities like health care .
Congress has introduced a bill that would force employers that do n't currently offer retirement plans to automatically enroll their workers in a direct - deposit IRA .
Employees would be allowed to opt out .
The other proposal would expand the saver 's credit , a tax credit for middle - or low - income workers who save through 401 ( k ) s or IRAs .
The bill would allow more people at higher incomes to qualify for the credit and allow more low - income wage earners who do n't pay federal income tax to also benefit .
Together these moves would increase savings participation for this group of workers to 80 % from 15 % , according to White House estimates .
But the plan 's cost is $ 59.6 billion over the next 10 years , which has rankled congressional Republicans worried about growing deficits .
Poverty rose throughout the West and Midwest last year , as slowdowns in housing and manufacturing sent more struggling families below the poverty line , according to a report released Tuesday .

BECK FACES BACKLASH — FROM THE RIGHT ….
As right - wing media personality Glenn Beck has grown in influence , conservative criticism has been , at best , muted .
In early August , Rep. Bob Inglis ( R ) of South Carolina , who is n’t exactly a moderate , encouraged his constituents to “ turn the TV off ” and stop listening to Glenn Beck .
The audience booed the conservative congressman relentlessly .
A week later , David Frum , a conservative pundit and former Bush speechwriter , suggested Beck ’s rhetoric may be , quite literally , dangerous .
But these remarks were largely overlooked , and were not echoed by other conservatives .
It seems , however , that we ’re starting to see a change .
On Tuesday , MSNBC ’s Joe Scarborough blasted Beck , and argued that the Fox News personality may be fomenting violence .
“ You cannot preach hatred , ” Scarborough said .
“ You can not say the president is racist .
You can not say things that have very deadly consequences . ”
He added , in an apparent reference to the Oklahoma City bombing , “ I was in Congress in 1995 .
I know where this can end . ”
Scarborough also called on Republican leaders to “ call out ” Becks ’ “ hatred . ”
Right - wing radio host Mark Levin called Beck “ pathetic . ”
Rush Limbaugh referred to Beck ’s role in promoting conservative protests as “ cheap and disingenuous . ”
Peter Wehner said Beck ’s “ interest in conspiracy theories is disquieting ” and his daily attacks are “ not good for the country . ”
Wehner called Beck a “ roiling mix of fear , resentment , and anger . ”
Conservative columnists Kathleen Parker and David Brooks told Chris Matthews that Beck is “ baiting ” and “ empowering ” racists .
Today , Levin said of Beck :
“ If you ’re not going to be politically sensible and have a strategy and have an end - game , you ’ll keep winding up on weekly magazines , you ’ll keep making a lot of money , but in the end you wo n’t make a difference . ”
It ’s interesting to watch Beck ’s ideological cohorts ( competitors ? ) trash the self - described “ rodeo clown . ”
In fact , it seems as if Beck may be marginalizing himself in a way that will , if we ’re all really lucky , make him permanently toxic to those who take politics seriously .
For that matter , it should send a signal to mainstream outlets : do n’t let Beck become your assignment editor .
Even conservatives think he ’s nuts .
Credit card issuers have seen higher defaults
The level of people falling behind with consumer loans in the US hit a new high in the first three months of 2009 , the American Bankers Association said .
Rising unemployment was behind the missed payments , it suggested .
Delinquencies - payments that were more than 30 days overdue - rose to 3.23 % from 3.22 % , the highest level since rates began being tracked in the 1970s .
Credit card loan delinquencies also increased , rising to 4.75 % from 4.52 % in the last quarter of 2008 .
The US unemployment rate is now at 9.5 % .
" The number one driver of delinquencies is job loss , " said the ABA 's chief economist , James Chessen .
" When people lose their jobs , they can't pay their bills .
Delinquencies wo n't improve until companies start hiring again and we see a significant economic turnaround . "
* UN report : evidence of Israeli , Hamas war crimes
* US : Security Council need not discuss Gaza report
UNITED NATIONS , Sept 17 ( Reuters ) - The United States has " serious concerns " about a U.N. investigator 's report accusing Israel and Palestinians of war crimes during their Gaza war , the U.S. envoy to the United Nations said on Thursday .
" The United States is reviewing very carefully what is a very lengthy document , " Ambassador Susan Rice told reporters .
South African jurist Richard Goldstone unveiled the report in New York this week .
" We have very serious concerns about many of the recommendations in the report , " Rice said .
The Goldstone commission said both the Israeli army and Palestinian militants had committed war crimes , and possibly crimes against humanity , during the December - January war in the Gaza Strip .
It said both had terrorized and killed civilians .
It urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the allegations to the International Criminal Court in The Hague if either Israel or Palestinian authorities failed to investigate and prosecute those suspected of such crimes within six months .
Israel had criticized the investigation from the start and refused to cooperate with a mission whose mandate it said was " clearly one - sided . "
Both Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas rejected the 575 - page document .
Goldstone 's mission was organized by the Geneva - based U.N. Human Rights Council , a body Israel and the United States have long criticized for what they say is its anti-Israeli bias .
Earlier this year , the United States successfully ran for a seat on the council , vowing to try to change the U.N. rights body from within .
Under President Barack Obama 's predecessor , George W. Bush , the United States had boycotted the panel .
' UNACCEPTABLE '
Israel has rejected international criticism of an offensive it said was launched to curb Hamas rocket attacks on its towns .
Israel says it is investigating allegations but has not yet found cause to prosecute any of its soldiers .
Rice said the Human Rights Council 's approach to the Gaza war investigation was deeply flawed .
" We have long expressed our very serious concern with the mandate that was given by the Human Rights Council prior to our joining the council , which we viewed as unbalanced , one - side and basically unacceptable , " she said .
She also rejected one of the key recommendations in Goldstone 's report -- that the Security Council should now take up the matter .
Rice made clear that Washington saw no point in the 15 - nation council even discussing the report .
" The appropriate venue for this report to be considered is the Human Rights Council , " she said .
Western diplomats said temporary council member Libya was interested in debating the Goldstone report .
As a result , they said , the council might have to engage in a symbolic discussion of it but would almost certainly take no action .
Rice said the focus should be the future .
" This is a time to work to cement progress toward the resumption of ( Israeli - Palestinian peace ) negotiations and their early and successful conclusion , " she said .
Obama might meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly next week to restart stalled peace talks .

Hello Prodex
Ebook readers are almost as good as dead .
The proliferation of netbooks and phone apps have driven home the point that an electronic device that merely displays books is a doomed idea , something you 'd mess with in the Sharper Image while you are getting your free back massage but would never , never consider buying .
" Neat !
It even has a calculator !
" The amount of hope and longing that surrounds Apple 's mysterious tablet computer is proof enough that people are craving a computer with the same touchscreen and finger commands as an iPhone , but bigger .
A computer that works as both a convenient portable device and a utility machine at home when you have the time to set up all the necessary peripherals .
If Apple 's Jesus Tablet does not actually exist , it would be necessary to invent one .
Additionally , more and more people are waking up to the inherent problems of proprietary ebooks tied to proprietary devices , especially now that it has been long enough for the devices to start getting lost , stolen , and broken .
Consumers are realizing that those hundreds of dollars that they sunk into books for their device are gone if the machine dies .
Without a working Kindle , for instance , Amazon customers are not able to read their Kindle books .
Consumers who rushed into the ereading frenzy are realizing they got conned hard by first generation devices .
The market is now steering people toward Sony and Google who are making ebooks that exist in " the cloud " and are accessible from any peripheral forever once purchased , making them better than regular books , which ought to be the fucking point .
Last November , I wrote about a device I called the " Prodex , " which was the computer I wanted at the time : a portable touchscreen netbook with two screens that opened along a hinge and allowed publishers to create book scans that saved the formatting of real books .
Such a device would allow a transitional generation of readers to enjoy every possible version of an ebook , giving publishers the ability to be creative and controversial with their electronic versions instead of yoking them to a machine that merely displays a text file in sickly black and white .
I was mad about what ereaders were doing at the time .
The focus should be on the books , not on the ugly plastic devices that allow you to read them .
Ereaders should be working to let you read every possible ebook , not calling the shots about which formats are acceptable .
It looks like the good folks at Asus have given me what I want and are developing a computer that mirrors my fantasies right down to size and color .
They hope to have it out by Christmas .
The goal is to make an ereader that is both " cheaper and more versatile " than existing ereaders , attempting to add functionality and value to a silly luxury concept .
Here 's what I imagined : Here 's what Asus is building :
Of course , now I 've got other obsessions and I do n't think such a computer is good enough anymore .
Now I 'm convinced that soon tablet touchscreens will be as ubiquitous as the ficus , and that the next generation of computers will be more like puzzle pieces that you link up instead of discrete " computing stations . "
Computers are going to be much more like magic portals into the internet , handmirrors for Wicked Stepmothers , and the most successful companies will be those who make computers that are unobtrusive , invisible , light , and disposable .
But I like this new Asus machine anyway .
I like the way it looks .
I want to play with it .
Can I type on it ?
Can I fold one screen all the way back , like bending the cover on a paperback ?
Will people be able to see what I am reading ?
Will it also work as a sketchpad ?
Can it play movies ?
Will it display my favorite porn ?
Can I slip my dick between the screens , gently sandwiching my twitching manhood between the warm glass plates as I imagine that I am fucking the future ?
Here is an interesting Email from a Bank Owner and CEO regarding As of Friday August 14 , 2009 , FDIC is Bankrupt
ABO , who as been in the business 30 years , writes :
A comment concerning the FDIC - As of June 30 the rates being charged banks have increased substantially .
Risk 1 category went to 12 basis points from 5 , risk 2 , 17 basis points , risk 3 , 35 basis points , and risk 5 , 50 basis points .
Additionally , a 5 basis point special assessment is being charged on September 30 on total assets less tier 1 capital .
It is probable that a second assessment will also be charged in December .
The cost of FDIC insurance for a two hundred million dollar , 1 risk rated bank last year would have been around $ 8,300 per month or $ 100,000 per year .
It would have been much less in previous years .
For a 5 risk rated bank , which many banks have been moved into , the cost will be $ 1,100,000 including the 5 basis point assessment being levied in September .
While warranted , this will exacerbate the problems and ultimately hasten the death or forced sale of a lot of banks .
This will certainly mark the end of the banking model using wholesale funding and aggressive deposits to fund commercial real estate projects .
In other words this is going to come down hard on the FIRE economy .
It seems to me that the result could be positive with the elimination of worthless banks and the shaking out of a dead system .
In other words , a true restructuring that could generate a true recovery .
However , rather than a return to the basics of lending I am concerned that this move will hasten our national race into the abyss of a depression and the further erosion of small business .
For whatever it is worth , I see years of hard work ahead and tough choices to be made if we are to turn the economy around .
I am retired but still own some small community banks and can tell you first hand that the small town part of the economy is weakened but hanging on .
The average Joe is hurting and scared .
Most have never had to worry like this and just do n't know where to turn .
The core small business sector is also under pressure of varying degrees depending on the industry .
I have been in banking for over 30 years and from my perspective this is much worse than anything I have seen .
God help us if cap and trade passes !
Good Banks Pay For Stupidity Of Others
As of June 30 we went from being charged 5 - 7 basis points to 12 .
That is the lowest fee being charged .
We are in the lowest risk rating category , 1 .
Risk category 2 is 17 basis points ;
Risk category 3 is 35 basis points and Risk category is 50 basis points .
On top of the 12 basis points , we are upcharged a little more .
The definition of the upcharge fee is : " This FDIC board approved adjustment , applicable to all institutions , reflects the rate differential above or below the base rate schedule . "
In other words , it 's another way to get money .
There is a special assessment that will be debited from our account on September 30 also .
She could not give me an exact number but she said it is very likely our special assessment would be calculated as 5 basis points on assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30 , there is no deduction for goodwill or intangibles .
I really hate it that the good banks have to pay for the stupidity of others !
Capital Is The Problem At Virtually All Banks
I talked to a friend this morning who is retired from both the Federal Reserve of Kansas City and RSM McGladrey .
He now does consulting work with the FDIC , due diligence and other regulatory work .
He said the picture he is seeing is worse than at any time in his life and CAPITAL is the problem with virtually all banks .
The Next Bubble To Burst
Check out the footnotes to Regions Financial Corp . ’s ( RF ) latest quarterly report , and you ’ll see a remarkable disclosure .
There , in an easy - to - read chart , the company divulged that the loans on its books as of June 30 were worth $ 22.8 billion less than what its balance sheet said .
The Birmingham , Alabama - based bank ’s shareholder equity , by comparison , was just $ 18.7 billion .
So , if it were n’t for the inflated loan values , Regions ’ equity would be less than zero .
Meanwhile , the government continues to classify Regions as “ well capitalized . ”
While Regions may be an extreme example of inflated loan values , it ’s not unique .
Bank of America Corp. ( BAC ) said its loans as of June 30 were worth $ 64.4 billion less than its balance sheet said .
The difference represented 58 percent of the company ’s Tier 1 common equity , a measure of capital used by regulators that excludes preferred stock and many intangible assets , such as goodwill accumulated through acquisitions of other companies .
Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC ) said the fair value of its loans was $ 34.3 billion less than their book value as of June 30 .
The bank ’s Tier 1 common equity , by comparison , was $ 47.1 billion .
The disparities in those banks ’ loan values grew as the year progressed .
Bank of America said the fair - value gap in its loans was $ 44.6 billion as of Dec. 31 .
Wells Fargo ’s was just $ 14.2 billion at the end of 2008 , less than half what it was six months later .
At Regions , it had been $ 13.2 billion .
A State Of Mind
1. Paulson appears on Face The Nation and says " Our banking system is a safe and a sound one . "
If the banking system was safe and sound , everyone would know it ( or at least think it ) .
There would be no need to say it .
2. Paulson says the list of troubled banks " is a very manageable situation " .
The reality is there are 90 banks on the list of problem banks .
Indymac was not one of them until a month before it collapsed .
How many other banks will magically appear on the list a month before they collapse ?
....
23 . FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said the FDIC is looking for ways to shore up its depleted deposit fund , including charging higher premiums on riskier brokered deposits .
24 .
There is roughly $ 6.84 Trillion in bank deposits .
$ 2.60 Trillion of that is uninsured .
There is only $ 53 billion in FDIC insurance to cover $ 6.84 Trillion in bank deposits .
Indymac will eat up roughly $ 8 billion of that .
25 . Of the $ 6.84 Trillion in bank deposits , the total cash on hand at banks is a mere $ 273.7 Billion .
Where is the rest of the loot ?
The answer is in off balance sheet SIVs , imploding commercial real estate deals , Alt - A liar loans , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds , toggle bonds where debt is amazingly paid back with more debt , and all sorts of other silly ( and arguably fraudulent ) financial wizardry schemes that have bank and brokerage firms leveraged at 30 - 1 or more .
Those loans cannot be paid back .
What can not be paid back will be defaulted on .
If you did not know it before , you do now .
The entire US banking system is insolvent .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury Department should consider expanding programs to cleanse troubled assets from bank balance sheets if current efforts fail to restart markets or if economic conditions worsen , a U.S. bailout watchdog panel said on Tuesday .
The Congressional Oversight Panel said in its latest monthly report that toxic loans and securities continue to pose a threat to the financial system , particularly for smaller banks that face mounting losses on commercial real estate loans .
These banks may need similar stress tests and capital support afforded to larger institutions , the panel added .
It also advocated that stress tests for the largest 19 institutions be repeated if the economy worsens beyond the worst - case assumptions used in initial tests conducted in April .
Despite improved financial market conditions , the panel said a “ continuing uncertainty is whether the troubled assets that remain on bank balance sheets can again become the trigger for instability . ”
In an interview on Reuters Television , the chairman of the congressional oversight panel , Elizabeth Warren , said no one even knows the value of the toxic assets still on banks ’ books .
VALUE OF TOXIC ASSETS UNKNOWN
“ No one has a good handle how much is out there , ” Warren said .
“ Here we are 10 months into this crisis ... and we ca n’t tell you what the dollar value is . ”
Estimates are that “ somewhere between $ 600 billion and $ 1.5 trillion in toxic assets ( is ) spread across the balance sheets of the small and the large banks , ” Warren said , adding : “ That ’s a lot . ”
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner convenes the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets at the Treasury Department in Washington June 25 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jose Luis Magana
In its report , the panel said the Treasury needs to either assure that a robust program is available for handling toxic assets as they go into default or else consider a different strategy for restarting markets for the assets .
The critical report comes as the Treasury prepares to launch a significantly scaled - down version of its toxic asset program , a series of public - private investment funds to purchase toxic mortgage securities with $ 30 billion in government subsidies .
Last October , the entire $ 700 billion U.S. bailout program was aimed at buying up the toxic assets that threatened to bring down the financial system .
But due to the plan ’s complexity and with market confidence rapidly deteriorating , then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson quickly shifted gears to use the money for direct capital injections into banks .
Since then , Paulson ’s successor , Timothy Geithner , announced plans to entice private investors to buy “ legacy ” securities and whole loans from banks .
But accounting forbearance that allowed banks to avoid recognizing losses on these assets combined with large institutions ’ ability to raise capital after regulator “ stress tests ” in May reduced investor angst over toxic assets .
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TIME BOMB
The Congressional Oversight Panel said , however , that smaller U.S. banks faced billions of dollars in losses from delinquent commercial property loans and were far less able to raise capital and absorb losses than their larger counterparts .
An analysis done by the panel showed that under a scenario 20 percent worse than assumptions used in the Federal Reserve ’s stress tests , about 719 banks with assets between $ 600 million and $ 100 billion would need to raise some $ 21 billion in new capital to offset loan losses .
“ Treasury must be prepared to turn its attention to small banks in crafting solutions to the growing problem of troubled whole loans , ” the panel said , adding that it should consider using similar stress tests -- along with pledges for additional capital -- on smaller institutions .
It said triggers for further supportive actions could come if unemployment remains high and residential foreclosures continued to mount .
The five - member panel approved the report by a 4 to 1 vote , with a dissent by U.S. Rep.
Jeb Hensarling , a Texas Republican and the committee ’s only sitting congressman .
Hensarling said he could not approve the report because it advocated intervention with additional government funds when that may not be necessary .
“ It is possible that the toxic asset market is already beginning to heal itself and that the intervention proposed by the Panel could be inappropriate -- if not counterproductive .
“ For this reason , I think it premature to endorse one or more of the approaches proposed by the Panel , but , instead , suggest that Treasury and the Fed continue to monitor the toxic asset market , ” Hensarling said in an addendum to the report .
' Dung of the devil ' plant roots point to new swine flu drugs
-end -
Scientists in China have discovered that roots of a plant used a century ago during the great Spanish influenza pandemic contains substances with powerful effects in laboratory experiments in killing the H1N1 swine flu virus that now threatens the world .
The plant has a pleasant onion - like taste when cooked , but when raw it has sap so foul - smelling that some call it the " Dung of the Devil " plant .
Their report is scheduled for the Sept. 25 issue of ACS ' , a monthly publication .
In the study , Fang - Rong Chang and Yang - Chang Wu and colleagues note that the plant , Ferula assa-foetida , grows mainly in Iran , Afghanistan and mainland China .
People used it as a possible remedy during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed between 20 to 100 million people .
Until now , however , nobody had determined whether the plant does produce natural antiviral compounds .
Chang and Wu identified a group of chemical compounds in extracts of the plant that showed greater potency against influenza A ( H1N1 ) than a prescription antiviral drug available for the flu .
" Overall , the present study has determined that sesquiterpene coumarins from F. assa-foetida may serve as promising lead components for new drug development against influenza A ( H1N1 ) viral infection , " the authors write .

Had the US and rest of the world had similar practices , requiring users to carefully watch their megabytes , YouTube and similar services would never had been conceived , let alone put into practice .
Perhaps the carriers would have hosted content , under the cap , but then we would be in a world where they decided what we saw rather than the demonstrably better one where that choice is truly free .
There are costs to bandwidth .
But rather than being 15 ¢ a megabyte , they are in the order of 15 ¢ a gigabyte - or 1000 times less .
So if you are using 500 GB a month , you are costing your carrier $ 75 a month .
It seems reasonable that you pay for it .
But , in Australia , if you want to use 50 GB a month , you 'll pay $ 2.60 a gigabyte to Telstra .
Paying for bandwidth is fine .
Getting gouged for it is another matter .
It is not just Telstra , although it has a special role .
No internet provider in Australia offers a plan like they do in the US .
The best ones are cheaper than Telstra but offer more by dividing between peak and off - peak use .
They have not tried to grab market share by going for it and freeing people from dreaded usage monitoring .
Why is n't competition working here ?
It is difficult to say but consider what would happen if a smaller provider lifted its cap to 250GB and charged 15 ¢ beyond that .
It would attract a disproportionate share of those who would use that much .
That may represent a small part of the market but a large part of its customers .
Add to that the potential congestion caused by such usage - if concentrated in the evenings - on the equipment installed in Telstra exchanges , and that 15 ¢ a gigabyte may be something much larger .
Is a new outbreak inevitable ?
Yes , because the first outbreak never really ended .
Over the summer , the disease has continued to spread through children ’s camps and military bases .
Now many colleges and universities are reporting outbreaks among students returning for the fall semester .
And in the colder fall and winter months , when people spend more time indoors in close quarters , flu cases always rise dramatically .
“ The virus is still around and it ’s ready to explode , ” says flu expert William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University .
“ We ’re potentially looking at a very big mess . ”
Is the outbreak global ?
Yes .
Since scientists first identified the swine flu virus last April , it has spread to more than 100 countries around the world , infecting millions from Chile to China , and it ’s moving especially fast through Europe .
And there are more than 2,800 documented deaths from the disease , although that number probably understates the case .
“ We are at the early stages of a global pandemic , ” says Dr. Margaret Chan , head of the World Health Organization .
It ’s the first such flu pandemic in 41 years .
How bad could it get ?
The worst - case scenarios are dire .
The WHO predicts that up to
2 billion people worldwide could be infected in the next two years .
If the history of past flu outbreaks is any guide , several million people could die from the disease — 90,000 in the U.S. alone .
The disease strikes hardest at those under the age of 25 , children with neurological problems , pregnant women , and people with weak lungs or fragile immune systems .
But those born before 1957 seem less susceptible to the disease , possibly because they developed immunity to distant relatives of the virus during flu outbreaks in the 1950s .
Why is this bug so hard to stop ?
Most people have no immunity to it .
Swine flu — or to use its official name , H1N1 influenza — bears little resemblance to the typical seasonal flu viruses that sicken hundreds of thousands of people every year .
Those who survive a seasonal flu usually develop antibodies to that virus , which protect them from later outbreaks of flu viruses with a similar molecular structure .
But few born after 1957 have encountered anything like the H1N1 virus .
“ This epidemic will travel faster than usual , because the population is more susceptible , ” says Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health .
How sick do people get ?
Swine flu ’s effects are nasty , but so far have been much milder than truly deadly influenzas of the past .
As a result , many health experts predict that the pandemic wo n’t live up to the worst - case scenarios .
Most people experience nothing worse than fever , body aches , a sore throat , a runny nose , and , in about half the cases , stomach distress .
“ If you get it , you feel like you ’ve been hit by a train , ” says Dr. Harold Standiford of the University of Maryland .
“ But in terms of causing serious illness , it has not done that very often . ”
Are we prepared for an outbreak ?
Not entirely .
Hospitals are stockpiling respirators and breathing masks , and many schools have set up hand - sanitizer stations near building entrances and in hallways .
Health authorities are encouraging employers to develop flexible sick - leave policies , so that people do n’t feel compelled to go to work when they ’re ill — a big issue in a country where 48 percent of working people do n’t get paid sick days .
And public - health officers have drawn up priority lists for distributing the H1N1 vaccine .
Hospital workers , emergency responders such as paramedics and firefighters , and pregnant women and young people with underlying health problems will get first crack at the vaccine — when it ’s ready .
And when will that be ?
It will be months before there ’s enough vaccine to distribute to the entire population .
Pharmaceutical companies started racing to develop a swine flu vaccine as soon as scientists prepared a genetic map of the virus , but it wo n’t be available in bulk until mid-October , when about 50 million doses should be ready , with an additional 20 million doses coming every month after that .
By then , swine flu infection could be rampant .
“ I think the virus is beating us to the tape , and it will be the virus itself that will immunize us in the fall , ” says Vanderbilt ’s Schaffner .
How can we protect ourselves ?
With soap , facial tissue , and common sense .
Until the vaccine is available , the best advice is to wash your hands often , scrubbing for at least 20 seconds — about the time it takes to sing a verse of “ Amazing Grace ” at a normal tempo .
And when you sneeze , cover your nose and mouth with a tissue — or sneeze into your elbow , not your hands — so that you do n’t subsequently spread the virus to everything you touch .
People who experience flu symptoms should stay home until their fever has subsided for 24 hours .
Even with the strictest precautions , though , people are going to get sick .
“ Flu , like a hurricane , is a force of nature , ” says Eric Toner , a public - health expert at the University of Pittsburgh .
“ You ca n’t stop it .
All you can do is be prepared to deal with the consequences . ”
Why they call it swine flu
Pigs are getting a bad rap .
It ’s true that the H1N1 virus was first detected in pigs , but the virus found in pigs is not the same strain of H1N1 that ’s spreading rapidly through the human population .
The H1N1 that affects humans is a new mutation , which combines genetic bits from four different subtypes of the virus .
And scientists say that humans are at very little risk of contracting flu from pigs .
The risk , in fact , is the other way around — pigs are much more likely to contract swine flu from humans .
So do n’t blame pigs for your sneezes and aches .
Dr. Amy Vincent of the U.S. Agriculture Department has studied swine flu for years , and she says that if you get sick , chances are the virus you caught was n’t brought to your area by a pig .
“ The most likely scenario is that it came over in the mammalian species that moves most freely around the world . ”
That means you , humans .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt was recently captured in a picture by BusinessInsider , showing him using a phone that clearly sports a BlackBerry logo on the back .
It seems that the device of choice for the CEO of Android ’s owner is a BlackBerry Curve – strange huh ?
A lot of other people felt the same , for example Gizmodo ran a story that – while not scathing – certainly questioned Mr. Schmidt without holding anything back .
Here s a snippet :
You ’re telling me that the CEO ca n’t get his code monkeys to create some custom Android software that connects to a special server and does everything a BlackBerry can ?
And it does n’t seem like a one night stand either — the ratty Google sticker on the back of the phone ( presumably a Curve 8900 ) seems to indicate the thing gets some serious usage .
Could you imagine El Jobso ( or Phil Schiller , for that matter ) , toting around an HTC Touch Pro 2 ?
And I ’ll give you one guess what Roger McNamee and Jon Rubinstein are using ( three letters … starts with P , ends with E ) .
Tsk , tsk .
Do better , Mr. Schmidt .
I agree that an Android Phone should undoubtedly be the phone of choice for the Google ’s CEO … but think about it – do you REALLY think he should ONLY have ONE phone ?
Google provides services for virtually ALL mobile platforms including iPhones and BlackBerries .
In fact , sometimes Google launches products and services for competing mobile platforms before Android !
I think it would negligent for Mr. Schmidt NOT to be using and testing other phones both so he can analyze them from a competitive standpoint and so he can assess the strength of Google ’s products on the device .
I ’m not the CEO of one of the world ’s most powerful company ’s but I have 3 phones on 3 carriers :
G1 on T - Mobile Pre on Sprint Voyager on Verizon
I love my Android the most but I carry my other phones often as well and expect Eric Schmidt might do the same for similar reasons .
What do you think … should his BlackBerry sighting inexcusable or a necessary evil ?

Ladies , say goodbye to hooks and hello to magnets .
A bra design that relies on a magnet for closure is busting into the lingerie market .
Designed to be easy to clip on and take off , with a front closure that provides a smooth back , this bra is said to be a first for the Canadian market .
" We wanted to do something new and innovative , " says La Vie en Rose spokes - woman Candice Pantin .
It 's not the only magnetic bra out there .
On Wednesday , burlesque star Dita von Teese launched a line of Wonderbra lingerie featuring quick - release magnetic closures , but it 's only available in Europe .
Canadian lingerie company La Vie En Rose unveiled Magnetic Attraction earlier this month .
The line comes in three styles – the Boost push - up , the Daily lightly padded and the Au Naturel unpadded – at $ 33.95 each .
But just how powerful is this magnet ?
Can it be trusted in moments of stress , such as , say , a D cup running to catch a bus or busting out some new moves on the dance floor ?
Ashley Shortall , 28 , a student in George Brown 's community work program , wears a 36D and took the Daily model for a test drive .
Originally from Newfoundland , Shortall is a dancer who loves to jig .
And she was impressed .
" I jigged as hard as I could and the bra did n't budge .
" It is so comfortable and it gives a lot of support , " she says .
" The front magnetic closure is easy and super strong .
It really surprised me . "
Sarah Kurchak , 27 , a personal trainer who is a 34A cup , chose the Boost model , whose " padded push - up gives you that oomph you crave in a plunging neckline , " according to the media kit .
" I put the bra through the wringer .
I ran in it , did some plyometric ( jump ) training in it and even took it to a Muay Thai class and the clasp did n't budge at all , " Kurchak says .
Her bosom may have been a little perkier than she likes for exercise thanks to the padded cups , but otherwise she is impressed with the magnetic hold .
While the little magnet 's strength is a source of comfort for the girls , it is proving to be a source of frustration for the boys .
Having spent years refining his bra-opening skills to the point where he can undo the traditional hook - and - eye model with one hand , John Koplimae was not impressed when the Magnetic Attraction repelled his advances in an informal man-on - the - street interview in which the bra was handed over and men were asked to try to open it .
" It 's a lot stronger than I thought , " says Koplimae , 26 , a cook at Bymark .
" That is solid hold . "
" I need two hands with this , " he says .
" It holds so well there 's no way to flick it open . "

Adam Cowan , 24 , who takes gender studies at the University of Toronto , is not a fan .
" Why did they invent this ?
Is it supposed to make it easier ?
' Cause it 's not . "
It took a few tries before Shortall 's boyfriend , Pat Conway , 25 , an international relations major at U of T , could figure it out .
" It 's a mighty powerful magnet keeping in those guns , " he laughs .
" At first I was like , ` I do n't get this at all .
It 's not working . '
It 's a good design , it just takes a little muscle . "
Joan Chang , 25 , a producer with CBC Radio , has a more practical concern : " I 'll get paper clips stuck to my shirt .
I do n't need scrap metal accessories , thank you very much ! "
As for worries that a Magnetic Attraction bra could demagnetize a credit or bank card , Pantin says no such cases arose during testing .
" The magnetic closure is no more harmful than a purse or wallet magnet , if not less , due to its smaller size , " she says .
However , going through airport security could be a concern .
It all depends on the location and calibration of metal detectors and not necessarily the strength of the magnet , says Mathieu Larocque , spokesman for the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority .
Nonetheless , one anonymous blogger at Tremendousnews.com cracks , " Finally a bra I can open , and also hang on my fridge ! "
Ivy Knight wrestled with her Boost bra for 10 minutes before she managed to open it .
She later went through an entire workout with her locker key stuck to it outside her shirt .

Jim Rogers talked about US dollars while he was attending the China International Financial Services Conference ( CIFSC ) held in Guangzhou on September 10 , 2009 .
Rogers believes that the last 50 years is U.S. government 's journey into a huge debt and the U.S. government 's decision - makers are still repeating this mistake .
Measures taken by countries to rescue the economy is continuously printing banknotes , which will lead to inflation ( except energy prices ) , and this process will not be interrupted unless there are more banks close down .
Europe and the United States government have fallen into the vicious cycle of " issue bonds - inflation - issue more bonds – inflation again " .
I will not buy more United States Treasury bonds because the government is constantly printing more banknotes .
The world will never be a lack of U.S. dollars .
I will buy oil , minerals and stock of those companies which are engaged in the real economy .
US dollar economy has encountered major problems , the dollar index fell to a new low , and it will continue to fall .
If the dollar rebounds in the future , I will sell all the U.S. dollars .
My whole family has moved to live in Asia .
The story of the United States is over .
A new story belongs to China .
With regard to the U.S. Treasury bonds , Rogers thinks that both the U.S. bond market bubble and the crisis are growing .
He could not tell when and how the bubble will burst , but he thinks lending money to creditors for 30 years and only takes 3 % to 4 % annual interest rate is a very unreasonable .
In the short term , because there are more people to buy U.S. Treasury bonds , interest rates will be cut for a short time , but on the long run interest rates will surely rise .
Therefore , China should further expand the U.S. Treasury holdings , or else China will suffer losses .

Michael Muller of silentservices .de discovered a bug in certain smartphones that allows sender obfuscation for MMS messages .
According to the security advisory , an attacker can create a MMS message that cloaks the sender number .
This could essentially give people who send threats , scams and spams a free pass , as it negates any worries about their numbers being reported / exposed .
The attacker could also theoretically automatically download content onto a device , using a specially crafted MMS containing a URL .
The major obstacle to this is that automatic download is entirely dependent on the service provider the device connects to .
According to Muller , " MMS clients which do not allow access to content URLs other than that of the provider 's MMS proxy should be safe from the content , but are still vulnerable to the sender obfuscation . "
The bug was discovered in June ; full disclosure only occurred on September 11 , 2009 .
This bug has been tested on the following devices :
– Blackberry ( BB 8800 , Firmware : 4.5.0.37 )
– Windows Mobile ( WM5 , WM6 , WM6.1 , WM6.5 )
– Sony Ericsson W890i , W810i

Hymen : a thin membrane that surrounds the opening to the vagina .
Hymens can come in different shapes .
The most common hymen in young women is shaped like a half moon .
This shape allows menstrual blood to flow out of the vagina .
Imperforate hymen :
An imperforate hymen can sometimes be diagnosed at birth .
More often , the diagnosis is made during the teen years .
An imperforate hymen is a thin membrane that completely covers the opening to the vagina .
Menstrual blood cannot flow out of the vagina .
This usually causes the blood to back up into the vagina which often develops into a vaginal mass and abdominal and / or back pain .
Some girls may also have pain with bowel movements and trouble passing urine .
The treatment for an imperforate hymen is minor surgery to remove the extra hymenal tissue and create a normal sized vaginal opening so that menstrual blood can flow out of the vagina .
Microperforate hymen : A microperforate hymen is a thin membrane that almost completely covers the opening to the vagina .
Menstrual blood is usually able to flow out of the vagina but the opening is very small .
A young woman with a microperforate hymen usually will not be able to insert a tampon into her vagina and may not realize that she has a very tiny opening .
If she is able to place a tampon into her vagina , she may not be able to remove it when it becomes filled with blood .
The treatment is minor surgery to remove the extra hymenal tissue making a normal sized opening for menstrual blood to flow out , and to allow for use of a tampon .
Septate hymen : A septate hymen is when the thin hymenal membrane has a band of extra tissue in the middle that causes two small vaginal openings instead of one .
Young women with a septate hymen may have trouble getting a tampon in or trouble getting a tampon out .
The treatment for a septate hymen is minor surgery to remove the extra band of tissue and create a normal sized vaginal opening .
What Made Fight Club a Classic
July 28 , 2009 at 1:41 am
The guy - ness of it
There are very few seriously male - centric movies out there .
Sure there are action movies but those are carefully planned so as not to be too off - putting to the chicks that most guys will drag to the theater with them .
Fight Club committed a marketing sin in not having any female - friendly sub-plots but became a classic for it .
Chuck Palahniuk ’s ethic
The man has carved out a niche for himself among the asocial misfit punk - types .
He has articulated an agenda for non-conformist , nihilistic anarchy .
David Fincher managed to capture some of the appeal for the non -film - going audience .
Brad Pitt
Here we have a charismatic star , playing a character that is written to be charismatic for a director who knows what he is doing .
Fight Club was created to be a perfect storm of Tyler Durden - ness .
The fact that it failed at the box - office
This removed the Harry Potter pop -factor from it .
The commercial - failure aspect means that you can still like it and think of yourself as being too raw and edgy for prime - time .
If this movie had been a hit nobody would remember it now .
It would have been relegated to being a Brad Pitt vehicle and probably be considered extremely dated .
The non-materialism
Make a movie that seriously , thoughtfully encourages people to not do something that people naturally do and people who want to be different from everybody else will flock to it .
This movie provides a political identity to people who lack one , which is a brilliant marketing strategy .
The variety
This movie has a ton of little sub-plots and asides and fascinating minor characters .
Choke , the sucky little abortion of a movie could have had that going for it but the director lacked the talent and imagination .
Fincher made sure there was lots of little short - attention - span stuff that made the movie feel like an epic .

Have you ever yearned for more immediate control over your surroundings ?
No , we do n't mean Magneto car - flipping abilities .
We mean more like wrangling all of the gear in a room into some kind of understandable and connected system .
If you said yes -- and you 're a Sims aficionado -- you 'll want to check into CRISTAL .
We 're not talking expensive champagne here , we 're talking about the " Control of Remotely Interfaced Systems using Touch - based Actions in Living spaces " system ( c'mon , it sort of makes sense ) .
The premise is simple : instead of having to juggle multiple remotes and input systems to deal with a room full of technology , CRISTAL merges a Surface - like touch area ( your coffee table in this scenario ) , an overhead camera , and connected devices to form a frighteningly intuitive control scheme .
The idea allows for all sorts of handy arrangements , like being able to virtually drag media from a server on one side of the room to your TV on the other , dim lights in a particular area by swiping on that location , or draw a path for a Roomba to clean using the overhead view .
Right now this is just a research project , of course , but the team working on the concept believes costs could move down from the astronomic $ 10,000 - $ 15,000 the setup would cost now to a more affordable range .
Until that happens , you 'll have the video of CRISTAL in action after the break .

Why this engrossment in thoughts of wealth ?
Is there no one to guide you ?
There is only one thing in three worlds that can save you from the ocean of samsara .
Get into that boat of satsangha quickly .
15. jatilo mundii lujnchhitakeshah kaashhaayaambarabahukritaveshhah pashyannapi cana pashyati muudhah udaranimittam bahukritaveshhahThere are many who go with matted locks , many who have clean shaven heads , many whose hairs have been plucked out ; some are clothed in saffron , yet others in various colors --- all just for a livelihood .

Still in his heart , he is a wretched puppet at the hands of passions .

One who lives in communion with God enjoys bliss , pure and uncontaminated , like a child and as someone intoxicated .

Si hace unos años alguien hubiera preguntado ¿quién es el político mexicano que denuncia que Banamex eludió impuestos , exige al gobierno mexicano que no sea cómplice y solicita la intervención de las autoridades judiciales para que no se viole la ley ? , la respuesta hubiera sido sencilla : López Obrador .
Entonces , en agosto de 2001 , se había anunciado que Citigroup compraba el banco mexicano más relevante , y desde la jefatura de Gobierno del DF ya con miras a 2006 , el tabasqueño enarboló la bandera de la denuncia de Banamex y de su accionista Roberto Hernández .
Pero nunca pasó nada .
No llegó más que a algunos titulares en los medios .
A ocho años de distancia , López Obrador sigue con su discurso contra Banamex y sus dueños , y ellos tan tranquilos … por ese frente .
El que sí les inquieta es el que ha abierto el Senado , dirigido por el priísta Manlio Fabio Beltrones .
Desde febrero de este año , el gobierno de EU compró 36 % de Citigroup para rescatarlo de la crisis , y como Citigroup es dueño de Banamex , la administración Obama cuenta entre sus activos al banco mexicano .
El artículo 13 de la Ley de Instituciones de Crédito prohíbe que un gobierno extranjero sea dueño de una institución financiera nacional , pero el TLCAN lo permite .
Tal es la controversia que el PRI ha planteado a la Suprema Corte de Justicia que resuelva .
No es gratuito .
Uno de los principales apoyos que ha tenido el PRI incluso en sus peores momentos ha sido el de Roberto González Barrera , dueño de Maseca y Banorte , quien estaría interesado en comprar el pedazo de Banamex que tenga que vender la Casa Blanca en caso de que la Corte haga prevalecer la ley crediticia por encima del tratado comercial .
Para Hacienda es al revés : TLC mata ley , al grado de que para salvaguardar la rectoría del Estado sobre su sistema bancario como manda la Constitución , el doctor Carstens se conformó con un breve telefonema al secretario del Tesoro de EU , Timothy Geithner , quien le prometió hace siete meses que se vio obligado a meterse a Citigroup de emergencia que ni pensó en Banamex al hacerlo y que su objetivo es salirse lo más pronto posible .
Hoy el político mexicano que sale en los medios denunciando a Banamex , exigiendo a las autoridades no ser cómplices , solicitando a la justicia que haga valer la ley es Beltrones .
Esta jugosa bandera le ha sido arrebatada a López Obrador , quien cuando controló la segunda fuerza política en el Legislativo tuvo como estrategia la de no negociar , no ceder , al grado de aislarse y estancarse en el discurso .
Beltrones , en cambio , primero desde la tercera posición y ahora desde la más relevante , se sentó a la mesa , sacó más de lo que se hubiera apostado y hasta consiguió lo que López Obrador hubiera querido : tener a Banamex en problemas .
SACIAMORBOS
El anarquista detenido hace un año por los destrozos en la marcha del 2 de octubre está libre .
Se sospecha que colaboró en los butanazos y ya lo esperan en la manifestación conmemorativa de este año , agendada para el viernes .
A Straightforward , Honest
Approach To Handling
Family Law Affairs
Family law is unpredictable .
Finding resolutions to issues is n’t always black and white .
With many years of experience litigating and negotiating high - conflict divorces and hostile child custody issues throughout Miami , at Pacheco Perez P.A. , we understand .
As your attorney , our ultimate goal is to provide you with realistic , honest advice and guidance on the best strategy for your situation .
We tell it like it is .
Sometimes , it ’s not always what our clients want to hear .
But in the long run , it saves them stress , time and money .
In his last years , he became a national celebrity , memorialized in a poem written by Andrew Motion , then the poet laureate , and in a song fashioned from Mr. Patch ’s own words about the fighting in the trenches that was recorded by the pop group Radiohead ( “ I ’ve seen devils coming up from the ground / I ’ve seen hell upon this earth . ” )
He met it all with the same modesty , saying that it was not he who should be honored but the men who fell at the battlefront , “ the ones who did n’t come home . ”

At a time when a new generation of British soldiers has been sent into combat in Iraq and Afghanistan , suffering casualties that have stirred growing public disquiet , Mr. Patch ’s voice struck a deep chord .
War , he said once , was “ the calculated and condoned slaughter of human beings , ” too often sent into combat as “ cannon fodder ” by politicians who should have settled their conflicts by dueling among themselves .
“ Too many died , ” he said .
“ War is n’t worth one life . ”
As for the carnage on the Western Front , on both sides , he said all who fought , whether British or German , should be mourned .
“ Irrespective of the uniforms we wore , ” he told the BBC , “ we were all victims . ”
When he attended remembrance services for the war dead , as he did in London last November on the 90th anniversary of the armistice that ended the war , he pressed the message home .
“ Remember the Germans , ” he said .
At his funeral , televised live in Britain , it was these themes that shaped the service .
Mr. Patch told officials that he did not want a state funeral , and not a military one , either , at least not one with rifle or artillery salutes .
His coffin was draped with the Union Jack , and carried into the 13th - century Gothic cathedral by soldiers from The Rifles , the British Army unit whose regimental antecedent was the Duke of Cornwall ’s Light Infantry , the unit that Mr. Patch fought for in Flanders .
But no weapons , not even ceremonial ones , were allowed into the cathedral .
But the feature that would have been likely to please Mr. Patch more than any other was the presence , as honorary pallbearers , of two German soldiers in full dress uniform , part of a six - man contingent that also included soldiers from Belgium and France .
A German diplomat , Eckhard Lübkemeier , offered a New Testament reading from Corinthians that spoke of Christ ’s “ message of reconciliation . ”
[ digg- reddit- me ] This morning , I re-read George W. Bush ’s September 20 , 2001 address to a Joint Session of Congress .
You should too .
It is an impressive speech – both in its temperance and quality of rhetoric and how it so clearly set up the tragedies that were to come .
Re-reading the words written so near the aftermath of this attack , it is remarkable how clearly they foreshadow what came next .
It is as if the Bush administration never recovered from this attack – and never took time to reflect after those panicked moments when the towers fell .
Bush used the now ubiquitous formulation , “ We will never forget , ” repeatedly in the speech – though all too quickly , we seemed to forget all of those things he said we never would :
America will never forget the sounds of our National Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace , on the streets of Paris , and at Berlin ’s Brandenburg Gate .
We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul , or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo .
We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America .
Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own : dozens of Pakistanis ; more than 130 Israelis ; more than 250 citizens of India ; men and women from El Salvador , Iran , Mexico , and Japan ; and hundreds of British citizens .
Yet too often since then , “ We will never forget , ” is used as a code word for the other elements of his speech that came to dominate the polarizing battles as America re-polarized : from his declaration that every nation must be either with us or with the terrorists to his declaration that terrorism was motivated by the hatred of our freedom to his understated plea for more centralized executive power .
( I ’ve always found it interesting that the loudest voices railing against any curbs on government power used to defeat terrorism seem to live in areas remote from danger .
The cities – where terrorism is much more likely – are hotbeds of liberalism and civil libertarianism .
I , for one , work in a landmark building and pass through Penn Station , Times Square , and Grand Central Station . )
Ignored from the text are the pleas for understanding of those different from us , his appreciation for the support of the world , and his declaration that in our response , America proved itself resilient and strong .
But for me , the two most memorable lines are the following – at the beginning and then end of the speech :
Our grief has turned to anger , and anger to resolution .
Whether we bring our enemies to justice , or bring justice to our enemies , justice will be done …
Fellow citizens , we ’ll meet violence with patient justice – assured of the rightness of our cause , and confident of the victories to come .
This is the path not taken .
In our response , we often failed to live up to these words , these noble goals .
Our justice system was deemed too weak for terrorists .
Patience was abandoned in favor of short - term actions .
And all too quickly , the Baby Boom generation re-polarized along partisan lines as Karl Rove sought to turn what he saw Bush ’s greatest weakness into his strength .
And , in neglecting to reflect on the events of that day , we learned the wrong lessons – focusing on a “ by any means necessary ” response indicative of panic that undermined our power rather than the true lesson about America ’s core strength that was revealed in the efficacy of the local responses and in the only thwarted attack :
The best defense of our way of life , of our institutions , of our government , of our people is the American people themselves – properly informed .
We should never forget this – and remembering this day should reinforce our resolve to “ meet violence with patient justice ” and to stand for the civilization , freedom , the rule of law in the face of fear and terrorism rather than being cowed into preemptive surrender .

Turkish Red Lentil
Soup is super easy to make and perfect on cold days to warm you up .
One of the best vegan soups because it is super filling and full of flavors .
This post was originally published in 2009 and we are now updating it with new pictures and additional information .
If you happen to go to a restaurant in Turkey , you see that there is one soup they always have on their menu : Red Lentil Soup .
It is like the national soup of Turkish people .
Believe it or not , we can even have it for breakfast in the morning on a cold winter day .
With a lot of lemon juice .
I do n’t know a better way to start a freezing day .
If you need a satisfying soup that is not heavy and comes together quickly , this recipe fits the bill perfectly .
I can imagine the happy smile on your face when you have a bowl of heartwarming and tasty red lentil soup .
Even the smell coming from the bowl is so comforting .
How to Make Red Lentil Soup
Although red lentil soup has several versions in Turkish cuisine , I ’d like to share the simplest recipe here .
The steps are quite straightforward and anyone can make it .
The best part is that you do n’t need to soak lentils , they cook well in about 20 minutes .
Put everything in a deep pot , cook until tender and then blend until smooth .
Make an olive oil drizzle with spices in a sauce pan and drizzle it over the soup either when it ’s still in the pot or after sharing it in bowls .
Do n’t forget to serve it with a few lemon wedges .
I know I forgot it when shooting the photos but we never have it without squeezing lemon on it .
Is Red Lentil Soup Healthy ?
This soup is not only decadent and comforting but also super nutritious .
Lentils are a good source of protein and fiber , that ’s why it is perfect for vegans .
Plus , they have a low glycemic index when you boil them yourself .
It might be higher though if you are using canned lentils .
Also , it is low in calories .
To put it in a nutshell , red lentil soup is a great option for a healthy diet .
Lentil Soup Red or Green ?
I love all types of lentils and use them often in my cooking .
Red lentil soup is smooth and creamy without cream .
We mostly have it as a starter and have the main course afterwards .
I sometimes use a combination of yellow and red lentils to make this soup .
On the other hand , a green lentil soup makes a super satisfying lunch or dinner on its own .
Have you seen our Lentil and Spinach Soup ?
It ’s one of our favorite meals .
Can You Freeze Red Lentil Soup ?
If you have leftovers and wo n’t be eating it in the next few days , freezing the soup is a good idea .
Make sure it is cold enough before putting it in the freezer .
Also , keeping it in an airtight container is important .
A quick note about re-heating red lentil soup :
If it is too thick , add a little hot water when re-heating .
The original post is as follows :
I want to share a Ramadan tradition that is still alive especially in small cities of Turkey .
As it ’s hard for traditions to survive in big cities , they are mostly seen in towns or small cities where people have more intimate relationships .
On the other hand , people in big cities are always complaining that they do n’t have these old traditions any more .
One of the Ramadan traditions I remember is that neighbors exchange whatever they cook for dinner .
And this is mostly the responsibility of the youngest family member to take the food to the next door neighbor .
It was mine when I was a child .
Food exhange during Ramadan
Mom used to prepare a bowl of the dish she made and tell me to take it to our neighbor .
I must admit that I always wonder what our neighbor cooked on that day .
She used to empty my bowl and fill it with the dish she cooked and give it in return , which is the second part of this tradition .
That ’s why I love it , it ’s a very good way of sharing .
In this way , you have a richer dinner table .
And I think the significance of giving this responsibility to children is to teach them sharing .
Mom used to pick another neighbor next day and I used to take the dish to them .
I used to walk so fast going and coming back form our neighbor ’s home as I did n’t want to miss the time of iftar .
And when I heard imam ’s voice on the way home , calling for the prayer ( which means we can break our fast ) , I used to start to run !
Everything was more exciting those times .
But if there is no child in a house , you yourself take the dish to your neighbor .
When I talk to mom on the phone these days , she says they still have this tradition in my hometown .
Among the soups I learnt from mom , red lentil soup is my favorite .
Our neighbors used to love it , too .
One bowl was never enough for them , so mom used to send them a small pot full of this soup .
This is a traditional Turkish soup and you can find it at every Turkish restaurant at any time .
Earlier this year , anti-piracy outfit BREIN demanded the closure of Usenet community FTD .
After negotiations between the pair came to nothing , BREIN declared FTD a criminal operation prompting FTD to take legal action against BREIN to clear their name .
Now BREIN is counter - claiming against FTD , demanding $ 70,000 a day in penalties .
Founded in 2001 , FTD is the largest Usenet community in The Netherlands with around 450,000 members .
FTD and its software allows members to report material they find on Usenet along with its location .
This material could include movies , music and TV shows and this made it a target for notorious anti-piracy outfit BREIN .
BREIN says that FTD operates illegally but the Usenet community and its specialist IT lawyer , Arnoud Engelfriet of Ictrecht law firm vigorously deny this and are now taking legal action the Dutch anti-piracy outfit .
The background to the case can be found in our earlier article , and a more detailed report on the action against BREIN here .
Yesterday , while BREIN ’s site was still supposedly out of action following an alleged ( or Hoaxed ) DDoS attack from Pirate Bay fans , it published a further report about FTD , which was hidden on its site away from easy public viewing .
Strangely the same page at the time of writing is password protected and the report unavailable , but we have a copy and translation .
Entitled ‘ BREIN Demands Closure of FTD ’ , the anti-piracy outfit went on to say that if FTD does not close it will require a penalty of 50,000 euros ( $ 70,000 ) per day against the service , in addition to compensation and full reimbursement of costs .
BREIN said that FTD “ organizes and promotes ” Usenet content , most of which is illegal .
BREIN then refers to earlier discussions it had with FTD , noting that it asked FTD to cease its “ structural use of illegal content ” in early 2009 .
The two sides had entered discussions to see if they could iron out their difficulties .
Following on , FTD pro-actively modified how they operate to ensure that there could be no doubt as to their legality .
“ After we made the changes , we got complete radio silence from BREIN .
No confirmation , no rejection , nothing , ” Arnoud explained .
“ Only after several days we found out what BREIN thought – but only by reading the online news .
That was a huge disappointment . ”
The news saw BREIN declare that FTD was a criminal operation in an article titled “ You do not pay for it , it ’s unlawful ” and this led to FTD taking legal action against BREIN to try to clear their name by having their operation declared legal by a court .
Now BREIN is counter - claiming against FTD .
Tim Kuik from BREIN now says that it is clear that FTD “ continued their abuses unabated ” and that the modifications they made were only made to hide the “ true nature ” of the site .
“ It is a wolf in sheep ’s clothing , ” said Kuik .
“ FTD earn money with a system that exists by virtue of the huge supply of illegal content to Usenet . ”
Mirroring the disappointment felt at FTD , Kuik added : “ It is disappointing but illustrates that BREIN ’s outstretched hand has been cut off . ”
So what exactly does this claim for 50,000 euros per day mean for FTD ?
Lawyer Arnoud Engelfriet told TorrentFreak that BREIN did not ask the court for damages .
Legally they are barred from asking for damages – article 3:305a of the Dutch Civil Code says that an organization that represents the interests of a certain group can never ask for damages .
They asked instead for a penal sum of 50 k euros if FTD were ordered by the court to shut down but it refused .
“ The idea is that a court can order you to shut down but you can ignore the court , ” said Arnoud .
“ With the penal sum , you risk that the court will then sell your house or seize other assets .
In principle that ’s legal , but the amount is of course ridiculous . ”
“ Ridiculous also sums up my view of the BREIN counterclaim .
Instead of addressing any of the points we raised , they simply repeat their standard rhetoric .
Nowhere is the distinction made between uploading works and telling people that someone has uploaded a work for ( legal ) download .
And downloading illegal uploads is legal in the Netherlands , ” notes Arnoud .
“ BREIN is not known for its careful handling of the truth , ” he added .
“ They are a propaganda organization after all . ”

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has given a cautious welcome to Iran 's announcement that it will open a newly revealed nuclear plant to inspection .
Speaking in New York , Mrs Clinton said it was always welcome when Iran decided to comply with international rules .
The US , France and UK accused Tehran of deception after it admitted to the existence of the facility on Monday .
Iran says the uranium enrichment plant , near the city of Qom , is in line with UN regulations .
It maintains it wants atomic power only for the production of electricity .
But the revelations have raised tension ahead of next Thursday 's talks in Geneva between Iran and six global powers negotiating over Tehran 's atomic programme .
IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES
Iran insists nuclear facilities are for energy , not military purposes Bushehr : Nuclear power plant Isfahan : Uranium conversion plant Natanz : Uranium enrichment plant , 4,592 working centrifuges , with 3,716 more installed Qom : Second enrichment plant , not yet operational Arak : Heavy water plant
Key nuclear sites in detail Q&A : Iran and the nuclear issue Strategy fuels fears
The Western powers are hoping to persuade Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment programme , but are threatening new sanctions if it fails to do so .
Russia has also indicated that it may support new sanctions .
Low - enriched uranium can be used as fuel for power plants while highly enriched uranium can be used to make nuclear bombs .
Earlier Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the disclosure proved Iran wanted to equip itself with nuclear weapons " and that Israel wanted to see an " unequivocal " Western response to the development .
Iranian atomic energy chief Ali Akbar Salehi said on Saturday that inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) could visit the new site under Non-Proliferation Treaty rules .
' Very hopeful '
Mrs Clinton said after meeting foreign ministers from Gulf countries : " It is always welcome when Iran makes a decision to comply with the international rules and regulations , and particularly with respect to the IAEA .
" We are very hopeful that , in preparing for the meeting on October 1 , Iran comes and shares with all of us what they are willing to do and give us a timetable on which they are willing to proceed . "
Western powers have been urging Iran to allow access to the site
The secretary of state 's remarks came hours after President Barack Obama said he remained open to " serious , meaningful dialogue " with Iran to resolve the issue .
Failure to comply with inspectors could lead to tough international sanctions , he said .
On Friday , President Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown demanded that Iran allow UN inspectors into the second site .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Friday that Tehran had conformed to IAEA rules , by informing the agency about the site a year earlier than it needed to .
But BBC world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds says there is a dispute about the amount of notice that Iran is required to give the IAEA before a new nuclear facility becomes operational .
In 2003 , Iran agreed on what is called a Subsidiary Arrangement , under which it is required to tell the IAEA at the preliminary design stage .
Iran later announced that it had repudiated this agreement , but the IAEA says that no unilateral repudiation is allowed .
On Saturday , the chief of staff for Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the second enrichment plant would " become operational soon " .
Meanwhile Iranian media reported that the elite Revolutionary Guards would start missile defence exercises on Sunday , in a move which seems guaranteed to increase tensions further .

That ’s A Nicht Nicht , Toronto Sun
Photo of the Toronto Sun box at Yonge and Irwin by David Topping / Torontoist .
Eye just beat us to it , but the unfortunate juxtaposition on today ’s Toronto Sun cover — a huge ad of a shocked - looking Bruno beside the Sun ‘s usual blood and gore headline , this time about a “ City councillor ’s ex-lover ” found murdered — is , well , too unfortunate not to post .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Senator Max Baucus unveiled a long - awaited healthcare overhaul on Wednesday that would dramatically revamp insurance rules but does not include a government - run option backed by liberal Democrats .
After months of negotiations , the Baucus bill -- which would cost an estimated $ 856 billion over 10 years -- attracted no Republican support and alienated some in his own Democratic Party .
But Baucus , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , said the proposal would eventually win over Republicans and closely follows the framework laid out by President Barack Obama , a Democrat , on his top domestic priority .
“ This is a good bill .
This is a balanced bill .
It can pass the Senate , ” Baucus told reporters .
“ At the end of the day , there is going to be Republican support for this bill . ”
Republicans were quick to criticize the measure , the last of several entries in the long congressional process of overhauling the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare industry , and even many Democrats found provisions they said needed work .
The legislation would require all U.S. citizens and legal residents to obtain health insurance , offer subsidies on a sliding scale to help people buy it , levy fees on healthcare companies and insurers , and expand Medicaid , the healthcare system for the poor .
Instead of the controversial government - run public option , the Baucus proposal calls for the creation of non-profit cooperatives to create competition in the insurance market .
The $ 856 billion price tag is slightly cheaper than four other bills pending in the Senate and House of Representatives , which all would cost at least $ 1 trillion , and Baucus said it would not increase the budget deficit .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the cost of the Baucus bill could be even lower at $ 774 billion , would lead to a net reduction of $ 49 billion in the deficit over 10 years and cut the number of uninsured Americans by about 29 million people .
Some 46 million people in the United States -- nearly a sixth of the population -- now have no health insurance .
CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the Baucus plan was “ an important building block and gets us closer to comprehensive healthcare reform . ”
The Senate Finance Committee will vote on the plan next week and each chamber of Congress will take up initial versions of a healthcare bill in coming weeks .
Baucus led months of talks among the so - called “ Gang of Six ” negotiators -- three Democrats and three Republicans -- in hopes of winning Republican support .
The panel is the last of five congressional committees to take up a healthcare bill .
With congressional elections due in 2010 , Obama has urged Congress to complete work on the plan by the end of this year .
“ There are going to be many changes from what he has released , ” Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid told Reuters .
“ There are things in there that I do n’t like . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , also a Democrat , said she preferred the House versions which include the public option .

“ The House bill clearly does more to make coverage affordable for more Americans and provides more competition to drive insurance companies to charge lower premiums and improve coverage , ” Pelosi said in a statement .
Opinion polls show Americans are split over Obama ’s plans for the healthcare industry , which he says are designed to rein in costs , improve care , regulate insurers to protect consumers and expand coverage to the uninsured .
Under the Baucus plan , insurance companies could no longer deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and would be barred from offering limited - benefit plans or placing lifetime limits on coverage .
It also would create state - based exchanges where individuals and small businesses could shop for insurance .
The bill does not require employers to offer health insurance , but companies with 50 or more full - time workers would pay a fee for employees who obtain policies subsidized by federal tax credits .
The proposal also requires that health insurance providers collectively pay an annual fee of $ 6 billion starting in 2010 , with other health companies making smaller collective payments to help fund the reforms in the bill .
The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payors index was up 1.6 percent and shares of home nursing companies rose , with Gentiva Health Services up 9 percent at $ 25.04 and Amedisys up nearly 8 percent at $ 41.95 .
Nursing home operator Skilled Healthcare Group was up more than 5 percent at $ 8.41 .
The stocks benefited from less severe Medicare reimbursement cuts in the bill for the companies than had been expected , analysts said .
‘ NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT ’
“ We all know that while this is a very good start , it is not a finished product , ” Democratic Senator Kent Conrad , one of the six negotiators on the Baucus plan , said in a statement .
The bill has some proposals designed to ease Republican concerns , specifying that illegal immigrants would not be covered and federal funds would not be used for abortions .
It also encourages states to start pilot projects to bolster medical malpractice reform , a traditional Republican concern .
But none of the three Republican negotiators on the Senate panel -- Charles Grassley , Mike Enzi and Olympia Snowe -- or any other Republican has endorsed the proposals so far .
Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said the Baucus plan “ puts massive new tax burdens on families and small businesses , to create yet another thousand - page , trillion - dollar government program . ”
Some Democrats have complained about the concessions made to Republicans , particularly reductions in the scope and elimination of the public option .
Critics of the option say it would hurt insurance companies and give government too big a role .
Despite his support for a government - run insurance option , Obama has signaled it is not an essential element of any ultimate healthcare overhaul .
Senate Finance Committee member John Rockefeller , a Democrat and a strong backer of a public option , says he will not support the panel ’s healthcare bill without significant changes .
He is the only Democrat to oppose the plan so far .
The council received abusive letters after renaming the pudding Council chiefs have reversed a decision to rename the pudding Spotted Dick after receiving " abusive letters " and accusations of political correctness .
Canteen staff at Flintshire council had decided it would be referred to as " Spotted Richard " on their menu after " immature comments " by some customers .
The council now says the pudding will revert to its traditional name .
But it has warned any customers who act in a " childish way " to behave themselves or be refused food .
Spotted Dick is a steamed suet pudding containing dried fruit , and is thought to have originated in the middle of the 19th Century .
Flintshire County Council will observe proper tradition and refer to all dishes by their proper name
Colin Everett , council chief executive
The " spotted " part of the name refers to the currants , which resemble spots , and " Dick " is believed to derive from the word dough .
Two weeks ago , the council said the pudding had been renamed Spotted Richard or Sultana Sponge because of " several immature comments from a few customers " at its headquarters in Mold .
One Flintshire councillor , Klaus Armstrong - Braun , criticised the name change as " ludicrous " and said those responsible for the decision would soon be " frightened of their own shadow " .
Now the council 's chief executive , Colin Everett has said : " Although the majority have seen the humorous side of the story , the impression given in the media that the council might have been ' politically correct ' has led to some derision and , sadly , to a number of abusive letters being sent in from across the country . "
He said Flintshire was a " sensible " council and catering staff had used their initiative in ordering the name change following the " childish comments of one regular customer " .
It 's all the more ridiculous when we now learn that only one person was responsible for making smutty remarks which led them to get rid of something which has been a tradition for more than 150 years
Klaus Armstrong - Braun , Flintshire councillor
He added : " In full agreement with the catering management Flintshire County Council will observe proper tradition and refer to all dishes by their proper name .
" Spotted Dick will be back on the menu under its proper and proud name .
In future , any customers who act in this childish way will be asked to behave properly or will be refused service .
" Let common tradition and common sense prevail . "
Mr Armstrong - Braun , who was interviewed by radio stations as far away as Canada when he complained about the name change , said : " It 's a great victory for Spotted Dick and for everyone who makes it .
" It 's made Flintshire a laughing stock all over the world .
I 've had lots of letters criticising them .
" It 's all the more ridiculous when we now learn that only one person was responsible for making smutty remarks which led them to get rid of something which has been a tradition for more than 150 years . "

Me a kitteh now .
Meet little Molly Malone–our sweet girl who was tossed out by some Easter - Bunny obsessed family of jerks .
But we have her now !
She absolutely loves everybody –the kittens especially –and will leap out of her exercise pen during the day to go hang out with Mr. Peeps the Muscovy duck .
We are trying to get her to bond with either Emmylou or Tumbles–or both !– but so far things are going a little slowly on that front .
Will keep you posted on the progress … .
So I got a Google Wave developer sandbox account .
If you do n’t know what Google Wave is , you ’ve probably been living under a rock , and you should go check out the aforementioned link .
It has a nifty video demonstrating various parts of it .
I ’ve had time to play with it for a while now , and while it ’s a pretty cool concept , is it actually useful for anything , or will it be ?
Wave terminology
To understand Wave better , you need to know about what the terminology used means .
A wave is kind of like a thread in a forum , except anyone can modify it ( no read - only mode at the moment ) .
Waves consist of blips , which are single entries in the wave by users or robots .
By default , waves are private .
However , you can invite other users or robots to participate in your wave , or make it public .
A robot is an artificial Wave - client .
When a human user uses the browser as the client , a robot is just a programmed client running on a server .
Kind of like an IRC bot .
Robots can do everything a human wave user can – they can post blips , edit them , etc .
Waves can also include gadgets .
They are similar to iGoogle gadgets , for example it could be a chess board or a map .
Gadget state is synced to all participants of a wave , so you could play a game of chess with your friend on wave ( after they make it so that you ca n’t move the opponent ’s pieces , but let ’s not get stuck on the small details ;) )
Here ’s a screenshot from Wave with wave and blip indicated :
( click for bigger image )
Robots and gadgets
I think a big part of Wave is robots and gadgets , because they allow anyone to extend the functionality provided by the “ base ” .
The sharp eyed might have noticed some robots in the above screenshot : Calcbot , Rssybot , Graphy , Tweety , Wikify and Wave Live Messenger .
Calcbot is essentially a calculator .
The screenshot above includes a blip from calcbot , displaying its usage instructions .
Rssybot allows you to embed any RSS feed into any wave , making it a feed - reader replacement , as you could store your favorite RSS feeds as waves into a folder
Graphy draws graphs .
There ’s a small graph showing in the screenshot as well .
Tweety allows you to use twitter through Wave .
It seemed to work rather well , with one exception :
It did not update new tweets from your timeline .
However , it would seem this is merely because the person who wrote it has not implemented it yet
Wikify allows you to easily embed links to wikipedia into waves
Wave Live Messenger , as you might guess from the name , allows you to chat with your Windows Live Messenger buddies through a wave .
It worked , but it is rather rudimentary at this point , and a bit buggy
These are just some bots I tried .
There ’s a lot more , like a bot which converts text into pirate speec ( yarrrr ! ) , and as said , anyone can write their own bots .
Hopefully someone will write a bot which implements libpurple and allows you to use the most popular instant messengers via wave .
That would be very cool , and as Wave Live Messenger demonstrates , very much possible .
I have not tried many gadgets , mostly because I could n’t find any definite source for good Wave - compatible gadgets .
However , there are several ones that Wave shows by default , such as the chessboard visible in the screenshot , a Google Maps gadget where you can place markers for anyone to see , a “ Who ’s coming ? ” gadget etc .
You could also think of embedding youtube videos into waves as being a gadget .
Yep , just paste a link from YouTube and Wave will display a little icon which you can use to turn it into an embedded video , which also works quite nicely .
User interface
The user interface is pretty similar to Gmail or other mail clients .
However , it ’s possible to customize it nicely , for example you can resize each column , or hide them .
You can also minimize a wave into the area on top , which could be useful if you have a wave where you chat with your friends – similar to having an IM window or an IRC channel open .
The UI also shows various hints when you move the cursor around .
Hovering over a blip will display some buttons you can use to interact with it , such as reply to or edit the wave .
In general , it ’s very responsive , which makes it nice to use .
Stability and usability
A concern from some is that this a very ambitious project that ’s might not work out .
The good news is that it works just fine .
Not in Opera ( stop being lazy bums , Google ! ) , though , but I ’ve used it in Firefox 3 and Chrome where it works quite well .
There have been some days with a lot of downtime or slowness , but that ’s probably because it ’s not quite there yet .
Sometimes the Wave updates also seem to break the robots , but once again this is probably due to the fact that the API is not 100 % stable yet either .
Wave is a viable email / IM replacement and more
This sums up my opinion of Wave :
It is very much a viable email and IM replacement .
You can think of various other uses too : A forum , a personal / group wiki … Facebook replacement …
It ’s a very viable IM and Twitter client too , as the robots show – just needs some more polish .
However , right now it ’s not very useful .
This is because it ’s not very likely that anyone you know is using it ( unless you work at Google ) .
At the moment it ’s also a bit difficult to “ moderate ” a wave – you ca n’t lock or make it read - only , so every participant can edit everything .
I hear things to limit editability are coming later , but even with them it may require some rules and restraint from the participants to make it easier to follow a conversation .
I think what Wave can be largely rests on the users :
It depends on what kind of robots and gadgets people write .
Without them , it still will be a good alternative for email and IM and perhaps some other uses , but with them it can be much more , and even the email / IM stuff will be much better .
Other things that might be cool to see on Wave would be integration of spreadsheets / documents , or perhaps I should try making my JavaScript tank - game TankWar Online a gadget ...
Would be neat to play it on Wave with multiple players .
Have you used Wave ?
What do you think ?
It 's the ultimate case of the one that got away .
Two teenage boys on Friday handed police almost $ 100,000 cash they found earlier this month during a fishing trip at Tuntable Creek , north of Lismore on the NSW north coast .
They recently told a carer about their ultimate catch and after seeking legal advice , decided to alert police .
Officers searched the area where the boys say they found the cash but failed to find anything to help inquiries .
Police are now looking for the lawful owner of the money .
Anyone with information is urged to contact Lismore police station .

We 're receiving more tips as we approach the Motorola Android event on September 10 .
An Android Atlas reader with access to the Motorola Sholes sent in pictures that show off the new look for Android Market .
The tip is unconfirmed , but based on the information that was provided , I 'd say the screenshots are real .
Please keep in mind that these reflect a work in progress and the final look could change .
The pictures below reveal an updated user interface .
The new Market has buttons for Top Paid , Top Free , and Just In .
There 's also a search button in the upper corner of the screen .
Most of these features were previously available , but were buried in the menu system .
The top level listing also gives a preview of which apps are in each category .
The update appears to be mainly a face - lift , so there 's no word on additional features .
The tipster noted , however , that this version of the Market was available in a Donut build of Android .
The Motorola Sholes will ship with Eclair , so we should see this Market update on other Android phones before Sholes launches later this year .

We got terrible news .
A friend that B used to work with , “ Big Keith , ” is missing .
Such a nice guy , big and friendly and cute and good natured and happy .
He ’s a firefighter and I think nearly his entire squad is gone .
The last time I saw Big Keith was at Sugar in December , and I remember I asked him if he was still thinking about joining the fire department and he replied “ I ’m IN the fire department ! ” — so we chatted like wow how fast time flies , the last time I had seen him he was just talking about thinking about joining .
And he bought me a cup of coffee another night too and I felt weird , I was n’t sure which was more insulting — to offer him money for it or not .
I did n’t know the protocol , back at the Gatien ’s nobody offered money , they just went and got it the next time .
Big Keith was in the movie
The Professional and he was great in it really , even though it was a small role .
He played Benny ( one of the corrupt cops ) and he has one awesome scene where he is standing in the hallway with his gun drawn , nervous and shaking and sweating .
Actually he is so remarkable I mentioned him in “ The Ministry of Speed ” too , and I guess it ’s silly but I liked to imagine my film would actually get made one day and Keith could play one of the doormen and it would actually be the real him they were referring to in the dialogue .
Something like that .
I remember one time Keith and I were chatting outside Naked Lunch and I was recounting to him how I ’d taped The Professional on the VCR and then I realized “ oh whoops you probably do n’t want to hear that do you ? ” thinking it was bad I had videotaped it instead of paying to see it in a theatre .
And eeheee he was cute he insisted “ No ! HBO is good , I ’ll take HBO ! ”
And B says his wife is in denial like she just expects him to come walking in the door any second and my God who can blame her ?
Because he was just so big and able and strong it seemed like nothing could ever take him down .
Oh my God knock on wood but if something like that were to happen to B , I would be the exact same way , I would have to see it with my own two eyes .
It ’s just not the way things are supposed to be .
B was really upset when he told me .
I remember all the funny stories he used to tell about working the door at Naked Lunch , how Keith would just make him laugh and laugh all night long .
Even though B hated doorkeeping so much I know he looks back fondly and proudly because of all the good guys he knows because of it .
And even though I do n’t really want to share this with those people , I feel like I want to say something to the Project Greenlighters , all those movie lovers , like they should go out and buy The Professional and tell all their friends , I just want everyone to know when they watch that movie they should look out for him and they can see how great he was and be proud for him he is such a hero .
But I am afraid it will just come out stupid or corny or something .

A man who produced a do - it - yourself jihad book has been sentenced to 12 years in prison in Australia .
Bela Khazaal was found guilty last September of producing a 110 - page book , in Arabic , entitled Provisions Of The Rules of Jihad .
This advised about terrorist acts such as exploding bombs , shooting down planes and assassinating people such as former US President George W Bush .
Khazaal had claimed his book was never intended to incite terrorist acts .
At his sentencing in Sydney , Justice Megan Latham said she found it " unsurprising " a jury had rejected his defence .
" It beggars belief that a person of average intelligence who has devoted themselves to the study of Islam over some years would fail to recognise the nature of the material , " she said .
" The dissemination of extremist activity , connected or unconnected with a terrorist plot , is caught by the government 's ( anti- terror ) scheme ... ( because such material ) is capable and is shown to foment terrorist activity . "
Khazaal , a former Lebanon - born Qantas Airways baggage - handler , compiled the book from a range of Internet sources , his lawyer George Thomas told the court at an earlier sentencing hearing .
Its full title is Provisions Of The Rules of Jihad - Short Judicial Rulings And Organisational Instructions For Fighters And Mujahideen Against Infidels .
He is the first person to be convicted on the charge of making a document connected with assistance in a terrorist act , which carries a maximum jail term of 15 years .
The Sydney Morning Herald reported that US international terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann , who was called as a witness at Khazaal 's trial , described the book as a " do - it - yourself jihad " manual , aimed at people who " do n't have Osama bin Laden 's telephone number " .
The Supreme Court heard that , in December 2003 , a military court in Lebanon sentenced Khazaal to 10 years ' hard labour for terrorism - related offences , including forming a terrorist association for the purpose of committing crimes against people and property .
You 're not as different from Albert Einstein and Charles Darwin after all , at least when it comes to patterns of correspondence .
A new Northwestern University study of human behavior has determined that those who wrote letters using pen and paper -- long before electronic mail existed -- did so in a pattern similar to the way people use e-mail today .
The study , published today by the journal Science , demonstrates the similarity of these two seemingly different activities , with the underlying pattern of human activity linking letters and e-mails .
The researchers examined extensive letter correspondence records of 16 famous writers , performers , politicians and scientists , including Einstein , Darwin , Sigmund Freud , Karl Marx , and Ernest Hemingway , and found that the 16 individuals sent letters randomly but in cycles .
The same mathematical model the Northwestern team used in a previous study to explain e-mail behavior now has been shown to apply to the letter writers .
This refutes the rational model , which says that people are driven foremost by responding to others .
No matter what their profession , all the letter writers behaved the same way .
They adhered to a circadian cycle ; they tended to write a number of letters at one sitting , which is more efficient ; and when they wrote had more to do with chance and circumstances than a rational approach of writing the most important letter first .
" We are interested in identifying and understanding patterns of human behavior , in learning how we make choices , " said Luís Amaral , professor of chemical and biological engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science .
Amaral led the research .
" There are patterns to how we spend our days , and these models of probability , of how people allocate their time to do certain tasks , can be applied to many different areas . "
" People are not that rational , " added Amaral , who also is an Early Career Scientist with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
" If a doctor , for example , better understands how we make decisions , he or she may be able to get better compliance with a treatment if it is tied to something a person does with regularity . "
The researchers studied correspondence that dated as far back as 1574 for philosopher Sir Francis Bacon and as recently , in the case of writer Carl Sandburg , as 1966 .
The letter data for the 16 individuals included a list of letters sent and , for each letter , the name of the sender , the name of the recipient and the date it was written .
More information :
The title of the Science paper is " On Universality in Human Correspondence Activity . "
In addition to Amaral , other authors of the paper are R. Dean Malmgren , Daniel B. Stouffer and Andriana S. L. O. Campanharo .

Plenty of young children think of their fathers as heroes , and a group of dads campaigning for their parental rights has taken that quite literally .
" New Fathers 4 Justice " ( formerly " Fathers 4 Justice " ) , is a U.K. - based group started by Matt O'Connor in 2000 that protests for fathers ' rights by donning superhero garb .
reddit_title= 'How A College Library Is Used [ Graphic ] ' ; reddit_url= '
http://comicsalliance.com/2009/09/11/dads-dressed-as-superheroes-family-court-reform/'; reddit_newwindow='1 ' ;
The group apparently has n't been successful at changing family court law or modifying the justice system in the traditional sense , but its protests and demonstrations have received mega media attention .
Some of the most memorable include a man climbing the Tower Bridge dressed as Spider - Man ; throwing condoms full of purple flour at then - Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2004 ; scaling Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman in 2006 , and standing atop the ancient monument of Stonehenge to protest the " stone age " British legal system in 2007 .
Take a look at a video of Fathers 4 Justice protesting dressed as Superman on the roof of British Leader of the House of Commons Harriet Harman , after the jump .
This summer they returned , when a man dressed as Captain America and another father dressed as Bananaman climbed construction cranes in South Wales displaying a " Where 's Daddy " banner until their eventual arrest .
The New Fathers 4 Justice name change came after O'Connor shut down the group following allegations that F4J members had plotted to kidnap former British Prime Minister Tony Blair 's young son .
Like a lot of costumed teams , O'Connor had to shed some loose cannons on the team to make the group effective again , and being a marketing professional , the name acts as a rebranding solution .
The media coverage of the group has inspired other F4J groups here in the United States as well as Canada .
In July members of the US group marched on Washington D.C. and climbed atop the Lincoln Memorial in support of legislation reform in the family court system and , prior to that , an Ohio father dressed as Spider - Man stood on top of a crane on the Ohio Statue University campus for more than 48 hours .
It remains to be seen whether the legal aims of any of the international F4Js will be met ( it 's important to note the affiliation exists in name only ) , but until then it seems they 'll continue to provide a conversation starter for a heated social issue in a colorful way .

A Shadow is prepared for flight over Iraq in this file photo
An unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) belonging to the US military has crashed in the northern Iraq city of Mosul .
The Shadow drone struck the roof of the Islamic Party 's office .
The UAV then bounced down into the building 's yard , and is not thought to have been shot down .
No injuries were reported and Major Derrick Cheng says the location of the crash is a pure coincidence .
Party member Yahya Abid Mahjob said the party was requesting that the military take greater care with their UAVs .
The Shadow , which is an unarmed reconnaissance plane , has been retrieved by US forces .
Earlier this month , another US UAV crashed in central Iraq .
The Predator came down without causing damage or injuries .
It is a larger vehicle capable of firing Hellfire missiles .

Japanese researchers have made ultra - thin metal wires by growing them inside carbon nanotubes .
It is hoped that the research - which can make wires only a single atom in diameter - could provide interesting clues to the best components for future nanoelectronic devices .
Atom - thin metal wires show many novel electronic properties - but the wires are so fragile and prone to oxidation that they have been difficult to study .
Ryo Kitaura and colleagues at Nagoya University solved this problem by growing the wires encased within protective nanotubes .
This means that their properties can be measured and mapped .
’ The process [ of growing the tubes ] is very simple , ’ says Kitaura .
’ We put carbon nanotubes and metal powder ( usually of a metal that sublimes at a relatively low heat ) into a glass tube and heat it to around 500 - 600 ?C ’ .
The vaporised metal atoms fill up the hollow centres of the nanotubes and solidify into wires .
By varying the width of the nanotube , Kitaura ’s team were able to control the thickness of the wires - varying them from a few atoms in diameter down to a chain of single atoms .
A crucial aspect of the work , Kitaura notes , is making high quality nanotubes for the starting material , so that the metal vapour can flow in smoothly and regularly .
This allows the process to reliably fill a high proportion ( up to 90 per cent ) of the nanotubes with metal .
Importantly , although the team have only demonstrated the technique using europium and ytterbium metal , they are confident that other metals with low sublimation temperatures can also be used .
This opens up a great deal of scope for researching other metal wires , such as samarium , potassium , rubidium , calcium and strontium .
A possible advantage of the process is that the filled nanotubes may have enhanced properties - such as the metal centre changing their conductivity .
’ There is potential for charge transfer between the nanotube and ensapsulated metal , so it may improve the semi-conducting properties of the tubes , ’ says David Carey , a nanotube expert at the University of Surrey , UK .
One question that remains is whether the wires would be stable if the nanotubes were dissolved away .
’ This process is rather like putting billiard balls into pipes of different width , so they have different packing orientations than you would usually find , ’ Carey says .
’ But this does not necessarily mean that these structures wo n’t be stable outside the nanotubes . ’

To my shame , I started my interview with Congressman Barney Frank about the legalization of marijuana by apologizing to my subject .
“ I know you guys have a lot on your plate these days , so I ’m sorry to be calling you about something kind of trivial …
” Then I did a rapid midcourse correction .
“ But it ’s not trivial , because people go to jail over it . ”
“ That ’s exactly right , ” Frank said .
We were talking about the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2009 , Frank ’s latest attempt to bring sanity to the federal marijuana laws .
Currently , pot is classified as a Schedule I Controlled Dangerous Substance under federal law , which makes it worse than morphine , cocaine , amphetamine , and PCP .
Possession of a single joint carries a penalty of $ 1,000 and a year in prison – a charge faced by about 800,000 American citizens every year .
This is the government whose judgment on war and economics we are supposed to respect .
So I started the interview over .
ESQUIRE : Could you tell me why you ’re doing it at this time ?
Everybody says you guys have got so much to handle right now .
BARNEY FRANK : Announcing that the government should mind its own business on marijuana is really not that hard .
There ’s not a lot of complexity here .
We should stop treating people as criminals because they smoke marijuana .
The problem is the political will .
ESQ : That ’s my second question .
There ’s already been a lot of change in the country .
Thirteen states have decriminalized pot .
What ’s holding up Congress ?
BF : This is a case where there ’s cultural lag on the part of my colleagues .
If you ask them privately , they do n’t think it ’s a terrible thing .
But they ’re afraid of being portrayed as soft on drugs .
And by the way , the argument is , nobody ever gets arrested for it .
But we have this outrageous case in New York where a cop jammed a baton up a guy ’s ass when he caught him smoking marijuana .
ESQ : You ’re kidding .
BF : Actually , I ’ve just been corrected by my partner – it was a radio he jammed up the guy ’s ass , not his baton .
ESQ : Small radio , I hope .
BF : By the way , the bill is bi-partisan : I ’ve got two Democrats and two Republicans .
ESQ : Who are the Republicans ?
BF : Ron Paul .
And Dana Rohrabacher from California .
ESQ : Is n’t Rohrabacher pretty hard - right ?
BF : He ’s a very conservative guy , but with a libertarian streak .
ESQ : That libertarian streak will help you out once in a while .
And who ’s against it ?
BF : Well , Mark Souder from Indiana , who ’s very much a proponent of the drug war .
ESQ : When you talk to Souder about it , what does he say ?
BF : You do n’t waste your time on people with whom you completely disagree .
ESQ : Okay .
BF : Here ’s one thing I would say – there ’s a great intellectual flaw at work here .
People say , “ Oh , you want the government to approve of smoking marijuana . ”
And the answer is , no , there should be a small number of things that the government makes illegal , but the great bulk of human activity ought to be none of the government ’s business .
People can make their own choices .
ESQ : What about the “ public - square ” argument that we need to keep prostitutes off the streets and pot-smokers on the run in order to promote a higher level of morality and civic order ?
BF : One , I do n’t think it ’s immoral to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol , even though they may make you sick .
Morality to me is the way you treat other people , not the way you treat yourself .
John Stuart Mill ’s On Liberty makes a great deal of sense in that regard .
I wish more people read him .
ESQ : My father forced me to read On Liberty when I was fourteen years old .
I still have n’t recovered .
BF : He deals very thoughtfully with some of the objections .
ESQ : Then let me ask you from the other side :
Why is the bill so modest ?
You explicitly say you ’re not going to overturn state laws .
BF : Because I think it ’s important , when you ’re confronting political opinions this way , to make it easier for people .
This is n’t for drug dealers .
Although I do think there ’s a logic that once you ’ve allowed people to smoke , you ’re going to go beyond that .
ESQ : So how far do you really want to go ?
Decriminalize completely ?
Tax it , like they ’re talking about out in California ?
BF : I do n’t think that ’s a debate I should get into right now .
ESQ : So you want to be a cautious centrist , waiting for the country to come around ?
BF : [ pause ]
You think this is centrist ?
ESQ : [ laughs ]
Okay , sorry .
BF : I must say , I do n’t have a lot of sympathy with people on the left who say , “ Oh , I ’m not going to settle for some small step , I ’m going to take the big step . ”
I ’m doing something I think could be passable .
I believe the results of modest beginnings will encourage people to go further .
And if the people who disagree with me are right , it wo n’t go further .
ESQ : Realistically , do you think it ’s going to pass ?
BF : Not this year , no .
ESQ : How long do you think it will take ?
BF : There ’s no point in my guessing .
Why would I want to guess ?
We ’ll have a rational discussion , and we ’ll see where it goes from there .
While We ’re Here , One Final Hit on the Topic
Meanwhile , in the wacky world of Republicans who love liberty almost as much as they love prisons , an Illinois congressman named Mark Kirk has proposed a competing law to make selling “ this new potent marijuana ” punishable by $ 1 million in fines and 25 years in prison .
Apparently Kirk is talking about something called “ kush , ” which I cannot personally evaluate since I am A ) not currently a pot- smoker , and B ) too crippled by college bills to afford anything that costs $ 600 an ounce .
But for those old - fashioned reality - based types who care about scientific evidence , here ’s what the guys in white lab coats say
PLUS : Why Obama really might decriminalize weed , and what the Bush team knew about legalization

In the competitive world of Washington protests , crowd size is often a matter of dispute .
Organizers usually boast of huge crowds , while police and the news media offer much smaller estimates .
So supporters of Saturday ’s “ tea party ” protests against President Barack Obama were quick to highlight their big turnout .
To bolster countless claims on blogs and Facebook , many posted a photograph that showed a gargantuan crowd sprawling from Capitol Hill down the National Mall to the Washington Monument .
But it turns out the photo is more than 10 years old , apparently taken during a 1997 Promise Keepers rally .
On Saturday , estimates about the crowd spread quickly through the conservative blogosphere .
Many writers , including author Michelle Malkin , pegged the number of people between 1 million and 2 million .
Those reports were largely based on information from people in the crowd .
Malkin , for example , updated her blog at 12:34 p.m. noting that , “ Police estimate 1.2 million in attendance .
ABC
News reporting crowd at 2 million , ” and she cited a Twitter post from Tabitha Hale , writer of Pink Elephant Pundit , who was in Washington for the protest .
Many bloggers said the media was unfairly reporting much smaller numbers , and many included the photo .
“ I have no doubt that Washington Democrats are well aware of how many people turned out , even as their media outlets try to downplay the event , ” said Power Line , a conservative blog that linked to the photograph from Say Anything , another conservative Web site .
“ ' Media ’ estimates range from 60,000 to 500,000 to around 2 million ( yes , 2,000,000 ) , ” wrote John G. Winder for the conservative blog Cypress Times .
“ Those estimates , the language employed , and the visuals chosen for use in reporting the rally and representing the people gathered , vary greatly based solely on bias . ”
In the mainstream media , crowd estimates varied .
The New York Times reported that “ thousands ” of protesters “ filled the west lawn of the Capitol and spilled onto the National Mall , ” while Fox News wrote that “ tens of thousands ” marched on Washington .
CNN said “ reporters at the scene described the massive crowd as reaching the tens of thousands . ”
Pete Piringer , public affairs officer for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Department , said the local government no longer provides official crowd estimates because they can become politicized .
But the day of the rally , Piringer unofficially told one reporter that he thought between 60,000 and 75,000 people had shown up .
“ It was in no way an official estimate , ” he said .
We asked Piringer whether there were enough protesters to fill the National Mall , as depicted in the photograph .
“ It was an impressive crowd , ” he said .
But after marching down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol , the crowd “ only filled the Capitol grounds , maybe up to Third Street , ” he said .
Yet the photograph so widely posted showed the crowd sprawling all the way to the Washington Monument , which is bordered by 15th and and 17th Streets .
There ’s another problem with the photograph :
It does n’t include the National Museum of the American Indian , a building located at the corner of Fourth Street and Independence Avenue that opened on Sept. 14 , 2004 .
( Looking at the photograph , the building should be in the upper right hand corner of the National Mall , next to the Air and Space Museum . )
That means the picture was taken before the museum opened exactly five years ago .
So clearly the photo does n’t show the “ tea party ” crowd from the Sept. 12 protest .
Also worth noting are the cranes in front of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History .
According to Randall Kremer , the museum ’s director of public affairs , “ The last time cranes were in front was in the 1990s when the IMAX theater was being built . ”
It appears that the photo was actually taken in 1997 at a rally for Promise Keepers , a group for Christian men .
According to the group ’s Web site , nearly 1 million people attended the event .
Photos of the Oct. 4 , 1997 , event that were posted on various Web sites in 2003 , 2008 and earlier this year show either the same picture or a similar photo that has identical tents and what appear to be TV screens in the same locations .
Conservative bloggers who originally posted the picture have backed down .
Malkin , like some of her conservative cohorts , retracted the number she had attributed to ABC when the network chastised FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe , whose organization arranged the event , for inaccurately telling the crowd that the news organization had reported the crowd at 1 million to 1.5 million people .
Malkin linked to the ABC story on her site , and changed her blog post headline to “ Celebrating the 9/12 rallies ; Turnout estimated at 2 million ; Update : How many ? ; FreedomWorks in error . ”
Say Anything updated its original post to say that the picture was “ of the wrong rally . ”
An accurate photo “ clearly shows that ( the rally ) did n’t take place on the mall nearly as extensively as the image I mistakenly posted does . ”
Power Line took the picture down all together .
But because mistakes can still live forever on the Internet and many people who saw the photo on Facebook were unaware it was found to be the wrong picture , we decided to still rate it on the Truth - O - Meter .
And Pants on Fire it is .
UPDATED : We updated this item with new details about the Promise Keepers photos .
The EDL might have had reason to feel confident , despite the thrashing they received in Birmingham .
They had the permission of the council to demonstrate , and the Metropolitan Police were determined - so we were told - to ensure that the protest went ahead .
They had riot police ready to start smashing heads if they needed to , and the usual crowd control barriers erected .
Yet , I swear , there was no way the police had any real control over this situation .
I believe that if they had tried to march these few tens of fascists down that road and outside that mosque , the EDL members would have been torn to shreds .
I am not talking metaphorically .
Every time there was even a rumour that these scumbags were spotted heading toward the mosque , thousands of these kids bolted toward where the action was presumed to be .
They moved like fucking Olympic athletes , vaulting over the barriers and fences , circumventing and breaking through lines of riot police with aplomb .
I stress that these were n't big men , like the chunky thugs that the EDL brings along , or the big lads that riot squad retains ( probably quite a few fascists among them as well , by the way ) .
They were young men , in some cases not yet men , but they ran with courage and confidence toward a ruckus , risking a beating not only from the fascists but also from the police , because of their numbers and because of their absolute hatred of the fascists .
And based on what I saw , I believe they would have prevailed easily , without question .
They would have taken on those thugs and turned them into sausage meat .
As someone said to me today ( quoting the late David Widgery , I believe ) , if socialists like to think of themselves as the vanguard , this was the avant - garde .
Because of those kids , the EDL could not get anywhere near the place .
Perhaps one or two observers managed to wander through the protest looking for faces to remember , but that was it .
They otherwise stayed pent up in some pub , getting drunk and thinking about who was going to get their face smashed in on the way home .
The EDL went home , frustrated , because the police could not guarantee their safety .
They could not take control of the streets outside the mosque .
Even to just open the road to move a few out of service buses , they had to persuade mosque leaders to plead with the crowd to vacate the road for a few moments .
What did this show ?
It showed that fascists cannot go looking for trouble in Muslim communities , and if they do try it they risk getting a hiding .
It showed that they can't attract enough of a periphery to back them up in their efforts .
This is crucial : what did the EDL want , and why would they come to an area with a big Muslim population and try to target a mosque ?
I think it 's this .
For years , the fascists have n't been able to engage in any meaningful street politics .
In the 1970s , their Honour Guard terrorised black people , the left , trade unionists and Jewish people .
If you were at a socialist meeting or even a trade union branch meeting , you might exit to find a few of those ' guardsmen ' waiting for you with baseball bats .
They had cadres of violent men who were able to control the streets , to an extent .
They have been itching to get back into doing that .
They have wanted to turn the BNP 's electoral gains into street gains .
They have wanted to use Islamophobia as a lever to achieve that .
If the official aim was to protest " Islamic extremism " , the unofficial aim was to incite a race riot .
They hoped to attract young white racist street - fighters to come and fight on their side , beat up some Muslims and create headlines about ' racial tensions ' .
Some while back , the BNP 's legal adviser made a speech explaining that as the BNP were unable to do street politics for a while , this role would have to be fulfilled by their some time rivals , the National Front .
He said they could be ' very useful ' in this respect .
I think the division of labour thus becomes : NF activists and the usual array of thugs from C - 18 and various football gangs try to instigate polarisation along racist lines in local communities ; if they succeed , the BNP then go on television and radio , at the invitation of producers who evidently think they 're the ' experts ' on this kind of issue , and say that Muslims are causing racial tensions , and it 's time to end the madness of multiculturalism and build ' peace walls ' separating the ' comunities ' .
This is not really an optional extra for them .
The BNP will not be able to grow unless large numbers of white people feel so threatened , so deranged with fear and loathing , that they do n't just want to vote for the fascists but join them and become part of their activists base .
Unless there is ' evidence ' on the streets of racial polarisation , and of some putative threat to ' indigenous ' people , they may hit a glass ceiling .
So , they need violence and chaos to build .
This is why confronting the EDL directly is a priority for antifascists and the left .
Moreover , if you 're on the left and you do n't want to talk to the people who were on that counter - demonstration , you might as well give up .
The next time the fascists try to target a local community , the Left should be there in numbers , and visibly .
They should be at the forefront of these struggles , repeatedly beating back the EDL until they get the message that is just not possible for fascists to take over the streets they way they used to .
The question of whether clouds are a positive or a negative feedback is one of the biggest remaining questions in climate modeling .
A new paper in the journal Science is another piece of evidence that clouds will amplify the effects of climate disruption instead of dampen it .
The authors of the study analyzed two unrelated observational methods and found that both showed a decrease in cloud cover over the Northeast ( NE ) Pacific as a result of climate changes in sea surface temperature ( SST ) , sea level pressure ( SLP ) , and two measurements of the troposphere ( the lower atmosphere ) .
The observational methods used were satellites and direct observation from ships , and even though the methods were different , both methods produced similar results and similar correlations to SST et al .
As a result , the conclusions of the paper are stronger than most .
And those conclusions are that , as the NE Pacific heats up , the amount of cloud cover over the region declines .
Less cloud cover over water means that the water absorbs more solar energy , further heating up the ocean surface .
Similarly , cooler water in the NE Pacific means more clouds that further cool the ocean ’s surface .
In addition , observations shown in the paper illustrate this same relationship holds across the entire Pacific .
The authors also compared the observations to the 18 general circulation models ( GCMs ) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 archive for how the models compared to the new clouds observations , and the results were striking – only two of the models produced the same statistical correlation sign (+ or -) as the observations , and one of those two is a statistical outlier for wind circulation .
According to the paper ’s lead author Dr. Amy Clement of the University of Miami , one of the next steps is to extend their results out of the NE Pacific to the rest of the Pacific and , ultimately , to the rest of the globe .
But according to Clement , the biggest problem is that only one GCM accurately reproduces all the observed cloud effects in the NE Pacific .
“ This is the best we can do , ” she said .
“ As more models pass this test , then we can begin to have more confidence in the sign of the low cloud feedback and how much that contributes to global climate sensitivity . ”
Time , and much more research , will tell .
Thanks to Amy Clement , lead author of the paper for answering my questions and providing me with a review copy of her paper

Skeptical Inquirer publisher calls Inhofe ’s list uncredible
Before Marc Morano left Sen. Inhofe ’s ( R - OK ) staff to become highly paid climate disruption denier and professional pundit , he collected a list of 687 scientists who supposedly rejected the the science underlying climate disruption .
It was titled the United States Senate Minority Report on Global Warming , and the purpose was to play a numbers game with the IPCC scientists responsible for writing and reviewing the Fourth Assessment Report working group 1 scientific review .
Supposedly , the 687 “ expert ” in the Minority Report outnumbered the IPCC scientists because of how many scientists were responsible for writing the IPCC Summary for Policymakers .
Given that 2000 or so scientists wrote and / or reviewed the WG1 study , this claim was clearly and obviously false to anyone who understood the way that the IPCC WG1 worked , but that did n’t stop Morano and Inhofe from making the claim .
Nor did it stop legions of uninformed climate disruption deniers from repeating the claim ad inifinitum .
While bloggers and some journalists have put a great deal of time into exposing the Inhofe list , it ’s too easy to dismiss bloggers as activists and journalists as members of the mythical “ liberal media . ”
But the avowed skeptical organization the Center for Inquiry is n’t so easily dismissed , especially by individuals claiming the mantle of “ climate change skeptic . ”
Which is why the Center ’s scathing investigation of the credibility – or rather the lack thereof – of the Inhofe list is such a big deal .
What the Center ’s investigation found is that 80 % of the scientists on the list had never published a climate - related paper .
The Center could verify that only 10 % were for certain involved in climate science , with an additional 5 % that could have been .
And 4 % largely or entirely agreed with the scientific theory human - caused climate disruption .
I think it ’s fair to say that the Center ’s claim that “ [ t ] hese results cast serious doubt on the Senate Minority Report ’s credibility ” is a bit understated .
What does this mean for Inhofe ’s infamous list ?
Probably not much .
Morano no longer works for Inhofe , after all , and neither man has been overly concerned with verifiable scientific fact when it comes to climate disruption .
But having the publisher of what is arguably the premier skeptical publication in the world say that the list is not credible wo n’t make their lives any easier .
And over the long run , that ’s probably a good thing .

The ozone hole has reduced ocean CO 2 absorption
In 2007 , scientists studying the Southern Ocean reported that it was not absorbing CO 2 as efficiently as had been expected .
A study published in November , 2008 partly contradicted the 2007 conclusion and said that the original study was flawed due to insufficient resolution in oceanic current eddies .
A new study published in Geophysical Research Letters adds yet another chapter to the ongoing questions about the Southern Ocean ’s ability , or lack thereof , to absorb anthropogenic CO 2 .
The fundamental absorption mechanism of any gas in water is related to the partial pressures of the gas in the air vs. dissolved in the water .
At a constant temperature , the partial pressure at the water surface will equal the partial pressure of that gas in the air .
Increase the amount of the gas in the air and more of it will slowly absorb into the water .
This is fundamentally why increasing concentrations of CO 2 due to fossil fuel combustion is driving ocean acidification – the partial pressure of CO 2 in the Earth ’s atmosphere is increasing and the ocean is absorbing more CO 2 as a result .
But this simple relationship is n’t sufficient to describe the real ocean .
The real ocean has waves , is in contact with wind , and has currents and upwellings that change the relationship on local and regional scales .
And it ’s these real ocean effects that the study ’s authors have modeled using coupled - climate - carbon models ( CCCMs ) , models that focus on the effects of the carbon cycle on climate and vice versa .
And the CCCMs have found that the ozone hole over Antarctica has been a significant factor in the reduction of CO 2 absorption by the Southern Ocean .
The Southern Annual Mode ( SAM ) is an atmospheric pattern that moves westerlies ( prevailing winds in the mid-latitudes that tend to blow from west to east ) closer to the pole .
According to the paper , the SAM has moved poleward as a result of increasing GHGs and ozone depletion , and wind stresses on the Southern Ocean have increased .
The result of increased wind is greater ocean mixing between the surface layers and deep , carbon - rich layers of the ocean .
Essentially , the ocean surface layers that are carbon - poor are being blown off the deeper layers , creating a condition where the ocean can’t absorb as much CO 2 because the ocean has a higher CO 2 partial pressure than it would have had if the westerlies had n’t been blowing so strongly .
The authors ran two sets of models , one with the effects of the ozone hole included and one without , and then compared the model runs with observed changes in the the partial pressure of CO 2 both in the Southern Ocean and in the air above it .
The model that did n’t include the effects of the ozone hole did n’t match reported observations .
In addition , as the SAM exposes deep , carbon - rich water to the surface , ocean acidification of the Southern Ocean accelerates and the effects thereof worsen .
These effects include reduced calicification of plankton and larger areas of low oxygen ( hypoxia ) that could lead to larger ocean dead zones .
In November , the Carboholic reported on a study that claimed the Southern Ocean was still absorbing CO 2 and that the problem with studies like this one was that they did n’t have detailed enough ocean models .
The authors of this study addressed the criticisms of the prior one directly and concluded that more detailed ocean models were not necessary in this case because the CCCMs used were able to replicate observated changes in CO 2 .
It remains to be seen , however , what happens when both model types from the two studies are combined .

Clinton Climate Initiative and Microsoft partner on Project 2°
Project 2° is an attempt to provide cities with easy - to - use software tools that can track and manage their greenhouse gas emissions .
The idea is that cities all have the same sources of GHG emissions – transportation , electricity generation , energy consumption , and industry – and the similarities mean that all cities have similar needs with respect to their ability to determine where , how , and how much emissions are coming from each sector .
At the moment , the Project 2° website indicates that there are only three cities using the software – Chicago , Houston , and Rotterdam , with Chicago having the most information available on the website .
Other resources at the Project 2° website are contact links for access to experts , documentation on official international GHG accounding guidelines , and a detailed demonstration of how the software works .
I do n’t know if this will take off or not .
Having Microsoft and Autodesk on board certainly does n’t hurt Project 2° ’s chances any , but who knows .
Ultimately , though , something like Project 2° is needed if cities are going to be able to get a handle on their GHG emissions and how best to cut them in the near future .

We might as well drive Model -Ts
Overall vehicle fuel efficiency has n’t increased much in decades .
Generally speaking , as gasoline and diesel engines have been made more efficient , the efficiency gains have been eaten up with increased vehicle mass and additional gadgets .
According to a New Scientist article , modern automobiles , trucks , motorcycles , and buses are not dramatically more efficient than the Ford Model - T .
University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute researchers Michael Sivak and Omer Tsimhoni analyzed the total fleet fuel efficiency for cars et al from 1923 to 2006 and found that overall efficiency improved at only 2 % per year average .
In addition , the bulk of that 2 % annual improvement actually took place between the OPEC oil embargo in the 1973 and 1991 .
According to the article , from 1991 to 2006 , fuel efficiency improved a grand total of 1.8 % .
One of the most critical points in the article is that removing old , low efficiency vehicles is critical to raising overall fleet fuel efficiency .
Thus the various “ Cash for Clunkers ” ideas that have been implemented locally and the federal plan that was recently signed into law by President Obama .
The other critical point made in the article is not necessarily obvious :
“ Society has much more to gain from improving a car from 15 to 16 mpg ( 6.38 to 6.8 km /l ) than from improving a car from 40 to 41 mpg ( 17 to 17.43 km /l ) , ” [ Sivak and Tsimhoni ] write in their paper .
“ Similarly , the benefits are greater from improving a truck from 4 to 4.5 mpg ( 1.7 to 1.92 km /l ) than from improving a truck from 7 to 7.5 mpg ( 3.19 km / l ) . ”
It ’s not necesarily obvious that this claim is correct until you invert the numbers .
Improving fuel efficiency from 15 to 16 mpg is 6.7 to 6.3 gallons per 100 miles , or 0.4 gallons less fuel burned .
Improving efficiency from 40 to 41 mpg means burning only 0.1 gallons less fuel ( 2.5 to 2.4 gallons per 100 miles ) .
In the same way , going from 4.0 to 4.5 mpg is better than going from 7.0 to 7.5 mpg because the improvement is 3 gallons per 100 miles vs. 1 gallon per mile respectively .

Dan Brewington is among the latest casualties in a war against fathers that is tearing our nation apart , family by family .
The Ripley and Dearborn County ( Indiana ) court system recently stripped him of his parental rights without reason or cause .
He is no longer able to see his daughters despite his history of loving care for them and their strong bond with him .
Mr. Brewington has neither a criminal history nor a Social Services history .
He is loved by his children whom he has taken excellent care of their entire lives .
He has also demonstrated his ability to successfully parent the children under joint custody with the mother for the past 2 ½ years .
Yet his rights were violated during divorce proceedings in which Judge Humphrey of Dearborn County ordered him to have no visitation with his children .
Ordering a man to have no contact with his children is a very serious matter .
So there should be some compelling reason for such drastic intervention by the state into the life of a citizen .
As part of court documents submitted during the divorce proceedings , a custody evaluation report was , of course , submitted .
In this report , a psychologist named Dr. Connor evaluated Dan Brewington ’s parenting abilities .
But Dr. Connor was not licensed in the state of Indiana at the time of his evaluation of Dan Brewington .
So what was he doing stripping a man of his rights to see his children without proper licensure ?
But nowhere in the contents of this unlicensed report was it asserted that Dan Brewington is a danger to his children or , for that matter , anyone else .
Had Dan Brewington been a danger to anyone , Dr. Connor would have been required , by Indiana law , to report such danger to the Child Protective Services Department or to the police .
No actions such as the above were required because Mr. Brewington is of no danger whatsoever .
The decision to withhold his children from him was based solely on whim and caprice of a judge who was not following the laws and guidelines of the State of Indiana .
The first judge involved in this custody case , Judge Taul of Ripley County , recused himself because of ex parte communications with the Custody Evaluator , Dr. Connor .
The case then went to Judge Humphrey of Dearborn County .
Judge Humphrey awarded the mother full custody of the children , and stripped Dan Brewington of all parental rights , including any visitation .
In the divorce decree this judge awarded items , to the mother , that were not marital assets but were instead material possessions of Mr. Brewington ’s family members and friends , to which neither Mr. Brewington nor his wife are entitled .
Dan Brewington has no criminal record and no CPS history .
If his parental rights can be taken then anyone ’s can .
If his civil rights are in jeopardy then so , too , are the rights of anyone reading this column - Democrat or Republican , black or white .
If we as adults cannot trust the judicial system to protect our rights then do our children stand even a chance ?
Just ask Dan Brewington ’ girls .
They were not granted a guardian ad litum to represent their interests in this case .
And , through no fault of their own , they have a mother more concerned with acquiring material possessions and control over her ex-husband than she is with protecting her children ’s best interest .
In a world where so many fathers are absent or uninvolved , how can the State of Indiana deprive an exceptional , committed father the right to see his children ?
Is it simply because he chose to represent himself in a court of law in Dearborn , Indiana ?
Or is it because he questioned the authority of Dr. Connor who , in fact , was not lawfully credentialed to intervene in this case ?
Or did Judge Humphrey rule in malicious retaliation to this father ’s attempts to exercise his legal right to advocate for himself ?
Clearly , Judge Humphrey violated civil law by restricting this father ’s visitation rights with his children without grounds .
My efforts to have this judge impeached or disbarred will not cease until Mr. Brewington is allowed to see his children or until the Almighty State of Indiana provides reasons for not doing so .
Panasonic 3D Full HD truck
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Sony and Panasonic have recently announced a new technology , called " active shutter " for producing the experience of 3D on high definition TVs .
The first models are expected to be available in late 2009 or early 2010 .
The original 3D experience of movies depended on the viewer wearing stereoscopic green and red glasses .
The illusion of 3D in the image came from superimposed green and red images taken from slightly different angles .
Each eye saw only one image , and the viewer 's brain combined them to give the illusion of three dimensions .
3D movies using this technology , called anaglyph 3D , can be viewed on any TV , as long as the viewer wears the glasses .
Anaglyph 3D glasses .
Image : Wikipedia .
The problem with anaglyph 3D is that it strains the eyes , and can cause headaches and nausea in some people .
Others have a dominant eye , and find it difficult to see the image as three dimensional .
A newer process for 3D in the cinema uses a special screen and polarized glasses .
In this system images for the left and right eye are rapidly alternated , and the glasses pick up the appropriate image for each eye .
A similar technique has now been introduced for high definition LCD televisions by LG Electronics in South Korea and Hyundai in Japan .
The system , known as X - Pol , projects the different images in the even and odd horizontal lines of the video , and the polarized glasses sort it all out for the viewer .
LG Electronics 47LH50 3D LCD TV
Now Sony and Panasonic have introduced an " active shutter " technique for high definition plasma and LCD TVs .
The viewer still has to wear polarized glasses , but in this system the glasses have LCD active shutters that are synchronized with signals from the TV .
The shutters rapidly block the right and left eye views alternately so each eye receives the correct image .
The new system gives higher resolution than X - Pol because in active shutter technology each eye sees all the lines in the video , whereas in X - Pol each eye sees only half the lines .
Separate images for the left and right eyes are recorded with 1920 X 1080 full - HD quality and alternately played at high speed .
By watching these images through special LCD glasses that are timed to open and close the right and left lenses in synchronization with the alternating images , the viewer is treated to exciting 3D realism .

Panasonic executive Peter Fannon said the new high definition 3D televisions will give viewers an experience just like being there , rather than watching it on TV .
Panasonic will be releasing some Full HD 3D models later this year , with Sony 's version coming on the market later .
Buyers of the new TVs will also need 3D - compatible Blu-ray disc players .
The glasses will be supplied with the TV sets .
There is no information yet on the prices of these televisions .

EL PASO , Texas , Sept. 28 ( UPI ) --
A top U.S. narcotics official told a conference on the border drug war that aggressive law enforcement must remain part of strategy to curb drug trafficking .
Anthony Placido , head of intelligence for the DEA , said drugs by nature were " mind - altering substances that destroy human life and create violence " and needed to be fought vigorously .

" Law enforcement will never be the total response to this problem , but it must be part of the answer , " Placido told the audience of U.S. and Mexican officials , politicians and scholars in El Paso , Texas .
The San Diego Union - Tribune said Monday that the weekend conference was notable for the new emphasis on drug treatment and other social programs aimed at letting some of the steam out of the trade .
There were also calls for decriminalization of some drugs by proponents who said drugs were too well entrenched in the United States and that the law of supply and demand was too strong to resist .
Cerberus has had a bad week .
Today the fund put in place a three - year lock up preventing investors to withdraw their money from two of its hedge funds .
The move comes on the heels of Tuesday ’s rumor that some of the firm ’s funds were on the verge of defaulting , prompting managing director Tim Price to come forward and say that , well , no , there was absolutely “ no truth the speculation . ”
Investors withdrew $ 4.7 billion of the $ 7.7 billion in assets in the two Cerberus Partners hedge funds recently , which amounts to 60 % of those funds assets under management .
It 's also 19 % of the total $ 23.4 billion of assets under management across of of Cerberus 's funds .
From the Financial Times :
Mr Neporent [ Cerberus COO ] stressed that those redemption requests totaled less than 20 % of Cerberus ’s $ 24.3 bn in assets under management and would not constrain its ability to operate its private equity and hedge funds businesses .
“ We still have lots and lots of money in our core business .
We have ample liquidity to do what we want to do , ” he said .
Uh oh .
That 's the dreaded " ample liquidity " reassurance that no one ever finds reassuring .
Welcome back to September .
I 'd be glad if I knew you 'd think about it for a moment ... how sick your country appears from the outside when one reads about so many medicines and so many disorders and about medicine for .... anything slightly uncomfortable .
And how all these trendy things migrate to other countries , where people do n't even know that their moods , sadnesses , uncomfortable moments , their life in a word , is a disorder .
Europe
How I wish I had made this up .
The email closes :
Here 's my answer :
The short answer to your question is : yes , there are many such patients here in the U.S.
However , most of these " patients " do not need these medications , most do not need psychiatry at all .
Of course many do , they are truly sick and but for psychaitry their lives would be chaos .
But thedo not .
But they come to psychiatry because they are told , almost constantly , that there is something wrong with them .
That the fatigue they feel , the emptiness , the lack of interest or sexual appetite or sadness or irritability -- all of these things could be helped by medications .
It happens that these " symptoms " occur in the absence of a clear cause , and medicines do help .
But theof the time these are symptoms only because they are compared to someone else .
Testosterone patches are the new big thing in psychiatry .
No , I 'm not kidding .
I 'm not sure what a lack of sexual interest in a 40 year old is -- but certainly in comparison to any TV show , it 's going to seem low .
That preys on people -- a man worries that his wife is judging him , even as she is worried he is judging her ; so both are worried , essentially , that the other person has agreed to accept TV as normal and feels consequently inadequate .
Etc .
If you doubt this , watch two married people try to sit through a sex scene in an episode of , or , etc , together .
They are handed images of life -- TV , etc -- and they think that they are supposed to be that .
The complicated answer to your question is that American society is n't really capitalist , it 's mercantilist .
Americans do n't want riches , they want what they are told to want .
They do n't want a nice car : they want a Lexus .
They do n't want a nice house ; they want a Viking refrigerator , granite counters .
They do n't want nice things : they want things that represent nice things .
Americans want .
While everyone was orgasming over The Tipping Point , they should have been reading this As such , psychiatry is n't a field serving a need ; it is a product creating a market .
They did n't need treatment ; they were told they needed treatment .
Just like you do n't need Nike shoes , you 're told you do .
Granted , having Nike shoes or psychiatric treatment can still be helpful , but most can certainly get along without it and , dare I say it , neither is worth the price .
And when someone says , " I did n't really want Nike shoes , I just got them because they were on sale , " they have inadvertently proven my point .
" But I needed to buy some kind of shoe . "
Think it through ... Psychiatry -- medicine -- is too gigantic of an industry to bend to the whims of reality .
It will create a market because too many people 's economies depend on it .
It 's too big for Obama or anyone else to change it .
Fox News and MSNBC can yell at each other all they want , it 's already been decided : Wellpoint 's stock has soared since Obama rolled in .
The " public option " is now Aetna .
This is how it has always been throughout history .
Didans really blast cannons at each other in the 16th - 17th centuries because people desperately needed more ?
Yes , they actually did .
A third of the Triangular Trade was rum .
People died over rum .
Not depleted uranium or alien artifacts or the Spear of Longinus : rum .
You ask whether it is worrisome that the rest of the world might see American as a bunch of invalids .
Well , that maybe true : but what do we care ?
We 're the only people that matter , all other people are supporting cast .
Your final point is the most important :
All of this is coming to a town near you .
All of this nonsense talk about whether American is losing its global dominance is a ruse .
As long as America remains the largest current market , it sets the standards .
The Chinese are going to want to need Viking refrigerators .
True power rests in the hands of those who define our cultural models and decide what we want to need or who we want to pretend to be .
The history of the world is the history of mercantilism ; the history of men bending government to fight to the death for things they do n't really need and only barely want .
“ There are books that are very dangerous , that invite and encourage suicide bombers , that explain the joy and pleasure and immortality that will come to those who perform suicide bombings , ” said Mr. Hmood , the deputy culture minister .
“ How do we deal with it ?
We will ask the publisher to sign a document promising not to bring such books into Iraq .
We are not a security ministry , but we can help the security situation and make the publisher feel he has a commitment to follow the law and that he will be punished if he does not . ”
Book publishers say the new policy could be the death knell for Iraq ’s once vibrant industry .
“ After the fall of the previous regime we were optimistic , ” said Ghada al - Amily , manager of a Baghdad publishing firm , The House of Arts and Cultures .
“ But instead of activating and encouraging publishing houses , they are incapacitating them . ”
Taha H. al - Shebeeb , an Iraqi writer of 10 novels whose politically tinged work often put him at odds with Mr. Hussein ’s government , called the current plans “ an awful retreat . ”
“ If this is true , I will hold a press conference where I will burn my novels and say that I had been mistaken when I objected to the policies of the previous regime , ” he said .
Ahmed Mohammed Raouf , chief engineer for the State Company for Internet Services , said he had mixed feelings about censorship .
He held a similar position in Mr. Hussein ’s government and remembers being ordered to filter any site that was even remotely “ antiregime . ”
“ We are a technical ministry , not a political ministry , ” he said .
“ Our job is to bring the systems , the tools , but not to decide what can be said .
We are engineers and technicians . ”
He added , however , that “ the situation had gotten out of control . ”
Die behindertenpolitischen Sprecher von CDU , FDP , Grünen und Linkspartei wehrten sich am Donnerstag mit einem offenen Brief empört gegen ihre Vereinnahmung als Unterstützer für SPD - Kanzlerkandidat Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
Hintergrund des Streits zwischen SPD und behindertenpolitischen Sprechern ist die Veröffentlichung eines Aufrufs zur Behindertenpolitik auf der Internetseite „ sozial-und-demokratisch.de “ .
„ Ich bin gelinkt worden “
„ Wir behalten uns rechtliche Schritte vor “
In ihrem Brief beklagen die Abgeordneten Ilja Seifert ( Linke ) , Markus Kurth ( Grüne ) und Erwin Lotter ( FDP ) , sie hätten ihre Unterschrift in der Annahme geleistet , dass der Aufruf überparteilich sei .
„ Es ist falsch , eine gute und wichtige Initiative zur inklusiven Beschulung behinderter Kinder für den Wahlkampf zu instrumentalisieren “ , heißt es in dem Schreiben .
„ Ich bin gelinkt worden “ , sagte der CDU - Abgeordnete Hubert Hüppe den Dortmunder „ Ruhr Nachrichten “ vom Freitag .
Die SPD - Bundestagsabgeordnete Karin Evers - Meyer , sie ist die Behindertenbeauftragte der Bundesregierung , antwortete umgehend .
Die SPD werde die drei Namen wie gewünscht aus der Unterstützerliste entfernen , schrieb sie in einem Brief .
„ Ich darf ihnen an dieser Stelle versichern , dass es nicht meine Absicht war , mit dem Aufruf ein Missverständnis zu provozieren .
“ Gleichzeitig erklärte Evers - Meyer , die behindertenpolitischen Sprecher seien nicht zur Unterzeichnung des Aufrufs aufgefordert worden .
Diese seien „ von sich aus auf mich zugekommen “ .
Sie habe dann eine Woche vor Veröffentlichung der Unterschriften noch einmal ausdrücklich auf die parteipolitische Bedeutung der Initiative hingewiesen .
Eine Reaktion sei nicht erfolgt .
„ Daher haben wir Ihre Unterstützung als ganz persönliche Wertschätzung unserer und meiner behindertenpolitischen Arbeit begriffen .
“ Der WWF nannte es „ eine bodenlosen Frechheit “ , dass die SPD mit einem Statement von Klimachefin Regine Günther den Eindruck erwecke , man unterstütze die Partei .
Der Naturschutzbund bezog sich auf die aktuelle Ausgabe der SPD - Zeitung „ Vorwärts “ .
Darin sind unter dem Slogan „ Den Richtigen wählen “ prominente Unterstützer für Frank - Walter Steinmeier in Wort und Bild aufgeführt .
Der WWF erklärte , Bild und Statement von Günther seien ohne ihr Wissen und Autorisierung verbreitet worden .
„ Wir behalten uns rechtliche Schritte vor “ , sagte WWF - Geschäftsführer Eberhard Brandes .
Auch der Präsident des Deutschen Instituts für Wirtschaftsforschung ( DIW ) , Klaus Zimmermann , distanzierte sich von einer Veröffentlichung im „ Vorwärts “ .
Die Verwendung des Zitates sei nicht mit Zimmermann abgesprochen worden , es gebe diesbezüglich seitens Zimmermanns und des DIW „ keinerlei Unterstützung “ für die SPD , sagte eine Sprecherin .
Am
Mittwoch hatten sich bereits Gewerkschaftsvorsitzende gegen ihre Vereinnahmung als Unterstützer zugunsten von SPD - Kanzlerkandidat Frank - Walter Steinmeier im „ Vorwärts “ gewehrt .
„ Vorwärts “ - Chefredakteur Uwe - Karsten Heye entschuldigte sich .
The mildly jubilant scenes at the Labour party conference when Gordon Brown announced that there would be no compulsory ID cards in the next parliament tell you one thing : that people in the hall understand how unpopular the ID card is and what a lead weight it will be at the next election .
But of course the speech makes little difference and by no means does it signal an end to the government 's ID management lunacy .
This is exactly what Brown said :
[ In ] the last two years we have looked again at how we can give the best security to our British citizens while never undermining their liberties .
We will reduce the information British citizens have to give for the new biometric passport to no more than that required for today 's passport .
And so conference , I can say to you today , in the next parliament there will be no compulsory ID cards for British citizens .
With this non-announcement , which follows one or two modest changes publicised by Alan Johnson in the summer , Labour hopes to draw the poison from the issue while retaining its long - term ambitions .
It is a sleight of hand that is familiar to anyone who has watched the ducking and diving on this policy over this last five years .
There are many who now vaguely believe that the ID card is no longer an issue but the lie to this is given by the fact that Home Office is preparing to spend £ 500,000 on advertising campaign , which features cartoon fingerprints , between now and December .
So far about 90,000 cards have been issued .
Ahead of schedule the government is going to start issuing cards to skilled migrants when they renew their visas – its is difficult to see how this is n't effectively compulsory – and from this month the UK Border Agency will trial issuing cards at Post Office in order to speed up enrolment process .
So the full energy of this disastrously wasteful and intrusive policy remains in tact .
Gordon Brown 's announcement that a reduction in the amount of personal detail required for ID cards and passports will mean that people 's civil liberties are being respected is obvious nonsense .
For one thing he did not say by how much the government would reduce the 50 odd pieces of personal data currently required .
The fact remains that the identity management policies of this government are built for the convenience of the state , not of the citizen , and Brown 's speech makes not the slightest difference to that strategy .
( CNN ) --
" I know I did n't chow down on a spoon ! " declared John Manley , who recently discovered that an eating utensil was the source of his two years of ill health , coughing , vomiting and pain .
The Wilmington , North Carolina , resident had surgery last week to remove part of a plastic spoon from his lung .
And it was n't just any old plastic spoon ; it came from the fast - food chain Wendy's , with the restaurant logo clearly visible on the handle .
" It must have been in the food or drink , " Manley told CNN affiliate WECT .
His doctor found the spoon after looking into his lungs with an endoscope , a medical instrument with a long , thin tube containing a light and a video camera .
" He explained that there was an object down there , and it had writing on it , " Manley said .
" It spelled out ' Wendy's ' on one side and ' hamburgers ' on the other , and I was a little floored . "
So were his relatives , who , when they were telephoned with the news , were eating ... Wendy's .

Advertisement A French climber known as Spiderman for his amazing feats has climbed one of the world 's tallest buildings , in Malaysia , on his third attempt .
Witnesses said it took Alain Robert , 47 , just over two hours to complete his ascent of the 88 - storey Tower Two of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur .
He has scaled many of the tallest buildings , using no safety equipment .
Mr Robert was reported to have been arrested for trespassing on completing the feat .
Mr Robert began his climb of the 452 m ( 1,483 ft ) tower before dawn , after apparently eluding security , and reached the top by 0730 local time .
Once there , he unfurled a Malaysian flag and waved his arms in celebration .
" He climbed using his bare hands and reached the top very fast as no security personnel noticed him or stopped him , " said Ee Wee Kiat , a cameraman who filmed the ascent .
' A bit stubborn '
It was Mr Robert 's third attempt to conquer the Petronas Towers , the third tallest building in the world .
On both previous occasions - in March 1997 and again in 2007 - he was arrested on reaching the 60th floor but released without charge .
Previous climbs have often ended with Mr Robert 's arrest for trespassing " With due respect to Malaysia , I came to finish something , " he told news agency Reuters before he set out .
" Climbing the Petronas all the way to the top is one of my dreams , " he said , describing himself as determined but also " a little bit stubborn " .
Mr Robert was reported to have been detained by Malaysian police as he went back into the building on the 88th floor .
Kuala Lumpur police chief Muhammad Sabtu Osman said he could be charged with criminal trespass .
" He climbed the building without a permit from the management , " he told the AFP news agency .
Mr Robert has climbed more than 70 buildings in his career , always without ropes , and has had several serious falls , resulting in fractures and operations .
In February this year , he scaled the 62 - storey Cheung Kong Centre in Hong Kong to draw attention to the issue of climate change .
He has also conquered the Eiffel Tower in Paris , the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and Taipei 101 in Taiwan , which at the time was the tallest in the world .

LinuxCon 2009 IBM says that battling for desktop market share against Windows is a " dead- end " for Linux .
Bob Sutor , IBM 's vp of open source and Linux for IBM , opened the inaugural LinuxCon conference held in Portland , Oregon on Monday with predictions for the open source desktop , telling developers they wo n't thrive unless they specialize .
Given his connections to Big Blue , Sutor unsurprisingly ( and justifiably ) praised Linux for its cloud , mainframe , and hardware - specific ubiquity .
But he opined that winning hearts in the general market is a different story altogether .
Sutor drew up several possible futures for the Linux desktop in the years ahead , including Linux going away altogether , one distribution dominating Linux desktops , one distro dominating all desktops , Linux reaching parity with Microsoft and Apple , and desktop Linux disappearing altogether and making the whole issue moot .
" Most people say , ' I do n't want to be bothered .
It just works .
I want to do the other parts of my job , and I want to go home , ' " said Sutor .
" So this , I think , is going to be a major , major portion that determines possibly some of those futures .
What are we really trying to do with this thing ?
I think making it a complete drop - in replacement is a dead - end strategy .
" They 've got a little more money , " Sutor said about Microsoft and Apple .
" But even more important than that , they 've got the market share and the mindshare .
We need lots of different attacks on this problem through lots of different technologies .
I think the Linux desktop is critical to that , but it has to find its niche of what it does really well , at what price point , and which people .
You should n't be thinking of it as one great desktop for everyone .
I really feel that way .
You have to do what we call ' market segmentation . ' "
Sutor argued that it's a mistake to try to sell or convince people to use something when they 're not interested and will never use it .
" Do n't waste your time , " he said .
" So in the same way , with Linux desktops , you 've got to decide ... who are the real potential users and focus on them to the exclusion of other people who - frankly - just are n't interested , " Sutor said .
His suggestions of places the community could focus on are virtualized desktops - not just for the traditional " light - weight " users , but for things like virtualized Linux development environments .
Regardless of whom the Linux desktop community would target in the future , Sutor said they need to focus on usability , stability , security , reliability , performance , with some cool thrown in , as well .
" Just like you all have done in enterprise space with servers , it works .
We bring that focus and attention to the desktop as well - with the cool - because you 've got to convince people to use it . " ®
Tamer loves “ his family and Jesus ” but not “ heights and cockroaches . ”
He likes “ flowers , sharks and whales . ”
Samar says she ’s happy on holidays and her birthday .
She ’s afraid of “ sharks , thieves and the dark . ”
One day , she hopes to see “ trees , flowers and my sister . ”
Avital , Tamer and Samar are all 12 - year - old children from Jerusalem .
One is a Jew , another is a Christian , the third a Muslim .
But when they play together , it ’s hard to see them as anything but children .
If they were growing up in a different world — one without political disputes , military checkpoints and a pervasive climate of hatred , suspicion and fear — their friendships would undoubtedly thrive .
For 10 days this summer , that “ different world ” became their reality .
Recently , Avital , Tamer and Samar were among the 36 children — 12 Palestinians , 12 Israelis and 12 Americans — who participated in an interfaith educational program called Kids4Peace .
Each summer , Kids4 Peace tries to plants the seeds of long - term peace for the next generation of Middle Easterners and Americans by focusing on the spiritual commonalities within Judaism , Islam and Christianity .
The program is jointly sponsored by the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont , Ohavi Zedek Synagogue and the Islamic Society of Vermont .
Burlington ’s Rock Point School hosted the kids .
Kids4Peace is the brainchild of Dr. Henry Ralph Carse , a native Vermonter who has been splitting his time between Vermont and the Middle East for the last 39 years .
A self - described “ practical theologian , ” Carse leads interfaith pilgrimages to holy sites throughout Israel and Palestine .
He launched Kids4 Peace in 2001 as a response to the Second Intifada , or Palestinian uprising , which took an especially heavy toll on the region ’s children .
Carse ’s initial goal was simple : to get Israeli and Palestinian children out of harm ’s way .
He soon realized that by physically removing kids from the conflict zone , he could also remove the political , cultural and ideological boundaries that separate them .
The problem , Carse explains , is that for several generations , all the proposals advanced for effecting peace in the Middle East have been based on political solutions .
But as each one has failed to deliver on its promise for enduring peace , people on both sides of the conflict have been left feeling disappointed and betrayed .
Carse ’s idea is that , embedded within the Jewish , Muslim and Christian traditions are “ peace tools ” that have never been fully explored or utilized in addressing the Arab - Israeli conflict .
“ Einstein said you ca n’t solve a problem with the same mind that created that problem , ” he said , on a recent sunny morning at Rock Point .
“ That ’s the situation we ’re in now in the Middle East .
This is not a religious conflict at all .
It ’s a political conflict that has a spiritual solution . ”
Illustrating Carse ’s point , three dozen children sat in a circle inside Bishop Hopkins Hall singing “ Salaam Shalom , ” a song named for the Arabic and Hebrew words for peace , respectively .
Some of the kids spoke mostly Arabic , others mostly Hebrew , and nearly all knew at least some English , the program ’s common language .
Before them on a coffee table was an assortment of religious objects — a yarmulke , Muslim prayer beads , a Christian incense burner .
They ’d just completed a daily ritual called “ the sharing of sacred objects , ” wherein one child selects an object from the table that he or she wants to know more about .
Then , someone from that religion explains the object ’s meaning .
Josh Thomas , a Kids4 Peace worker on loan from the organization ’s Atlanta chapter — Kids4 Peace also has chapters in North Carolina , Canada and Jerusalem — weighed in on the significance of this game of show - and - tell .
As Thomas explained , many of the Israeli and Palestinian children have never entered a house of worship other than their own , or broken bread with someone from a different culture or religion .
Just as likely , they ’ve never encountered someone from the other side of the conflict who ’s not a soldier , police officer or politician .
“ For the first time , ” said Thomas , “ they get to see each other as real people . ”
The only tense moment came shortly after my introduction to the group — in English , followed by Hebrew and Arabic translations .
Zoubaida , the group ’s Jerusalem coordinator , pulled aside her American counterparts and held a hushed but emotional discussion out of my earshot .
Rev. Diane Nancekivell , who chairs the Kids4Peace Vermont board , later explained the nature of Zoubaida ’s dismay : Apparently , no one from the American group had informed her that a journalist would be visiting that day .
“ It ’s almost impossible for us Americans to have the sensitivity that Israelis and Palestinians have for the press , ” Nancekivell explained .
“ It ’s something I could not have anticipated . ”
However , this minor faux pas was quickly resolved after we agreed to a few simple security protocols , such as not printing the last names or hometowns of the children or their guides .
For their part , the children seemed unfazed by a reporter ’s presence .
Despite expressing a few initial trepidations about traveling to a different country and living with people who did n’t speak their language , they seemed either to forget or overlook their obvious differences .
There was no sign of nervousness as the kids rehearsed for that evening ’s activity , a performance called “ Abraham ’s Tent . ”
As an “ ensemble , ” they were a squealing mob discovering the playground potential of a bunch of beanbag chairs .
And , despite the range of skin color , from white to deep olive , it was difficult to tell Jew from Christian from Muslim .
“ We try not to overburden the children with huge expectations that they ’ll all become Martin Luther Kings overnight , ” said Carse , referring to the program ’s recreational agenda : a full range of summer - camp activities , such as swimming , kickball , arts and crafts and s’mores around the campfire .
“ That ’s not fair to any 11 - year - old . ”
That said , Kids4 Peace ’s Thomas is working on a PhD dissertation at Emory University that explores the longer - term consequences of children ’s participation in this program .
Although his research is still underway , Thomas has found that many Kids4 Peace alumni in their late teens are now active in other international programs and peace - related activities .
As for their American counterparts , Thomas has also heard anecdotes of kids participating in tolerance education programs and , less formally , of kids standing up for minorities within their own communities , such as defending Muslim kids who were being picked on by fellow students .
Later that evening , the kids performed “ Abraham ’s Tent ” on the shores of Lake Champlain .
As Abraham is considered a patriarch of all three religions , the children were divided into three groups — each with an equal mix of Jews , Muslims and Christians — and performed skits highlighting one ritual or tradition from that particular faith .
Seated outside the Bishop Booth Conference Center on a buggy but pleasant evening , the audience of some 80 parents and community members watched the children reenact the Muslim story of God ordering Abraham to sacrifice up his son , Ishmael ; the Christian celebration of holy week ; and the Jewish story of God coming to Jacob in a dream .
It played out like any school recital , with plenty of cheat sheets and giggles .
But the kids still took their religious education seriously .
For example , as this year ’s Kids4 Peace camp happened to coincide with the Jewish holiday of Tisha B’ov , some of the Orthodox Jews from Israel were fasting during the session .
When the other children found out , some of them decided to go without food , too , just to see what it was like .
( Of course , many Muslim children are familiar with fasting from their own observance of the holy month of Ramadan . )
Although such solidarity may seem like a big deal to adults , for the American , Palestinian and Israeli kids , it was just something fun to do .
Noa , a 12 - year - old girl from Burlington , explained : “ It ’s a little harder to ask adults to do that because they grew up with their own beliefs and their minds are already made up … .
If you grow up with peaceful thoughts , then it ’s easier to put them in action when you ’re older . ”
Newspapers have been covering Benjamin Bernanke ’s mid-September statement that the recession may be “ technically over ” , by which he presumably meant that U.S. Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) was no longer shrinking .
Should we pay attention to GDP statistics or whether or not we see business investing and people getting hired for non-government - related jobs ?
The technical definition of GDP includes government spending .
If the government were to double all of its employees ’ salaries , printing sufficient money to cover the increase , GDP would increase .
The government could end any recession in 10 minutes by doubling all the amounts paid to doctors and hospitals through Medicare and Medicaid .
The government could send out $ 500 checks to every American in exchange for people filling out a survey on what TV programs they watched in the preceding week ( survey results were produced ! ) .
There is no subtraction from GDP for government borrowing that must eventually be repaid .
A statistic that can be manipulated as easily as GDP should not be used to gauge the economy ’s health .
The obese sedentary guy who takes a statin will end up with a low measured cholesterol level … and he ’ll drop dead of a heart attack all the same .
What could we look at ?
How about private investment .
Without investment there wo n’t be growth in productivity , wages , or jobs .
Government investment is n’t sustainable in the long run because eventually there has to be some private activity to be taxed to feed the government .
Data on private investment as a component of GDP are available from www.bea.gov.
The NIPA table released on August 27 , 2009 ( direct link that may rot ) shows that “ gross private domestic investment ” was falling in 2007 and 2008 , mostly due to residential housing being lumped in .
Investment was falling at a rate of 50 percent per year in the first quarter of 2009 , at a rate of 25 percent per year in the second quarter ( Q3 data are not yet available ) .
The fall was not simply due to Americans deciding that they could live with their parents .
Investment in “ Equipment and software ” was falling at a rate of 36 percent in Q1 of 2009 ( after three years at that rate of decline , American business would only be investing one quarter as much as it had in 2008 … in the U.S. ; they might be investing vast sums in China or India but those do n’t add to our GDP ) .
An alternative statistic would be the total number of private sector jobs .
The number of jobs that the government can extract taxes from is about the same as in 1999 ( earlier posting ) .
Despite a larger population , the U.S. has not added any private sector jobs over the last 10 years .
I like this statistic better than anything having to do with earnings because it is not subject to distortion from the financial sector ( a few Wall Street guys collecting $ 100 million bonuses can make it look like the economy is growing sustainably ) .
Nor is it subject to distortion from America ’s pension system .
The 41 - year - old retired Boston city transit workers and the 48 - year - old retired autoworkers get and spend checks every month , but an increase in the amount of money society allocates to paying people not to work is not a sustainable path out of a downturn .
It surprises me that people are willing to pay attention to the GDP statistic , at least in the currency that the U.S. government can print .
If we must use GDP , should n’t we at least look at it adjusted for what the dollar is worth against a basket of foreign currencies ?
Usually currency traders are n’t fooled by our politicians ’ shenanigans .
The Euro was introduced in 1999 , ten years ago , and was worth about $ 1 . Today it is worth $ 1.46 .
Nominated in dollars , it looks as though the U.S. GDP grew from $ 9.5 trillion to $ 14 trillion .
Nominated in Euros , however , the U.S. GDP is about the same as it was in 1999 .
Due to population growth , this would mean that the average American should be slightly poorer than he or she was in 1999 , aside from any benefits that stem from improved technology .
Should we be putting on our King Bush II - style Mission Accomplished flight suits and celebrating the end of the recession because our government has figured out how to borrow more money and then spend it faster than ever ?

A row has blown up over an officer at a human rights group that monitors Israel .
He is accused of collecting " Nazi memorabilia " .
But is it unacceptable to collect material from the Third Reich ?
There 's been a rise in interest in Nazi memorabilia Marc Garlasco is not the first person to get into trouble for an interest in an aspect of the Third Reich .
Two years ago Bryan Ferry was pilloried for expressing admiration for the films of Leni Riefenstahl and the buildings of Albert Speer and other aspects of iconography .
And in 1999 , then GQ editor James Brown had to resign after Rommel and the Nazis were referred to in a list of the century 's 200 most stylish men .
Thousands of military history buffs collect war paraphernalia because we want to learn from the past
Marc Garlasco
But on both sides of the Atlantic there is a burgeoning market in Third Reich - era memorabilia .
Mr Garlasco is one of thousands of collectors who are seeking rare items from the period .
His hobby has outraged bloggers , who also accuse him of anti-Israel bias , and he has defended himself in a piece on the Huffington Post blog by saying that suggestions he has Nazi sympathies are " defamatory nonsense " .
Instead , he says he has a long - standing interest in World War II memorabilia from both the German and Allied sides .
" I 've never hidden my hobby , because there 's nothing shameful in it , however weird it might seem to those who are n't fascinated by military history , " he wrote .
The rarest memorabilia can be incredibly valuable " Thousands of military history buffs collect war paraphernalia because we want to learn from the past .
But I should have realized that images of the Second World War German military are hurtful to many . "
He admitted making " juvenile and tasteless postings " on two websites .
He had been accused of saying an SS leather jacket was " cool " .
But is there anything wrong with collecting Third Reich - era memorabilia ?
Malcom Fisher runs Regimentals , one of the biggest dealers in militaria in the UK .
On his website you can buy original items from as far back as the 18th Century , but much of his business is material from World War II , and much of that is German .
The website features everything from an oil painting of Adolf Hitler to vases stamped with swastikas .
But Mr Fisher says the collectors who buy from him are fundamentally just people with an interest in history .
" We in no way market these items for any other reason than history .
Whether it be British , Russian , German or Italian it is all part of history .
That can not be denied .
I handle the artefacts of history . "
In Germany , even anti-Nazi symbols can cause problems
The people who buy the militaria are ordinary people from various walks of life , says Mr Fisher .
He says he is wary of journalists who try to represent the hobby .
" There is a 1 % fringe element that are loonies but that will happen in any walk of life . "
The prices for the kind of items sold by Mr Fisher and collected by the likes of Mr Garlasco can be extraordinarily high , but there is also a parallel market in reproduction militaria .
Enthusiasts both collect the reproduction material , but also wear uniforms at re-enactment events .
Anthony Hole runs Militaria - net , which specialises in Third Reich - era memorabilia , all of which is reproduction .
The website sells , among a wide range of stock , SS uniforms and badges .
Mr Hole says he has also dealt with TV production companies like the BBC .
He describes the collectors as including " a generation of middle - aged men who grew up watching war films and playing with Action Man " .
Aesthetic factors
And the notion that collecting could be associated with political leanings is far fetched , he says .
" [ Garlasco ] being suspended is ludicrous .
The first collectors were ex-servicemen .
My wife 's uncle was a left - wing union leader .
He had a Nazi dagger his dad collected in the desert .
He passed it down to his son .
It 's the same as any other heirloom . "
He readily admits that a big factor in re-enactors ' choices is aesthetic .
" The German uniforms looked better than anybody else 's ...
If you looked at the British uniforms and equipment , [ it was ] very practical rather than aesthetic . "
But while much of the reproduction material may be historic , some of the items on Mr Hole 's website , including SS T - shirts and SS coffee mugs may raise eyebrows , to say the least .
Some might make a distinction between the ordinary parts of the Third Reich armed forces , and the SS , a wing of the Nazi party , parts of which led the organisation of the Holocaust .
Mark Frazer , of the Board of Deputies of British Jews , says everything has to be taken on a case - by - case basis .
The first collectors were servicemen and their families " No doubt some of these collectors will have purely academic motives and we'd have no quarrel with that .
But we are aware of those at the other end of the spectrum who dress up in Nazi uniforms for role - plays and recreations of life under the Third Reich .
" Such fantasies are certainly troubling if not dangerous and one would have to question their obsession with such a dark period in history .
They are certainly entitled to their hobby , just as we are entitled to think less of them when we hear about it . "
Some areas of course are totally unacceptable .
The organisation would always act on the sale of items from a concentration camp or anti-Semitic material .
The most important aspect is whether collecting memorabilia is connected to politics , says Gerry Gable , publisher of anti-fascist magazine Searchlight .
" It all depends on the circumstances .
If you say to me [ noted Holocaust denier ]
David Irving 's got a house full of Nazi memorabilia , I would say bad news .
Years ago there was a guy who on the surface was a World War II militaria collector but he was a BNP member with a wife in the police service .
There you draw a line .
" It is chasing shadows unless you can show the guy has some dodgy politics . "
Here is a selection of your comments .
As far as German uniforms looking " cool " , that was entirely the point of them .
The SS uniforms were designed by film costumers , not by the German army .
Similarly , Leni Riefenstahl films and Albert Speer buildings are massively significant artistic artifacts , and if you want to do any kind of assessment of artistic value then it's important to disconnect the visual element from the political context , because German art from that period * has * influenced everyone since .
The problem is that no - one before or since has been as effective at propaganda as the Nazis were , particularly in the use of art as propaganda .
But that in itself is something we must learn from history too - the country with the most effective propaganda is not necessarily the country who is in the right .

My grandfather passed down a small Mauser pistol that he obtained from a captured German officer in WWII - it is still functional , and we even take it to the range on rare occasions .
To me it is like a trophy - a memento of the Allies ' victory against the Axis forces .
War implements are like any other historical memorabilia , in that there is a story to tell behind them ... though with instruments of battle the story is often a cautionary one .
History is something to be studied and learned from - not feared or censored .
Jim Kenny , VA , United States
I recently saw a BBC documentary about Nazi war re-enactments , where there were a vast amount of Nazi memorabilia on sale .
I was astonished to see people proudly dressed in Nazi uniforms , even a Nazi wedding was filmed .
I felt saddened that my home country could actually allows such gatherings when every year the war memorial services get less and less .
I think all Nazi memorabilia should be on display in museums as a learning tool , a way to show future generations of what happened and what to avoid .

It is too easy to try to wrap this up as if we were simply talking about historical artefacts that people wish to collect .
We are dealing with not just a regime , but a philosophy & not just history but something that is underground and real and with us today .
If we take Graham Bayley 's comment that " under ever uniform there was an ordinary man " seriously , then it is logical to argue that it is the uniform therefore that makes the difference .
That being the case , and given what those uniforms made ' normal ' people do , then those specific uniforms , those specific badges , are most certainly unsafe for humans to be trading in .
David Collier , Ilford , UK I collect Mongolian , Japanese , Soviet , South African , Bhutan , and German militaria so I must offend at least 90 % of the world .
They must see me for the horseback riding , sword wielding communist with apartheid leanings , who likes to go mountaineering while eating sauerkraut and knackwurst evil man that I no doubt am .
It is a sad world we live in .
JC Peterse , Thornhill , Canada Surely people cannot object to people collecting objects of genuine historical interest , no matter how morbid or dark the subject .
If so , how far do you go back ?
World War II ?
I? 200 years ?
I know someone with some small roundhead relics from the Civil War ... does this make then dangerous anti-monarchists ?
Reproductions are slightly different as they are not historical collections .
But even then you need to be careful before you judge , just because you think a jacket looks ' cool ' it does n't mean you condone the actions of people wearing similar jackets !
David , Birmingham
I recently returned from a trip visiting the d - day beach landing sites of Normandy and old Nazi memorabilia from uniforms to cutlery and deactivated weaponry is readily available in museum gift shops .
A huge market exists for these objects as they are now antiques and are priced accordingly .
I see no problem with this myself as I am fascinated by the human condition and the effects of war .
Plus I think an air of romanticism exists about the 2nd world war about the fight between good and evil which many find appealing .
However there will always be those with extreme political views who will look to the past for inspiration and want to feel that bit closer to there ideals .
D Greenwood , London
A soldier handing down to his son the Nazi dagger he captured in battle is a substantially different case to one in which an individual collects items with no such intrinsic personal history .
Collectors of art often do so because they admire the artist ( or their particular movement ) or for material gain , but very often for both reasons .
Since there are available significant quantities of Nazi memorabilia , the values of these items is relatively trivial , which pretty much leaves us with a motive of admiration .
D Brookes , UK
My husband has a book that his grandfather picked up in Germany at the end of the Second World War .
It 's called simply ' Hitler ' and is a book full of black and white photographs stuck into a huge album - much like a sticker album today .
It has a forward by Goebbels extolling the virtues of the Third Reich .
It 's a fascinating book in a way ( as a piece of history ) but I loath it and wish we could get rid of it .
It 's wrapped up in a plastic bag , high on a shelf in our understairs cupboard - and there , as far as I am concerned - it can stay .
Rosemary Ward I have an avid interest in the 2nd world war and especially the Nazi party .
It is a very interesting point in history and one that should be studied so the same evil can never be repeated .
My interest is purely for historical reasons and in no way political , I am extremely anti-fascist and do not see how any person could ever glorify the Nazi party or make it sound anything other than pure evil .
This article is very good in getting the message across that just because someone has an interest in something it does not mean they believe in it .
Obviously you do get the extremists such as the bnp , who apparently are n't racist but a quick google search show its members giving nazi salutes , but I think to put everyone with an interest in history under that banner would be extremely unfair .
Lee Murray , Birmingham I collect WHW ( Winterhilfwerk ) donation badges of the Third Reich era and become extremely frustrated with the reporting of this period of history .
The WHW items are virtually banned on certain auction websites , deemed as objects of hate because they may carry a swastika or an image of Adolf Hitler .
I do not support or promote the ideals of the National Socialist regime which carried out heinous crimes .
However , we think nothing of the collection of militaria of the Japanese ( who killed 5.5 million civilians ) , the Russians ( Stalin killed up to 20 Million of his own people ) , the British ( for inventing the civilian concentration camp ) and the Americans ( their genocide and systematic ethnic cleansing of the Native American Peoples ) .
You can not undo history , only hide it or drive it underground .
Please remember that it is only the losing side that is tried for war crimes and if you take the time to speak to veterans they will tell you that under every uniform there was an ordinary man , except in very very rare cases , no matter which countrys ' uniform he was wearing .

HPV Vaccine Gardasil
HPV Vaccine Gardasil 2
Cervical cancer vaccine punted to 300,000 more teenage girls
HPV Vaccine Hoax Exposed
Alert over jab for girls as two die following cervical cancer vaccination .
A jab that could be given to hundreds of thousands of schoolgirls this autumn was at the centre at a safety scare last night following the deaths of two young women .
European regulators are investigating the “ sudden and unexpected ” deaths of the women who received Gardasil , one of two jabs to protect against cervical cancer licensed for use in the UK .
The vaccine has been hailed as a breakthrough by the Department of Health , which is backing an annual programme of vaccination for girls aged 11 to 13 years starting in September .
The jab is already available privately and a thirteen - year - old girl from London became the first in the country to receive the cervical cancer vaccine in 2006 .
Hollie Anderson ’s mother , Lisa , paid £ 450 for her to have the jab after seeing her own mother battle against cancer .
I have been saying it ’s dangerous for ages , and so have countless others .
The government gave millions of pounds of taxpayers money to Merck , the shit - kicking Big Pharma firm to buy an untested vaccine , that had a history of deaths and bad reactions from those who received the cocktail of crap .
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) said one of the young women who received Gardasil died in Germany while the other was in Austria .
It has not released their ages .
It follows the deaths of three young women aged 12 , 19 and 22 who were reported to have died in the U.S. days after Gardasil was administered , with 1,700 patients suffering “ adverse reactions ” .
There were no previous recorded deaths in Europe .
The EMEA said : “ In both cases , the cause of death could not be identified .
“ No causal relationship has been established between the deaths of the young women and the administration of Gardasil . ”
LOL Deaths Associated with HPV Vaccine Start Rolling In , Over 3500 Adverse Affects Reported .
Judicial Watch , a U.S. government watchdog , became concerned while noting large donations to key politicians originating from Merck .
A freedom of information request from the group in May of this year discovered that during the period from June 8 , 2006 – when the vaccines received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) – to May 2007 there were 1,637 reports of adverse reactions to the HPV vaccine reported to the FDA .
Three deaths were related to the vaccine , including one of a 12 - year - old .
One physician ’s assistant reported that a female patient “ died of a blood clot three hours after getting the Gardasil vaccine . ”
Two other reports , on girls 12 and 19 , reported deaths relating to heart problems and / or blood clotting .
Visit my other articles on Gardasil to get an in depth look at just how bad it is .
A spokesman said 1.5 million people had been given the vaccine in Europe .
She said there were no plans to change advice on the use of the vaccine .
The UK vaccination programme will protect girls against the sexually - transmitted human papillomavirus ( HPV ) that causes cervical cancer .
It should help cut up to 1,000 deaths a year from the disease .
Gardasil , made by Merck , is one of the jabs to be used initially .
The other is Cervarix , made by Glaxo - SmithKline .
Dr Nicholas Kitchin , medical director at Sanofi Pasteur MSD , which markets Gardasil , said : “ The authorities in the two countries have looked intensively at these two cases and have not established a causal link , and this has been endorsed by the EMEA .
“ The fact that the EMEA is not taking any action on the back of this should be seen as reassuring that the product remains safe . ”
Hmm .
It ’s costing the taxpayer over £ 10 million .
It may save 1000 lives .
Now if only prostrate cancer had that sort of financial dedication from the government .
Not sure what the final number of lives ‘ saved ’ will actually be when you subtract the number of girls who will die from it and have other adverse reactions like , appendicitis , arthritis , asthma , bronchospasm , gastroenteritis , insomnia , joint pain , nausea , pelvic - inflammatory disease , and upper respiratory tract infection .
It can also render girls infertile .
Wonderful stuff I ’m sure you ’ll agree .

To arrive at the set of keywords that :
Describe business correctly ( are relevant )
Attract traffic ( are popular & are searched for )
Have less competition ( are relatively un-optimized for )
Steps
Step I :
Lets start by saying that the for the keyword finalization of a web site the first step is to device the theme of the web site .
The keywords then should be generated which are in sync with the theme structure of the site .
The home pages & the other higher level pages should target more general ( main theme ) keywords .
The deeper pages ( embedded in sub directories or sub domains ) should target more specific & qualified keywords .
Once the sites themes & sub - themes are done , lets start by looking for the keywords
StepII :
The finalization of the keywords for any given site can be done in the following way :
Generation of the seed keywords for the site ( theme keywords ) .
Expansion of the seed keywords into key - phrases by adding qualifiers ( sub theme keywords )
Generating a larger set of keywords by word play on the key - phrases generated in step II .( sub theme targeting )
Lets take them one by one :
SEED Keywords / Primary keywords :
The seed keywords can be generated by either of the ways mentioned below :
The client provides the terms he feels are relevant to his business .
The SEO firm generates the seed words by understanding the business domain & the business model of the client .
Some outside domain consultant provides them .
Another way of generating seed keywords is to look for the meta tags of the competition web sites .
WARNING : do not place any unnecessary emphasis on these tags .
Use them just to generate you seed keywords list .
If one has certain set of keywords then tools like WT & Overture can also be used to arrive at the other relevant seed keywords .
Typically seed keywords are single word .
A good number of seed Keywords is between 10 - 12 .
SUB theme Keywords ( add Qualifiers )
Now to these seed keywords add qualifiers .
These qualifiers can be anything location / sub - product / color / part no/activity / singular etc .
By utilizing these qualifiers one can expand the list of the seed keywords .
Say a good number would be anywhere between 20 - 30 .
Typically a sub theme key phrase could be of 2 - 3 - 4 word length .
One recent study suggests that
The typical searcher often uses longer queries .
Many contain more than three words .
Within three different search engines , keyword distribution data tells a compelling story :
Words in Query Look Smart ( % ) Ask.com ( % ) Teoma ( % )
1 27.00 12.76 38.04
2 33.00 22.46 29.59
3 23.00 19.34 18.13
4 10.00 11.89 8.00
5 7.00 * 7.86 3.51
6 – 6.19 1.39
7 – 5.47 0.63
Look Smart does not report beyond 5 search terms , instead grouping five or more terms into one category .
Approximately 40 percent of queries in Look Smart have three or more words .
About 32 percent in Teoma have three or more .
Ask Jeeves has an even higher skew , nearly 62 percent , because of its natural language focus .
Within FAST , the database that powers Lycos and others , the average is 2.5 terms .
That suggests a similar frequency distribution to LookSmart and Teoma .
Hence we can keep the average length of sub theme keywords at around 3 .
THE Rudd Government 's decision to separate Telstra will increase competition and lead to better services , the telecommunications industry says .
Australia 's second and third largest telcos , Optus and iiNet , said the Government 's decision to divide the company was a " landmark change " .
" It changes the entire landscape , " said Optus director of government and corporate affairs Maha Krishnapillai .
" The sector has been dysfunctional and that has been largely driven by Telstra 's behaviour . "
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy today announced major changes to the Telecommunications
Act to force Telstra to separate its infrastructure and retail arms , or face tough new rules on the way it operates .
Join Malcolm
Farr 's blog :
What the Telstra break - up will mean
The changes will allow Telstra to voluntarily separate itself , or be " functionally separated " by the Government .
Gartner mobile and wireless research director Robin Simpson said the move was aimed at creating a " level playing field " for telcos .
" Telstra dominate all of the fixed infrastructure and if you are fixed telco or a mobile telco you need access to Telstra ’s infrastructure to run your business , " he said .
" The thinking behind the Government strategy is if we could introduce a level playing field in terms of the cost , availability and speed with which you can get connected ... it would enhance competition .
" It lowers the costs of the competing carriers and makes it faster for them to gain access to connectivity they need . ”
iiNet managing director Michael Malone said the move would directly benefit consumers .
" The big winner from these reforms is the Australian consumer who will be able to gain access to fast , affordable and competitive broadband services , " he said .
" It should provide greater certainty for the telecommunications industry and encourage investment , innovation and jobs . "
Consumer group CHOICE also welcomed the move to end Telstra 's monopoly on infrastructure .
" Consumers will only gain benefits from improved productivity where there is fair competition among telco retailers , " said director of policy and campaigns Gordon Renouf .
" Where one controls the underlying infrastructure we can have no confidence in competition delivering those benefits for consumers . "
Meanwhile Telstra has criticised the new legislation , saying the changes are unnecessary .
" We are disappointed the Government has felt it necessary to introduce this legislation , " said chief executive David Thodey .
" ( However ) Telstra remains committed to working with the Government to find a solution that is in the best interests of the industry , the nation , Telstra and our shareholders . "

The Microsoft - Yahoo search deal is n’t a forgone conclusion .
In fact , news out yesterday suggests the companies may face serious regulatory hurdles .
Potentially , it wo n’t be allowed .
That leaves me wondering .
What ’s Yahoo ’s Plan B ?
Does it even have a backup plan , especially when CEO Carol Bartz has suggested Yahoo can no longer run search on its own ?
In June — before the deal was announced — Bartz said this to the world :
“ Yahoo does n’t have to do anything with Microsoft about anything , ” Bartz said at an investor conference .
Three months later , she reversed herself .
A New York Times interview has her saying Yahoo could n’t afford to do search on its own :
Ms. Bartz said she sold the search business because Yahoo could no longer continue to match the level of investment Google and Microsoft were making in searching , one of the Web ’s most lucrative and technologically complex businesses .
Who does this ?
It ’s like trying to sell a bricks - and - mortar business and saying you ’ve got no choice but to do so .
You ’re not going to get a good price from your buyer ( Microsoft ) , if they think you ’re desperate or have no alternative ( Yahoo ’s already been barred from doing a deal with Google ) .
Worse , what if you DON ’T sell that business ?
Are you just going to board it up ?
Are you going to shop it around to other buyers who realize you ’re even more desperate now ?
Do they want to buy a business that you ’ve said ca n’t afford to run ?
That ’s the situation Bartz is in if Yahoo ca n’t sell its search assets .
Meanwhile , Yahoo employees keep leaving .
Doug Cutting who left last month said his departure had been in the works for months and had nothing to do with the recent deal that was announced .
I totally believe that .
I figure months before this , Cutting was smart enough to see Yahoo was done in search and wanted to move on .
I suspect more people will be like that , and when Bartz has continued to suggest that Yahoo is n’t a search engine — even denies it ever was one — it just does n’t seem that inspiring for anyone who wants to be involved with search .
Oh , but the user interface will be key !
Bartz pushed that once again in a television interview out yesterday , likening search technology to being like an Intel computer processor that you build a computer around .
IE — see how successful companies like Microsoft , Apple or HP have been without owning the processor ?
Yahoo can be the same without owning the “ search processor . ”
The UI is n’t going to change anything for Yahoo .
In case there ’s any mistake , I ’ll say it again as clearly as possible :
USER INTERFACE CHANGES WON’T LET YAHOO COMPETE IN SEARCH
Got it ?
Write it down , someone come check back on this in five years .
If Yahoo ’s moved up in search share thanks to outsourcing search and just toying with the user interface , I ’ll eat those words somehow — covered even in Yahoo purple frosting .
No one has succeeded as a general search engine just by making user interface changes .
No one , in the past nearly 15 years of us having search engines .
That ’s like 150 “ real ” years .
( For more , see A Search Eulogy For Yahoo and Why Search Sucks & You Wo n’t Fix It The Way You Think )
The interview ticked me off in other ways .
Bartz downplayed search as something people spend only 3 % of their time on .
Hey , I do n’t spend all my time shopping .
But who do you think makes more money off of me , places I shop at or television stations that deliver me entertainment ?
Bartz also joked about how “ I do n’t wake up in the morning and think gosh , ‘ What am I going to search for ’ . ”
This was in reaction to one of the CNBC hosts interviewing her joking how Google ’s big change to its home page was to make the search box larger .
Yahoo , you see , is that central place where everyone starts their day .
Ha , ha , ha .
Let ’s laugh all the way to the bank , shall we ?
That “ plain ” home page earns plenty of money for Google from all the people who go there and , um , search on it .
Making the Google search box bigger was a simple but effective change .
Gosh , I ’m pretty sure one of the Yahoo home page changes ( it ’s hard to keep track of them , as that page seems to change so often ) , was to make its own search box bigger .
Let ’s also put our heads in the sand about the fact that Google has a personalized home page service , iGoogle .
Bartz does an amazing job talking about all of Yahoo ’s properties and downplaying Google as if it does n’t compete in some of these same areas .
I agree .
Yahoo is a huge leader in many areas , as I wrote in my Yahoo The Failure : Myth Versus Reality piece last year .
But Google does compete in a variety of ways .
It ’s investing in search AND in portal features .
So ’s Microsoft .
It ’s Yahoo that ’s pulling back .
Watching that interview , I remarked on Twitter that Bartz is coming off with me like some type of Sarah Palin of search ( Silicon Valley Insider got a kick out of that ) .
I watch her do these TV interviews , and she ’s got this “ aw shucks ” and “ straight shooting ” delivery that makes you want to believe in the things she ’s saying , regardless of how they ’re being spun .
For me , the problem is that I know search too well for that type of spin to work on me .
I just find it irritating .
I also find it amazing .
Bartz is working so hard to marginalize search ( last I looked , the second most popular internet activity after doing email ) .
She ’s working so hard to say that Yahoo has to give things up to Microsoft .
What if she ca n’t dump search .
What ’s the Plan B ?
How do you recover running search on your own after having chopped off your own legs ?

The issue of population , or more accurately overpopulation , is a really , really sensitive subject , so I want to state from the outset that this article is not directed to those people with children , rather those that are considering having children ; be it their first or adding to their clan .
What ’s done is done , what ’s not can be prevented .
Knowledge is wonderful , but with it comes a heavy responsibility .
Jonathon Porritt , an advisor to the UK government , believes that green groups are betraying the interests of their members by refusing to address population issues due to the topic being “ too controversial ” .
He ’s right , it ’s the elephant in the room many of us are trying to ignore for fear of backlash .
I had touched on the topic briefly and gingerly in the past with some interesting feedback .
At the age of 27 , I decided that it was important that I did not have children and took the appropriate steps to ensure it did n’t occur .
At that stage , it had more to do with genetics than environment , but as I get older I ’ve discovered the side benefit was my decision is likely my greatest gift to the planet .
It ’s a decision I have never , ever , ever regretted , so I certainly can’t claim it was a huge sacrifice and be eligible for any martyr awards .
The thought of my progeny running about planet Earth sends chills down my spine to be quite honest :) .
For me to perpetuate the line would have contributed so much additional environmental strain , even if my kids missed getting hit by the genetic boogeyman .
For example , the average life expectancy of Australians , Canadians , folks in the USA and UK is between 77 – 80 years .
At an average of 11 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year , the average Aussie will generate more than 880 tons of carbon emissions in one lifetime .
That does n’t include all the other harm we do .
But what if I did n’t stop at one child and had two or more ?
Or what about my child ’s children , their children and so on .
What if some of them became heavy tobacco smokers like me ?
The mind boggles at the potential environmental impact if I had decided to have kids .
It could potentially have many thousands of tons of greenhouse gas emissions and toxic waste within a few generations .
Even if I reduced my personal impact by 75 % , that could be wiped out by me introducing a single mini-me to this planet .
Here ’s a few stats gathered from Mother Jones about the carbon footprint of children :
– One child in the USA generates as much CO2 as 106 Haitian children .
– In the region of 223 trees would be needed to offset the CO2 generated by a child watching 3 hours of TV every day for 18 years .
– In 2006 , volunteers collected 68,720 lbs of toys and 33,469 lbs of diapers during global beach cleanups .
– The average student bins up to 90 lbs of lunch - box leftovers and packaging each year .
Sure , I could have taken steps with my kids to avoid some of those things , but that does n’t mean they would have continued it .
My parents warned me about drugs , but that certainly did n’t stop me losing a decade of my life to them .
The machine of marketing is in kids ’ ears for so much of their lives and it ’s incredibly pervasive and persuasive .
I know because I ’m part of that machine .
The other thing that constantly springs to my mind for those of us who fully understand where humanity is at – why would you want to bring children into a world that ’s falling apart environmentally ?
We ca n’t guarantee their survival , nor can we even be confident in it .
Are we offering them the “ gift of life ” or a terrible curse ?
Some talk about their “ right ” to children .
But where does that “ right ” come from ?
Mother Nature issues us with no such right .
Are we listening too much to our animal instincts but using our “ superior ” intellects to rationalize our having children rather than facing the fact this planet needs to be fixed before we can continue expanding , or even just maintaining current population levels ?
Many say even at current levels , the population is unsustainable long term .
We really need to think long and hard about why we have children .
The finger is often pointed at developing countries regarding their tendency to generate massive broods , but I feel those folks have a better justification than most of us do .
They do n’t have the education we do and it ’s their survival strategy for when they get older .
With mortality rates so high in many country they need to have more children .
Until we address their poverty , nothing will change there .
But in order for us to maintain our comparatively lavish lifestyles , they must stay poor .
It ’s sadly just how the system works for now and it ’s a system doomed to fail .
Let ’s face it ; we humans are n’t exactly an endangered species and no matter what types of controls are put in place , be they from government or nature throwing devastation our way , it ’s unlikely everyone will stop procreating all at once and for humanity to disappear from the planet altogether .
Let me play the devil ’s advocate here – even if it did , why would that be so bad ?
Why is it so important in the grand scale of things that our species continues to survive forever ?
Seems to me that the way we are going it could n’t be – we appear to have some sort of collective , subconscious death wish .
If it is so important , what ’s wrong with Africans taking over the world for example ?
Or Chinese , or Indians ?
Who cares as long as it ’s an element of the species that by that time knows how to look after the darned place .
Our societies and commerce systems are based on the false assumption that infinite expansion is realistic .
Deep down , most of us know that is insane .
Knowing is one thing , experiencing it is another .
We , and the next couple of generations are going to quickly see that this is not the case .
Not only the environment , but our own financial systems have turned against us already .
For those of us with the education and knowledge of the perils of overpopulation , it ’s up to us to make what for some will be a huge sacrifice – to not have any / more children .
That does n’t stop us from teaching the current and next generation about our mistakes so that they may avoid them .
Want kids or something to nurture ?
Adopt .
Consider getting a recycled pet even .
For the others who do n’t fully understand the danger we our now facing with overpopulation and the environmentally generally – continue to eat , drink and be merry by all means , but if you do , just do n’t have kids – that can be your contribution ; there ’s nothing further you need do or understand .
Going green for you can be that easy .
Sounds like a fair trade for not having to compromise your lifestyle do n’t you think ?
Let ’s just give churning out kiddies a bit of a rest for a while and see how this mess pans out .
Ouroboros contributer Kristen Fortney is covering the 4th Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence conference , presently underway in Cambridge .
A wide range of researchers are gathered for one of the few scientifically respectable conferences to focus on the elimination of aging and repair of age - related damage in the old - though a lot of the work presented yesterday only pertains to slowing the progress of aging .
Some selected excerpts from the first two days of the conference are linked below , and you might want to wander over to the SENS Foundation website and look at the conference presentation abstracts or the program to see what 's coming up next .
SENS4 , Session 1 : Combating oxidation
Cathy Clarke tested an original and interesting approach to avoiding free radical damage to poly - unsaturated fatty acids , or PUFAs : isotope reinforcement .
...
The basic idea here , explained in an earlier paper , is very simple : heavier isotopes make stronger bonds , so isotope - reinforced PUFAs will be more resistant to free radical attack .
Will these results transfer to higher organisms ?
Is there any chance that the deuterium could get incorporated into other molecules , stabilizing proteins that we want to degrade ?
The authors plan to follow up this study in worms and mice .
SENS4 , Session 3 : Optimising metabolism against aging
Stephen Spindler described his ( ongoing ) project to screen a large number of potential lifespan - affecting compounds in mice - so far , several candidates look promising .
Interestingly , he also argued that the majority of previous studies measuring the effects of various compounds on rodent life expectancy suffer from serious flaws .
In particular , he argued that many of them were confounded by a possible calorie restriction effect : mice are picky eaters , and if you change their diet by adding some compound to it , they will often eat less of it .
SENS4 , Session 4 : Adult regenerative capacity
Brandon Reines presented a counterintuitive result on regeneration : sometimes old animals have a higher regenerative capacity than young animals .
In particular , if you punch a hole in the ear of a young mouse , then it wo n’t heal ; but in a middle - aged mouse it will heal completely .
He argued that this happens because mouse ear connective tissues never fully differentiate , and suggested that other neural - crest - derived connective tissues might show similar properties .
SENS4 , Session 5 : Eliminating recalcitrant intracellular molecules : the lysosome
John Schloendorn discussed ongoing work at the SENS Foundation Research Center to develop new enzymes that can degrade harmful intracellular junk that accumulates with age .
So far , they have discovered enzymes that can degrade A2E and 7 - ketocholesterol , which are implicated in macular degeneration and osteoporosis , respectively .
Their next step will be to construct a drug delivery system to get these enzymes to lysozomes ...
On the lighter side , Schloendorn also described some of the Center ’s methods for building functional lab equipment on the cheap , all good examples for aspiring DIY biologists .
SENS4 , Session 6 : Eliminating recalcitrant intracellular molecules : other
Claude Wischik spoke about preventing aggregation of tau protein , which is implicated in Alzheimer ’s disease .
Clinical trials of their aggregation - inhibiting drug Rember are promising : it seems to slow the down the rate of cognitive decline in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer ’s disease .
SENS4 , Sessions 9 and 10 : Rejuvenating extracellular material
Kendall
Houk gave a very interesting talk on computationally designing enzymes from scratch .
They plan to apply their recently published protocol to develop enzymes that can reverse the formation of Advanced Glycation End-products ( AGEs ) - sugar - modified proteins that accumulate with age and are implicated in several age - related diseases .
Just inside the entrance to the U.S. Treasury , on the other side of a forbidding array of guard stations and scanners that control access to the Greek Revival building , lies one of the most beautiful interior spaces in all of Washington .
Ornate bronze doors open inward to a two - story - high chamber .
Chandeliers line the coffered ceiling , casting a soft glow on the marble walls and richly inlaid marble floor .

||How did the economy get into this mess ?
Visit our archive “ Charting the Road to Ruin . ” Illustration by Brad Holland .

In this room , starting in 1869 and for many decades thereafter , the U.S. government conducted many of its financial transactions .
Bags of gold , silver , and paper currency arrived here by horse - drawn vans and were carted upstairs to the vaults .
On the busy trading floor , Treasury clerks supplied commercial banks with coins and currency , exchanged old bills for new , cashed checks , redeemed savings bonds , and took in government receipts .
In those days , anyone could observe all this activity firsthand — could actually witness the government and the nation ’s bankers doing business .
The public space where this occurred became known as the Cash Room .
Today the Cash Room is used for press conferences , ceremonial functions , and departmental parties .
And that ’s too bad .
If Treasury still used the room as it once did , then perhaps we ’d have more of a clue about what happened to the billions of dollars that flew out of Treasury to selected American banks in the waning days of the Bush administration .
To read the complete story , pick up a copy of The Great Hangover : 21 Tales of the New Recession from the Pages of Vanity Fair* *( Harper Perennial ) , available online and at better booksellers now .
Is secession ever justified ?
Mainstream conservatives and progressives often encourage it in other countries - remember Kosovo - even as they deify Abraham Lincoln for preventing it in the U.S.
But consider what the federal government has done to us over the past century : Fractional - reserve banking backed up by the Federal Reserve Board - creating a culture based on credit rather than saving Relentless meddling in other countries - through war or coercion ( forced " cooperation " ) - in order to expand markets for American corporations .
Prohibition or regulation of inexpensive or superior alternatives to corporate products - resulting in everything from the War on Drugs to the War on Hemp to the decline of small farms and small business .
More could be added to this list .
My point is that , for anyone not blinded by nationalism , any of the three provide solid grounds for peaceful secession of the states from the Union .
Together , they make a compelling case .
It could be asked if things would not be even worse after a formal break - up .
The answer is that no one knows for sure .
But some things are likely : The Federal Reserve would be put to an end .
States that want to attract business and create jobs would have to figure out a better financial system for themselves .
The wars in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Iraq would end , as well as all of the overseas occupations , and no state would have the ability to wage non-defensive war .
There 'd be as much reason for terrorists to target American states as they do Norway or Luxembourg .
There would be no more federal medical marijuana raids or BATFE sieges .
Special interests and corporations would find it more difficult to bribe 50 state legislatures than just one Congress .
But nationalism makes neither peaceful nor violent secession likely .
Over the past century the nationalists have effectively instilled their propaganda through public schools and in more subtle ways , such as placing the Flag of the United States in church sanctuaries .
They have also effectively persuaded the people that a pro-secession argument is a pro-slavery argument .
This is completely illogical , but it sticks .
In any case , anyone who loses their faith in Washington DC is certainly not going to place it in Sacramento or Springfield or Albany .
But it is quite possible they 'll lose their faith in DC .
The American Empire is falling apart .
Recall that in the last year of his Administration , Bush was unable to make war on Iran or stand up to Russia , as he desperately wanted to do .
The country was simply too weak .
And it is weaker now , diverting resources from the failed Iraq experiment into Afghanistan .
Just as the USSR 's empire imploded shortly after it ended its failed incursion in Afghanistan , the same might happen to the USA .
The USA is also weak financially .
It does n't have the money to pay for Medicare and Social Security .
If Obama 's domestic plans like Cap & Trade and Health Care " Reform " pass Congress , we will likely see a deepening recession alongside rampant inflation .
If the increasing numbers of jobless see the price of food and fuel soar , we could see civil unrest .
If and when U.S. military troops are called in to suppress rioters - whether by this President or the next , whether in the inner city or at Tea Party - like protests - the end of the USA will be all but official .
There probably wo n't be any secession even at that time .
Hard - line progressives and conservatives will still hold out hope that if the " right people " are in charge , things can get fixed .
But the foundation of the political system will be shaken forever .
This foundation is the faith which the majority of the people have in the system .
Their faith was actually sold by Congress to J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created .
More and more of the people are realizing it now , but they 're still in the minority .
If the unemployment rate and / or the inflation rate soars , and if the government becomes heavy - handed in controlling unrest , more and more Americans will lose their faith at an increasingly rapid rate .
When people lose their faith in a system they can not control , their only viable option is to drop out of it when possible and game it when necessary .
They will seek allies with which to barter goods or services .
They will reject Federal Reserve dollars when they can , or accept payments only in cash without reporting the income .
A system of bribery based on special favors of " friends of friends " who work for the government will flourish .
It might not be as brazen as in third - world countries , but could become equally rampant .
The " cheaters " and tax evaders would be so numerous that the government could n't possibly catch them all .
Soon , people will form their own schools , as funding from DC will dry up .
No longer will the USA threaten and coerce other countries .
As soon as state and local police lose federal funding , they will stop providing SWAT back - ups of federal raids .
This future will be anarchy , not because there wo n't be a nominal government , but because the people will have lost faith in politics and thereby lose whatever trust they had in government .
The people will treat it as an obstacle in their lives , to be worked around when possible and dealt with when necessary .
But they 'll stop voting and stop volunteering to put their lives at risk for the Flag .
This coming anarchy actually exists today .
The world is the product of our beliefs , upon which we act .
We let ourselves be governed only because we believe the government is more right than wrong , more good than bad .
There is no " authority , " there is only people with uniforms and guns , and you obey them either because you believe in what they do , or because you fear them .
Either way , it 's just your beliefs .
But the less we admire or sacrifice for the government , and the more we comply out of fear and self - interest , the less the effective the State will be .
Sooner or later , alternative institutions will spring up to provide security , legal adjudication , even money .
Even if the U.S. never faces a Berlin Wall moment , the people , by their beliefs and actions , can make the government increasingly irrelevant to their lives .
And that does n't have to begin at some future turning point , it can begin today .

South Korea is planning to raise tens of millions of dollars by selling vintage US combat rifles to gun enthusiasts in the United States .
The ageing M1 and carbine rifles were used by US troops in the Korean and Vietnam wars before being donated to the South Korean military .
The rifles have been mothballed for years in military warehouses , but were occasionally used in drills by reserve soldiers .
The defence ministry in Seoul says it has won approval to sell more than 100,000 rifles .
The sale is expected to raise more than $ 120 million .

I realise it 's very difficult to get these things right , but when we have an " Afghanistan day " like yesterday , in which Downing Street and three important departments try to reassure a doubtful public , it 's the language that lets them down .
Taliban " moderates " and Afghan " democracy " were all over the airwaves yesterday .
Give us a break .
It 's not David Miliband 's fault .
Read the level - headed and impressive speech the foreign secretary made to Nato in Brussels yesterday and I do n't think you 'll find the word " democracy " in the text once .
That is progress , and reflects a realisation that we are not dealing with modern Surrey – or even Louisiana – here , but a remote and essentially feudal society .
Miliband is groping for an exit strategy .
I could have kissed him ( well , perhaps not ) when I read the sentence : " We are not in Afghanistan militarily because girls were not allowed to go to school . "
How many times have we heard reference to school attendance rates – there , not here – from well - meaning politicians and even soldiers on the ground who know they need UK public opinion behind them and have been told there are a lot of women voters – here and there ?
The foreign secretary went on to say : " But helping them [ girls ] do so is an important downpayment to Afghans desperate for a better future for their children .
Ditto health care .
Ditto jobs .
That is why in Helmand , to take as an example , British , American , Danish and Estonian civilian and military staff are working to help build schools , provide clean water and electricity , surface roads and support agriculture . "
The trouble since 2001 has been that the development agenda has repeatedly stalled .
Nato forces have been bogged down fighting the ragbag insurgency that is actively sabotaging development efforts .
The Karzai government in Kabul is corrupt and ineffective over much of the country .
The Americans have a bad record bombing innocent civilians – who are voters too .
So Miliband states – or rather restates , since Tony Blair , Gordon Brown , Paddy Ashdown and others have all said it too – the obvious that the west must find an effective way of including whatever Taliban factions ( acres of newsprint today is devoted to deconstructing them , as Miliband attempted , too ) can be persuaded that not fighting is the better option .
Since fighting is all many of them know – the Russians invaded in December 1979 and it was hardly Kew Gardens before then – that is a daunting prospect .
Citing British experience in Northern Ireland , ministers make the point that the political strategy – reconciliation , inclusion and development – requires maintenance of the military strategy that persuades the Taliban ( or IRA ) that they can't win and that we 're not going to leave soon .
That 's what Barack Obama and the smart soldiers the Iraq / Afghan conflicts have finally produced ( it always takes time in any war to purge dud peacetime desk generals ) seem to be saying too .
It helps .
The Northern Ireland experience is relevant only up to a point .
It needed war - weariness all round , plus the convergent interests of Dublin , London and Washington – all three well led at the time – as well as competent local negotiators in Belfast to sign the Good Friday deal .
The process ruined the moderate ( a relative word here too ) signatory parties – the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist party – so that the regional government is now in the hands of the province 's equivalent of the Taliban : Sinn Féin and the ex-IRA , and the Paisleyite DUP .
At a retirement bash for the Irish Times 's distinguished London correspondent , Frank Millar , the other evening I could n't help noticing that the VIPs present were all from the respectable strands – officials and politicians from Dublin , London and the SDLP / UU parties – not the old hardliners .
All the same , they have scrubbed up well enough , and first minister Peter Robinson of the DUP is a smart operator , as is Martin McGuinness .
There remains outside the fold what Miliband might call " tier one " fundamentalists , the Continuity and Real IRA – local equivalents to Mullah Omar .
A lot of people do n't like it for obvious reasons and there are still fractures , notably over control of policing and security , though friends in Belfast sometimes tell me that reported " sectarian " disturbances are mostly just hooliganism .
But public opinion accepts the dirty compromises for peace and development .
Belfast city centre now looks like most others .
All of which is a longwinded way of saying it 's doable in Kabul if the will , skill and commitment is there .
But is it ?
Elections loom because elections , always an imperfect mechanism , are what the west expects , though safe in west London my Afghan dry cleaner is always telling me they 're a charade : people vote as they 're told .
Hamid Karzai looks like one of those Ulster Unionist leaders , not strong enough to cut the deal .
Which raises the larger question : is Afghanistan remotely a state in the sense that Henry VIII declared this country to be – " this realm of England is an empire " – when he formally broke with the Pope in 1534 - 35 ?
Between them Henry VII , his son Henry VIII , Cardinal Wolsey ( why does he remind me of Peter Mandelson ? ) , and the formidable Thomas Cromwell brought the warring feudal lords to heel , got the justice system working and filled the Treasury – though Henry VIII , having executed Cromwell , went on to waste the money fighting the French , because that was what kings of England did , was n't it ?
The Taliban would understand .
It took a scary decade after his death ( 1547 ) before his younger daughter , who had inherited the Tudor brains , got a grip on things again – and another unsettled century after her death ( 1603 ) to nail down a settlement that still endures .
I 'd wager that what the suffering Afghans need most is the Henry VII who won the Battle of Bosworth Field , a tough , tightfisted central ruler who could manage the warlords and promote such basics as trade , clean water , and ( we 've moved on since 1485 ) education for girls .
That 's what the Russians thought they were doing when their tanks rolled in in 1979 , though they did n't understand – still do n't – the importance of enforceable laws .
More important than votes , as even an old tyrant like Henry VIII knew .
He did things by the book even if he cheated .
I am grateful to Hilary Mantel 's splendid evocation of his reign , her new novel , Wolf Hall , which I have just finished , for reminding me .
Given the structure of the consortiums that operated the mines , it would be exceedingly difficult for Niger to transfer uranium to Iraq .
Niger 's uranium business consists of two mines , Somair and Cominak , which are run by French , Spanish , Japanese , German and Nigerian interests .
If the government wanted to remove uranium from a mine , it would have to notify the consortium , which in turn is strictly monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Moreover , because the two mines are closely regulated , quasi - governmental entities , selling uranium would require the approval of the minister of mines , the prime minister and probably the president .
In short , there 's simply too much oversight over too small an industry for a sale to have transpired .
( As for the actual memorandum , I never saw it .
But news accounts have pointed out that the documents had glaring errors -- they were signed , for example , by officials who were no longer in government -- and were probably forged .
And then there 's the fact that Niger formally denied the charges . )
Before I left Niger , I briefed the ambassador on my findings , which were consistent with her own .
I also shared my conclusions with members of her staff .
In early March , I arrived in Washington and promptly provided a detailed briefing to the C.I.A .
I later shared my conclusions with the State Department African Affairs Bureau .
There was nothing secret or earth - shattering in my report , just as there was nothing secret about my trip .
Though I did not file a written report , there should be at least four documents in United States government archives confirming my mission .
The documents should include the ambassador 's report of my debriefing in Niamey , a separate report written by the embassy staff , a C.I.A. report summing up my trip , and a specific answer from the agency to the office of the vice president ( this may have been delivered orally ) .
While I have not seen any of these reports , I have spent enough time in government to know that this is standard operating procedure .
I thought the Niger matter was settled and went back to my life .
( I did take part in the Iraq debate , arguing that a strict containment regime backed by the threat of force was preferable to an invasion . )
In September 2002 , however , Niger re-emerged .
The British government published a ' ' white paper ' ' asserting that Saddam Hussein and his unconventional arms posed an immediate danger .
As evidence , the report cited Iraq 's attempts to purchase uranium from an African country .
Then , in January , President Bush , citing the British dossier , repeated the charges about Iraqi efforts to buy uranium from Africa .
The next day , I reminded a friend at the State Department of my trip and suggested that if the president had been referring to Niger , then his conclusion was not borne out by the facts as I understood them .
He replied that perhaps the president was speaking about one of the other three African countries that produce uranium : Gabon , South Africa or Namibia .
At the time , I accepted the explanation .
I did n't know that in December , a month before the president 's address , the State Department had published a fact sheet that mentioned the Niger case .
Tyson Fined $ 2M For Mucking Up Missouri River
A Meat and Dairy Industries Article from All - Creatures.org
FROM
Heather Moore , Care2
August 2009
[ Ed . Note :
This article exemplifies why we all need to be vegan .
If humans did not eat animals we wouldnt have these problems . ]
Animals raised for food produce approximately 130 times as much excrement as the entire human population 87,000 pounds per second .
The Justice Department recently fined Tyson Fresh Meats , the world 's largest beef and pork supplier , $ 2 million for pumping animal waste into the Missouri River .
Tyson was in violation of a 2002 agreement to limit its discharges into the river .
According to one news report , Tyson , which discharges about 5 million gallons of " treated wastewater " from a Nebraska beef processing facility into the river each day , caused high levels of toxicity to aquatic life in the river .
Gee , what a surprise !
The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has reported that factory farms pollute our waterways more than all other industrial sources combined .
According to the EPA , chicken , hog , and cattle excrement have polluted 35,000 miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminated groundwater in 17 states .
Animals raised for food produce approximately 130 times as much excrement as the entire human population 87,000 pounds per second .
The waste is typically stored in massive cesspools a half mile wide and 20 feet deep .
In 1995 , a giant lagoon  holding 8 acres of excrement burst , spilling 25 million gallons of putrefying hog urine and feces into the New River in North Carolina , killing more than 10 million fish ; making the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster seem more like a glass of spilt soy milk .
A Scripps Howard synopsis of a Senate Agricultural Committee report on farm pollution issued this warning about animal waste :  [ I ] ts untreated and unsanitary , bubbling with chemicals and diseased .
It goes onto the soil and into the water that many people will , ultimately , bathe in and wash their clothes with and drink .
It is poisoning rivers and killing fish and making people sick .
Catastrophic cases of pollution , sickness , and death are occurring in areas where livestock operations are concentrated .
Every place where the animal factories have located , neighbors have complained of falling sick . 
A Duke University Medical Center study showed that people living downwind of pig farms are more likely to suffer from tension , depression , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , headaches , shallow breathing , coughing , sleep disturbances , and loss of appetite .
And that 's just what happens to you if you do n't eat the meat if you eat animal products , you may also develop heart disease , diabetes , and certain cancers !

Recently by Peter Schiff : The Devil We Know
Like a battering ram in a medieval siege , gold keeps hammering away at the gate .
For the third time in less than twelve months , the yellow metal is once again crashing into the $ 1,000 per ounce level .
As of press time , it looks like gold will close above that level today and will set a new record in the process .
Even if the breach is fleeting , who can doubt that it will mount another assault soon ?
In the meantime , there is no shortage of market analysts who are not buying gold while questioning the motives of those who are .
Although they offer a variety of strained reasons , they nearly all agree that it has nothing to do with inflation , which is nearly universally considered dead and buried .
As a self - confessed gold bug , I can assure all that inflation is the only reason I buy gold .
And recently , I ’m buying a lot .
Meltdown : A Free - Marke ...
Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 20.00 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
When individuals choose to accumulate savings in the form of gold rather than interest - bearing paper deposits in government - insured accounts , there is only one reason for doing so : they fear that the interest will not be enough to compensate for their expected loss of purchasing power through inflation .
This fear reflects both current inflation and the expectation for future inflation .
While there are those who buy gold to speculate on its appreciation , the underlying factor that drives that appreciation in the first place will always be inflation .
If governments were not creating inflation , there would be little investment advantage to owning gold .
Some believe that gold investors are primarily motivated by fear .
It is often assumed that gold is the one asset class that holds its value when all other asset classes are falling due to market uncertainty .
But this explanation brings us right back to inflation .
When economies move into recession , there is always political pressure for governments to intervene .
Their one tool is the printing press .
When governments act to prop up sagging markets , or bail out investors or depositors of failed institutions , they create inflation ( print money ) to pay for it .
This , in effect , transfers capital from prudent investors to speculators .
At the same time , it pulls the rug out from under the safest vehicles of traditional investment — bonds and cash .
It becomes hard for investors to protect their principal , much less grow their wealth .
Some turn to gold , with its historically guaranteed ‘ floor ’ against losses , and others start making ever riskier investments to try to ‘ beat ’ the inflation rate .

Gold ’s appeal as an asset of choice during times of political uncertainty , particularly during wartime , is again a function of its being a hedge against inflation .
Wars are always expensive .
They are also often unpopular , which makes paying for them through tax increases politically dangerous .
As a result , they are almost always financed through the ‘ secret tax ’ of inflation .
For a nation that loses a war , or suffers revolution or systemic civil conflict , there is always the chance that its currency could become worthless .
While this may not be the kind of inflation that we read about in the business section , it is the ultimate form of the monetary malady — whereby a currency loses all of its purchasing power .
Whenever the price of gold rises sharply , I always take it as an early warning sign that inflation expectations are rising .
If those expectations are not met , its price will fall .
If the market is correct , gold will maintain its gains .
And if the inflation continues to intensify , so too will gold ’s rise .
Most analysts , however , simply look at the dubious CPI to determine the presence of inflation and inflation expectations .
They perennially forget that prices are a lagging indicator and only a symptom of inflation , and may in fact not be rising at the moment when inflation kicks into high gear .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
The anti-gold camp takes their greatest solace from the bond market , where things have been eerily quiet .
They maintain that since bond yields have not risen much , inflation must not be a problem , and so the gold bugs are simply paranoid .
The bond market , they tell us , is populated by ‘ vigilantes ’ who sound a bugle call at the first whiff of inflation .
But this argument ignores the fact that central bankers themselves are the biggest bond buyers and are in effect ‘ vigilantes - in - chief . ’
Their outsized participation in the market has led to gross distortions .
When the Fed or another central bank buys treasuries , real returns are not considered .
Purchases are made for political reasons rather than investment merit , which renders meaningless the signals current bond prices are sending .
The gold - bashers also believe that reduced consumer demand due to unemployment will keep inflation pressures at bay for the foreseeable future .
However , inflation will ultimately act to reduce the supply of goods much faster than unemployment reduces demand for goods , sending prices up despite lower demand .
The stagflation of the 1970s is an example of such an outcome .
The bottom line is that gold is continuing its long - term bull run , and those who dismiss the message behind its rise do so at their own financial peril .
When it comes to inflation , gold is the canary in the economic coal mine .
Just as unseen toxins kill the canary before the miners succumb to the fumes , a spike in gold is a harbinger of reckless monetary devaluation .
Our leading commentators think that since they ca n’t see or smell the gas , all those canaries ( gold prices , commodity prices ) must be dying of natural causes .
Good luck to them when the toxins flood the mine .
The Best of Peter Schiff
Many Americans who thought that the health care debate was important must have wondered where their congressmen were in early August during the first two weeks of the House of Representatives recess .
It turns out they were not hosting town hall meetings or listening to constituents because many of them were in Israel together with their spouses on a trip paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
Fully 13 % of the entire US House of Representatives , 56 members , traveled to Israel in the largest AIPAC - sponsored fact - finding visit by American politicians ever conducted .
And the leaders of the two congressional groups , 25 Republicans for a week starting on August 2nd followed by 31 Democrats beginning on August 13th , were drawn from the top ranks of their respective parties .
House Minority whip Eric Cantor headed the Republican group and House Majority leader Steny Hoyer led the Democrats .
Cantor and Hoyer are longtime enthusiasts for Israel and all its works .
In January , when Israel was pounding Gaza to rubble and killing over a thousand civilians , Hoyer and Cantor wrote an op - ed entitled " A Defensive War , " which began with " During this difficult war in the Gaza Strip , we stand with Israel . "
Why ?
Because " Instead of building roads , bridges , schools and industry , Hamas and other terrorists wasted millions turning Gaza into an armory . "
Hoyer and Cantor , clearly noticing a militarization of the Gaza Strip that no else quite picked up on , also affirmed that Israel occupied the moral high ground in the conflict , " While Israel targets military combatants , Hamas aims to kill as many civilians as possible . "
That Hoyer and Cantor were completely wrong on this vital point as well as others , in fact reversing the truth , has never resulted in an apology or a correction of the record from either lawmaker .
And there ’s more .
In May 2009 , Cantor and Hoyer teamed up again in a congressional letter sent to their colleagues in congress .
The message described how Washington must be " both a trusted mediator and a devoted friend to Israel " because " Israel will be taking the greatest risks in any peace agreement . "
AIPAC could n’t have put it better .
In fact , AIPAC wrote the missive since Cantor and Hoyer apparently needed a little help to get the message just right .
The actual source of the letter was revealed when the document was circulated with the file name " AIPAC Letter Hoyer Cantor May 2009.pdf , " which the intrepid congressional duo had failed to change before sending out .
The August congressional junkets were paid for by the American Israel Education Foundation , which is a non-profit foundation that is part of AIPAC .
The non-profit foundation part means that the trip to convince already acquiescent congressmen that Israel needs more aid and special treatment was more - or - less subsidized by the US taxpayer .
Taking congressmen to Israel to make sure they understand the issues properly is not exactly new , but the scale and seniority of the recent visits sent a clear message to President Barack Obama that he should not pressure Israel in any way or he will face bipartisan opposition , opposition that he will not be able to overcome .
It appears that Obama might have already received the message loud and clear if the rumors that he will harden his line on Iran and soften his approach to Tel Aviv to permit Israeli settlement expansion are true .
The current Israeli government line as regurgitated by AIPAC is an attempt , aided and abetted by the congressional visitors , to shift the narrative .
According to AIPAC and Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu , the settlements have nothing to do with the issue of negotiating peace so Israel should be able to continue to expand its occupation of Arab East Jerusalem without any restraint while permitting " natural growth " in the other West Bank settlements .
Israel claims to be willing to talk peace with the Palestinians while decrying that there is no one to talk to .
Tel Aviv and its cheerleaders in Washington insist that the real threat to peace in the Middle East is Iran , which is seeking a nuclear weapon and will use it to bomb Israel and arm terrorists to attack the United States .
Eric Cantor was fully on - message , prepping his group by writing an op -ed for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz on August 3rd .
He wrote that " Israel is not only a democratic ally and our only true friend in the Middle East ; it is also a vital pillar of US national security strategy …
Israel has a right to accommodate the natural growth of its population … excessive handwringing over natural growth is a diversion from the main threat in the Middle East : Iran . "
If the line sounds familiar , it should as it is straight out of Israel and AIPAC ’s playbook garnished with its ridiculous pretense that Israel is some kind of strategic asset and an eternal friend .
Cantor and Hoyer ’s lawmaker colleagues apparently benefited greatly from their travels , which included a visit to the illegal West Bank settlement of Alfei Menashe to express solidarity with the heroic and widely misunderstood Israeli settlers .
According to Cantor there should not be any confusion about who is doing what to whom in the Middle East .
In describing the purpose of the trip , he noted that his Republican colleagues were eager to learn about " … the challenges on the ground in the Middle East , especially those challenges faced by Israel . "
He then returned to his script , describing the situation in more detail and expressing his concern about the " … focus being placed on settlements and settlement growth when the real threat is the existential threat that Israel faces from Iran and the impending nuclearization of Iran . "
During the trip itself , Cantor could hardly shut up about how much he loves Israel and its policies , no matter what those policies are .
When two Arab families were evicted from their homes in Jerusalem , resulting in a worldwide protest that included criticism from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Cantor discovered another way to look at the situation .
He complained about Clinton , " I ’m very troubled by that , because I do n’t think we in America would want another country telling us how to implement and execute our laws . "
Cantor ’s travelmates evidently agreed with his rosy view of all things Israeli .
Steve Scalise marveled at " all the things that the people of Israel have been through , " while Louie Gohmert pressed Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for a commitment to recognize Israel as a Jewish state , apparently oblivious to the fact that the status of a Muslim or a Christian in a Jewish state would be somewhat precarious .
Leonard Lance called for working together against Iran while Mike Coffman noted that the Obama Administration failed to comprehend " the magnitude of this threat of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons . "
Perhaps Coffman and Lance should read some of the intelligence that the US government produces at great expense which reveals that Iran has no nuclear weapons program .
Congressman Pete Olson reported that he had known in " his head " how important the relationship with Israel was and , after three days , knew it also in his heart .
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , who has been to Israel seven times and is the author of numerous pro-Israel and anti-Palestinian resolutions in the House , called Israel " our US ally against the violent extremists " and twittered to her constituents a gushing account of her " amazing dinner with soldiers of the Israeli Defense Forces .
Courageous young men … "
Hoyer , who has been to Israel a dozen times , led the cheerleading for the Democrats .
The House Majority leader contradicted his own party ’s president in finding that the settlements were not a " big issue " hindering a peace agreement , noting that they should be a " subject of negotiations . "
The real problem for Hoyer was completely predictably the Palestinians , specifically the " unwillingness of Abbas to sit down now . "
Hoyer also declared Jerusalem to be a " unified city " under Israeli control and reiterated Congressman ’s Gohmert ’s demand that the Palestinians recognized Israel as a Jewish State , neither of which is US policy .
Shelly Berkley , who has never met an Israeli she did n’t like , put it more bluntly , " The goals of this trip are to express Congress ’s solidarity with the State of Israel and to find out what Israel ’s needs are . "
Representative Kendrick
Meek welcomed his opportunity to visit Israel to help him " make better decisions as a member of congress . "
President George Washington counseled explicitly against getting involved in the quarrels of foreign nations .
What would he think of Hoyer and Cantor and the drones that followed them to Israel on a " fact finding " trip paid for by the Israel Lobby ?
Words like " disloyalty " come to mind immediately , but the AIPAC trips targeting congress are signs of a deeper problem .
Many congressmen undoubtedly display knee - jerk support for Israel either because it is career enhancing or because they are afraid not to .
Those who truly believe that Israel ’s interests are of paramount importance and that the United States ought to go to war on its behalf should perhaps find another line of work .
If they retain even a shred of decency and love of country , it is time for Cantor , Hoyer and others like them to go away .
They should leave quietly but do so quickly .
The well - being of the United States and its citizens demands it .
[ Updated at 12:50 p.m. : Assemblyman Michael Duvall has resigned , according to his website , where he posted this statement :
“ I am deeply saddened that my inappropriate comments have become a major distraction for my colleagues in the Assembly , who are working hard on the very serious problems facing our state .
I have come to the conclusion that it would not be fair to my family , my constituents or to my friends on both sides of the aisle to remain in office .
Therefore , I have decided to resign my office , effective immediately , so that the Assembly can get back to work . ” ]
Capitol Blackberries are buzzing after KCAL - TV Los Angeles late Tuesday night aired a videotape of what its reporter said was an Orange County GOP lawmaker talking to a colleague at a committee hearing in explicit detail about recent trysts .
In the KCAL report , Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee Vice Chairman Michael Duvall ( R - Yorba Linda ) appears not to realize that his microphone is on during a lull in a July committee hearing and talks about his conquest of two women .
Reporter Dave Lopez then reports that Duvall says on the tape that the women with whom he has been having sex are lobbyists .
The report alleges that one of the lobbyists works for a utility with business before Duvall 's committee but does not name her .
Later in the report , Duvall is seen ducking Lopez on the Assembly floor and in the hallways outside the chamber as the reporter confronts him with questions about his sexual encounters .
[ Updated at 10:13 a.m. : The Assembly Legislative Ethics Committee is looking into the reports about Duvall 's alleged relationship with the lobbyist , a source close to the committee said this morning .
Members of the ethics panel plan to meet today with their legal counsel to determine what action they might take , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authority to speak for the committee .
" They are taking this very seriously , " the source said .
Meanwhile , Duvall posted this apology on his campaign website : “ I made a mistake and I sincerely apologize .
I deeply regret the comments I made in what I believed to be a private conversation .
This is a private matter and I ask that everyone respect the privacy of all involved . ” ]
Duvall joined the Assembly in 2006 , representing the 72nd District , which includes the cities of Fullerton , Anaheim , Placentia , Orange , Brea , Yorba Linda and La Habra .
He is a former Yorba Linda City Councilman and member of the Orange County Sanitation District board and Orange County Transportation Authority .
According to his Assembly website , he also runs an insurance business with his wife .

Countries , when they democratically reject EU treaties , are usually told to vote again until they produce the “ right ” result – something the EU establishment hope will happen in the re-run Irish constitutional referendum on the Lisbon Treaty taking place exactly a month today .
The Irish political establishment are almost unanimous in their support for the document ; the leaders of Fianna Fáil , Fine Gael and Labour all enthusiastically calling for its speedy passage into law .
Any impartial observer will tell you that the Lisbon Treaty is no different in composition from the document – the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe - democratically rejected by the people of France and the Netherlands in national referenda .
Much of their argument in favour of accepting the ‘ revised ’ Lisbon Treaty centres around the supposed “ concessions ” the country has won – chiefly , the ability to retain its European Commissioner and domestic control of laws governing social issues such as sensitive aspects of medical research .
I use the word “ supposed ” advisedly , as these concessions are nothing more than oral promises to the Irish government from other European countries as their formal incorporation into the Treaty would require the ratification process to start afresh in the twenty - three countries ( including the United Kingdom ) who have already given their ascent to the document .
As with the previous referendum , opposition is being coordinated by an unappealing alliance of Sinn Féin Teachtaí Dála and far - left radicals such as Dublin ’s self - proclaimed Marxist MEP Joe Higgins .
The “ no ” campaign expects to be outspent by a margin of more than ten - to - one .
Irish referendum aside , a clever question from European Conservative and Reformist Group MEP Nirj Deva at the approval hearing being held for incoming Development Commissioner Karel du Gucht yesterday afternoon neatly surmises the wholly deceptive nature of the EU establishment towards the implementation of the European Constitution .
Perhaps you 've heard all the uproar about President Obama 's speech today .
A group of folks is very concerned about a speech of his today , because he 's talking to schoolkids .
And hey , did n't Hitler talk to kids ...?
That 's about as good as their logic gets .
I wish I were kidding .
Read the transcript of Obama 's speech , and see if you can find the alarming parts where he calls for the formation of Brown Shirts , or the extermination of a group of humans , or the invasion of Poland .
I must have missed it , instead seeing things like where he says ,
Now I ’ve given a lot of speeches about education .
And I ’ve talked a lot about responsibility .
I ’ve talked about your teachers ’ responsibility for inspiring you , and pushing you to learn .
I ’ve talked about your parents ’ responsibility for making sure you stay on track , and get your homework done , and do n’t spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with that Xbox .
I ’ve talked a lot about your government ’s responsibility for setting high standards , supporting teachers and principals , and turning around schools that are n’t working where students are n’t getting the opportunities they deserve .
But at the end of the day , we can have the most dedicated teachers , the most supportive parents , and the best schools in the world – and none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities .
Unless you show up to those schools ; pay attention to those teachers ; listen to your parents , grandparents and other adults ; and put in the hard work it takes to succeed .
And that ’s what I want to focus on today : the responsibility each of you has for your education .
I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself .
Call the Allies !
Load the B -29s !
Seriously , read this whole speech .
It 's inspiring , wonderful , and designed to inspire kids to stay in school , accept the responsibility of the education , learn things , and then go and do good for the world .
Of course , there is a lunatic fringe in this country who will go ballistic about Obama no matter what he does ; these are the ones saying the speech is indoctrinating children into accepting his socialist health care plan that will mutilate puppies and convert our elderly into Soylent Green .
These people may be rabid racists , or simply mentally unbalanced , but we know for a rock solid fact that these people are utterly , completely wrong .
Whatever you want to call them , it 's clear they are so far from the norm of the American people that they can't even see the horizon from where they are .
Simply reading the speech transcript shows that simply and clearly .
But it 's also a fact that this subset of the population will always be with us .
But you know what ?
That does n't mean we have to give them a voice in the mainstream press .
They have a right to their speech , but that does n't obligate anyone to pay attention to them , especially on the platform of national TV .
I 'm looking you right in the eye , Fox News .
Not only do you give these people -- factually wrong and provably so -- a voice , you reiterate their comments and use your own voice to back them up .
This sort of thing mainstreams a view that is charitably called crazy .
Again , I urge you to read Obama 's actual speech .
It 's awesome , and something every kid should see and hear .
Yet because " news " media like Fox have aired so much invective from the wildly fringe reality - polluting community , even mainstream folks are arguing that Obama 's speech is evil .
I saw a news report yesterday about an elementary school in North Carolina where they did n't air the speech because so many parents complained .
I can't help but wonder what they would would have said if George Bush had made this same speech .
Of course , Bush never would have said something like :
You ’ll need the knowledge and problem - solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS , and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment .
You ’ll need the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness , crime and discrimination , and make our nation more fair and more free .
You ’ll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy .
And maybe if he had said those words , the people I 'm talking about would 've complained anyway .
Critical thinking skills ?
Ha !
If I sound angry , then , yeah , I am .
I 'm tired of ignorance held up as inspiration , where vicious anti-intellectualism is considered a positive trait , and where uninformed opinion is displayed as fact .
It 's killing any real debate in this country , where the system of government depends utterly on a well - informed public .
When rampant idiocy is presented as reasonable discourse without any rebuttal , then we all suffer .
What we need are government officials not afraid to talk like Barney Frank did to such a voice of lunacy .
To reiterate , crackpots have a right to air their diseased notions , just as we have the right to tear those ideas to shred when they do .
More than that , the news media have a responsibility to do so .
Let me leave you with this revolutionary and dangerous notion from President Obama :
Do n’t be afraid to ask questions .
Do n’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it .
I do that every day .
Asking for help is n’t a sign of weakness , it ’s a sign of strength .
It shows you have the courage to admit when you do n’t know something , and to learn something new .
So find an adult you trust – a parent , grandparent or teacher ; a coach or counselor – and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals .
I would add that we all need to not be afraid to speak out against nonsense and to call out willful ignorance when we see it .
Never give up .
Never back down against evil .
Never tire , because this struggle will be eternal .

In an effort to stay abreast of the highly competitive gaming console market , Microsoft is offering a rebate on all XBox 360 Elite packages purchased from now until October 5 .
The rebate , done in response to Sony ’s recent drop of the Playstation 3 price to $ 299 , will drop the current $ 299 price tag down $ 50 .
Only a month ago , Microsoft slashed the price of the Elite package down $ 100 from $ 399 .
Details on how to get the rebate are available here .
Rumors abound that Nintendo might drop the price of the Wii from $ 249 to $ 199 on September 27 , but as of now , they are just rumors .
Microsoft is clearly hoping that the rebate will encourage gamers to buy a 360 Elite , if they have n’t previously shelled out for the system , and will find the rebate tempting enough to choose the 360 Elite over the Playstation 3 .
So , assuming you do n’t already own an XBox 360 Elite or a Playstation 3 , which would you choose ?
Is the $ 50 limited - time price difference reason enough to go Microsoft instead of Sony ?

Denying The Existence Of Time
By Rusty Rockets
Perhaps humans invented the concept of time out of mortal fear ; reasoning that if time were tangible then its degenerative march could be controlled , just as mankind has tried to subdue other aspects of the natural world .
Immortality would be within our grasp !
But while time may be a convenient metronome that delivers neatly portioned slivers of existence to conscious beings , the idea of a ' universal time ' is looking increasingly fanciful , at least to some physicists .
One individual , Peter Lynds , has put his reputation on the line to try and prove that thinking of time and motion in measured segments , like frames in a film , is wrong - headed .
Funnily enough , that 's what his critics think of his theory .
Lynds goes as far as saying that if instants , rather than intervals , of time were a cosmological truth , then none of us would be here today .
In fact no physical object , no mass or energy down to the smallest of particles would ever be in motion .
This is probably not the sort of immortality that our ancestors had in mind .
The most amazing thing about this whole story is that Lynds is not a trained scientist .
But he does have a passionate interest in physics and he is also a huge fan of Einstein 's work .
Lynds ' theory , Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics : Indeterminacy vs. Continuity , has caused quite a commotion amongst academics , some even saying that his theory is a hoax and that Lynds does n't actually exist .
Skepticism and scorn of Lynds ' work has continued but this barrage of criticism does n't look like it will shut him up anytime soon .
Much of the opposition to Lynds ' ideas can be attributed to his questioning of scientific orthodoxy .
He does n't mind suggesting that Einstein , Hawking and other respected figures are just plain wrong .
He claims some theories are redundant , such as ' imaginary ' time , and others just need modification , such as further developing Einstein 's theories so as to iron out some of the contradictions .
Most of these would take up too much space in trying to explain ; so concentrating on Lynds ' main theme will be the goal here .
In the beginning there was darkness � and there was no time .
Time becomes immaterial in empty space , and demonstrates clearly that without objects - in - motion - mass and energy - there is nothing to measure the relative passing of time .
So how God knew what day it was in the beginning is anyone 's guess .
But we digress .
Time is relative to mass and energy , there is no ideal universal clock .
As a concept , time cannot precede mass and energy , simply because the idea of time is reliant on the relative motions of celestial bodies .
As Lynds says : " if there is no mass - energy , there is no space - time ; " both are fixed and enmeshed .
Because of this , time also has no direction or flow , as we conceive it subjectively ; " it is the relative order of events that is important . "
This is what led Lynds to claim that there is " no precise static instant in time underlying a dynamical physical process . "
The Greek mathematician Zeno conjured up a famous paradox that involved halving the distance between starting and end - points in time and space .
The paradox involves a person trying to move from point A to point B .
In order to move from point A , say , your doorway , to point B , say the pub , you must first reach half the distance between A and B , but before that , you must first reach half of that distance .
And before that , you must first reach half of that distance and so on ad infinitum .
You 'll never reach the pub !
Zeno 's paradox seems to make a mockery out of divvying up time to conveniently suit scientific purposes but we know that this does n't happen in the real world .
For example , when you are driving in your car , your speed is relative to the road beneath you .
There is no point on your journey that could be called one instant in time .
It can only be an interval of time .
Even if you took a photograph of the car travelling along the road , the photograph would be an interval related to the speed of the camera , perhaps a thirtieth of a second .
It does n't matter how much you reduce the time interval , it will always still be an interval , rather than an instant .
If there are no measured instants then there is no infinity paradox , which demonstrates that there is no actual time measurement .
In short , there is only relative motion between objects , and the order in which they occur .
To make it even more confusing , Lynds proposes that this theory demonstrates that a body in motion has no distinct position or coordinate .
This basic account of Lynds ' theory brings us back to human perceptions of time and why the brain needs to have a concept of time .
We are finite beings in an infinite universe ( as far as we know ) and understanding the universe requires that we are able to measure the events and objects that make up the universe .
Being able to control our physical environment by allocating and referring to time in ' instants ' is a handy way of dealing with the problem .
But it seems increasingly likely that we need to change the way in which we approach , observe and evaluate the universe 's dimensions before we have any hope of understanding any of the universe 's mysteries .
Perhaps Lynds ' theory is just what we need to get started .
Susanne Craig at WSJ takes a deep dive into the practices of Goldman Sachs ( GS ) stock analysts , and notes that preferred clients get , well , preferred access to ideas and advice .
Here 's the nut of it :
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. research analyst Marc Irizarry 's published rating on mutual - fund manager Janus Capital Group Inc. was a lackluster " neutral " in early April 2008 .
But at an internal meeting that month , the analyst told dozens of Goldman 's traders the stock was likely to head higher , company documents show .
The next day , research - department employees at Goldman called about 50 favored clients of the big securities firm with the same tip , including hedge - fund companies Citadel Investment Group and SAC Capital Advisors , the documents indicate .
Readers of Mr. Irizarry 's research did n't find out he was bullish until his written report was issued six days later , after Janus shares had jumped 5.8 % .
Every week , Goldman analysts offer stock tips at a gathering the firm calls a " trading huddle . "
But few of the thousands of clients who receive Goldman 's written research reports ever hear about the recommendations .
This story will bring fresh , unwanted attention to the bank , which is reeling from a string of undesirable media stories .
Goldman 's response is that ideas from the company 's " huddles " are consistent with the research the firm is broadly disseminating , and that it 's rare for anything particularly significant is disclosed in such meetings .
In other words , the company denies that it gives advance info to anyone -- it 's more like top tier clients get more time with the personal trainer .
Still , others feel differently about the practice :
The tips usually go to top clients who have expressed interest in having the information and have short - term investment horizons , he says .
Goldman does n't want to overload other clients with information that is n't relevant to them , he says .
" We are not in the business of serving thousands of retail customers , " he says .
At least one competitor discloses such trading tips much more broadly .
Morgan Stanley 's research department sends blast emails with short - term views on various stocks to thousands of clients , and posts the information on its Web site .
It does n't call customers to convey the tips , because Morgan Stanley officials decided that could expose the firm to questions about selective disclosure , according to people familiar with the matter .
We'd be pretty curious , though , how profitable these huddles are for top traders .
We find it hard to believe that the top hedge funds in the world get a lot of value out of Buy / Sell ideas from analysts , unless they 're blatantly telegraphing market - moving reports , in which case that could be trouble .
Still , this timeline looks pretty damning :

Lewis Hamilton will start the Singapore Grand Prix on pole after a poor session for Brawn GP saw Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button finish in 10th and 12th .
Barrichello , trailing Button by 14 points in the title race , was fifth fastest but crashed late on and drops five places after changing his gearbox .
Button failed to make the top 10 as the championship leader produced an error - strewn display to finish 12th fastest .
Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel will share the front row , with Nico Rosberg third .
In fact , the Williams driver might have hoped for a better session had Barrichello 's late crash into the wall not ended qualifying a minute early with the German on a flyer .
Rosberg had earlier set the fastest time in the second session .
But that slight annoyance was nothing compared to the fate of Button and Barrichello , who had entered the weekend with high hopes following an upgrade package to their Brawns , which boasted new rear and front wings and a new diffuser .
It 's a disastrous session for us .
We underestimated the competition ... ( and ) we 'll have to see what we can recover on Sunday
Team boss Ross Brawn Button , in particular , will again face questions over his ability to cope with the pressure of leading the drivers ' championship with four races to go as two tentative runs during the second part of qualifying left him back on the sixth row .
" It 's a disastrous session for us , " admitted team boss Ross Brawn .
" We underestimated the competition in second qualifying because we used one old set , then one new set , and did n't get the car balanced well on the new set .
" We were perilously close to losing both cars in that session .
The shoot - out was n't bad , looking at the fuel weights , but that topped it off for us .
" With Jenson dropping out of third qualifying , Rubens had the maximum chance to get some points on Jenson .
We 'll have to see what we can recover on Sunday . "
It is the third time this season that Hamilton has secured pole , and the McLaren looked on the pace throughout qualifying having changed the chassis of his car in order to cure a wiring problem from Friday .

And the reigning world champion revealed he could have got even more out of the car , saying : " The out lap was n't that bad actually , I had a 10 - second window where I did n't have to push that much .
I reckon we had another couple of tenths in it for sure .
" ( But ) it 's absolutely fantastic , I 'm very happy and very pleased for the team .
" We came with updates , as did everyone else , so we did n't know where we would be .
Friday practice was n't spectacular for me but I came in with a positive approach and big thanks to the guys , they worked up until 10 am this morning rebuilding the car .
" I 'm pleased to have done this for them .
I 'm feeling more comfortable in the car and we 'll see what happens with the strategies . "
Red Bull , too , will be happy with their pace , with Vettel second and Mark Webber fourth on the grid , but Williams 's Rosberg showed arguably the most surprising pace , given his team had not expected to impress at Marina Bay .
" Going into qualifying , we were n't sure we would make it to Q3 , but in Q2 it worked out fantastically , " admitted Rosberg .
" With the heavier fuel in Q3 it was a bit more difficult , but third on the grid is fantastic for us .
" Who knows , maybe we can even fight for a win very soon . "
Fernando Alonso , winner here last year , will start from fifth as Renault look to put the recent controversy over Nelson Piquet Jr 's deliberate crash here 12 months ago behind them .
" It was a fantastic result for us , we did n't expect to finish there , " said the Spaniard . " [ But ]
I 'm not sure we can get much more out of the car tomorrow .
You never know though .
If we finish the race it will be a good result . "
The BMWs of Nick Heidfeld of Robert Kubica will start from seventh and eighth , behind Toyota 's Timo Glock and ahead of McLaren 's Heikki Kovalainen .
Elsewhere , Ferrari 's fears that they would be off the pace were borne out when Kimi Raikkonen could only manage 13th , with team - mate Giancarlo Fisichella again betraying his lack of feel for his new car in finishing back in 18th .
And at the back of the grid , Adrian Sutil followed his front row qualifying last time out in Monza by dropping out of Q1 in 16th place , with the high downforce track clearly not suiting the Force India .
The German 's team - mate Vitantonio Liuzzi will start from the back of the grid , while Renault 's Romain Grosjean also struggled after putting new brakes into his car for the session and , having crashed in first practice on Friday , dropped out in first qualifying alongside Jaime Alguersuari and Fisichella .

Yet despite so promising a start , the process of Turkey ’s accession to the E.U. has lost significant momentum since 2005 .
Negative statements and actions by E.U. leaders have played a key role in discouraging Turkey .
These have undermined Ankara ’s will to reform and have fueled resentment .
Popular support in Turkey for E.U. membership continues to wane .
Frustrated leaders in Turkey lament that the E.U. would reject Turkey ’s accession even if Ankara implements all the prerequisite reforms and meets all other preconditions .
Europe ’s wavering on Turkey ’s E.U. accession is jeopardizing the E.U. ’s credibility and threatening to tarnish its good image .
How can European leaders be trusted if they continue to go back on their word , stalling , and perhaps scuttling , a process that began a decade ago with so much promise , has produced so many positive effects , and holds such potential for the future ?
During my three decades in mediating conflicts around the globe , I have learned that only rarely , perhaps once in a generation , do the political planets align for dramatic solutions .
( In the past few years just such an alignment appeared over Northern Ireland . )
A promising alignment is now appearing over a land of key importance for both the E.U. and Turkey : Cyprus .
Ongoing talks between the leaders of the island ’s Greek and Turkish communities offer the best and probably the last chance to avoid an indefinite partition of the island .
A settlement on Cyprus — something that both Turkey and the E.U. can contribute to achieving — would breathe new life into the accession negotiations between Turkey and the E.U. and hasten the day when both sides can gain full advantage from each other .
Strengthening the relationship between Turkey and the E.U. through accession negotiations offers a clear opportunity to serve the E.U. ’s interests in energy security and to bolster stability both in the Middle East and the South Caucasus .
1 ) The work of Wackernagel and Rees ( first publication in English , 1996 ) instigated a major strand in radical social thinking about construction of the future .
The authors not only defined a new concept – that of an ‘ ecological footprint ’ – they also developed a metric for it .
Its units are defined in terms of ‘ global hectares ’ , comparing the biological capacity of societies / countries ( their capacity to produce and reproduce the conditions for life on the planet ) with their consumption of resources made available to them by this bio-capacity .
The authors ’ conclusions are worrying .
At the global level , the bio-capacity of our planet is 2.1 global hectares ( gha ) per capita ( ie 13.2 billion gha per 6.3 billion inhabitants ) .
In contrast , the global average for consumption of resources was already – in the mid-1990s – 2.7 gha .
This ‘ average ’ masks a gigantic imbalance , the average for the Triad [ 1 ] ( Europe , North America and Japan ) having already reached a multiple of the order of four magnitudes of the global average .
A good proportion of the bio-capacity of societies in the South is taken up by and to the advantage of these centres .
In other words , the current expansion of capitalism is destroying the planet and humanity and this expansion ’s logical conclusion is either the actual genocide of the peoples of the South – as ‘ over - population ’ – or at least keeping them in ever increasing poverty .
An eco -fascist strand of thought is being developed which gives legitimacy to this type of solution to the problem .
http://www.pambazuka.org/images/articles/446/press_ads/aid_to_africa_ad.jpg
2 ) The interest of this work goes beyond its conclusions .
For it is a question of a calculation ( I use the term ‘ calculation ’ deliberately , rather than ‘ discourse ’ ) put in terms of the use value of the planet ’s resources , illustrated through their measurement in global hectares ( gha ) , not in dollars .
The proof is therefore given that social use value can be the subject of perfectly rational calculation .
This proof is decisive in its import , since socialism is defined in terms of a society founded on use value and not on exchange value .
And defenders of capitalism have always held that socialism is an unreal utopia because – according to them – use value is not measurable , unless it is conflated with exchange value ( defined in terms of ‘ utility ’ in vulgar economics ) .
Recognition of use value ( of which the measurement of economic footprints is but one good example ) implies that socialism should be ‘ ecological ’ , indeed can only be ecological , as Altvater proclaims ( ‘ Solar socialism ’ or ‘ no socialism ’ ) .
But it also implies that this recognition is impossible in any capitalist system , even a ‘ reformed ’ one , as we shall see .
3 ) In his time , Marx not only suspected the existence of this problem .
He had already expressed it through his rigorous distinction between use value and wealth , conflated in vulgar economics .
Marx explicitly said that the accumulation of capital destroys the natural bases on which it is built : Man ( the alienated , exploited , dominated and oppressed worker ) and the earth ( symbol of natural riches at the disposal of humanity ) .
And whatever might be the limitations of this way of putting it , trapped within its own era , it nonetheless remains an illustration of a clear consciousness of the problem ( beyond intuition ) that deserves to be recognised .
It is regrettable , therefore , that the ecologists of our time , including Wackernagel and Rees , have not read Marx .
This would have allowed them to take their own proposals further , to grasp their revolutionary import , and , of course , to go further than Marx himself on this topic .
4 ) This deficiency in modern ecology facilitates its capture by the ideology of vulgar economics from its dominant position in contemporary society .
This capture is already under way and , indeed , considerably advanced .
Political ecology ( such as that proposed by Alain Lipietz ) was located from the beginning within the gamut of the ‘ pro- socialist ’ , political Left .
Subsequently , ‘ green ’ movements ( and then political parties ) located themselves in the Centre Left , through their expressed sympathy with social and international justice , their critique of ‘ waste ’ , their concern with the fate of workers and ‘ poor ’ peoples .
But , apart from the diversity of these movements , we should note that none of them had established a rigorous relationship between the authentic socialist dimension necessary to rise to the challenge and a recognition , no less necessary , of the ecological dimension .
To achieve this , we should not ignore the wealth / value distinction originated by Marx .
Capture of ecology by vulgar ideology operates on two levels :
On the one hand by reducing measurement of use value to an ‘ improved ’ measurement of exchange value , and on the other by integrating the ecological challenge with the ideology of ‘ consensus ’ .
Both these manoeuvres undermine the clear realisation that ecology and capitalism are , by their nature , in opposition .
5 ) This capture of ecological measurement by vulgar economics is making huge strides .
Thousands of young researchers , in the United States , and , imitating them , in Europe , have been mobilised in this cause .
The ‘ ecological costs ’ are , in this way of thinking , assimilated to external economies .
The vulgar method of measuring cost / benefit in terms of exchange value ( itself conflated with market price ) is then used to define a ‘ fair price ’ integrating external economies and diseconomies .
And Bob ’s your uncle .
It goes without saying that the work – reduced to mathematical formulas – done in this traditional area of vulgar economics does not say how the ‘ fair price ’ calculated could become that of the actual current market .
It is presumed therefore that fiscal and other ‘ incentives ’ could be sufficiently effective to bring about this convergence .
Any proof that this could really be the case is entirely absent .
In fact , as can already be seen , oligopolies have seized hold of ecology to justify the opening up of new fields to their destructive expansion .
Francois Houtart provides a conclusive illustration of this in his work on biofuels .
Since then , ‘ green capitalism ’ has been part of the obligatory discourse of men / women in positions of power , on both the Right and the Left , in the Triad ( of Europe , North America and Japan ) , and of the executives of oligopolies .
The ecology in question , of course , conforms to the vision known as ‘ weak sustainability ’ ( in the usual jargon ) , in other words , marketisation of the ‘ rights of access to the planet ’s resources ’ .
In the report of the United Nations commission which he chaired , presented to the United Nations General Assembly of 24 - 26 June 2009 , Joseph Stiglitz openly embraced this position , proposing ‘ an auction of the world ’s resources ( fishing rights , licences to pollute etc ) ’ .
This proposal quite simply comes down to sustaining the oligopolies in their ambition to mortgage further the future of the people of the South .
6 ) The capture of ecological discourse by the political culture of the consensus ( a necessary expression of the conception of capitalism as the end of history ) is equally well advanced .
This capture has an easy ride , as it is responding to the alienation and illusion that feed the dominant culture – that of capitalism .
An easy ride because this culture is actual , and holds a dominant place in the minds of the majority of human beings , in the South as well as in the North .
In contrast , the expression of the demands of the socialist counter - culture is fraught with difficulty .
Because socialist culture is not there in front of our eyes .
It is part of a future to be invented , a project of civilisation , open to the creativity of the imagination .
Slogans – such as ‘ socialisation through democracy and not through the market ’ ; ‘ the transfer of the decisive level for decision making from the economic and political levels to that of culture ’ – are not enough , despite their power to pave the way for the historical process of transformation .
For what is at stake is a long ‘ secular ’ process of societal reconstruction based on principles other than those of capitalism , in both the North and the South , which can not be supposed to take place ‘ rapidly ’ .
But construction of the future , however far away , begins today .

US Army abandons effort to court - martial Iraq war resister
By Peter Daniels
29 September 2009
The US Army , admitting defeat in its more than three - year effort to punish First Lt. Ehren Watada for refusing to deploy to Iraq , is allowing the Hawaiian - born soldier to resign from the military on October 2 .
He will be granted a discharge “ under other - than - honorable conditions , ” according to his lawyer .
An Army spokesman said regulations allowed for “ resignation for the good of the service in lieu of general court - martial . ”
Watada , now 31 , was the first officer to face court - martial charges for refusing to serve in the Iraq war .
He did not ask for conscientious objector status , instead courageously attacking the US invasion as a war of aggression .
He said he refused to be a party to war crimes , and was charged in July 2006 with three counts : one count of “ missing movement ” stemming from his refusal to deploy with his unit to Iraq in 2006 , and two counts of conduct unbecoming an officer in connection with public statements explaining his reasons for resisting the war .
He faced up to six years in prison if convicted .
In one of the statements the Army considered “ unbecoming an officer , ” Watada said , “ It is my conclusion as an officer of the Armed Forces that the war in Iraq is not only morally wrong but a horrible breach of American law .
As the order to take part in an illegal act is ultimately unlawful as well , I must as an officer of honor and integrity refuse that order .
...
The wholesale slaughter and mistreatment of Iraqis is not only a terrible and moral injustice , but it ’s a contradiction to the Army ’s own law of land warfare .
My participation would make me party to war crimes . ”
The original court - martial , in February 2007 , ended in a mistrial after a ruling by a military judge .
A second court - martial was stopped by a federal court ruling in the state of Washington , near Watada ’s base at Fort Lewis , later that year .
The district court judge ruled that such a trial would amount to double jeopardy and would therefore be unconstitutional .
Watada enlisted in the Army in May 2003 , later explaining , “ I believed the [ Bush ] administration , like many Americans out there , when they guaranteed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , ties to Al Qaeda , and Saddam had ties to 9/11 . ”
Watada described how , in light of “ the abuse and mistreatment of detainees in Abu Ghraib , the accounts of Iraqi civilians , the accounts of independent journalists , and the accounts of American soldiers coming back home , I began to look deeper into the legality of the war itself … any war that you are forced to participate in that is not a war of necessity is a war of aggression and is the worst crime against humanity and the worst crime against the peace . ”
In another comment after he was first charged in 2006 , Watada spoke of the economic and social conditions driving young people to enlist in the military .
“ It ’s the 18- , 19 - , 20 - year - olds that really do n’t know their rights , do n’t know what they are getting into , so are at a really huge disadvantage .
If they realize that they are opposed to the war , they have no way out .
There is that socioeconomic disadvantage — it is a type of draft . ”
He said that “ using these people for an unjust and illegal war … is tragic . ”
The Army ’s decision to abandon their case against Watada reflects a recognition and fear inside the political and military establishment of the enormous unpopularity of the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
Watada ’s lawyer , Kenneth Kagan , explained that the Army had up to now refused to allow the soldier to resign .
“ This time , however , it was accepted , apparently only when the Army realized it could not defeat Lieutenant Watada in a courtroom . ”

Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann announced a no-fly zone over the Oktoberfest festival area on Saturday , Sept. 26 .
The airspace restriction came at the request of the federal Interior Ministry .
Munich 's
Theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres ( 31 hectares ) , where 6 million people join in the 16 - day celebration every year .
" A no -fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " Herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at Germany over the past few days .
On Thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by Oktoberfest attendees .
A torrent of terrorist threats
Video messages have threatened German targets
No less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al Qaeda 's Osama bin Laden - replete with German subtitles - demanding that Europeans leave Afghanistan .
Other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on Friday , which , according to the German interior ministry , had come from the Taliban
" Because of your commitment here against Islam , attacking Germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " Ajjub " spoke in German in the video .
The footage included images of potential targets such as Munich 's Oktoberfest festival , as well as the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and Cologne 's massive cathedral .
Images of Defense Minister Franz - Josef Jung and Interior Minister Wolfgang Shaeuble were also shown .
This latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over Sunday 's national elections .
No fear - mongering
Meanwhile , chairman of the Islamic Council of Germany , Ali Kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with Interior Minister Schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" Even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
The no-fly zone will remain in effect until Oct. 4 , when the festival comes to an end .

My senior prom dress was nothing special .
I attended an all girls school my senior year and as such , almost none of my friends had dates and a big group of us agreed to go together .
My mother was n't super keen on shopping so my sister took me to the mall to find a prom dress .
I ended up in a simple black halter dress that seemed like a " smart " purchase as I could wear it on other occasions outside of prom .
In retrospect I wish I had gone for a more high fantasy and fun dress .
That dress did n't really reflect my style or my interests ; it was a practical purchase partially motivated by the fact it was on sale and we had a gift card to the store !
Now I think if I went back to prom , even in a group date setting , I 'd love a dramatic , high - fantasy , slightly ridiculous ball gown .
I mean , how often do you have an excuse to dress up in an enormous tulle confection and dance wildly with your friends ?
Not often enough !
Of course as a photographer you do occasionally get to invent excuses for dress up -- hence today 's photographs in this gorgeous Chotronette gown .
I 've never considered myself much of a " photoshoot photographer " so much as a blogger / self portrait photographer .
I do n't often go for fancy dresses and dramatic makeup because I tend to feel silly in the former and am rubbish at applying the latter , but it 's good to shoot something fairytale inspired just for fun every once in awhile .
Life is short , why not buy yourself a sword and run around your local castle ?
I 'm still not a model and I could use some help with elaborate makeup , but I had a lot of fun creating these dramatic photographs in this dream Chotronette dress .
I last wore one of their dresses back in the early spring in my " romance book cover " shoot ( another wee dream brought to life through photographs ) .
That dress was soft and pink and this time I was excited to create something a bit stronger and more regal with their Armour dress .
It 's so dramatic and beautifully detailed and perfect for every woman who wants something feminine , but bold .
There 's many legends of strong women in Celtic folklore and history from Boudicca who led an uprising against the Romans to Grace O'Malley the Pirate Queen of Clare Island .
Even the stories of mermaids and sirens center on dangerous women who led sailors to their deaths with their pretty faces and powerful voices .
We tend to think of fairytales as a whole in terms of knights or damsels in distress , but when you read the old tales there 's many legends about powerful women who forged their own paths and needed no knight to save them .

Greenland is already losing enough ice to raise sea level by 0.8 millimetres per year ( Image : Nick Cobbing )
Ancient reefs in Mexico suggest the sea rose 3 metres within 100 years ( Image : Paul Blanchon )
See our related editorial
FOR a few minutes David Holland forgets about his work and screams like a kid on a roller coaster .
The small helicopter he ’s riding in is slaloming between towering cliffs of ice – the sheer sides of gigantic icebergs that had calved off Greenland ’s Jakobshavn glacier .
“ It was like in a James Bond movie , ” Holland says afterwards .
“ It ’s the most exciting thing I have ever done . ”
Jakobshavn has doubled its speed in the past 15 years , draining increasing amounts of ice from the Greenland ice sheet into the ocean , and Holland , an oceanographer at New York University , has been trying to find out why .
Scientists like him are more than a little astonished at the rate at which our planet ’s frozen frontiers seem to be responding to global warming .
The crucial question , though , is what will happen over the next few decades and centuries .
That ’s because the fate of the planet ’s ice , from relatively small ice caps in places like the Canadian Arctic , the Andes and the Himalayas , to the immense ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica , will largely determine the speed and extent of sea level rise .
At stake are the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people , not to mention millions of square kilometres of cities and coastal land , and trillions of dollars in economic terms .
In its 2007 report , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) forecast a …
Should , by some terrible misfortune , Ray Kurzweil shuffle off his mortal coil tomorrow , the obituaries would record an inventor of rare and visionary talent .
In 1976 , he created the first machine capable of reading books to the blind , and less than a decade later he built the K250 : the first music synthesizer to nigh - on perfectly duplicate the sound of a grand piano .
His Kurzweil 3000 educational software , which helps students with learning difficulties such as dyslexia and attention deficit disorder , is likewise typical of an innovator who has made his name by combining restless imagination with technological ingenuity and a commendable sense of social responsibility .
However , these past accomplishments , as impressive as they are , would tell only half the Kurzweil story .
The rest of his biography – the essence of his very existence , he would contend – belongs to the future .
Following the publication of his 2005 book , The Singularity is Near : When Humans Transcend Biology , Kurzweil has become known , above all , as a technology speculator whose predictions have polarised opinion – from stone - cold scepticism and splenetic disagreement to dedicated hero worship and admiration .
It 's not just that he boldly envisions a tomorrow 's world where , for example , tiny robots will reverse the effects of pollution , artificial intelligence will far outstrip ( and supplement ) biological human intelligence , and humankind " will be able to live indefinitely without ageing " .
No , the real reason Kurzweil has become such a magnet for blogospheric debate , and a tech - celebrity , is that he 's convinced those future predictions – and many more just as stunning – are imminent occurrences .
They will all , he steadfastly maintains , happen before the middle of the 21st century .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Which means , regarding the earlier allusion to his mortal coil , that he does n't plan to do any shuffling any time soon .
Ray Kurzweil , 61 , sincerely believes that his own immortality is a realistic proposition ... and just as strongly contends that , using a combination of grave - site DNA and future technologies , he will be able to reclaim his father , Fredric Kurzweil ( the victim of a fatal heart attack in 1970 ) , from death .
Just when will this ultimate life - affirming feat be possible ?
In Kurzweil 's estimation , we will be able to upload the human brain to a computer , capturing " a person 's entire personality , memory , skills and history " , by the end of the 2030s ; humans and non-biological machines will then merge so effectively that the differences between them will no longer matter ; and , after that , human intelligence , transformed for the better , will start to expand outward into the universe , around about 2045 .
With this last prediction , Kurzweil is referring not to any recognisable type of space travel , but to a kind of space infusion .
" Intelligence , " he writes , " will begin to saturate the matter and energy in its midst [ and ] spread out from its origin on Earth . "
It 's as well to mention at this point that , in 2005 , Mikhail Gorbachev personally congratulated Kurzweil for foreseeing the pivotal role of communications technology in the collapse of the Soviet Union , and that Microsoft chairman Bill Gates calls him " the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence " .
A man of lesser accomplishments , touting the same head - spinning claims , would impress few beyond an inner circle of sci- fi obsessives , but Kurzweil – honoured as an inventor by US presidents Lyndon B Johnson and Bill Clinton – has rightfully earned himself a stockpile of credibility .
In person , chewing pensively on a banana , the softly spoken , slightly built Kurzweil looks chipper for his 61 years , and wears an elegantly tailored suit .
A father of two , he resides in the Boston suburbs with his psychologist wife , Sonya , but has flown into Los Angeles for a private screening of Transcendent Man , the upcoming documentary that examines his life and theories over a suitably cosmic score by Philip Glass .
" People do n't really get their intellectual arms around the changes that are happening , " he says , perched lightly on the edge of a large armchair , his overall sheen of wellbeing perhaps a shade more encouraging than you 'd expect from a man of his age .
" The issue is not just [ that ] something amazing is going to happen in 2045 , " he says .
" There 's something remarkable going on right now . "
To understand exactly what he means , and why he thinks that his predictions bear up to hard scrutiny , it 's necessary to return to the title of the above - mentioned book , and the grand idea on which it 's based : " the singularity " .
Borrowed from black - hole physics , in which the singularity is taken to signify what is unknowable , the term has been applied to technology to suggest that we have n't really got a clue what 's going to happen once machines are vastly more " intelligent " than humans .
The singularity , writes Kurzweil , is " a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid , its impact so deep , that human life will be irreversibly transformed " .
He is not unique in his adoption of the idea – the information theorist John von Neumann hinted at it in the 1950s ; retired maths professor and sci- fi author Vernor Vinge has been exploring it at length since the early 1980s – but Kurzweil 's version is currently the most popular " singularitarian " text .
" I did n't come to these ideas because I had certain conclusions and worked backwards , " he explains .
" In fact , I did n't start looking for them at all .
I was looking for a way to time my inventions and technology projects as I realised timing was the critical factor to success .
And I made this discovery that if you measure certain underlying properties of information technology , it follows exquisitely predictable trajectories . "

For Kurzweil , the crux of the singularity is that the pace of technology is increasing at a super - fast , exponential rate .
What 's more , there 's also " exponential growth in the rate ' of exponential growth " .
It is this understanding that gives him the confidence to believe that technology – through an explosion of progress in genetics , nanotechnology and robotics – will soon surpass the limits of his imagination .
It is also why , in addition to bananas and the odd beneficial glass of red wine , he follows a regime of around 200 vitamin pills daily : not so much a diet as an attempt to " aggressively re-programme " his biochemistry .
He claims that tests have shown he aged only two biological years over the course of 16 actual vitamin - popping years .
He also says that , thanks to the regime , he has effectively cured himself of Type 2 diabetes .
Not even open - heart surgery , which he underwent last year , and from which he made a rapid recovery ( " a few hours later I was in the next room , and sent an email " ) could dent his convictions .
On the contrary , he thinks that the brevity of his convalescence is proof positive that the pills are working .
If he slows down the ageing process , he reckons , he 'll be around long enough to witness the arrival of technology that will prolong his life ... forever .
Kurzweil was raised in Queens , New York , where two youthful obsessions – electronics and music – would lead to a guest appearance on the 1960s TV quiz show I 've Got a Secret , on which ( aged 17 ) he showcased his first major invention : a home - made computer that could compose tunes .
Five years later came the death ( in 1970 , when Ray was 22 ) of his father , Fredric , a struggling composer and conductor who , Kurzweil believes , never really got his due .
" I 'm painfully aware of the limitations he had , which were not his fault , " he says .
" In that generation , information about health was not very available , and we did n't have [ today 's ] resources for creating music .
Now , a kid in a dorm room can create a whole orchestral composition on a synthesizer . "
The tragedy of that loss – and the fact that the means to repair a congenital heart defect were available to him , but not his father – is clearly an intense motivation for Kurzweil .
Sometime soon , he believes , he will once again be able to converse with his father , such is the potential of the scientific advances he believes will ultimately pave the way to the singularity .
Not everyone , though , concurs with his appraisal of technological progress , and his belief in the imminence of immortality .
Memorably , in the Transcendent Man documentary , Kevin Kelly , founding editor of future - thinking magazine Wired , labels Kurzweil a " deluded dreamer " who is " performing the services of a prophet " .
In reacting to that assessment , Kurzweil 's habitually mellow tone of voice takes on a hint – albeit mild – of umbrage .
" It 's interesting that [ Kelly ] says my views are ' hard - wired ' , when I actually think his views are hard - wired , " he says .
" He 's a linear thinker , and linear thinking is hard - wired in our brains : it worked very well 1,000 years ago .
Some people really are resistant to accepting this exponential perspective , and they 're very smart people .
You show them the data , and yes , they follow it , but they just can not get past it .
Other people accept it readily . "
Whereas Kelly differs from Kurzweil on the grounds of interpretation and tone , other voices of dispute are rooted in a deep - seated fear of technological calamity .
" The form of opposition from fundamentalist humanists , and fundamentalist naturalists – that we should make no change to nature [ or ] to human beings – is directly contrary to the nature of human beings , because we are the species that goes beyond our limitations , " counters Kurzweil .
" And I think that 's quite a destructive school of thought – you can show that hundreds of thousands of kids went blind in Africa due to the opposition to [ genetically engineered ] golden rice .
The opposition to genetically modified organisms is just a blanket , reflexive opposition to the idea of changing nature .
Nature , and the natural human condition , generates tremendous suffering .
We have the means to overcome that , and we should deploy it . "
To those opponents who detect a thick strain of techno - evangelism in Kurzweil 's basically optimistic interpretation of the singularity , he reacts with self - parody : there 's a tongue - in - cheek photo in The Singularity is Near of the author wearing a sandwich board bearing the book 's title , and he insists he was never " searching for an alternative to customary faith " .
At the same time , he says humankind 's inevitable move towards non-biological intelligence is " an essentially spiritual undertaking " .
Whether or not he attracts a significant following of dedicated believers in search of deliverance , ecstasy or any variation thereof ( some commentators have called the singularity " the rapture for geeks " ) , Kurzweil has undoubtedly positioned himself at the heart of a growing singularity industry .
He is a director of the non-profit Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence , " the only organisation that exists for the expressed purpose of achieving the potential of smarter - than - human intelligence safer and sooner " ; there 's a second film awaiting release ( part fiction , part documentary , co-produced by Kurzweil ) , also based on The Singularity is Near ; and in addition to his theoretical books , he has co-authored a series of health titles , including Transcend : Nine Steps to Living Well Forever and Fantastic Voyage : Live Long Enough to Live Forever .
The secret of immortality , he wants you to know , is available in book form .
Those who have lent Kurzweil their support include space - travel pioneer Peter Diamandis , chairman of the X - Prize Foundation ; videogame designer ( and creator of Spore and SimCity ) Will Wright ; and Nobel Prize - winning astrophysicist George Smoot .
All three can be found on the faculty and adviser list of the recently founded Singularity University ( Silicon Valley ) , of which Kurzweil is chancellor and trustee .
If the pace of technology continues to accelerate , as Kurzweil predicts , it seems likely that discussion of the singularity will see an exponential growth of its own .
Few would dispute that it's one of the 21st century 's most compelling ideas , because it connects issues that intensely polarise people ( God , the energy crisis , genetic engineering ) with sci-fi concepts that stir the imagination ( artificial intelligence , immersive virtual reality , molecular engineering ) .
Thanks largely to Kurzweil and the singularity , scenarios once viewed as diverting entertainment are being reappraised with a new seriousness .
The line between fanciful thinker and credible , scientific analyst is becoming blurred : what once would have been relegated to the realms of sci- fi is now gaining factual currency .
" People can wax philosophically , " says Kurzweil .
" It 's very abstract – whether it's a good thing to overcome death or not – but when it comes to some new methodology that 's a better treatment for cancer , there 's no controversy .
Nobody 's picketing doctors who put computers inside people 's brains for Parkinson's : it 's not considered controversial . "
Might that change as more people become aware of the singularity and the pace of technological change ?
" People can argue about it , " says Kurzweil , relaxed as ever within his aura of certainty .
" But when it comes down to accepting each step along the way , it 's done really without much debate . "

Ray Kurzweil 's guide to incredible future technologies — and when he thinks they 're likely to arrive ...
1 Reconnaissance dust
" These so - called ' smart dust ' – tiny devices that are almost invisible but contain sensors , computers and communication capabilities – are already being experimented with .
Practical use of these devices is likely within 10 to 15 years "
2 Nano assemblers
" Basically , these are three - dimensional printers that can create a physical object from an information file and inexpensive input materials .
So we could email a blouse or a toaster or even the toast .
There is already an industry of three - dimensional printers , and the resolution of the devices that can be created is getting finer and finer .
The nano assembler would assemble devices from molecules and molecular fragments , and is about 20 years away "
3 Respirocytes
" A respirocyte is a nanobot ( a blood cell - sized device ) that is designed to replace our biological red blood cells but is 1,000 times more capable .
If you replaced a portion of your biological red blood cells with these robotic versions you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath , or sit at the bottom of a swimming pool for four hours .
These are about 20 years away " '
4 Foglets
" Foglets are a form of nanobots that can reassemble themselves into a wide variety of objects in the real world , essentially bringing the rapid morphing qualities of virtual reality to real reality .
Nanobots that can perform useful therapeutic functions in our bodies , essentially keeping us healthy from inside , are only about 20 years away .
Foglets are more advanced and are probably 30 to 40 years away "
5 Blue goo
" The concern with full - scale nanotechnology and nanobots is that if they had the capability to replicate in a natural environment ( as bacteria and other pathogens do ) , they could destroy humanity or even all of the biomass .
This is called the grey goo concern .
When that becomes feasible we will need a nanotechnology immune system .
The nanobots that would be protecting us from harmful self - replicating nanobots are called blue goo ( blue as in police ) .
This scenario is 20 to 30 years away "

September 30 , 2009
Today started not unlike any other .
Except that one of my friends emailed me a story about how a company called American Police Force has moved into a town south of me called Hardin , and how they were “ taking over that jail that was built and never opened ” .
Now most Montanans are aware of this financial OOPS that was this modern jail .
It was built , and never opened because it was not built to specs in accordance with prisoner housing requirements pursuant to Montana State Law .
The new prison facility in Hardin , Montana .
When I started reading the KULR 8 news stations reports on this “ American Police Force ” , it immediately made me suspicious as that is totally against the idea of police .
Our police are hired and mandated by the local governments they are local to .
They are required to go to what ’s called POST , or Peace Officer ’s Standards of Training .
This school is mandatory by Montana Law prior to be appointed as a “ sworn peace officer ” .
With these concerns in mind , I started making phone calls .
I started with Becky Shay , who was the Billings Gazette reporter who initially broke the story .
I spent an hour and a half with her and talked about all of the details .
She and I had a positive talk where she assured me that she was “ thankful for the chance to be able to talk to people like me . ”
I was appalled to hear that this company had “ no intention of revealing who their parent company is ” .
Ms. Shay confided in me that she went from a reporter ’s salary and conditions “ driving a ’ 99 Dodge Intrepid with a broken tie rod and bad front brakes ” , to “ a brand new black SUV that she does n’t have to pay the gas bill for ” .
My jaw was on the floor .
Story breaker straight to the being the mouth of the beast …
Ms.
Shay also told me that there are people in Hardin that are so grateful for APF ’s presence , that they literally opened their homes to her if she needed a place to say .
Now this SOUNDS great and all , but it also sounded very manufactured .
This conversation went down as if Ms. Shay was trying to sell me something .
I read some things about how APF arrived in Hardin , Montana with the words : Hardin Police on the door .
This is IMPERSONATING A POLICE OFFICER .
They had NO RIGHT to bear that title .
They are NOT sworn as peace officers .
They have NO AUTHORITY !
[ efoods ]
It was shortly before I ended this call on a positive note , that Ms. Shay expressed a GREAT interest in talking to Alex .
I told her that I would be contacting the AJ show .
I was told by her that I was TOTALLY 100 % OK ’d to use ALL of the content in any further correspondence .
I then called Mr. Al Pedersen who is the Executive Director of Two Rivers Authority , the financial entity that is in charge of attempting to rebuild Hardin ’s infrastructure .
I asked Mr. Pedersen to elaborate how a private military company could move into a town , take over a prison that did not meet Montana Code , and dare to emblazon “ Hardin Police ” on their doors …
Mr. Pedersen cursed me out , and hung up on me .
I called him back , got his voicemail , and left the message that since he could not see fit to talk to me civilly , that I would be calling all of my elected officials as well as CNN and CSPAN .
No reply .
I then proceeded to call KULR8 news in Billings , Montana .
They expressed concern about how a near 20 year career reporter could simply sell out and go to work for the very company SHE ousted !
The person I spoke to said , “ she got herself a bigger paycheck , ca n’t fault her for that ! ” .
This person also conceded that it was a sell out situation , and was sick .
I than called the Office of the Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer .
The person who answered the phone assured me that Gov. Schweitzer was watching this situation and would see to it that there was NOTHING illegal or unconstitutional going on , and that his office would NOT allow these people to overstep any legal boundaries .
They did n’t want to talk about how the APF showed up labelled as “ police ” .
This conversation was abruptly ended by the intern .
I then called the Office of Max Baucus ’ Billings location who denied any knowledge .
Although Schweitzer , Baucus , and Mt Senator Jon Tester were sued by Two Rivers Authority to allow this prison to be used by a private entity … wherein a judge overturned Montana Law in order to allow this prison to be used privately without disclosing where the prisoners are coming from , or their nature .
This company is known to be affiliated with Blackwater Security now known as XE , as well as other PMC’s .

We also try cases in all four of the San Diego County courthouses and in neighboring counties , such as Riverside and Orange County , if necessary .
In recent years , I ’ve become increasingly concerned about my scatterbrained - ness .
I find it hard to focus on a single task for a prolonged period of time : for example , I find it takes me far longer to get through a book , or even read a short passage of text , than it ever used to .
I do n’t listen to the other person when I ’m having a conversation — or rather , I try to listen , but the information somehow always seems to pass through my brain without being stored anywhere .
I ’m not really present in the moment .
My brain gets distracted very easily , and I ’ll swear I had n’t had that conversation with you .
My comprehension of texts is perhaps worse than it ’s ever been , too .
Not all the time , but often , I have to concentrate quite hard in order to actually take in the details of what I ’m reading if I want anything more than a cursory understanding .
When using the computer at home , I never seem to do anything productive — just follow an endless cycle of checking my feed reader , my e-mail , Twitter , and flicking through my open tabs .
Sure , I get things done , but slowly , and piecemeal .
My concentration usually feels scattered , my focus divided , my brain like it ’s trying to juggle too many balls / clubs / knives / porcupines at once .
The first time I noticed this really happening was after starting university .
My arrival at uni coincided ( I think ) with my first really portable , useful laptop ( an iBook G4 ) with real internet - wherever - I - was ; with the rise of update services like Twitter ; with the rise of tabbed browsing .
More and more things calling for my attention at any given time , and an increasing number of easy distractions .
I think taking a laptop into lectures was a big mistake .
What with web browsing , instant messaging , and the computer society chat room , I ’d often leave lectures not having a clue what we ’d just been told about .
Closer to exams , I ’d be going over course notes and sample exam papers and come across topics that I was sure I ’d never been taught .
Of course , I had — I just had n’t been paying much attention .
It ’s a problem that feeds itself .
Checking your e-mail or Twitter account and finding a new message or some new updates from your friends is very … moreish .
Each new ‘ thing ’ you discover is like a reward for your brain — well done ! , it says , you checked for a thing , and you found one !.
And so you check again .
And again , and again .
Modern technology makes it easier than ever to be distracted ; for your focus to be divided .
Everything is at your fingertips .
The problem is that if you ’re trying to write a report on the computer and your brain keeps diving off to skim through some websites , or check your e-mail , or see what your friends are up to , it leaves very little time to actually devote to what you were trying to accomplish in the first place .
And every time you check on one of these things , and your brain gets that little reward , it spends more and more time looking at more and more things .
Ergo , you do n’t finish that report — never mind , I ’ll finish it tomorrow .
But tomorrow , you ’re just as distracted .
You feel bad for not finishing , but your brain ca n’t help seeking its little rewards .
It becomes a habit .
An addiction .
So the downward spiral goes .
I think multitasking ’s partly to blame for this detrimental effect .
As much as we like to think we can work on lots of things at once , the fact is we ’re simply not that good at it – and I do n’t think it ’s particularly good for us , either .
It ’s stressful , and it trains our brain that it ’s okay to only focus on tasks for a short period of time before switching to something else – but that ’s no way to get things done .
Even when relaxing , my brain still thinks it should be doing other things .
For years , I ’ve been overloading myself with information and trying to do too many things at once .
Without even noticing it , I ’ve been training my brain to always look for opportunities to perform this kind of rapid context - switching , which has left me less and less able to focus on any one thing for any length of time .
And lately , it ’s been getting to me .
I want to read more ( I used to love reading books and would devour them ever - so quickly ) ; I want to write more ; I want to create more .
Every time I attempt to settle down to do one of these things , that crack - seeking part of my brain gets excited by the slightest thing , pulling my attention away from what I want to do .
What was that noise ?
Have I done this ?
I should remember to do that .
I wonder if I have any e-mails ?
Are there any updates to my iPhone apps ?
Has anyone posted on Twitter recently ?
I ’m genuinely concerned about the effect it ’s going to have on my long - term ability to focus on tasks and on my memory .
The change I ’ve described thus - far has arisen over a fairly short 4 year period .
Current research seems to be backing up this idea that multitasking may well be problematic .
A recent CNN article covers a study in which multitaskers did worse on attention tests than non-multitaskers .
The multitaskers were more easily distracted by irrelevant information , and retained useless information in their short - term memory .
Researchers are n’t sure whether these effects are reversible or not —
I ’m inclined to think they are , given enough time spent trying to correct them .
So , I ’m planning to do something about it and start trying to reverse the effects .
It ’s like realizing that for years I ’ve been eating junk food on an alarmingly regular basis , and training my body to crave the taste of it .
It ’s time to throw away the Big Zinger Whopper , go on a diet , and start an exercise regime .
For starters , I ’m going to be attempting to take up meditation on a daily basis .
After all , applying single focus for a prolonged period of time is part of what mindfulness mediation is all about .
Training my brain regularly in this way should help increase my mindfulness and focus when going about my day - to - day activities .
The goal of this kind of meditation is to bring an inner peace and a lasting happiness .
Along the path to that goal , you get a lot of other benefits such as being more connected to your body , more aware of your feelings and emotions , and less caught by your thoughts and what ’s called the “ monkey mind ” – a mind that wo n’t rest and that , over time , contributes to the kinds of anxiety and stress many of us feel each day .
An Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation – Hivelogic
I ’m also going to be trying to cut down on multitasking .
If I ’m doing something creative , or talking to somebody , or reading something , I want to give that my full attention .
No aimless web browsing , or e-mail / Twitter / feed checking , whilst I ’m trying to half - participate in a conversation with you .
That does n’t mean I ca n’t browse the web or read my feeds – but there ’s a time and a place , and keeping these things distinct means that I should be more effective at whatever it is I ’m doing .
As with meditation , singletasking should help my ability to focus on a given task .
It wo n’t be easy and it wo n’t be fast , but I guess it ’s a bit like learning to run a marathon – take small , incremental steps , practice as often as you can , and you ’ll get there .
After I began drafting this post I bought a book I ’d read about online : The Power of Less .
It may sound like a load more self - help nonsense , but it puts forward some useful ideas about applying meditation techniques to singletasking in your daily life .
Simply focus on the task at hand — if you find your attention drawn away , be aware of what ’s happening , breathe , and return your focus to the task .
I ’ve written the first draft of this blog post with no distractions whatsoever – just me and a text editor .
I ’ve written nearly 1000 words in about half an hour , because my attention has been on writing , and only on writing .
Singletasking might just be the way forward

Lee Kai-Fu became the face of Google China
The man who led Google 's expansion into China is leaving the company to start his own business .
Lee Kai - Fu , who joined from Microsoft in 2004 , will step down as president of Google in greater China in September , the company said .
When he joined , Microsoft sued Google and Mr Lee , claiming he had violated an agreement that prohibited him from working for a rival for one year .
The two sides later settled out of court , without releasing details .
Mr Lee went on to become the face of Google China .
But during his reign Google China had a difficult relationship with Beijing censors .
In June , access to Google in some parts of China was disrupted , amid a row over what Chinese citizens should be allowed to view over the internet .
A Chinese official also accused Google of spreading pornography and breaking Chinese law .
" Kai - Fu has made an enormous contribution to Google over the last four years , helping dramatically to improve the quality and range of services that we offer in China , " said Alan Eustace , Google 's senior vice president for engineering .
Mr Lee will be replaced by John Liu , who currently leads its greater China sales team .
I do n’t know how one goes about finding these things , but someone noticed a weird source code for this page .
It ’s a very basic , unspectacular catalog page for Fujinon Binoculars .
But take a look at the source code .
This screenshot is but a tiny part of the madness .
Keep scrolling down the code for the full effect .
I ’ll wait .
Apparently , the designer cares very deeply about the 8 point font .
It was funny enough to get posted to b3ta and even made the weekly newsletter .
Lots of folks laughed at it because it seemed so pointless .
But that ’s just the beginning of the story .
This turned out to be about so much more than the 8 point font .
If you take the entire source code and lay it on its side , you get this .
Which does n’t mean anything in itself , but take a look at the Google Earth view from Fujinon ’s headquarters as you look toward Mount Fuji , as posted to b3ta .
And then overlay the source code ( seen in yellow here ) onto the image .
Just a bit of an “ ooga - booga ” moment , huh ?
But it makes plenty of sense in the Japanese “ form over function ” mindset .
A website has to have the proper Feng Shui after all .
When you take all day to make sure one stroke of your calligraphy is right , why not go the distance for your html as well ?

Recently we received some questions about how Google uses ( or more accurately , does n't use ) the " keywords " meta tag in ranking web search results .
Suppose you have two website owners , Alice and Bob .
Alice runs a company called AliceCo and Bob runs BobCo .
One day while looking at Bob 's site , Alice notices that Bob has copied some of the words that she uses in her " keywords " meta tag .
Even more interesting , Bob has added the words " AliceCo " to his " keywords " meta tag .
Should Alice be concerned ?
At least for Google 's web search results currently ( September 2009 ) , the answer is no .
Google does n't use the " keywords " meta tag in our web search ranking .
This video explains more , or see the questions below .
Q : Does Google ever use the " keywords " meta tag in its web search ranking ?
A : In a word , no .
Google does sell a Google Search Appliance , and that product has the ability to match meta tags , which could include the keywords meta tag .
But that 's an enterprise search appliance that is completely separate from our main web search .
Our web search ( the well - known search at Google.com that hundreds of millions of people use each day ) disregards keyword metatags completely .
They simply do n't have any effect in our search ranking at present .
Q : Why does n't Google use the keywords meta tag ?
A : About a decade ago , search engines judged pages only on the content of web pages , not any so - called " off - page " factors such as the links pointing to a web page .
In those days , keyword meta tags quickly became an area where someone could stuff often - irrelevant keywords without typical visitors ever seeing those keywords .
Because the keywords meta tag was so often abused , many years ago Google began disregarding the keywords meta tag .
Q : Does this mean that Google ignores all meta tags ?
A : No , Google does support several other meta tags .
This meta tags page documents more info on several meta tags that we do use .
For example , we do sometimes use the " description " meta tag as the text for our search results snippets , as this screenshot shows :
Even though we sometimes use the description meta tag for the snippets we show , we still do n't use the description meta tag in our ranking .
Q : Does this mean that Google will always ignore the keywords meta tag ?
They came from outer space a half - century ago and landed in Mexico , where moviegoers embraced big - headed freaks in Mylar tights and busty female invaders from Venus .
Fighting for the survival of Earth : mummies , wrestlers and mad scientists .
These unsung heroes of vintage Mexican cinema mesmerized south - of - the - border moviegoers for a decade in low - budget pictures that threw together science , sex and action with low - budget abandon .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOTrTw78dX0 " Part of the charm of these films is that they are so atrociously underbudgeted and the effects are so cheesy , " said UCLA Film & Television Archive programmer Shannon Kelley , who curated the upcoming free film series " Aztec Mummies & Martian Invaders : Mexican Sci-Fi Classics . "
" To make something seem supernatural , they 'd just add a strange warble sound effect in the background , " she said .
The Mexican film industry began churning out sci-fi on the cheap in the late ' 50s during a period when the nation 's film industry suffered an economic downturn , said Kelley , who likened the movies to Plan 9 From Outer Space , the legendarily bad 1959 sci- fi flick by American director Ed Wood .
" The aliens all wore these very simple Mylar costumes , " she said .
" Plus you have the posturing by the actors . "
Starting Aug. 14 , five of these Mexican sci-fi gems get unearthed in Los Angeles for the UCLA film series .
The lineup includes an Aug. 28 screening of The Ship of Monsters ( La Nave de los Monstruos ) .
In the 1959 movie , pictured top , two Venusian women , Beta and Gamma , crash - land in Chihuahua , Mexico .
There they enslave a couple of handsome earthlings with their vampirelike bloodsucking skills .
Read on for a look at the pictures , and plots , that once drove Mexican sci- fi fans bonkers .
Santo the Silver Mask vs. the Martian Invasion .
Though it hardly seems like a fair fight , Mexican filmmakers liked to pit their aliens against masked wrestlers , as in Santo the Silver Mask vs. the Martian Invasion ( trailer embedded below ) .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whs0rBMv5ww "
It 's kind of like in the United States , where you have Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein — combine your franchises and hopefully double your audience , " said Kelley .
" Santo , the main star of the luchador genre , combats Martians using his beefy body and expert wrestling powers plus scientific knowledge and cultural sensitivity . "
In the movie , platinum - bewigged , Mylar - clad extraterrestrials backed by scantily dressed females announce their impending invasion with apocalyptic television broadcasts , then teletransport themselves to private homes and public sporting events in order to vaporize some humans and kidnap others .
Heroic masked wrestler Santo comes to the rescue .

Yesterday before going to see Julie and Julia ( loved it ! )
I headed down to the Copley Farmers market ( where I will start working on Friday - - please come visit , SE - ers ! ) and picked up a baguette and herbs de provence goat cheese , which I snuck into the theatre and enjoyed throughly while watching the movie .
What kind of yummy snacks do you all ( or do n't you ? ) sneak into the movie theatres ?
Does it vary depending on what you 're going to watch ?
In an earlier post I speculated a bit on what mischief Kent Conrad might get up to to monkeywrench healthcare reform efforts .
I wrote that before I found out precisely how far he 's already gone to kill Democratic healthcare reform .
Instead of measuring the impact of health care reform over ten years , the CBO will use a 20 - year window , Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) told reporters Tuesday .
" You have to do that if you 're going to know whether you 're bending the cost curve , " he said .
He wants the timeline to apply to the Senate Health Committee and the House bills , as well .
" Everything needs to be scored in a similar way , " he said .
He added , significantly , that the bill would not need to be paid for with spending cuts and revenue increases over the 20 - year period .
Rather , Conrad stressed that ir would merely need to show that it was reducing the rate of the increase iin health care costs and it would only need to be paid for over the first decade to meet his criteria .
The CBO has been largely dismissive of reforms that Democrats insist will lead to cost savings , such as prevention efforts or the establishment of an independent commission to set Medicare reimbursement rates .
At the same time , the White House has taken drug - price negotiations and other cost - saving efforts off the table in deals with industry groups .
The upshot : CBO is likely to estimate that the second decade of the reform bill 's life will add to the deficit , giving fuel to critics who say it is too expensive .
It would also force backers of the bill to trim subsidies , increase revenue somehow , or break Obama 's pledge .
That 's way outside usual procedure for the CBO , which always uses a 10 year window for projections -- a timeframe already problematic .
But it 's also a significant departure for Kent Conrad , as Ezra Klein points out :
The first came earlier this year when Conrad modified Obama ’s first budget .
Obama had eliminated a couple of Bush - era gimmicks that made the deficit appear smaller than it really was .
Bush , for instance , shortened the budget window from 10 years to five , so the total deficit sounded smaller .
Obama ’s budget returned it to the traditional 10 .
And then Conrad changed it back .
The Politico reported that Conrad made this decision " because of the uncertainty of long - range forecasts . "
Others thought he did it to hide the size of the deficit .
In any case , 10 years , as the alert reader will notice , is less than 20 years .
If 10 years was too long a time period for certainty , then it is difficult to see how 20 years could possibly be acceptable .
The second came in 2003 , when Conrad voted for the Medicare Modernization Act , better known as Medicare Part D. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would increase the federal deficit by $ 421 billion and reduce federal revenue by another $ 174 billion .
The total cost to the deficit , then , neared $ 600 billion .
Conrad not only accepted the CBO ’s 10 - year time frame , but he voted for the bill .
His press release enthusiastically touted the fact that the bill would " bring more than $ 70 million to North Dakota hospitals over the next ten years . "
Conrad ’s record in the Senate , then , would lead you to believe a couple of things .
For one , he distrusts long - range projections .
Even 10 years is too uncertain .
He also believes some priorities overwhelm deficit concerns , health - care coverage being one of them .
But when faced with a health - care reform that will be deficit neutral within the 10 - year time frame , he is demanding that it instead be measured against an even more uncertain 20 - year time frame , and by an agency that he claims underestimates savings .
The CBO ’s scores are terrible , in other words , and come in such small portions !
Kent Conrad does n't want comprehensive healthcare reform that really works , and he 's doing his damnedest to empower the Blue Dogs and his fellow ConservaDems to kill it .
In many developing countries religion is one of the most powerful sources of personal identity – for good and ill .
Understanding these identities is critical to tackling conflict and understanding politics .
Equally , the role of religion in forming attitudes and behaviour can be profoundly important in addressing the causes and effects of poverty .
In countries where the state has a weak or erratic presence , people often organise essential services through faith communities : the churches are the largest healthcare providers in sub-Saharan Africa .
Faith can also be a channel through which people become engaged as active citizens , and press for change , whether in recent Kenyan elections or the protests in Burma .
A couple of weeks ago I spoke in Rimini , northern Italy .
Twenty thousand people of faith attended the conference to discuss and examine their Catholicism .
All over the world , week in week out , billions more people of different faiths take time to practise their religious beliefs .
Faith remains a major force and source of immense influence around the world .
At the turn of the millennium government understood that the churches could deliver powerful and effective advocacy messages in favour of development objectives : on aid , trade and debt .
With Gordon Brown and myself , they were mainly knocking on an open door .
We valued that commitment to making poverty history .
The great London multi - faith march by religious leaders this year to promote the Millennium Development Goals was further evidence of the power wielded by faith communities when they work together .
We know they are effective advocates – that 's not the key question in development .
But do religious leaders and faith communities in the developing world have the capacity to contribute effectively to national development plans ?
Or are they only interested in the welfare of their own constituencies , so that funding them would be divisive ?
The answer is providing help to enable faith communities to develop their capabilities .
It does n't make sense for them to do this separately .
This is a core part of the vision of my Faith Foundation .
When faith communities collaborate for justice and human development there is a double payoff : things get done and respect and understanding between them grows .
In Mozambique there are excellent programmes training leaders from different faiths together so that they can play their role in health education among their communities .
Faith communities given training , some funding and mobile phones , could provide governments with missing data about incidence of disease and the effectiveness of healthcare delivery in parts of their populations where government has negligible access .
But there is little research on what these communities need , even what they are already doing , to know what interventions are required .
Dfid is funding one of the first research consortiums studying faith and development based at Birmingham University .
But we need more .
Religions know a lot about wellbeing .
But a small minority are part of the problem .
They do not start off with a belief in a merciful and compassionate God and reflect this in work for integral human development , peace and justice .
As Pope Benedict points out in his recent encyclical , there are religious ideologies that completely deny the very value of development .
But it would be wrong to pump up instances of the wilful perversion of religion into a blanket condemnation of faith .
Let 's be clear .
Faith communities are not NGOs in the normal sense .
They were not consciously created for service delivery , health care , advocacy , or education .
They are a gathered people brought together by often ancient religious traditions carried through the generations by a community of faith .
They are centred on worship , usually rooted in sacred texts and have a particular spirituality and set of symbols .
They are involved in healthcare and education because of their particular spirituality and what they believe are the simple demands of justice .
Their obligation is to God or their founding teacher .
They bring to it a common concern for the human dignity of the person that embraces the spiritual .
Faith has traditionally been a blind spot in the UK policy arena , which has tended to be dominated by economic and political discourses .
The Observer journalist Anthony Sampson told a story from his time as ghost writer for the 1980 Brandt Report .
It was at the time a major contribution to the analysis of the problems of international development .
After it was published , Sampson asked Willy Brandt how he felt about it .
" Too many economists , not enough anthropologists " was his somewhat cryptic reply .
He meant , of course , that the report had not paid enough attention to the importance of culture and religion in determining outcomes in development .
Now he had his faults , but excessive religiosity was not one of them .
The developing world was steeped in religious ideas and practice .
You neglected them at the cost of effective development .
At the time the secular world of econometrics and development experts , on the whole , simply did n't get it .
He had spotted the problem .
The role of faith in development is complex and not well enough understood .
The seminar series we 're running with Dfid , Islamic Relief , World Vision and Oxfam is designed to be an open , and if necessary , critical discussion about the role that faith can play in development .
It 's timely .
Government is taking an increasing interest in faith and development , and the faith community increasingly has a viable role alongside major development organisations in working to achieve the MDGs .
We live in a global community .
The contest for scarce resources , water and oil , will be intense by mid-century .
Our interdependence is manifest whether at the level of climate change or global financial markets .
The daunting task of bringing 1.4 billion people out of dire poverty , feeding the 900 million who go to bed hungry every day , faces religious communities and secular humanists alike .
We need the inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue that turns neighbours into friends able to work together to confront the threats to our common security .
This speech will be delivered as the first in a series of seminars exploring faith and development hosted by The Tony Blair Faith Foundation , the Department for International Development , Islamic Relief , World Vision and Oxfam and debated on Comment is free : belief .
A selection of on - topic comments will be put forward as questions at the end of the live session on Monday evening
A Happy Banking Tale , and Faint Praise We Can Live With
Interesting piece here by Washington Post columnist Steven Pearlstein about a relatively small North Carolina bank called Citizens South , which avoided bad loans , has remained profitable , and then applied for and won $ 20.5 million in TARP bailout funds .
Writing on the eve of the testimony by eight gigantic bankers before the House Financial Services Committee , Pearlstein lauds Citizens South and its president , Kim Price , for the sanity and creativity with which they put that $ 20.5 million to use :
A few weeks ago , while reading a newspaper article , Price came up with an ingenious plan for how to use it .
The article was about the reluctance of people to buy a house in the current market , and what kinds of incentives had been used successfully by builders and bankers to get them to close a deal .
Two stood out : lower rates and the waiving of closing costs .
And that got Price to thinking :
What if Citizens were to use its federal bailout money to offer below - market mortgage rates with no closing costs to consumers who would buy a house , or a house lot , from builders and developers who had borrowed money from Citizens ?
Price asked some of his loan officers to check with the builders and developers , who not surprisingly were excited enough about the project to be willing to chip in some money to help cover a portion of the forgone closing costs .
So last week , Citizens launched its marketing campaign for the $ 20.5 million program , in collaboration with its builder - developer customers , offering 30 - year loans with an initial teaser rate of 3.5 percent for the first two years , rising to a fixed 5.5 percent rate ( the current market rate ) for the balance of the loan .
“ As we see it , it ’s a win - win - win situation all round , ” Price explained to me .
Pearlstein is particularly impressed that Price ’s total pay package last year was just $ 456,146 , a rounding error for most of the eight banking kings who came to talk to Congress .
This leads Pearlstein to deliver a zesty kicker to his column :
So here ’s a question the House Financial Services Committee might put to the Titans of Finance :
How is it that Kim Price , a community banker with an undergraduate degree from Appalachian State University , a tiny executive staff , and a pay package that you would consider insulting , somehow managed to come up with a more creative use for his government bailout money than any of you ?
Some graduates of Appalachian State University ( ahem , ahem ) might take offense at Pearlstein ’s insinuation .
But this strikes me as a case of faint praise that such people should happily accept .

Opposition to the war is rising , even in the President 's own party and even before his new military strategy has been fully implemented .
Our ally 's leaders look weak and corrupt , Americans are increasingly opposed to the war , and prominent politicians and columnists are saying it is time to leave and redeploy our forces to focus on the real danger to the U.S. , which is from al Qaeda .
Sound familiar ?
That was roughly the state of play regarding Iraq in September 2007 , even as General David Petraeus 's troop surge and counterinsurgency strategy were beginning to work in Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle .
Despite a few shaky moments , President Bush stuck with it , and a looming U.S. defeat became a victory .
We are now approaching a similar pass in Afghanistan , amid rising doubts about the wisdom of continuing that war nearly eight years after 9/11 .
Evidence that President Hamid Karzai's allies stuffed ballot boxes have tarnished the recent Afghan election , U.S. casualties are rising , and the Taliban enemy seems increasingly menacing .
Though new theater commander Stanley McChrystal has only recently submitted his strategic plan , the calls are growing for the U.S. to leave .
We are about to see if our current Commander in Chief has the nerve of his predecessor to withstand a Washington panic .
***
The great irony of this panic is that only months ago the consensus was that Afghanistan was a " war of necessity , " as President Obama likes to put it .
Even the left seemed to agree that Afghanistan could n't again become a sanctuary for al Qaeda , that retreat from Afghanistan would be a strategic victory for jihadists , and that it would weaken our influence in Islamabad and perhaps threaten the stability of Pakistan itself as Islamists tried to turn the Pakistan military and population its way .
Now we 're told we can accomplish these same strategic goals merely by maintaining a much smaller force than the 68,000 currently committed to Afghanistan .
Drones and special forces based offshore can contain the jihadists , while the Kabul government will have to fend for itself .
We thus do n't need to " nation build " to achieve U.S. ends .
I ’ve started a new project that I ’m calling Food In Real Life .
The idea is that I take pictures of real food that I ’m about to eat , compare them to the pictures on the food ’s packaging , and then dole out scores for the food ’s appearance ( compared to the packaging ) and taste like I ’m some kind of Olympic food judge .
For example , here ’s a comparison I did of Antioch Farms Chicken Kiev :
Looks :
While the color and texture are almost identical , the chicken kiev pictured on the box
is about 50 % longer than the ones found inside .
( There is no way that the sliced and unsliced
portions on the box belong to the same kiev . )
The butter sauce is portrayed accurately , even
though my picture does n’t really show it .
( It ’s boiling - lava hot , so slicing the chicken without
splashing butter magma everywhere was a challenge . ) 4 out of 5
I ’d love any feedback you have on the idea or the execution of the site .
Artistic actress flaunts furry writing bush
Ooops , did we write “ bush ” in the headline ?
Maybe it was a Freudian slip .
Read on .
It seems that Kazuo Kajiyama , reporting in Nikkan Gendai ( Sep. 8 ) , was asked to serve as assistant to a gal who gives erotic calligraphy performances .
She goes by the moniker Minako and gave a calligraphy performance at a “ happening bar ” in Akasaka .
Kajiyama was invited to keep the ink flowing , in more ways than one .
A happening bar , for the uninitiated , is a place where all sorts of outrageous and kinky things happen , and Minako , a 31 - year - old actress , not only has something of an exhibitionistic bent , but also happens to be a fully qualified instructress in the art of brush calligraphy .
As it turned out , our “ bush ” reference was not entirely incorrect ; an audience of about 20 male patrons were astonished to see that Minako ’s artistry is not limited to writing solely with her hands .
Accompanied by her male assistant decked out in a Japanese kimono , she made her appearance completely nude .
“ Teacher , preparations have been completed ! ” the assistant proclaims .
Minako is handed a brush , the tip of which has been dipped into an inkstone .
She then solicits members of the audience for requests .
“ Please write ‘ Ai , ' ” exclaims one , requesting that she write the Sino - Japanese ideograph meaning “ love . ”
Squatting vertically above a sheet of paper , she inserts the brush into her vagina and , slowly contorting her anatomy to follow the stroke pattern of the character , produces 愛 ( ai ) , as the audience ogles in amazement .
“ Kajiyama , next ! ” she orders .
The second brush is not your everyday variety , but rather a custom - made device that combines calligraphy brush with a vibrator .
She flips the switch to “ on ” and slides it inside , and is soon grinding her pelvis and batting her eyelashes while emitting little grunts of pleasure .
Squatting above a fresh sheet of paper , this time she sensually inscribes 夢 ( yume ) , meaning “ dream . ”
And her performance is once again word perfect .
How can Minako manage such masterful calligraphy , despite the distraction of being diddled by a dildo down there in her most sensitive spot ?
“ Well I ’ve been keeping in practice , ” she replies .
“ If there ’s a way to do it , I ’d like to embark on a world tour . ”
Carnegie Hall , here she comes ! ( K.S. )

Iran has asked the United Nations to call a meeting to consider banning attacks on nuclear installations , the semi-official Fars news agency reported .
Israel has said it will not tolerate a nuclear Iran and has dropped hints about taking military action against Iran ’s enrichment facilities if diplomatic efforts fail to halt the nuclear program .
Iran has said its program is purely civilian in nature and cites its right to nuclear power under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
Tehran ’s request , which asked for a conference of 150 nations to vote on a proposed ban , was made on Wednesday in a letter by Iran ’s envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency , Ali-Asghar Soltaniyeh , according to Fars .
Mr. Soltaniyeh asked that Iran ’s proposal be considered at the scheduled September meeting of the nuclear agency ’s general conference .
The World From Berlin German Nuclear Scandal is ' Hair - Raising and Unforgivable '
Fresh allegations about government misconduct involving a controversial nuclear waste storage facility at Gorleben have rekindled political debate about atomic energy in Germany , just weeks before the country goes to the polls .
Media commentators speculate that the issue could affect the national election .
Was immer jeder einzelne Anhänger der Piratenpartei unter der von dieser propagierten » Post­ideologie « versteht – selbst aus » postideologischer « Sicht der Piraten dürfte die vergangene Woche nicht optimal verlaufen sein .
Es begann mit einem Interview von Andreas Popp , dem stellvertretenden Vorsitzenden der Piraten , in der Jungen Freiheit , dem kurz darauf ein ausgefüllter Fragebogen des Parteivorsitzenden Jens Seipenbusch in derselben Zeitung folg­te .
Wieder einen
Tag später annoncierten die ­Piraten begeistert die Wahlempfehlung , welche die » Freien Wähler Düsseldorf « abgegeben hatten , zu ihren Gunsten .
Die » Freien Wähler « wurden gegründet von Torsten Lemmer , ehemals Manager der Naziband Störkraft und zuletzt im Mai 2009 wegen Volksverhetzung verurteilt .
Man kenne » diesen Herrn « nicht , sagte dann der für die Veröffentlichung der Empfehlung verantwortliche Pressesprecher der Piraten Nordrhein - Westfalens – übrigens ein christlicher Lebensschützer – der ­Jungle World .
» Aha , hm , da werde ich mich mal informieren . «
Ob er es inzwischen geschafft hat , den Namen Lemmer zu googeln , ist unbekannt – die stolze Presseerklärung findet sich jedenfalls immer noch auf der Website der Partei .
Aber zurück zur » Postideologie « : Gegen Ende voriger
Woche dämmerte es selbst der Piraten - Führung , dass die so gern beschworene vorurteilsfreie Offenheit gegenüber allen politischen Richtungen irgendwie auch bedeuten sollte , dass man nicht nur mit Rechten spricht .
Und so rief man zwecks eines Ausgleichs im postideo­logischen Ping - Pong bei der Jungle World an und bat darum , interviewt zu werden .
Vielleicht ist den Piraten immer noch nicht klar , wie glücklich sie darüber sein können , dass aus dem Gespräch mangels Interesse der Jungle World nichts wird .
Denn bei der Basis , die schon die halbherzige Entschuldigung von Andreas Popp für sein Interview in der Jungen Freiheit mehrheitlich als Kapitulation vor dem unsäglichen Zeitgeist der political correctness empfand , hätte man sich gewiss empört , von den eigenen Helden in einem linken Blatt lesen zu müssen .
Das könnte durchaus daran liegen , dass die Klientel der Partei – jedenfalls die , die sich öffentlich äußert – zu großen Teilen aus Nazi - Nerds und Stammtischschwaflern mit IT - Kenntnissen besteht , die sich gegen das » ausgelutschte Links - Rechts - Schema « verwahren , weil sie ihren Stammtisch - Pragmatismus und ihr Lamento über » die da oben « , die alle » korrupt « seien , für » postideologisch « halten .
Dass die Pressestelle der Piratenpartei im Büro des ehemaligen SPD - Abgeordneten Jörg Tauss residiert und der Pressesprecher der Piraten von diesem vor zwei Monaten auf Staatskosten als Mitarbeiter engagiert wurde , wird da­gegen als gute Idee gefeiert .
Die Zeitung , die zuerst hierüber berichtete , wurde von Piraten mit Protestmails eingedeckt .
Wegen » unsachlicher Berichterstattung « .
Da zeigt sich dann , wie es um das Demokratieverständnis und die Vorstellung von Meinungsfreiheit bei den Piraten steht .
» Unsachlich « ist da alles , was ihnen nicht passt , und gegen solche » Auswüchse « vorzugehen , gehört zur Lieblingsbeschäftigung der Piraten .
Zum Beispiel indem sie Twitter - Mobbing gegen missliebige Journalistinnen wie Julia Seeliger organisieren , die es gewagt hatte , in der Taz kritisch über rechte Tendenzen bei den Piraten zu berichten .
Oder indem sie das eigene Forum mit flammenden Anklagen gegen den » faschistischen PC - Terror « vollschreiben , der doch tatsächlich vorschreibe , das Wort » Schwarze « statt » Neger « zu verwenden .
Oder indem sie über Flashmobs am Wahlsonntag nachdachten , die wohl aus Parteimitgliedern bestehen sollten , die mit Piratenpartei - T- Shirts uniformiert vor den Wahllokalen in Stellung gehen sollten .
Kleinliche Einwände wie der , dass so etwas an die Hitlerjugend erinnere , die seinerzeit Wähler terrorisierte , machen in diesem Milieu nur wenig Eindruck .
Wegen der » Postideologie « wahrscheinlich .
Um sich klarzumachen , was das postideologische Geschwafel im realen Leben bedeuten könnte , reicht es übrigens , sich eine Abordnung der Piratenpartei auf offiziellem Staatsbesuch vorzustellen .
In Polen .
Oder in Israel .
Music is one of the surest ways to influence human emotions ; most people unconsciously recognize and respond to music that is happy , sad , fearful or mellow .
But psychologists who have tried to trace the evolutionary roots of these responses usually hit a dead end .
Nonhuman primates scarcely respond to human music , and instead prefer silence .
A new report by Charles Snowdon , a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , and musician David Teie of the University of Maryland shows that a monkey called the cotton - top tamarin indeed responds to music .
The catch ?
These South American monkeys are essentially immune to human music , but they respond appropriately to " monkey music , " 30 - second clips composed by Teie on the basis of actual monkey calls .
The music was inspired by sounds the tamarins make to convey two opposite emotions : threats and / or fear , and affiliation , a friendly , safe and happy condition .
The study , published this week ( Sept. 1 ) in the journal Biology Letters , reported that the monkeys could tell the difference :
For five minutes after hearing fear music , the monkeys displayed more symptoms of anxiety and increased their movement .
In contrast , monkeys that heard " affiliative " music reduced their movements and increased their feeding behavior -- both signs of a calming effect .
Snowdon , a longtime researcher into primate behavior , says the project began with an inquiry from Teie , who plays cello in the National Symphony Orchestra : Had Snowdon ever tested the effects of music on monkeys ?
When Teie listened to recordings made in Snowdon 's monkey colony at the psychology department at UW - Madison , he readily discerned the animal 's affective state , Snowdon says .
" He said , ' This is a call from an animal that is very upset ; this is from an animal that is more relaxed . '
He was able to read the emotional state just by the musical analysis . "
Teie composed the music using specific features he noticed in the monkeys ' calls , such as rising or falling pitches , and the duration of various sounds , says Snowdon , who notes that monkeys are not the only ones who use musical elements to convey emotional content in speech .
Studies show that babies that are too young to understand words can still interpret a long tone and a descending pitch as soothing , and a short tone as inhibiting .
" We use legato ( long tones ) with babies to calm them , " Snowdon says .
" We use staccato to order them to stop .
Approval has a rising tone , and soothing has a decreasing tone .
We add musical features to speech so it will influence the affective state of a baby .
If you bark out , ' PLAY WITH IT , ' a baby will freeze .
The voice , the intonation pattern , the musicality can matter more than the words . "
Snowdon , who has sung in choirs for most of his life , adds , " My talking does not necessarily tell you about my emotional state .
When I add extra elements , change the tone of voice , the rhythm , pitch or speed , that is where the emotional content is contained . "
Monkeys interpret rising and falling tones differently than humans .
Oddly , their only response to several samples of human music was a calming response to the heavy - metal band Metallica .
The study opens a new window into animal communication , Snowdon says .
" People have looked at animal communication in terms of conveying information – ' I am hungry , ' or ' I am afraid . '
But it 's much more than that .
These musical elements are inducing a relatively long - term change in behavior of listeners .
The affiliative music is making them calmer ; they move less , eat and drink at a higher rate , and show less anxiety behavior . "
This change in behavior suggests that for cotton - top tamarins , communication is about much more than just information .
" I am not calling just to let you know how I am feeling , but my call can also stimulate a similar state in you , " Snowdon says .
" That would be valuable if a group was threatened ; in that situation , you do n't want everybody being calm , you want them alert .
We do the same thing when we try to calm a baby .
I am not just communicating about how I am feeling .
I am using the way I communicate to induce a similar state in the baby . "
The similarities in communications between monkeys and people suggest deep evolutionary roots for the musical elements of speech , Snowdon says .
" The emotional components of music and animal calls might be very similar , and from an evolutionary perspective , we are finding that the note patterns , dissonance and timing are important for communicating affective states in both animals and people . "
You 've likely heard of Microsoft 's next - gen operating system projects Midori and Singularity , but earlier this month researchers released a prototype for another OS , code - named Barrelfish .
Barrelfish is an OS written specifically for multicore environments .
It hopes to improve the performance of boxes with such chips by creating a network bus , if you will , between cores .
Today such systems tend to share resources like memory .
As demand increases , performance of the box decreases as shared resources do n't scale well .
Barrelfish instead passes messages between cores on its bus , and reportedly uses a database - like approach to keep track of the hardware available .
The project has n't exactly been a secret .
Researchers have been trotting the globe lecturing on it for about a year .
But they were shy about releasing code .
On Sept. 15 , that changed with the release of the first snapshot of the OS .
Microsoft Research , Cambridge , created Barrelfish in conjunction with ETH Zurich , a technology university .
Rumors have swirled that the OS is going to be completely free and open source , as it includes some BSD third - party libraries , which are " covered by various BSD - like open source licenses , " the Barrelfish team says .
But we 'll have to wait and see on that .
This early take - a- peek code is being released under a copyright held by ETH Zurich and Microsoft .
According to a blog post by a blogger , Advogato , on Advogato , who attended a lecture by one of those globe - trotting researchers :
" ... instead of fully isolating program from device via driver , Barrelfish has a kind of database where lots of low level information about the hardware can be found .
The kernel is single threaded and non preemptive .
Scheduling is coupled with the message passing , an arrival of the message simply activates the waiting thread .
It also uses a little bit of the microkernel concepts , running drivers in protected space , like L4 and in general pushing a lot into application domains . "
Here is a diagram of Barrelfish from its creators .

The self - confidence of media pundits like Jim Cramer can have a big influence on us ( Image : Marion Curtis / Rex Features )
EVER wondered why the pundits who failed to predict the current economic crisis are still being paid for their opinions ?
It ’s a consequence of the way human psychology works in a free market , according to a study of how people ’s self - confidence affects the way others respond to their advice .
The research , by Don Moore of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , shows that we prefer advice from a confident source , even to the point that we are willing …
“ Plus , in a world where dark wizards are kidnapping or killing people on a regular basis , a little under - age drinking is the least of their problems . ”
Overseas audiences may respond differently to the drinking scenes .
In England , the legal drinking age is 18 , but 16 - year - olds can order alcohol if they ’re eating a meal .
( Even by those standards , the teenagers in the movie were flouting the law : during the pub scene , no food was served . )
Alcohol educators say that they do n’t want to ruin the fun , but that parents should be aware of alcohol ’s role in the Harry Potter series , the books as well as the movies .
Several studies suggest that movies influence teenagers ’ behavior when it comes to drinking , drugs and tobacco .
An Institute of Medicine committee on under -age drinking has said there is “ a strong possibility ” that youth exposure to alcohol through movies contributes to early initiation of alcohol use .
A 2007 study of nearly 5,600 German teenagers looked at the relationship between drinking activity and exposure to American movies .
Even accounting for variables like friends ’ drinking habits , the researchers found that children with high exposure to alcohol in movies were nearly three times as likely to binge - drink as those with the lowest exposure .
Similarly , a study of 3,000 adolescents found that those who were most often exposed to smoking in movies were nearly three times as likely as others to try smoking .
In a striking finding , the study concluded that in more than half the times that a child in the study tried a cigarette , the decision was linked to having seen smoking in a movie .
Alcohol experts say this does not mean that children should n’t see the new Harry Potter movie .
It actually presents an opportunity for parents to talk to their children about alcohol , says Dr. Christopher Welsh , a University of Maryland psychiatrist and addiction specialist .
“ I hope parents can talk to their kids and tell them even though Harry Potter made that seem fun , that it is n’t O.K. , ” said Dr. Welsh , the author of a 2007 article about alcohol use in the Harry Potter series , published in The Journal of Child and Adolescent Substance Abuse .

' The truth is , I am in denial , but it is self - denial . '
by Jeremy Hooper
In what might be his most revelatory interview yet , professional " ex- gay " Alan Chambers is essentially conveying what we all know :
That his and many others ' " change " is little to nothing more than re-closeting for the sake of pleasing one certain , anti-gay vision of God .
And honestly , even interviewer Gary Schneeberger seems to realize it .
Here are a few choice snips from the two boys ' lil chat :
SCHNEEBERGER : 1 . The title of [ your new book ] is telling .
It ’s called Leaving Homosexuality , not Entering Heterosexuality .
Why is that ?
What ’s the difference ?
CHAMBERS :
The key thought here is the opposite of homosexuality is n’t heterosexuality .
It ’s holiness .
There are people who are conflicted with their sexuality , involved with homosexuality , and there is a way out for those who want it .
But it does n’t say that they ’re going into heterosexuality , because that ’s not the point .
The point is that people can leave whatever it is that God calls less than His best and move into something that is His best , becoming more like He is .
SCHNEEBERGER : 2 . Now , I ’ve heard it , and you ’ve heard it : Gay activists are going to read that and say , again , “ Alan Chambers is living a lie .
He ’s suppressing who he really is . ”
You make a great point in the book that is very applicable to anyone who struggles with any temptation -- and that is , self - denial is n’t a bad thing .
How do you respond to those who say you ’re just living a lie ?
CHAMBERS : For so long I ’ve heard gay activists say to me , “ You ’re just in denial .
You ’re not grasping the reality of the situation .
You ’re just denying who you really are . ”
The truth is , I am in denial , but it is self - denial .
I ’m not in denial of who I used to be .
I ’m not in denial of the temptations that I could still experience .
I am denying the power that sin has over me .
Sin does not have any power that we do n’t give it , and what I ’ve found is that my freedom – and the freedom of others I ’ve known who ’ve left homosexuality -- was centered around denying what might come naturally to us regardless of how it got there .
And once you deny sin ’s power , you can live a free life .
The most authentic part of my life is first and foremost my relationship with Christ , but sitting here where I ’m doing this interview in my back yard -- with my kids and with my wife -- this is who I am .
This is who I want to be .
This is the truth of my life .
This is who I was created to be .
And this is what brings me happiness .
...
SCHNEEBERGER : 5 . There are some remarkably honest passages in this book -- from the details of your childhood to the details of your sexual addictions to the details of your wedding night and your honeymoon .
This book is not going to go under the radar when it comes to the attention of gay activists .
A lot of them read CitizenLink .
They ’re going to see this story .
What would you say to them as they learn about some of the details of your story they may not have known before ?
CHAMBERS : This is me being honest .
I have nothing to hide .
There is absolutely no reason for me to be anything other than candid about the truth of my life , because I think it really speaks to the bigger issue .
And that is , who do I trust ?
Who is my hope in ?
Who is my security found in ?
Who do I look to for every answer ?
And that is Jesus Christ .
When someone is critical , they ’re going to be critical whether I share some of the things I ’ve shared or not .
I ’m looking first and foremost to help people who want help to realize this is what it looks like to leave homosexuality .
This is a really good picture of what this life that I love so much looks like .
If people look at that , no matter whether they ’re fans or critics , and say , “ This guy is brutally honest about how hard this road is but at the same time how much he loves the journey he ’s on , ” then I think that speaks volumes .
And honestly , as a Christian leader , I think that that ’s something we have to do more often .
Christians really need to be honest about their struggles , because secrecy is worse than lies , and I do n’t have any desire to go back to where I once was .
I have every desire to move forward .
I have the life I love , and it gets better every single day .
And I ’m going to be honest about that -- the good , bad and the ugly .
And at the end of the day , I choose this life .
This is who I am .
FULL INTERVIEW : Friday Five : Alan Chambers [ CitizenLink ]
We really have nothing to add .
In fact , it seems that we basically have the same assessment of Alan as he has of himself .
He 's " self - denying " what is naturally within him , making a choice to live as who he thinks he should be rather than what he naturally was / is / could be .
And he 's doing so because he , unlike medical science , refuses to see homosexuality as an orientation that is fittingly compared to heterosexuality , instead choosing to position it as an aberration from the one and only accepted norm .
We get it .
We do n't agree with it , but we get it and fully support his right to live , what seems like ( but may not be ) , a conflicted life .
Fair enough .
He has every right .
Our issue is now and forever has been Alan and his community 's role in passing off this information as factual information rather than personal belief / choice .
Let 's not forget that this is the same Gary Schneeberger who , just this month , tried to spin what was essentially an internal NARTH press release as a credible , peer - reviewed journal purporting to find benefit in " ex - gay " therapy .
And let 's not forget that this is the same Alan Chambers whose sole paycheck ( as far as we can tell ) is derived from using his own personal choice to convince countless many parents and impressionable ( often hurting ) teens that this , their own constrictive version of the gospel , is , well -- the gospel .
Your thoughts
At least while he makes a living peddling this to people in vulnerable situations , we can take heart in him & his associates backing themselves into an ever - smaller niche with preachings like this :
" The key thought here is the opposite of homosexuality is n’t heterosexuality .
It ’s holiness . "
The more ' believers ' who are willing & able to get in the public eye and reduce their religion to nothing more than the opposition of homosexuality , the more deeply churches divide and the thinner their lines of supply become .
If a LGBT commentator proclaimed the opposite of homosexuality were holiness , they'd be quite easily decried as maniacally self - sabotaging - the exact same applies to our detractors .
- - P.S. - -
Not to be pedantic here , but is n't holiness technically reserved for popes , texts , institutions etc. - not having sex does n't qualify someone as holy surely ?
So by extension - seeing as offices & objects cannot possess sexual orientation - holiness could no more be the opposite of homosexuality than citrus could be the opposite of upright , or laminated the opposite of blue ?

Every single time I see these ex-gay " success stories , " it 's always a person who struggled , not with a perfectly normal and loving homosexual relationship , but with sex / drug / alcohol addiction .
Somewhere along the line , they were convinced that instead of the sex / drug / alcohol addiction , their homosexuality was the problem .
Go figure .
Sure , if this guy wants to live this way then he 's got every right , but it makes me sick that he and his ilk try to pass off this seriously fucked - up worldview as irrefutable fact .
That he might tell impressionable kids that , it 's not the addiction that 's bad -- it 's your natural attractions .
I believe a few things about this guy :
1 ) He 's lying , at least in part .
2 ) He 's miserable , but very well - spoken , and beaten about the head with guilt and a specific ( and FLAWED ) interpretation of the Bible .
( Loving homosexual relationships Are. Not. Condemned .
In . The. Bible .
http://www.whosoever.org/bible/ )
3 ) He 's bisexual , so it 's not completely repulsive to him to have sex with a female partner .
Anyway .
Just wanted to rant a bit .
He can live how he wants , but he has no right to condemn others or fuck with their heads .
Grr !

why are you giving this guy free publicity who cares if he wants to try to have a relationship with a woman ?
who is he anyway , some guy who decided there is more money in being a heterosupremacist than in being a homo ?
Let him screw around with women , poor women .
We do n't need him and you sure do n't need to be giving this guy publicity .

Well , the real questions , the ones that might have been asked , but were not included in this interview ..
1 . How 's your sex life ?
How many times do you do it ?
2 . How 's your wife 's sex life ?
Is it satisfying for her ?
3 . Do n't you worry that you are cheating her out of a meaningful relationship ?
4 . Have you been faithful to your wife ?
5 . Does she have someone on the side ?
6 . When were you last checked for STDs ?
7 . Your wife ?
8 . Do you have any income that is n't derived from professional anti-gay activities ?
9 . How do your kids deal with the stigma that their dad is n't really a breeder ?

I think Chambers may have opened a very important door .
Since he has now established this as a matter of faith , and of a relationship with a personal God ( I even use an upper - case " G " just to be extra- respectful ) , then we can engage the ex-gay movement on those terms .
I think many parents and conflicted young gay people see " conversion " therapy as some secret passageway to a happy life of fulfillment in a heterosexual relationship .
If the ex-gayers would admit that this is not reparative therapy - for a condition that does n't need correction - but religious indoctrination , then I would have substantially less of a beef with them .
Eh , but that would ask them to be intellectually honest .
Who'm I kidding ?
Aw well .
I can dream .

After reading all that , my only thought is , " Man , that guy must really hate women . "
For the sake of his own " holiness " , he is willing to deprive his wife the love of a man who truly desires her .
I can't believe that is God 's plan .
God made sexual desire , and I 'm certain that God wants everyone in a sexual relationship to feel desired .

So is this guy REALLY ex - gay ( in his own mind ) ??
Or is Ex -Gay his job title ?
How much money does he make doing this ?
Maybe I 'll become ex-gay for 1 millisecond , then become ex - ex - gay so that it can become my profession : Ex - Ex -Gay .
With 2
Ex's in the title I should make twice as much as he does lol !
In all seriousness , there are 2 main factions being hurt by him and people like him : the wives ( unless they 're just in it for money ) , and the confused and neglected teens being pushed into this by ignorant and dominating parents .
I say neglected above , because any parent who truly loved their child would n't ever try to force their child to do something .

I 'm really conflicted by this .
Because he 's just sort of put this in the same language as addiction therapy -- that you are never not a addict , but you have to learn to manage it .
I 've never been really happy with that " always a sinner " theory of addiction either .
He 's basically saying that heterosexuality is a " choice . "
Or at least it is for him .
Like sobriety .
I think that for a lot of people love in a relationship is enough .
Sexual desire takes a back seat to nurturing .
And for these people , going through ex-gay therapy and settling down with a wife , might make sense .
He certainly would have culture and history norms on his side .
( As an aside , I 'm always amazed at how much easier the trans community has it in some Asian and Pacific Island cultures than gays and lesbians .
They have such a strong bias culturally to two genders , and opposite partners , that it 's easier for boys to become girls -- and it 's generally boys becoming girls -- than to stay boys and love boys . )
BUT !
Seems to me that a better use of his time and energy would be to spend it on making God 's earth better for everyone .
To allow for difference .
And to not focus on the hate in the Word .
( And realize that interpretations change ) than to preach sexual attraction as addiction .
In fact , in the long run , it might benefit his beloved Christianity .
An inclusive church is a growing church after all .

Yeah it really scares me that people try to equate homosexuality with other sins such as murder .
I was just watching this show about these crazy lesbians who killed old people ... and like they deluded themselves into thinking that all these " sins " were equivalent .
people are crazy !

If Chambers book generates enough revenue , and the wife gets fed up with the sham , then he should be prepared for a big fraud suit .
She could end up with the kids , and most of the spoils of his " fraudulent " endeavor .
And , she may be able to find all the proof that she needs to support her claim of fraud in the pages of his book .
For that matter , anyone married to an " ex -" gay might find themselves in a similar position , and all because this book exposes the underlying fraud .

I find it interesting that so far those posting have n't mentioned their personal relationship with a risen Savior .
I am a gay man by definition , but by the Grace of God , I am re-born .
( I am sure this will get those who have never had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ going )
He is right .
Being a homosexual or not is not the issue .
the issue is where you place your trust .
Trust in Jesus changes your perspective .
Through the renewing of your mind , God will mold you into his child .
If you do n't believe the Word of God ( the Bible ) than this discussion is accurate .
Once the your heart and mind or open to the Love , Grace , and forgiveness offered by Jesus , the word becomes your moral compass .
That is all he is saying .
I pray daily to be more like my father in heaven .
If that means dying to myself daily as Paul did .
Than so be it .
I am grateful for the promise of eternal life and i will die to my desires that are contridictory to Salvation in Jesus Christ .
He is real .
He does care .
And he is calling each of us to a personal relationship .
Gay or straight , God never changes .
He is the Same yesterday , today , and tomorrow .
And for those that refuse Him , there is judgement .
Believe it or Not .
He gave us the free will to make that choice .
I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE IN HIM and Homosexuality is a SIN .
I am sure this will not get posted but you who are reading it may the spirit of God bring you peace .

The damage caused by the extreme religious and the unabashedly self - righteous never seems to end .
One day , this country , this world will be lifted above the idiocy of people like Alan Chambers , who 's sole objective seems to be taking pleasure in the pain he inflicts on gay teens and their parents .
Until then , Mr. Chambers and his minions will shroud themselves in the eternal , but unachievable , goal of " holiness " .
In the meantime , though , we can take comfort in the knowledge that , if Mr. Chambers ' all - loving god exists , and by extension Heaven and Hell , then Mr. Chambers shall most definitely be destined for the depths of Hell .

All Baltimore City food establishments will be prohibited from serving and selling foods , which are not prepackaged , that contain 0.5 grams or greater of trans fat .
Interim Commissioner Olivia D. Farrow today announced details of the ban , the enforcement strategy and new resources available to affected businesses .
In March 2008 , Mayor Sheila Dixon signed legislation prohibiting food facilities from preparing and cooking foods with ingredients that contain 0.5 grams or greater of trans fat .
Businesses were given several months to substitute healthier alternatives .
" I applaud the restaurant and baking industry in Baltimore for embracing this transition away from artery - clogging trans fats to recipes with healthier ingredients , " said Mayor Dixon .
" The implementation of this legislation will greatly assist our progress in making Baltimore a healthier city . "

Most trans fats are artificial fats that are created when manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil .
Trans fats both elevate LDL ( " bad " ) cholesterol that causes heart disease and lower HDL ( " good " ) cholesterol that works to clear arteries .
The National Institutes of Health has found that more than 12.5 million Americans have congestive heart disease and more than 500,000 die each year from the disease .
Studies have indicated that trans fats are responsible for as many as 30,000 premature deaths in the United States each year .
By simply replacing the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil with a healthier alternative , restaurant operators will be assisting their customers in living a healthier life .
" The Baltimore City Health Department strongly believes that such a prohibition is necessary , " said Interim Commissioner Farrow .
" This is another step towards a healthier Baltimore . "
Since the law was passed , the Baltimore City Health Department has encouraged local bakers to consider alternative recipes that are equally delicious but trans - fat free .
Environmental Health sanitarians have reached out to local bakeries in an effort to learn how they will transition and have provided them with resources to alternatives – trans fat - free ingredients .
Moderate and high priority food service facilities found to be using vegetable shortening , margarine or any kind of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil or ingredients containing such will receive a violation .
Repeat offenders could face closure .
" Ethical " coffee is being produced in Peru , the world 's top exporter of Fairtrade coffee , by labourers paid less than the legal minimum wage .
Industry insiders have also told the FT of non-certified coffee being marked and exported as Fairtrade , and of certified coffee being illegally planted in protected rainforest .
This casts doubt on the certification process used by Fairtrade and similar marks that require producers to pay the minimum wage .
It also raises questions about the assurances certifiers give consumers about how premium - priced fair trade coffee is produced .
There are more cracks appearing within the administration of the fair trade coffee system .
This article , originally published in the Financial Times , unearths cases of fair trade money not going where it should , workers being paid less than they should , and coffee being sold as fair trade when it ’s not .
Here is just a short excerpt from that article :
As I have mentioned before in this blog , these kinds of problems threaten public trust in fair trade and have the potential to bring the entire movement to its knees .
I ’m not saying the administration of the fair trade system is not enormously complicated , especially when dealing with so many small growers in so many parts of the world .
It is clearly a huge challenge to administer and police such a widespread movement .
That said , fair trade is enormously important to the world .
Its impact on coffee farmers , the growth of social consciousness in the west … and its position as an alternative to free trade … make fair trade profoundly important to our future .
With the stakes being so high , I think we would do better to slow the growth of the movement , and make absolutely sure that it is administered and policed effectively .
There is absolutely no benefit to pushing for faster expansion , if the foundations of the movement itself are shaky .
Without public trust in fair trade , we have nothing .
